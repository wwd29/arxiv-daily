<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Background We aim to use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automate the extraction and classification of thyroid cancer risk factors from pathology reports. Methods We analyzed 1,410 surgical pathology reports from adult papillary thyroid cancer patients at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, from 2010 to 2019. Structured and non-structured reports were used to create a consensus-based ground truth dictionary and categorized them into modified recurrence risk levels. Non-structured reports were narrative, while structured reports followed standardized formats. We then developed ThyroPath, a rule-based NLP pipeline, to extract and classify thyroid cancer features into risk categories. Training involved 225 reports (150 structured, 75 unstructured), with testing on 170 reports (120 structured, 50 unstructured) for evaluation. The pipeline's performance was assessed using both strict and lenient criteria for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Results In extraction tasks, ThyroPath achieved overall strict F-1 scores of 93% for structured reports and 90 for unstructured reports, covering 18 thyroid cancer pathology features. In classification tasks, ThyroPath-extracted information demonstrated an overall accuracy of 93% in categorizing reports based on their corresponding guideline-based risk of recurrence: 76.9% for high-risk, 86.8% for intermediate risk, and 100% for both low and very low-risk cases. However, ThyroPath achieved 100% accuracy across all thyroid cancer risk categories with human-extracted pathology information. Conclusions ThyroPath shows promise in automating the extraction and risk recurrence classification of thyroid pathology reports at large scale. It offers a solution to laborious manual reviews and advancing virtual registries. However, it requires further validation before implementation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The research explores the utilization of a deep learning model employing an attention mechanism in medical text mining. It targets the challenge of analyzing unstructured text information within medical data. This research seeks to enhance the model's capability to identify essential medical information by incorporating deep learning and attention mechanisms. This paper reviews the basic principles and typical model architecture of attention mechanisms and shows the effectiveness of their application in the tasks of disease prediction, drug side effect monitoring, and entity relationship extraction. Aiming at the particularity of medical texts, an adaptive attention model integrating domain knowledge is proposed, and its ability to understand medical terms and process complex contexts is optimized. The experiment verifies the model's effectiveness in improving task accuracy and robustness, especially when dealing with long text. The future research path of enhancing model interpretation, realizing cross-domain knowledge transfer, and adapting to low-resource scenarios is discussed in the research outlook, which provides a new perspective and method support for intelligent medical information processing and clinical decision assistance. Finally, cross-domain knowledge transfer and adaptation strategies for low-resource scenarios, providing theoretical basis and technical reference for promoting the development of intelligent medical information processing and clinical decision support systems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multimodal aspect-based sentiment analysis (MABSA) aims to understand opinions in a granular manner, advancing human-computer interaction and other fields. Traditionally, MABSA methods use a joint prediction approach to identify aspects and sentiments simultaneously. However, we argue that joint models are not always superior. Our analysis shows that joint models struggle to align relevant text tokens with image patches, leading to misalignment and ineffective image utilization. In contrast, a pipeline framework first identifies aspects through MATE (Multimodal Aspect Term Extraction) and then aligns these aspects with image patches for sentiment classification (MASC: Multimodal Aspect-Oriented Sentiment Classification). This method is better suited for multimodal scenarios where effective image use is crucial. We present three key observations: (a) MATE and MASC have different feature requirements, with MATE focusing on token-level features and MASC on sequence-level features; (b) the aspect identified by MATE is crucial for effective image utilization; and (c) images play a trivial role in previous MABSA methods due to high noise. Based on these observations, we propose a pipeline framework that first predicts the aspect and then uses translation-based alignment (TBA) to enhance multimodal semantic consistency for better image utilization. Our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on widely used MABSA datasets Twitter-15 and Twitter-17. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the pipeline approach and its potential to provide valuable insights for future MABSA research. For reproducibility, the code and checkpoint will be released.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Democratic opinion-forming may be manipulated if newspapers' alignment to political or economical orientation is ambiguous. Various methods have been developed to better understand newspapers' positioning. Recently, the advent of Large Language Models (LLM), and particularly the pre-trained LLM chatbots like ChatGPT or Gemini, hold disruptive potential to assist researchers and citizens alike. However, little is know on whether LLM assessment is trustworthy: do single LLM agrees with experts' assessment, and do different LLMs answer consistently with one another? In this paper, we address specifically the second challenge. We compare how four widely employed LLMs rate the positioning of newspapers, and compare if their answers align with one another. We observe that this is not the case. Over a woldwide dataset, articles in newspapers are positioned strikingly differently by single LLMs, hinting to inconsistent training or excessive randomness in the algorithms. We thus raise a warning when deciding which tools to use, and we call for better training and algorithm development, to cover such significant gap in a highly sensitive matter for democracy and societies worldwide. We also call for community engagement in benchmark evaluation, through our open initiative this http URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Content moderation on social media platforms shapes the dynamics of online discourse, influencing whose voices are amplified and whose are suppressed. Recent studies have raised concerns about the fairness of content moderation practices, particularly for aggressively flagging posts from transgender and non-binary individuals as toxic. In this study, we investigate the presence of bias in harmful speech classification of gender-queer dialect online, focusing specifically on the treatment of reclaimed slurs. We introduce a novel dataset, QueerReclaimLex, based on 109 curated templates exemplifying non-derogatory uses of LGBTQ+ slurs. Dataset instances are scored by gender-queer annotators for potential harm depending on additional context about speaker identity. We systematically evaluate the performance of five off-the-shelf language models in assessing the harm of these texts and explore the effectiveness of chain-of-thought prompting to teach large language models (LLMs) to leverage author identity context. We reveal a tendency for these models to inaccurately flag texts authored by gender-queer individuals as harmful. Strikingly, across all LLMs the performance is poorest for texts that show signs of being written by individuals targeted by the featured slur (F1 <= 0.24). We highlight an urgent need for fairness and inclusivity in content moderation systems. By uncovering these biases, this work aims to inform the development of more equitable content moderation practices and contribute to the creation of inclusive online spaces for all users.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have recently gained increasing popularity within the domain of large language models (LLMs) due to their ability to significantly reduce training and inference overhead. However, MoE architectures face challenges, such as significant disparities in the number of tokens assigned to each expert and a tendency toward homogenization among experts, which adversely affects the model's semantic generation capabilities. In this paper, we introduce LocMoE+, a refined version of the low-overhead LocMoE, incorporating the following enhancements: (1) Quantification and definition of the affinity between experts and tokens. (2) Implementation of a global-level adaptive routing strategy to rearrange tokens based on their affinity scores. (3) Reestimation of the lower bound for expert capacity, which has been shown to progressively decrease as the token feature distribution evolves. Experimental results demonstrate that, without compromising model convergence or efficacy, the number of tokens each expert processes can be reduced by over 60%. Combined with communication optimizations, this leads to an average improvement in training efficiency ranging from 5.4% to 46.6%. After fine-tuning, LocMoE+ exhibits a performance improvement of 9.7% to 14.1% across the GDAD, C-Eval, and TeleQnA datasets.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose a novel approach for training large language models (LLMs) to adhere to objectives defined within a latent embedding space. Our method leverages reinforcement learning (RL), treating a pre-trained LLM as an environment. Our embedding-aligned guided language (EAGLE) agent is trained to iteratively steer the LLM's generation towards optimal regions of the latent embedding space, w.r.t. some predefined criterion. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the EAGLE agent using the MovieLens 25M dataset to surface content gaps that satisfy latent user demand. We also demonstrate the benefit of using an optimal design of a state-dependent action set to improve EAGLE's efficiency. Our work paves the way for controlled and grounded text generation using LLMs, ensuring consistency with domain-specific knowledge and data representations.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly popular, transforming a wide range of applications across various domains. However, the real-world effectiveness of their query cache systems has not been thoroughly investigated. In this work, we for the first time conducted an analysis on real-world human-to-LLM interaction data, identifying key challenges in existing caching solutions for LLM-based chat services. Our findings reveal that current caching methods fail to leverage semantic connections, leading to inefficient cache performance and extra token costs. To address these issues, we propose SCALM, a new cache architecture that emphasizes semantic analysis and identifies significant cache entries and patterns. We also detail the implementations of the corresponding cache storage and eviction strategies. Our evaluations show that SCALM increases cache hit ratios and reduces operational costs for LLMChat services. Compared with other state-of-the-art solutions in GPTCache, SCALM shows, on average, a relative increase of 63% in cache hit ratio and a relative improvement of 77% in tokens savings.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, transformer, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Semantic relations among entities are a widely accepted method for relation extraction. PromptORE (Prompt-based Open Relation Extraction) was designed to improve relation extraction with Large Language Models on generalistic documents. However, it is less effective when applied to historical documents, in languages other than English. In this study, we introduce an adaptation of PromptORE to extract relations from specialized documents, namely digital transcripts of trials from the Spanish Inquisition. Our approach involves fine-tuning transformer models with their pretraining objective on the data they will perform inference. We refer to this process as "biasing". Our Biased PromptORE addresses complex entity placements and genderism that occur in Spanish texts. We solve these issues by prompt engineering. We evaluate our method using Encoder-like models, corroborating our findings with experts' assessments. Additionally, we evaluate the performance using a binomial classification benchmark. Our results show a substantial improvement in accuracy -up to a 50% improvement with our Biased PromptORE models in comparison to the baseline models using standard PromptORE.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Providing external knowledge to Large Language Models (LLMs) is a key point for using these models in real-world applications for several reasons, such as incorporating up-to-date content in a real-time manner, providing access to domain-specific knowledge, and contributing to hallucination prevention. The vector database-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach has been widely adopted to this end. Thus, any part of external knowledge can be retrieved and provided to some LLM as the input context. Despite RAG approach's success, it still might be unfeasible for some applications, because the context retrieved can demand a longer context window than the size supported by LLM. Even when the context retrieved fits into the context window size, the number of tokens might be expressive and, consequently, impact costs and processing time, becoming impractical for most applications. To address these, we propose CRAG, a novel approach able to effectively reduce the number of prompting tokens without degrading the quality of the response generated compared to a solution using RAG. Through our experiments, we show that CRAG can reduce the number of tokens by at least 46\%, achieving more than 90\% in some cases, compared to RAG. Moreover, the number of tokens with CRAG does not increase considerably when the number of reviews analyzed is higher, unlike RAG, where the number of tokens is almost 9x higher when there are 75 reviews compared to 4 reviews.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We surely enjoy the larger the better models for their superior performance in the last couple of years when both the hardware and software support the birth of such extremely huge models. The applied fields include text mining and others. In particular, the success of LLMs on text understanding and text generation draws attention from researchers who have worked on NLP and related areas for years or even decades. On the side, LLMs may suffer from problems like model overfitting, hallucination, and device limitation to name a few. In this work, we suggest a model pruning technique specifically focused on LLMs. The proposed methodology emphasizes the explainability of deep learning models. By having the theoretical foundation, we obtain a trustworthy deep model so that huge models with a massive number of model parameters become not quite necessary. A mutual information-based estimation is adopted to find neurons with redundancy to eliminate. Moreover, an estimator with well-tuned parameters helps to find precise estimation to guide the pruning procedure. At the same time, we also explore the difference between pruning on large-scale models vs. pruning on small-scale models. The choice of pruning criteria is sensitive in small models but not for large-scale models. It is a novel finding through this work. Overall, we demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model to the state-of-the-art models.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generalized large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 may not provide specific answers to queries formulated by materials science researchers. These models may produce a high-level outline but lack the capacity to return detailed instructions on manufacturing and material properties of novel alloys. Enhancing a smaller model with specialized domain knowledge may provide an advantage over large language models which cannot be retrained quickly enough to keep up with the rapid pace of research in metal additive manufacturing (AM). We introduce "AMGPT," a specialized LLM text generator designed for metal AM queries. The goal of AMGPT is to assist researchers and users in navigating the extensive corpus of literature in AM. Instead of training from scratch, we employ a pre-trained Llama2-7B model from Hugging Face in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) setup, utilizing it to dynamically incorporate information from $\sim$50 AM papers and textbooks in PDF format. Mathpix is used to convert these PDF documents into TeX format, facilitating their integration into the RAG pipeline managed by LlamaIndex. Expert evaluations of this project highlight that specific embeddings from the RAG setup accelerate response times and maintain coherence in the generated text.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Notable people's life trajectories have been a focus of study -- the locations and times of various activities, such as birth, death, education, marriage, competition, work, delivering a speech, making a scientific discovery, finishing a masterpiece, and fighting a battle, and how these people interact with others, carry important messages for the broad research related to human dynamics. However, the scarcity of trajectory data in terms of volume, density, and inter-person interactions, limits relevant studies from being comprehensive and interactive. We mine millions of biography pages from Wikipedia and tackle the generalization problem stemming from the variety and heterogeneity of the trajectory descriptions. Our ensemble model COSMOS, which combines the idea of semi-supervised learning and contrastive learning, achieves an F1 score of 85.95%. For this task, we also create a hand-curated dataset, WikiLifeTrajectory, consisting of 8,852 (person, time, location) triplets as ground truth. Besides, we perform an empirical analysis on the trajectories of 8,272 historians to demonstrate the validity of the extracted results. To facilitate the research on trajectory extractions and help the analytical studies to construct grand narratives, we make our code, the million-level extracted trajectories, and the WikiLifeTrajectory dataset publicly available.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Conversational recommendation (ConvRec) systems must understand rich and diverse natural language (NL) expressions of user preferences and intents, often communicated in an indirect manner (e.g., "I'm watching my weight"). Such complex utterances make retrieving relevant items challenging, especially if only using often incomplete or out-of-date metadata. Fortunately, many domains feature rich item reviews that cover standard metadata categories and offer complex opinions that might match a user's interests (e.g., "classy joint for a date"). However, only recently have large language models (LLMs) let us unlock the commonsense connections between user preference utterances and complex language in user-generated reviews. Further, LLMs enable novel paradigms for semi-structured dialogue state tracking, complex intent and preference understanding, and generating recommendations, explanations, and question answers. We thus introduce a novel technology RA-Rec, a Retrieval-Augmented, LLM-driven dialogue state tracking system for ConvRec, showcased with a video, open source GitHub repository, and interactive Google Colab notebook.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent studies have indicated that Large Language Models (LLMs) harbor an inherent understanding of truthfulness, yet often fail to express fully and generate false statements. This gap between "knowing" and "telling" poses a challenge for ensuring the truthfulness of generated content. To address this, we introduce Adaptive Activation Steering (ACT), a tuning-free method that adaptively shift LLM's activations in "truthful" direction during inference. ACT addresses diverse categories of hallucinations by utilizing diverse steering vectors and adjusting the steering intensity adaptively. Applied as an add-on across various models, ACT significantly improves truthfulness in LLaMA ($\uparrow$ 142\%), LLaMA2 ($\uparrow$ 24\%), Alpaca ($\uparrow$ 36\%), Vicuna ($\uparrow$ 28\%), and LLaMA2-Chat ($\uparrow$ 19\%). Furthermore, we verify ACT's scalability across larger models (13B, 33B, 65B), underscoring the adaptability of ACT to large-scale language models.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The integration of multimodal Electronic Health Records (EHR) data has notably advanced clinical predictive capabilities. However, current models that utilize clinical notes and multivariate time-series EHR data often lack the necessary medical context for precise clinical tasks. Previous methods using knowledge graphs (KGs) primarily focus on structured knowledge extraction. To address this, we propose EMERGE, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) driven framework aimed at enhancing multimodal EHR predictive modeling. Our approach extracts entities from both time-series data and clinical notes by prompting Large Language Models (LLMs) and aligns them with professional PrimeKG to ensure consistency. Beyond triplet relationships, we include entities' definitions and descriptions to provide richer semantics. The extracted knowledge is then used to generate task-relevant summaries of patients' health statuses. These summaries are fused with other modalities utilizing an adaptive multimodal fusion network with cross-attention. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets for in-hospital mortality and 30-day readmission tasks demonstrate the superior performance of the EMERGE framework compared to baseline models. Comprehensive ablation studies and analyses underscore the efficacy of each designed module and the framework's robustness to data sparsity. EMERGE significantly enhances the use of multimodal EHR data in healthcare, bridging the gap with nuanced medical contexts crucial for informed clinical predictions.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Code Community Question Answering (CCQA) seeks to tackle programming-related issues, thereby boosting productivity in both software engineering and academic research. Recent advancements in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) have transformed the fine-tuning process of Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce responses that closely mimic human behavior. Leveraging LLMs with RLHF for practical CCQA applications has thus emerged as a promising area of study. Unlike standard code question-answering tasks, CCQA involves multiple possible answers, with varying user preferences for each response. Additionally, code communities often show a preference for new APIs. These challenges prevent LLMs from generating responses that cater to the diverse preferences of users in CCQA tasks. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework called Aligning LLMs through Multi-perspective User Preference Ranking-based Feedback for Programming Question Answering (ALMupQA) to create user-focused responses. Our approach starts with Multi-perspective Preference Ranking Alignment (MPRA), which synthesizes varied user preferences based on the characteristics of answers from code communities. We then introduce a Retrieval-augmented In-context Learning (RIL) module to mitigate the problem of outdated answers by retrieving responses to similar questions from a question bank. Due to the limited availability of high-quality, multi-answer CCQA datasets, we also developed a dataset named StaCCQA from real code communities. Extensive experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of the ALMupQA framework in terms of accuracy and user preference. Compared to the base model, ALMupQA showed nearly an 11% improvement in BLEU, with increases of 20% and 17.5% in BERTScore and CodeBERTScore, respectively.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Grammatical error correction (GEC) tools, powered by advanced generative artificial intelligence (AI), competently correct linguistic inaccuracies in user input. However, they often fall short in providing essential natural language explanations, which are crucial for learning languages and gaining a deeper understanding of the grammatical rules. There is limited exploration of these tools in low-resource languages such as Bengali. In such languages, grammatical error explanation (GEE) systems should not only correct sentences but also provide explanations for errors. This comprehensive approach can help language learners in their quest for proficiency. Our work introduces a real-world, multi-domain dataset sourced from Bengali speakers of varying proficiency levels and linguistic complexities. This dataset serves as an evaluation benchmark for GEE systems, allowing them to use context information to generate meaningful explanations and high-quality corrections. Various generative pre-trained large language models (LLMs), including GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-3.5 Turbo, Text-davinci-003, Text-babbage-001, Text-curie-001, Text-ada-001, Llama-2-7b, Llama-2-13b, and Llama-2-70b, are assessed against human experts for performance comparison. Our research underscores the limitations in the automatic deployment of current state-of-the-art generative pre-trained LLMs for Bengali GEE. Advocating for human intervention, our findings propose incorporating manual checks to address grammatical errors and improve feedback quality. This approach presents a more suitable strategy to refine the GEC tools in Bengali, emphasizing the educational aspect of language learning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Adversarial training has been instrumental in advancing multi-domain text classification (MDTC). Traditionally, MDTC methods employ a shared-private paradigm, with a shared feature extractor for domain-invariant knowledge and individual private feature extractors for domain-specific knowledge. Despite achieving state-of-the-art results, these methods grapple with the escalating model parameters due to the continuous addition of new domains. To address this challenge, we introduce the Stochastic Adversarial Network (SAN), which innovatively models the parameters of the domain-specific feature extractor as a multivariate Gaussian distribution, as opposed to a traditional weight vector. This design allows for the generation of numerous domain-specific feature extractors without a substantial increase in model parameters, maintaining the model's size on par with that of a single domain-specific extractor. Furthermore, our approach integrates domain label smoothing and robust pseudo-label regularization to fortify the stability of adversarial training and to refine feature discriminability, respectively. The performance of our SAN, evaluated on two leading MDTC benchmarks, demonstrates its competitive edge against the current state-of-the-art methodologies.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Researchers have been studying approaches to steer the behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs) and build personalized LLMs tailored for various applications. While fine-tuning seems to be a direct solution, it requires substantial computational resources and may significantly affect the utility of the original LLM. Recent endeavors have introduced more lightweight strategies, focusing on extracting "steering vectors" to guide the model's output toward desired behaviors by adjusting activations within specific layers of the LLM's transformer architecture. However, such steering vectors are directly extracted from the activations of human preference data and thus often lead to suboptimal results and occasional failures, especially in alignment-related scenarios. This work proposes an innovative approach that could produce more effective steering vectors through bi-directional preference optimization. Our method is designed to allow steering vectors to directly influence the generation probability of contrastive human preference data pairs, thereby offering a more precise representation of the target behavior. By carefully adjusting the direction and magnitude of the steering vector, we enabled personalized control over the desired behavior across a spectrum of intensities. Extensive experimentation across various open-ended generation tasks, particularly focusing on steering AI personas, has validated the efficacy of our approach. Moreover, we comprehensively investigate critical alignment-concerning scenarios, such as managing truthfulness, mitigating hallucination, and addressing jailbreaking attacks. Remarkably, our method can still demonstrate outstanding steering effectiveness across these scenarios. Furthermore, we showcase the transferability of our steering vectors across different models/LoRAs and highlight the synergistic benefits of applying multiple vectors simultaneously.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>To counter the side effect brought by the proliferation of social media platforms, hate speech detection (HSD) plays a vital role in halting the dissemination of toxic online posts at an early stage. However, given the ubiquitous topical communities on social media, a trained HSD classifier easily becomes biased towards specific targeted groups (e.g., female and black people), where a high rate of false positive/negative results can significantly impair public trust in the fairness of content moderation mechanisms, and eventually harm the diversity of online society. Although existing fairness-aware HSD methods can smooth out some discrepancies across targeted groups, they are mostly specific to a narrow selection of targets that are assumed to be known and fixed. This inevitably prevents those methods from generalizing to real-world use cases where new targeted groups constantly emerge over time. To tackle this defect, we propose Generalizable target-aware Fairness (GetFair), a new method for fairly classifying each post that contains diverse and even unseen targets during inference. To remove the HSD classifier's spurious dependence on target-related features, GetFair trains a series of filter functions in an adversarial pipeline, so as to deceive the discriminator that recovers the targeted group from filtered post embeddings. To maintain scalability and generalizability, we innovatively parameterize all filter functions via a hypernetwork that is regularized by the semantic affinity among targets. Taking a target's pretrained word embedding as input, the hypernetwork generates the weights used by each target-specific filter on-the-fly without storing dedicated filter parameters. Finally, comparative experiments on two HSD datasets have shown advantageous performance of GetFair on out-of-sample targets.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>How much data is required to learn the structure of a language via next-token prediction? We study this question for synthetic datasets generated via a Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar (PCFG) -- a hierarchical generative model that captures the tree-like structure of natural languages. We determine token-token correlations analytically in our model and show that they can be used to build a representation of the grammar's hidden variables, the longer the range the deeper the variable. In addition, a finite training set limits the resolution of correlations to an effective range, whose size grows with that of the training set. As a result, a Language Model trained with increasingly many examples can build a deeper representation of the grammar's structure, thus reaching good performance despite the high dimensionality of the problem. We conjecture that the relationship between training set size and effective range of correlations holds beyond our synthetic datasets. In particular, our conjecture predicts how the scaling law for the test loss behaviour with training set size depends on the length of the context window, which we confirm empirically for a collection of lines from Shakespeare's plays.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this study, we investigate the capabilities and inherent biases of advanced large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 in the context of debate evaluation. We discover that LLM's performance exceeds humans and surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art methods fine-tuned on extensive datasets in debate evaluation. We additionally explore and analyze biases present in LLMs, including positional bias, lexical bias, order bias, which may affect their evaluative judgments. Our findings reveal a consistent bias in both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 towards the second candidate response presented, attributed to prompt design. We also uncover lexical biases in both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, especially when label sets carry connotations such as numerical or sequential, highlighting the critical need for careful label verbalizer selection in prompt design. Additionally, our analysis indicates a tendency of both models to favor the debate's concluding side as the winner, suggesting an end-of-discussion bias.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Language models have the ability to perform in-context learning (ICL), allowing them to flexibly adapt their behavior based on context. This contrasts with in-weights learning, where information is statically encoded in model parameters from iterated observations of the data. Despite this apparent ability to learn in-context, language models are known to struggle when faced with unseen or rarely seen tokens. Hence, we study $\textbf{structural in-context learning}$, which we define as the ability of a model to execute in-context learning on arbitrary tokens -- so called because the model must generalize on the basis of e.g. sentence structure or task structure, rather than semantic content encoded in token embeddings. An ideal model would be able to do both: flexibly deploy in-weights operations (in order to robustly accommodate ambiguous or unknown contexts using encoded semantic information) and structural in-context operations (in order to accommodate novel tokens). We study structural in-context algorithms in a simple part-of-speech setting using both practical and toy models. We find that active forgetting, a technique that was recently introduced to help models generalize to new languages, forces models to adopt structural in-context learning solutions. Finally, we introduce $\textbf{temporary forgetting}$, a straightforward extension of active forgetting that enables one to control how much a model relies on in-weights vs. in-context solutions. Importantly, temporary forgetting allows us to induce a $\textit{dual process strategy}$ where in-context and in-weights solutions coexist within a single model.</li>

In this paper, we identify a new opportunity for efficient LLM serving for requests that trigger tools: tool partial execution alongside LLM decoding. To this end, we design Conveyor, an efficient LLM serving system optimized for handling requests involving external tools. We introduce a novel interface for tool developers to expose partial execution opportunities to the LLM serving system and a request scheduler that facilitates partial tool execution. Our results demonstrate that tool partial execution can improve request completion latency by up to 38.8%.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present STAT: a simple algorithm to prune transformer models without any fine-tuning. STAT eliminates both attention heads and neurons from the network, while preserving accuracy by calculating a correction to the weights of the next layer. Each layer block in the network is compressed using a series of principled matrix factorizations that preserve the network structure. Our entire algorithm takes minutes to compress BERT, and less than three hours to compress models with 7B parameters using a single GPU. Using only several hundred data examples, STAT preserves the output of the network and improves upon existing gradient-free pruning methods. It is even competitive with methods that include significant fine-tuning. We demonstrate our method on both encoder and decoder architectures, including BERT, DistilBERT, and Llama-2 using benchmarks such as GLUE, Squad, WikiText2.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Automated clinical text anonymization has the potential to unlock the widespread sharing of textual health data for secondary usage while assuring patient privacy and safety. Despite the proposal of many complex and theoretically successful anonymization solutions in literature, these techniques remain flawed. As such, clinical institutions are still reluctant to apply them for open access to their data. Recent advances in developing Large Language Models (LLMs) pose a promising opportunity to further the field, given their capability to perform various tasks. This paper proposes six new evaluation metrics tailored to the challenges of generative anonymization with LLMs. Moreover, we present a comparative study of LLM-based methods, testing them against two baseline techniques. Our results establish LLM-based models as a reliable alternative to common approaches, paving the way toward trustworthy anonymization of clinical text.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have facilitated structured data generation, with applications in domains like tabular data, document databases, product catalogs, etc. However, concerns persist about generation veracity due to incorrect references or hallucinations, necessitating the incorporation of some form of model confidence for mitigation. Existing confidence estimation methods on LLM generations primarily focus on the confidence at the individual token level or the entire output sequence level, limiting their applicability to structured data generation, which consists of an intricate mix of both independent and correlated entries at the sub-structure level. In this paper, we first investigate confidence estimation methods for generated sub-structure-level data. We introduce the concept of Confidence Network that applies on the hidden state of the LLM transformer, as a more targeted estimate than the traditional token conditional probability. We further propose Confidence-Aware sub-structure Beam Search (CABS), a novel decoding method operating at the sub-structure level in structured data generation. CABS enhances the faithfulness of structured data generation by considering confidence scores from the Confidence Network for each sub-structure-level data and iteratively refining the prompts. Results show that CABS outperforms traditional token-level beam search for structured data generation by 16.7% Recall at 90% precision averagely on the problem of product attribute generation.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Machine learning models have recently enjoyed a significant increase in size and popularity. However, this growth has created concerns about dataset privacy. To counteract data leakage, various privacy frameworks guarantee that the output of machine learning models does not compromise their training data. However, this privatization comes at a cost by adding random noise to the training process, which reduces model performance. By making models more resistant to small changes in input and thus more stable, the necessary amount of noise can be decreased while still protecting privacy. This paper investigates various techniques to enhance stability, thereby minimizing the negative effects of privatization in machine learning.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent works have shown the remarkable superiority of transformer models in reinforcement learning (RL), where the decision-making problem is formulated as sequential generation. Transformer-based agents could emerge with self-improvement in online environments by providing task contexts, such as multiple trajectories, called in-context RL. However, due to the quadratic computation complexity of attention in transformers, current in-context RL methods suffer from huge computational costs as the task horizon increases. In contrast, the Mamba model is renowned for its efficient ability to process long-term dependencies, which provides an opportunity for in-context RL to solve tasks that require long-term memory. To this end, we first implement Decision Mamba (DM) by replacing the backbone of Decision Transformer (DT). Then, we propose a Decision Mamba-Hybrid (DM-H) with the merits of transformers and Mamba in high-quality prediction and long-term memory. Specifically, DM-H first generates high-value sub-goals from long-term memory through the Mamba model. Then, we use sub-goals to prompt the transformer, establishing high-quality predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that DM-H achieves state-of-the-art in long and short-term tasks, such as D4RL, Grid World, and Tmaze benchmarks. Regarding efficiency, the online testing of DM-H in the long-term task is 28$\times$ times faster than the transformer-based baselines.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) are constrained by outdated information and a tendency to generate incorrect data, commonly referred to as "hallucinations." Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses these limitations by combining the strengths of retrieval-based methods and generative models. This approach involves retrieving relevant information from a large, up-to-date dataset and using it to enhance the generation process, leading to more accurate and contextually appropriate responses. Despite its benefits, RAG introduces a new attack surface for LLMs, particularly because RAG databases are often sourced from public data, such as the web. In this paper, we propose \TrojRAG{} to identify the vulnerabilities and attacks on retrieval parts (RAG database) and their indirect attacks on generative parts (LLMs). Specifically, we identify that poisoning several customized content passages could achieve a retrieval backdoor, where the retrieval works well for clean queries but always returns customized poisoned adversarial queries. Triggers and poisoned passages can be highly customized to implement various attacks. For example, a trigger could be a semantic group like "The Republican Party, Donald Trump, etc." Adversarial passages can be tailored to different contents, not only linked to the triggers but also used to indirectly attack generative LLMs without modifying them. These attacks can include denial-of-service attacks on RAG and semantic steering attacks on LLM generations conditioned by the triggers. Our experiments demonstrate that by just poisoning 10 adversarial passages can induce 98.2\% success rate to retrieve the adversarial passages. Then, these passages can increase the reject ratio of RAG-based GPT-4 from 0.01\% to 74.6\% or increase the rate of negative responses from 0.22\% to 72\% for targeted queries.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent years have witnessed remarkable progress in multi-view diffusion models for 3D content creation. However, there remains a significant gap in image quality and prompt-following ability compared to 2D diffusion models. A critical bottleneck is the scarcity of high-quality 3D assets with detailed captions. To address this challenge, we propose Bootstrap3D, a novel framework that automatically generates an arbitrary quantity of multi-view images to assist in training multi-view diffusion models. Specifically, we introduce a data generation pipeline that employs (1) 2D and video diffusion models to generate multi-view images based on constructed text prompts, and (2) our fine-tuned 3D-aware MV-LLaVA for filtering high-quality data and rewriting inaccurate captions. Leveraging this pipeline, we have generated 1 million high-quality synthetic multi-view images with dense descriptive captions to address the shortage of high-quality 3D data. Furthermore, we present a Training Timestep Reschedule (TTR) strategy that leverages the denoising process to learn multi-view consistency while maintaining the original 2D diffusion prior. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Bootstrap3D can generate high-quality multi-view images with superior aesthetic quality, image-text alignment, and maintained view consistency.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) like transformers have impressive in-context learning (ICL) capabilities; they can generate predictions for new queries based on input-output sequences in prompts without parameter updates. While many theories have attempted to explain ICL, they often focus on structured training data similar to ICL tasks, such as regression. In practice, however, these models are trained in an unsupervised manner on unstructured text data, which bears little resemblance to ICL tasks. To this end, we investigate how ICL emerges from unsupervised training on unstructured data. The key observation is that ICL can arise simply by modeling co-occurrence information using classical language models like continuous bag of words (CBOW), which we theoretically prove and empirically validate. Furthermore, we establish the necessity of positional information and noise structure to generalize ICL to unseen data. Finally, we present instances where ICL fails and provide theoretical explanations; they suggest that the ICL ability of LLMs to identify certain tasks can be sensitive to the structure of the training data.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose Quantum-informed Tensor Adaptation (QuanTA), a novel, easy-to-implement, fine-tuning method with no inference overhead for large-scale pre-trained language models. By leveraging quantum-inspired methods derived from quantum circuit structures, QuanTA enables efficient high-rank fine-tuning, surpassing the limitations of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)--low-rank approximation may fail for complicated downstream tasks. Our approach is theoretically supported by the universality theorem and the rank representation theorem to achieve efficient high-rank adaptations. Experiments demonstrate that QuanTA significantly enhances commonsense reasoning, arithmetic reasoning, and scalability compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, QuanTA shows superior performance with fewer trainable parameters compared to other approaches and can be designed to integrate with existing fine-tuning algorithms for further improvement, providing a scalable and efficient solution for fine-tuning large language models and advancing state-of-the-art in natural language processing.</li>

This study focuses on ear biometric identification, exploiting its distinctive features for enhanced accuracy, reliability, and usability. While past studies typically investigate face recognition and fingerprint analysis, our research demonstrates the effectiveness of ear biometrics in overcoming limitations such as variations in facial expressions and lighting conditions. We utilized two datasets: AMI (700 images from 100 individuals) and EarNV1.0 (28,412 images from 164 individuals). To improve the accuracy and robustness of our ear biometric identification system, we applied various techniques including data preprocessing and augmentation. Our models achieved a testing accuracy of 99.35% on the AMI Dataset and 98.1% on the EarNV1.0 dataset, showcasing the effectiveness of our approach in precisely identifying individuals based on ear biometric characteristics.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Temporal sentence grounding is a challenging task that aims to localize the moment spans relevant to a language description. Although recent DETR-based models have achieved notable progress by leveraging multiple learnable moment queries, they suffer from overlapped and redundant proposals, leading to inaccurate predictions. We attribute this limitation to the lack of task-related guidance for the learnable queries to serve a specific mode. Furthermore, the complex solution space generated by variable and open-vocabulary language descriptions exacerbates the optimization difficulty, making it harder for learnable queries to distinguish each other adaptively. To tackle this limitation, we present a Region-Guided TRansformer (RGTR) for temporal sentence grounding, which diversifies moment queries to eliminate overlapped and redundant predictions. Instead of using learnable queries, RGTR adopts a set of anchor pairs as moment queries to introduce explicit regional guidance. Each anchor pair takes charge of moment prediction for a specific temporal region, which reduces the optimization difficulty and ensures the diversity of the final predictions. In addition, we design an IoU-aware scoring head to improve proposal quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of RGTR, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on QVHighlights, Charades-STA and TACoS datasets.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Computer Aided Design (CAD) engineers typically do not achieve their best prototypes in a single attempt. Instead, they iterate and refine their designs to achieve an optimal solution through multiple revisions. This traditional approach, though effective, is time-consuming and relies heavily on the expertise of skilled engineers. To address these challenges, we introduce Query2CAD, a novel framework to generate CAD designs. The framework uses a large language model to generate executable CAD macros. Additionally, Query2CAD refines the generation of the CAD model with the help of its self-refinement loops. Query2CAD operates without supervised data or additional training, using the LLM as both a generator and a refiner. The refiner leverages feedback generated by the BLIP2 model, and to address false negatives, we have incorporated human-in-the-loop feedback into our system. Additionally, we have developed a dataset that encompasses most operations used in CAD model designing and have evaluated our framework using this dataset. Our findings reveal that when we used GPT-4 Turbo as our language model, the architecture achieved a success rate of 53.6\% on the first attempt. With subsequent refinements, the success rate increased by 23.1\%. In particular, the most significant improvement in the success rate was observed with the first iteration of the refinement. With subsequent refinements, the accuracy of the correct designs did not improve significantly. We have open-sourced our data, model, and code (this http URL).</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the development of edge networks and mobile computing, the need to serve heterogeneous data sources at the network edge requires the design of new distributed machine learning mechanisms. As a prevalent approach, Federated Learning (FL) employs parameter-sharing and gradient-averaging between clients and a server. Despite its many favorable qualities, such as convergence and data-privacy guarantees, it is well-known that classic FL fails to address the challenge of data heterogeneity and computation heterogeneity across clients. Most existing works that aim to accommodate such sources of heterogeneity stay within the FL operation paradigm, with modifications to overcome the negative effect of heterogeneous data. In this work, as an alternative paradigm, we propose a Multi-Task Split Learning (MTSL) framework, which combines the advantages of Split Learning (SL) with the flexibility of distributed network architectures. In contrast to the FL counterpart, in this paradigm, heterogeneity is not an obstacle to overcome, but a useful property to take advantage of. As such, this work aims to introduce a new architecture and methodology to perform multi-task learning for heterogeneous data sources efficiently, with the hope of encouraging the community to further explore the potential advantages we reveal. To support this promise, we first show through theoretical analysis that MTSL can achieve fast convergence by tuning the learning rate of the server and clients. Then, we compare the performance of MTSL with existing multi-task FL methods numerically on several image classification datasets to show that MTSL has advantages over FL in training speed, communication cost, and robustness to heterogeneous data.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We explore the use of long-context capabilities in large language models to create synthetic reading comprehension data from entire books. Previous efforts to construct such datasets relied on crowd-sourcing, but the emergence of transformers with a context size of 1 million or more tokens now enables entirely automatic approaches. Our objective is to test the capabilities of LLMs to analyze, understand, and reason over problems that require a detailed comprehension of long spans of text, such as questions involving character arcs, broader themes, or the consequences of early actions later in the story. We propose a holistic pipeline for automatic data generation including question generation, answering, and model scoring using an ``Evaluator''. We find that a relative approach, comparing answers between models in a pairwise fashion and ranking with a Bradley-Terry model, provides a more consistent and differentiating scoring mechanism than an absolute scorer that rates answers individually. We also show that LLMs from different model families produce moderate agreement in their ratings. We ground our approach using the manually curated NarrativeQA dataset, where our evaluator shows excellent agreement with human judgement and even finds errors in the dataset. Using our automatic evaluation approach, we show that using an entire book as context produces superior reading comprehension performance compared to baseline no-context (parametric knowledge only) and retrieval-based approaches.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While AI-generated content has garnered significant attention, achieving photo-realistic video synthesis remains a formidable challenge. Despite the promising advances in diffusion models for video generation quality, the complex model architecture and substantial computational demands for both training and inference create a significant gap between these models and real-world applications. This paper presents SNED, a superposition network architecture search method for efficient video diffusion model. Our method employs a supernet training paradigm that targets various model cost and resolution options using a weight-sharing method. Moreover, we propose the supernet training sampling warm-up for fast training optimization. To showcase the flexibility of our method, we conduct experiments involving both pixel-space and latent-space video diffusion models. The results demonstrate that our framework consistently produces comparable results across different model options with high efficiency. According to the experiment for the pixel-space video diffusion model, we can achieve consistent video generation results simultaneously across 64 x 64 to 256 x 256 resolutions with a large range of model sizes from 640M to 1.6B number of parameters for pixel-space video diffusion models.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Mamba state-space models (SSMs) have recently outperformed state-of-the-art (SOTA) Transformer large language models (LLMs) in various tasks and been widely adapted. However, Mamba's downstream learning capabilities remain either unexplored$\unicode{x2013}$e.g., mixed-precision (MPFT) and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)--or under-evaluated$\unicode{x2013}$e.g., in-context learning (ICL). For the latter, recent works reported Mamba's ICL rivals SOTA Transformer LLMs using non-standard benchmarks. In contrast, we show that on standard benchmarks, pretrained Mamba models achieve only 38% of the ICL performance improvements (over zero-shot) of comparable Transformers. Enabling MPFT and PEFT in Mamba architectures is challenging due to recurrent dynamics and highly customized CUDA kernels, respectively. However, we prove that Mamba's recurrent dynamics are robust to small input changes using dynamical systems theory. Empirically, we show that performance changes in Mamba's inference and fine-tuning due to mixed-precision align with Transformer LLMs. Furthermore, we show that targeting key memory buffers in Mamba's customized CUDA kernels for low-rank adaptation regularizes SSM parameters, thus achieving parameter efficiency while retaining speedups. We show that combining MPFT and PEFT enables up to 2.15 times more tokens-per-second and 65.5% reduced per-token-memory compared to full Mamba fine-tuning, while achieving up to 81.5% of the ICL performance improvements (over zero-shot) of comparably fine-tuned Transformers.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The Stable Diffusion Model (SDM) is a prevalent and effective model for text-to-image (T2I) and image-to-image (I2I) generation. Despite various attempts at sampler optimization, model distillation, and network quantification, these approaches typically maintain the original network architecture. The extensive parameter scale and substantial computational demands have limited research into adjusting the model architecture. 1) For the tuning method, we design a model assembly strategy to reconstruct a lightweight model while preserving performance through distillation. Second, to mitigate performance loss due to pruning, we incorporate multi-expert conditional convolution (ME-CondConv) into compressed UNets to enhance network performance by increasing capacity without sacrificing speed. Third, we validate the effectiveness of the multi-UNet switching method for improving network speed. 2) For the tuning-free method, we propose a feature inheritance strategy to accelerate inference by skipping local computations at the block, layer, or unit level within the network structure. We also examine multiple sampling modes for feature inheritance at the time-step level. Experiments demonstrate that both the proposed tuning and the tuning-free methods can improve the speed and performance of the SDM. The lightweight model reconstructed by the model assembly strategy increases generation speed by $22.4\%$, while the feature inheritance strategy enhances the SDM generation speed by $40.0\%$.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The deployment of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is rapidly expanding to numerous cities. At the heart of AVs, the object detection module assumes a paramount role, directly influencing all downstream decision-making tasks by considering the presence of nearby pedestrians, vehicles, and more. Despite high accuracy of pedestrians detected on held-out datasets, the potential presence of algorithmic bias in such object detectors, particularly in challenging weather conditions, remains unclear. This study provides a comprehensive empirical analysis of fairness in detecting pedestrians in a state-of-the-art transformer-based object detector. In addition to classical metrics, we introduce novel probability-based metrics to measure various intricate properties of object detection. Leveraging the state-of-the-art FACET dataset and the Carla high-fidelity vehicle simulator, our analysis explores the effect of protected attributes such as gender, skin tone, and body size on object detection performance in varying environmental conditions such as ambient darkness and fog. Our quantitative analysis reveals how the previously overlooked yet intuitive factors, such as the distribution of demographic groups in the scene, the severity of weather, the pedestrians' proximity to the AV, among others, affect object detection performance.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) aligned through reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) have quickly become one of the dominant paradigms for building intelligent conversational assistant agents. However, despite their strong performance across many benchmarks, LLM-based agents still lack conversational skills such as disambiguation: when generalized assistants are faced with ambiguity, they often overhedge or implicitly guess users' ground-truth intents rather than asking clarification questions, and under task-specific settings, high-quality conversation samples are often limited, affecting models' ability to learn optimal dialogue action policies. We propose Action-Based Contrastive Self-Training (henceforth ACT), a quasi-online preference optimization algorithm based on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) which allows for sample-efficient dialogue policy learning in multi-turn conversation. We demonstrate ACT's efficacy under sample-efficient conditions in three difficult conversational tasks: tabular-grounded question-answering, machine reading comprehension, and AmbigSQL, a novel task for disambiguating information-seeking requests for text-to-SQL generation. Additionally, we propose evaluating LLMs' ability to function as conversational agents by examining whether they can implicitly recognize and reason about ambiguity in conversation. ACT demonstrates substantial conversation modeling improvements over standard approaches to supervised fine-tuning and DPO.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent research efforts have explored the potential of leveraging natural language inference (NLI) techniques to enhance relation extraction (RE). In this vein, we introduce MetaEntail-RE, a novel adaptation method that harnesses NLI principles to enhance RE performance. Our approach follows past works by verbalizing relation classes into class-indicative hypotheses, aligning a traditionally multi-class classification task to one of textual entailment. We introduce three key enhancements: (1) Instead of labeling non-entailed premise-hypothesis pairs with the uninformative "neutral" entailment label, we introduce meta-class analysis, which provides additional context by analyzing overarching meta relationships between classes when assigning entailment labels; (2) Feasible hypothesis filtering, which removes unlikely hypotheses from consideration based on pairs of entity types; and (3) Group-based prediction selection, which further improves performance by selecting highly confident predictions. MetaEntail-RE is conceptually simple and empirically powerful, yielding significant improvements over conventional relation extraction techniques and other NLI formulations. Our experimental results underscore the versatility of MetaEntail-RE, demonstrating performance gains across both biomedical and general domains.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Digital terrain models (DTMs) are pivotal in remote sensing, cartography, and landscape management, requiring accurate surface representation and topological information restoration. While topology analysis traditionally relies on smooth manifolds, the absence of an easy-to-use continuous surface model for a large terrain results in a preference for discrete meshes. Structural representation based on topology provides a succinct surface description, laying the foundation for many terrain analysis applications. However, on discrete meshes, numerical issues emerge, and complex algorithms are designed to handle them. This paper brings the context of terrain data analysis back to the continuous world and introduces ImplicitTerrain (Project homepage available at this https URL), an implicit neural representation (INR) approach for modeling high-resolution terrain continuously and differentiably. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate superior surface fitting accuracy, effective topological feature retrieval, and various topographical feature extraction that are implemented over this compact representation in parallel. To our knowledge, ImplicitTerrain pioneers a feasible continuous terrain surface modeling pipeline that provides a new research avenue for our community.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Research in neural models inspired by mammal's visual cortex has led to many spiking neural networks such as pulse-coupled neural networks (PCNNs). These models are oscillating, spatio-temporal models stimulated with images to produce several time-based responses. This paper reviews PCNN's state of the art, covering its mathematical formulation, variants, and other simplifications found in the literature. We present several applications in which PCNN architectures have successfully addressed some fundamental image processing and computer vision challenges, including image segmentation, edge detection, medical imaging, image fusion, image compression, object recognition, and remote sensing. Results achieved in these applications suggest that the PCNN architecture generates useful perceptual information relevant to a wide variety of computer vision tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly become key components in various AI applications, understanding their security vulnerabilities and the effectiveness of defense mechanisms is crucial. This survey examines the security challenges of LLMs, focusing on two main areas: Prompt Hacking and Adversarial Attacks, each with specific types of threats. Under Prompt Hacking, we explore Prompt Injection and Jailbreaking Attacks, discussing how they work, their potential impacts, and ways to mitigate them. Similarly, we analyze Adversarial Attacks, breaking them down into Data Poisoning Attacks and Backdoor Attacks. This structured examination helps us understand the relationships between these vulnerabilities and the defense strategies that can be implemented. The survey highlights these security challenges and discusses robust defensive frameworks to protect LLMs against these threats. By detailing these security issues, the survey contributes to the broader discussion on creating resilient AI systems that can resist sophisticated attacks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The generality of pretrained large language models (LLMs) has prompted increasing interest in their use as in-context learning agents. To be successful, such agents must form beliefs about how to achieve their goals based on limited interaction with their environment, resulting in uncertainty about the best action to take at each step. In this paper, we study how LLM agents form and act on these beliefs by conducting experiments in controlled sequential decision-making tasks. To begin, we find that LLM agents are overconfident: They draw strong conclusions about what to do based on insufficient evidence, resulting in inadequately explorative behavior. We dig deeper into this phenomenon and show how it emerges from a collapse in the entropy of the action distribution implied by sampling from the LLM. We then demonstrate that existing token-level sampling techniques are by themselves insufficient to make the agent explore more. Motivated by this fact, we introduce Entropic Activation Steering (EAST), an activation steering method for in-context LLM agents. EAST computes a steering vector as an entropy-weighted combination of representations, and uses it to manipulate an LLM agent's uncertainty over actions by intervening on its activations during the forward pass. We show that EAST can reliably increase the entropy in an LLM agent's actions, causing more explorative behavior to emerge. Finally, EAST modifies the subjective uncertainty an LLM agent expresses, paving the way to interpreting and controlling how LLM agents represent uncertainty about their decisions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, attack, membership infer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Meta-learning involves multiple learners, each dedicated to specific tasks, collaborating in a data-constrained setting. In current meta-learning methods, task learners locally learn models from sensitive data, termed support sets. These task learners subsequently share model-related information, such as gradients or loss values, which is computed using another part of the data termed query set, with a meta-learner. The meta-learner employs this information to update its meta-knowledge. Despite the absence of explicit data sharing, privacy concerns persist. This paper examines potential data leakage in a prominent metalearning algorithm, specifically Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML). In MAML, gradients are shared between the metalearner and task-learners. The primary objective is to scrutinize the gradient and the information it encompasses about the task dataset. Subsequently, we endeavor to propose membership inference attacks targeting the task dataset containing support and query sets. Finally, we explore various noise injection methods designed to safeguard the privacy of task data and thwart potential attacks. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of these attacks on MAML and the efficacy of proper noise injection methods in countering them.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Natural language is a powerful complementary modality of communication for data visualizations, such as bar and line charts. To facilitate chart-based reasoning using natural language, various downstream tasks have been introduced recently such as chart question answering, chart summarization, and fact-checking with charts. These tasks pose a unique challenge, demanding both vision-language reasoning and a nuanced understanding of chart data tables, visual encodings, and natural language prompts. Despite the recent success of Large Language Models (LLMs) across diverse NLP tasks, their abilities and limitations in the realm of data visualization remain under-explored, possibly due to their lack of multi-modal capabilities. To bridge the gap, this paper presents the first comprehensive evaluation of the recently developed large vision language models (LVLMs) for chart understanding and reasoning tasks. Our evaluation includes a comprehensive assessment of LVLMs, including GPT-4V and Gemini, across four major chart reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we perform a qualitative evaluation of LVLMs' performance on a diverse range of charts, aiming to provide a thorough analysis of their strengths and weaknesses. Our findings reveal that LVLMs demonstrate impressive abilities in generating fluent texts covering high-level data insights while also encountering common problems like hallucinations, factual errors, and data bias. We highlight the key strengths and limitations of chart comprehension tasks, offering insights for future research.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Videos carry rich visual information including object description, action, interaction, etc., but the existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) fell short in referential understanding scenarios such as video-based referring. In this paper, we present Artemis, an MLLM that pushes video-based referential understanding to a finer level. Given a video, Artemis receives a natural-language question with a bounding box in any video frame and describes the referred target in the entire video. The key to achieving this goal lies in extracting compact, target-specific video features, where we set a solid baseline by tracking and selecting spatiotemporal features from the video. We train Artemis on the newly established VideoRef45K dataset with 45K video-QA pairs and design a computationally efficient, three-stage training procedure. Results are promising both quantitatively and qualitatively. Additionally, we show that \model can be integrated with video grounding and text summarization tools to understand more complex scenarios. Code and data are available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper proposes a novel "auto-agglomerative" 3D fracture assembly method, PuzzleFusion++, resembling how humans solve challenging spatial puzzles. Starting from individual fragments, the approach 1) aligns and merges fragments into larger groups akin to agglomerative clustering and 2) repeats the process iteratively in completing the assembly akin to auto-regressive methods. Concretely, a diffusion model denoises the 6-DoF alignment parameters of the fragments simultaneously, and a transformer model verifies and merges pairwise alignments into larger ones, whose process repeats iteratively. Extensive experiments on the Breaking Bad dataset show that PuzzleFusion++ outperforms all other state-of-the-art techniques by significant margins across all metrics, in particular by over 10% in part accuracy and 50% in Chamfer distance.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Invariant-based Contrastive Learning (ICL) methods have achieved impressive performance across various domains. However, the absence of latent space representation for distortion (augmentation)-related information in the latent space makes ICL sub-optimal regarding training efficiency and robustness in downstream tasks. Recent studies suggest that introducing equivariance into Contrastive Learning (CL) can improve overall performance. In this paper, we rethink the roles of augmentation strategies and equivariance in improving CL efficacy. We propose a novel Equivariant-based Contrastive Learning (ECL) framework, CLeVER (Contrastive Learning Via Equivariant Representation), compatible with augmentation strategies of arbitrary complexity for various mainstream CL methods and model frameworks. Experimental results demonstrate that CLeVER effectively extracts and incorporates equivariant information from data, thereby improving the training efficiency and robustness of baseline models in downstream tasks.</li>

The input 360 images is processed with the CNN for visual feature extraction, and the extracted feature map is converted into a graph that finds a spherical representation of the input. We also introduce a novel loss function to address the issue of discrete probability distributions defined on the surface of a sphere.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Image generation and editing have seen a great deal of advancements with the rise of large-scale diffusion models that allow user control of different modalities such as text, mask, depth maps, etc. However, controlled editing of videos still lags behind. Prior work in this area has focused on using 2D diffusion models to globally change the style of an existing video. On the other hand, in many practical applications, editing localized parts of the video is critical. In this work, we propose a method to edit videos using a pre-trained inpainting image diffusion model. We systematically redesign the forward path of the model by replacing the self-attention modules with an extended version of attention modules that creates frame-level dependencies. In this way, we ensure that the edited information will be consistent across all the video frames no matter what the shape and position of the masked area is. We qualitatively compare our results with state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy on several video editing tasks like object retargeting, object replacement, and object removal tasks. Simulations demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed strategy.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Single domain generalization (single DG) aims at learning a robust model generalizable to unseen domains from only one training domain, making it a highly ambitious and challenging task. State-of-the-art approaches have mostly relied on data augmentations, such as adversarial perturbation and style enhancement, to synthesize new data and thus increase robustness. Nevertheless, they have largely overlooked the underlying coherence between the augmented domains, which in turn leads to inferior results in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective scheme, termed as \emph{StyDeSty}, to explicitly account for the alignment of the source and pseudo domains in the process of data augmentation, enabling them to interact with each other in a self-consistent manner and further giving rise to a latent domain with strong generalization power. The heart of StyDeSty lies in the interaction between a \emph{stylization} module for generating novel stylized samples using the source domain, and a \emph{destylization} module for transferring stylized and source samples to a latent domain to learn content-invariant features. The stylization and destylization modules work adversarially and reinforce each other. During inference, the destylization module transforms the input sample with an arbitrary style shift to the latent domain, in which the downstream tasks are carried out. Specifically, the location of the destylization layer within the backbone network is determined by a dedicated neural architecture search (NAS) strategy. We evaluate StyDeSty on multiple benchmarks and demonstrate that it yields encouraging results, outperforming the state of the art by up to {13.44%} on classification accuracy.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Tabular data from different tables exhibit significant diversity due to varied definitions and types of features, as well as complex inter-feature and feature-target relationships. Cross-dataset pretraining, which learns reusable patterns from upstream data to support downstream tasks, have shown notable success in various fields. Yet, when applied to tabular data prediction, this paradigm faces challenges due to the limited reusable patterns among diverse tabular datasets (tables) and the general scarcity of tabular data available for fine-tuning. In this study, we fill this gap by introducing a cross-table pretrained Transformer, XTFormer, for versatile downstream tabular prediction tasks. Our methodology insight is pretraining XTFormer to establish a "meta-function" space that encompasses all potential feature-target mappings. In pre-training, a variety of potential mappings are extracted from pre-training tabular datasets and are embedded into the "meta-function" space, and suited mappings are extracted from the "meta-function" space for downstream tasks by a specified coordinate positioning approach. Experiments show that, in 190 downstream tabular prediction tasks, our cross-table pretrained XTFormer wins both XGBoost and Catboost on 137 (72%) tasks, and surpasses representative deep learning models FT-Transformer and the tabular pre-training approach XTab on 144 (76%) and 162 (85%) tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>LiDAR sensors are widely used in autonomous vehicles to better perceive the environment. However, prior works have shown that LiDAR signals can be spoofed to hide real objects from 3D object detectors. This study explores the feasibility of reducing the required spoofing area through a novel object-hiding strategy based on virtual patches (VPs). We first manually design VPs (MVPs) and show that VP-focused attacks can achieve similar success rates with prior work but with a fraction of the required spoofing area. Then we design a framework Saliency-LiDAR (SALL), which can identify critical regions for LiDAR objects using Integrated Gradients. VPs crafted on critical regions (CVPs) reduce object detection recall by at least 15% compared to our baseline with an approximate 50% reduction in the spoofing area for vehicles of average size.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Logical reasoning serves as a cornerstone for human cognition. Recently, the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has demonstrated promising progress in solving logical reasoning tasks effectively. To improve this capability, recent studies have delved into integrating LLMs with various symbolic solvers using diverse techniques and methodologies. While some combinations excel on specific datasets, others fall short. However, it remains unclear whether the variance in performance stems from the methodologies employed or the specific symbolic solvers utilized. Therefore, there is a lack of consistent comparison between symbolic solvers and how they influence LLM's logical reasoning ability. We perform experiments on LLMs integrated with 3 symbolic solvers: Z3, Pyke, and Prover9, and compare their performance on 3 logical reasoning datasets: ProofWriter, PrOntoQA, and FOLIO. Our findings indicate that when combined with LLMs Pyke's performance is significantly inferior to that of Prover9 and Z3. Z3's overall accuracy performance slightly surpasses Prover9, but Prover9 could execute more questions.</li>

To address this, researchers have turned to synthetic data generation. While Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been widely used, they suffer from instability and mode collapse. Recently, diffusion probabilistic models have emerged as a promising alternative, offering stable training and better distribution coverage. This paper introduces a novel palmprint generation method using diffusion probabilistic models, develops an end-to-end framework for synthesizing multiple palm identities, and validates the realism and utility of the generated palmprints. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in generating palmprint images which enhance contactless palmprint recognition performance across several test databases utilizing challenging cross-database and time-separated evaluation protocols.</li>

Much of the existing work in FL focuses on efficiently learning a model for a single task. In this paper, we study simultaneous training of multiple FL models using a common set of clients. The few existing simultaneous training methods employ synchronous aggregation of client updates, which can cause significant delays because large models and/or slow clients can bottleneck the aggregation. On the other hand, a naive asynchronous aggregation is adversely affected by stale client updates. We propose FedAST, a buffered asynchronous federated simultaneous training algorithm that overcomes bottlenecks from slow models and adaptively allocates client resources across heterogeneous tasks. We provide theoretical convergence guarantees for FedAST for smooth non-convex objective functions. Extensive experiments over multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing simultaneous FL approaches, achieving up to 46.0% reduction in time to train multiple tasks to completion.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Video-Language Models (VLMs), pre-trained on large-scale video-caption datasets, are now standard for robust visual-language representation and downstream tasks. However, their reliance on global contrastive alignment limits their ability to capture fine-grained interactions between visual and textual elements. To address these challenges, we introduce HENASY (Hierarchical ENtities ASsemblY), a novel framework designed for egocentric video analysis that enhances the granularity of video content representations. HENASY employs a compositional approach using an enhanced slot-attention and grouping mechanisms for videos, assembling dynamic entities from video patches. It integrates a local entity encoder for dynamic modeling, a global encoder for broader contextual understanding, and an entity-aware decoder for late-stage fusion, enabling effective video scene dynamics modeling and granular-level alignment between visual entities and text. By incorporating innovative contrastive losses, HENASY significantly improves entity and activity recognition, delivering superior performance on benchmarks such as Ego4D and EpicKitchen, and setting new standards in both zero-shot and extensive video understanding tasks. Our results confirm groundbreaking capabilities of HENASY and establish it as a significant advancement in video-language multimodal research.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), has gained significant attention for its effectiveness in computer vision, especially in agricultural tasks. Recent advancements in instance segmentation have improved image classification accuracy. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive dataset for training neural networks to detect weeds and soy plants through instance segmentation. Our dataset covers various stages of soy growth, offering a chronological perspective on weed invasion's impact, with 1,000 meticulously annotated images. We also provide 6 state of the art models, trained in this dataset, that can understand and detect soy and weed in every stage of the plantation process. By using this dataset for weed and soy segmentation, we achieved a segmentation average precision of 79.1% and an average recall of 69.2% across all plant classes, with the YOLOv8X model. Moreover, the YOLOv8M model attained 78.7% mean average precision (mAp-50) in caruru weed segmentation, 69.7% in grassy weed segmentation, and 90.1% in soy plant segmentation.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The limited availability of psychologists necessitates efficient identification of individuals requiring urgent mental healthcare. This study explores the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipelines to analyze text data from online mental health forums used for consultations. By analyzing forum posts, these pipelines can flag users who may require immediate professional attention. A crucial challenge in this domain is data privacy and scarcity. To address this, we propose utilizing readily available curricular texts used in institutes specializing in mental health for pre-training the NLP pipelines. This helps us mimic the training process of a psychologist. Our work presents two models: a discriminative BERT-based model called CASE-BERT that flags potential mental health disorders based on forum text, and a generative model called CASE-Gemma that extracts key features for a preliminary diagnosis. CASE-BERT demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods, achieving an f1 score of 0.91 for Depression and 0.88 for Anxiety, two of the most commonly reported mental health disorders. CASE-Gemma can achieve a BERT Score of 0.849 on generating diagnoses based on forum text. The effectiveness of CASE-Gemma is evaluated through both human evaluation and qualitative methods, with the collaboration of clinical psychologists who provide us with a set of annotated data for fine-tuning and evaluation.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The semantic annotation of tabular data plays a crucial role in various downstream tasks. Previous research has proposed knowledge graph (KG)-based and deep learning-based methods, each with its inherent limitations. KG-based methods encounter difficulties annotating columns when there is no match for column cells in the KG. Moreover, KG-based methods can provide multiple predictions for one column, making it challenging to determine the semantic type with the most suitable granularity for the dataset. This type granularity issue limits their scalability. On the other hand, deep learning-based methods face challenges related to the valuable context missing issue. This occurs when the information within the table is insufficient for determining the correct column type. This paper presents KGLink, a method that combines WikiData KG information with a pre-trained deep learning language model for table column annotation, effectively addressing both type granularity and valuable context missing issues. Through comprehensive experiments on widely used tabular datasets encompassing numeric and string columns with varying type granularity, we showcase the effectiveness and efficiency of KGLink. By leveraging the strengths of KGLink, we successfully surmount challenges related to type granularity and valuable context issues, establishing it as a robust solution for the semantic annotation of tabular data.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>An increasing number of public datasets have shown a transformative impact on automated medical segmentation. However, these datasets are often with varying label quality, ranging from manual expert annotations to AI-generated pseudo-annotations. There is no systematic, reliable, and automatic quality control (QC). To fill in this bridge, we introduce a regression model, Quality Sentinel, to estimate label quality compared with manual annotations in medical segmentation datasets. This regression model was trained on over 4 million image-label pairs created by us. Each pair presents a varying but quantified label quality based on manual annotations, which enable us to predict the label quality of any image-label pairs in the inference. Our Quality Sentinel can predict the label quality of 142 body structures. The predicted label quality quantified by Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) shares a strong correlation with ground truth quality, with a positive correlation coefficient (r=0.902). Quality Sentinel has found multiple impactful use cases. (I) We evaluated label quality in publicly available datasets, where quality highly varies across different datasets. Our analysis also uncovers that male and younger subjects exhibit significantly higher quality. (II) We identified and corrected poorly annotated labels, achieving 1/3 reduction in annotation costs with optimal budgeting on TotalSegmentator. (III) We enhanced AI training efficiency and performance by focusing on high-quality pseudo labels, resulting in a 33%--88% performance boost over entropy-based methods, with a cost of 31% time and 4.5% memory. The data and model are released.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The adaptation and use of Machine Learning (ML) in our daily lives has led to concerns in lack of transparency, privacy, reliability, among others. As a result, we are seeing research in niche areas such as interpretability, causality, bias and fairness, and reliability. In this survey paper, we focus on a critical concern for adaptation of ML in risk-sensitive applications, namely understanding and quantifying uncertainty. Our paper approaches this topic in a structured way, providing a review of the literature in the various facets that uncertainty is enveloped in the ML process. We begin by defining uncertainty and its categories (e.g., aleatoric and epistemic), understanding sources of uncertainty (e.g., data and model), and how uncertainty can be assessed in terms of uncertainty quantification techniques (Ensembles, Bayesian Neural Networks, etc.). As part of our assessment and understanding of uncertainty in the ML realm, we cover metrics for uncertainty quantification for a single sample, dataset, and metrics for accuracy of the uncertainty estimation itself. This is followed by discussions on calibration (model and uncertainty), and decision making under uncertainty. Thus, we provide a more complete treatment of uncertainty: from the sources of uncertainty to the decision-making process. We have focused the review of uncertainty quantification methods on Deep Learning (DL), while providing the necessary background for uncertainty discussion within ML in general. Key contributions in this review are broadening the scope of uncertainty discussion, as well as an updated review of uncertainty quantification methods in DL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper explores a novel dynamic network for vision and language tasks, where the inferring structure is customized on the fly for different inputs. Most previous state-of-the-art approaches are static and hand-crafted networks, which not only heavily rely on expert knowledge, but also ignore the semantic diversity of input samples, therefore resulting in suboptimal performance. To address these issues, we propose a novel Dynamic Transformer Network (DTNet) for image captioning, which dynamically assigns customized paths to different samples, leading to discriminative yet accurate captions. Specifically, to build a rich routing space and improve routing efficiency, we introduce five types of basic cells and group them into two separate routing spaces according to their operating domains, i.e., spatial and channel. Then, we design a Spatial-Channel Joint Router (SCJR), which endows the model with the capability of path customization based on both spatial and channel information of the input sample. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed DTNet, we conduct extensive experiments on the MS-COCO dataset and achieve new state-of-the-art performance on both the Karpathy split and the online test server.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Online marketing is critical for many industrial platforms and business applications, aiming to increase user engagement and platform revenue by identifying corresponding delivery-sensitive groups for specific incentives, such as coupons and bonuses. As the scale and complexity of features in industrial scenarios increase, deep uplift modeling (DUM) as a promising technique has attracted increased research from academia and industry, resulting in various predictive models. However, current DUM still lacks some standardized benchmarks and unified evaluation protocols, which limit the reproducibility of experimental results in existing studies and the practical value and potential impact in this direction. In this paper, we provide an open benchmark for DUM and present comparison results of existing models in a reproducible and uniform manner. To this end, we conduct extensive experiments on two representative industrial datasets with different preprocessing settings to re-evaluate 13 existing models. Surprisingly, our experimental results show that the most recent work differs less than expected from traditional work in many cases. In addition, our experiments also reveal the limitations of DUM in generalization, especially for different preprocessing and test distributions. Our benchmarking work allows researchers to evaluate the performance of new models quickly but also reasonably demonstrates fair comparison results with existing models. It also gives practitioners valuable insights into often overlooked considerations when deploying DUM. We will make this benchmarking library, evaluation protocol, and experimental setup available on GitHub.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world applications presents both opportunities and challenges, particularly in multilingual and code-mixed communication settings. This research evaluates the performance of seven leading LLMs in sentiment analysis on a dataset derived from multilingual and code-mixed WhatsApp chats, including Swahili, English and Sheng. Our evaluation includes both quantitative analysis using metrics like F1 score and qualitative assessment of LLMs' explanations for their predictions. We find that, while Mistral-7b and Mixtral-8x7b achieved high F1 scores, they and other LLMs such as GPT-3.5-Turbo, Llama-2-70b, and Gemma-7b struggled with understanding linguistic and contextual nuances, as well as lack of transparency in their decision-making process as observed from their explanations. In contrast, GPT-4 and GPT-4-Turbo excelled in grasping diverse linguistic inputs and managing various contextual information, demonstrating high consistency with human alignment and transparency in their decision-making process. The LLMs however, encountered difficulties in incorporating cultural nuance especially in non-English settings with GPT-4s doing so inconsistently. The findings emphasize the necessity of continuous improvement of LLMs to effectively tackle the challenges of culturally nuanced, low-resource real-world settings.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated impressive zero-shot capabilities for various downstream tasks. Their performance can be further enhanced through few-shot prompt tuning methods. However, current studies evaluate the performance of learned prompts separately on base and new classes. This evaluation lacks practicality for real-world applications since downstream tasks cannot determine whether the data belongs to base or new classes in advance. In this paper, we explore a problem setting called Open-world Prompt Tuning (OPT), which involves tuning prompts on base classes and evaluating on a combination of base and new classes. By introducing Decomposed Prompt Tuning framework (DePT), we theoretically demonstrate that OPT can be solved by incorporating out-of-distribution detection into prompt tuning, thereby enhancing the base-to-new discriminability. Based on DePT, we present a novel prompt tuning approach, namely, Decomposed Context Optimization (DeCoOp), which introduces new-class detectors and sub-classifiers to further enhance the base-class and new-class discriminability. Experimental results on 11 benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of DePT and demonstrate that DeCoOp outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, providing a significant 2% average accuracy improvement.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Effectively analyzing the comments to uncover latent intentions holds immense value in making strategic decisions across various domains. However, several challenges hinder the process of sentiment analysis including the lexical diversity exhibited in comments, the presence of long dependencies within the text, encountering unknown symbols and words, and dealing with imbalanced datasets. Moreover, existing sentiment analysis tasks mostly leveraged sequential models to encode the long dependent texts and it requires longer execution time as it processes the text sequentially. In contrast, the Transformer requires less execution time due to its parallel processing nature. In this work, we introduce a novel hybrid deep learning model, RoBERTa-BiLSTM, which combines the Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach (RoBERTa) with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks. RoBERTa is utilized to generate meaningful word embedding vectors, while BiLSTM effectively captures the contextual semantics of long-dependent texts. The RoBERTa-BiLSTM hybrid model leverages the strengths of both sequential and Transformer models to enhance performance in sentiment analysis. We conducted experiments using datasets from IMDb, Twitter US Airline, and Sentiment140 to evaluate the proposed model against existing state-of-the-art methods. Our experimental findings demonstrate that the RoBERTa-BiLSTM model surpasses baseline models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa-base, RoBERTa-GRU, and RoBERTa-LSTM), achieving accuracies of 80.74%, 92.36%, and 82.25% on the Twitter US Airline, IMDb, and Sentiment140 datasets, respectively. Additionally, the model achieves F1-scores of 80.73%, 92.35%, and 82.25% on the same datasets, respectively.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various industries due to their exceptional generative capabilities. However, for safe and effective real-world deployments, ensuring honesty and helpfulness is critical. This paper addresses the question: Can we prioritize the helpfulness of LLMs while preserving their honesty? To begin with, we establish exhaustive principles aimed at guaranteeing the honesty of LLM. Additionally, we introduce a novel dataset, referred to as HoneSet, comprising 930 queries spanning six categories meticulously crafted to assess an LLM's capacity for maintaining honesty. Subsequently, we present two approaches to augmenting honesty and helpfulness in LLMs: a training-free enhancement and a fine-tuning-based improvement. The training-free approach, which is based on curiosity-driven prompting, empowers LLMs to articulate internal confusion and uncertainty regarding queries, thereby optimizing their responses. Conversely, the fine-tuning-based method employs a two-stage process inspired by curriculum learning: initially instructing LLMs to discern between honest and dishonest responses, then refining their training to enhance helpfulness. Experiments conducted on nine prominent LLMs demonstrate a significant improvement in alignment with honesty across all models through the implementation of our proposed enhancements. Particularly noteworthy is the 65.3% enhancement observed in Llama3-8b and the remarkable 124.7% improvement in Mistral-7b, as measured by the H$^{2}$ (honest and helpful) assessment. We believe that our work can pave the way for developing more trustworthy LLMs for real-world applications.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The amplification of high-speed micro-motions holds significant promise, with applications spanning fault detection in fast-paced industrial environments to refining precision in medical procedures. However, conventional motion magnification algorithms often encounter challenges in high-speed scenarios due to low sampling rates or motion blur. In recent years, spike cameras have emerged as a superior alternative for visual tasks in such environments, owing to their unique capability to capture temporal and spatial frequency domains with exceptional fidelity. Unlike conventional cameras, which operate at fixed, low frequencies, spike cameras emulate the functionality of the retina, asynchronously capturing photon changes at each pixel position using spike streams. This innovative approach comprehensively records temporal and spatial visual information, rendering it particularly suitable for magnifying high-speed micro-motions.This paper introduces SpikeMM, a pioneering spike-based algorithm tailored specifically for high-speed motion magnification. SpikeMM integrates multi-level information extraction, spatial upsampling, and motion magnification modules, offering a self-supervised approach adaptable to a wide range of scenarios. Notably, SpikeMM facilitates seamless integration with high-performance super-resolution and motion magnification algorithms. We substantiate the efficacy of SpikeMM through rigorous validation using scenes captured by spike cameras, showcasing its capacity to magnify motions in real-world high-frequency settings.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The need for modelling causal knowledge at different levels of granularity arises in several settings. Causal Abstraction provides a framework for formalizing this problem by relating two Structural Causal Models at different levels of detail. Despite increasing interest in applying causal abstraction, e.g. in the interpretability of large machine learning models, the graphical and parametrical conditions under which a causal model can abstract another are not known. Furthermore, learning causal abstractions from data is still an open problem. In this work, we tackle both issues for linear causal models with linear abstraction functions. First, we characterize how the low-level coefficients and the abstraction function determine the high-level coefficients and how the high-level model constrains the causal ordering of low-level variables. Then, we apply our theoretical results to learn high-level and low-level causal models and their abstraction function from observational data. In particular, we introduce Abs-LiNGAM, a method that leverages the constraints induced by the learned high-level model and the abstraction function to speedup the recovery of the larger low-level model, under the assumption of non-Gaussian noise terms. In simulated settings, we show the effectiveness of learning causal abstractions from data and the potential of our method in improving scalability of causal discovery.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Graph contrastive learning (GCL) is a popular method for leaning graph representations by maximizing the consistency of features across augmented views. Traditional GCL methods utilize single-perspective i.e. data or model-perspective) augmentation to generate positive samples, restraining the diversity of positive samples. In addition, these positive samples may be unreliable due to uncontrollable augmentation strategies that potentially alter the semantic information. To address these challenges, this paper proposed a innovative framework termed dual-perspective cross graph contrastive learning (DC-GCL), which incorporates three modifications designed to enhance positive sample diversity and reliability: 1) We propose dual-perspective augmentation strategy that provide the model with more diverse training data, enabling the model effective learning of feature consistency across different views. 2) From the data perspective, we slightly perturb the original graphs using controllable data augmentation, effectively preserving their semantic information. 3) From the model perspective, we enhance the encoder by utilizing more powerful graph transformers instead of graph neural networks. Based on the model's architecture, we propose three pruning-based strategies to slightly perturb the encoder, providing more reliable positive samples. These modifications collectively form the DC-GCL's foundation and provide more diverse and reliable training inputs, offering significant improvements over traditional GCL methods. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that DC-GCL consistently outperforms different baselines on various datasets and tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>biometric</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This study thoroughly investigates how well deep learning models can recognize Arabic handwritten text for person biometric identification. It compares three advanced architectures -- ResNet50, MobileNetV2, and EfficientNetB7 -- using three widely recognized datasets: AHAWP, Khatt, and LAMIS-MSHD. Results show that EfficientNetB7 outperforms the others, achieving test accuracies of 98.57\%, 99.15\%, and 99.79\% on AHAWP, Khatt, and LAMIS-MSHD datasets, respectively. EfficientNetB7's exceptional performance is credited to its innovative techniques, including compound scaling, depth-wise separable convolutions, and squeeze-and-excitation blocks. These features allow the model to extract more abstract and distinctive features from handwritten text images. The study's findings hold significant implications for enhancing identity verification and authentication systems, highlighting the potential of deep learning in Arabic handwritten text recognition for person biometric identification.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We develop a multimodal classifier for the cultural heritage domain using a late fusion approach and introduce a novel dataset. The three modalities are Image, Text, and Tabular data. We based the image classifier on a ResNet convolutional neural network architecture and the text classifier on a multilingual transformer architecture (XML-Roberta). Both are trained as multitask classifiers and use the focal loss to handle class imbalance. Tabular data and late fusion are handled by Gradient Tree Boosting. We also show how we leveraged specific data models and taxonomy in a Knowledge Graph to create the dataset and to store classification results. All individual classifiers accurately predict missing properties in the digitized silk artifacts, with the multimodal approach providing the best results.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Tabular data are omnipresent in various sectors of industries. Neural networks for tabular data such as TabNet have been proposed to make predictions while leveraging the attention mechanism for interpretability. However, the inferred attention masks are often dense, making it challenging to come up with rationales about the predictive signal. To remedy this, we propose InterpreTabNet, a variant of the TabNet model that models the attention mechanism as a latent variable sampled from a Gumbel-Softmax distribution. This enables us to regularize the model to learn distinct concepts in the attention masks via a KL Divergence regularizer. It prevents overlapping feature selection by promoting sparsity which maximizes the model's efficacy and improves interpretability to determine the important features when predicting the outcome. To assist in the interpretation of feature interdependencies from our model, we employ a large language model (GPT-4) and use prompt engineering to map from the learned feature mask onto natural language text describing the learned signal. Through comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that InterpreTabNet outperforms previous methods for interpreting tabular data while attaining competitive accuracy.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The advent of Vision Transformers (ViTs) marks a substantial paradigm shift in the realm of computer vision. ViTs capture the global information of images through self-attention modules, which perform dot product computations among patchified image tokens. While self-attention modules empower ViTs to capture long-range dependencies, the computational complexity grows quadratically with the number of tokens, which is a major hindrance to the practical application of ViTs. Moreover, the self-attention mechanism in deep ViTs is also susceptible to the attention saturation issue. Accordingly, we argue against the necessity of computing the attention scores in every layer, and we propose the Less-Attention Vision Transformer (LaViT), which computes only a few attention operations at each stage and calculates the subsequent feature alignments in other layers via attention transformations that leverage the previously calculated attention scores. This novel approach can mitigate two primary issues plaguing traditional self-attention modules: the heavy computational burden and attention saturation. Our proposed architecture offers superior efficiency and ease of implementation, merely requiring matrix multiplications that are highly optimized in contemporary deep learning frameworks. Moreover, our architecture demonstrates exceptional performance across various vision tasks including classification, detection and segmentation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The large communication and computation overhead of federated learning (FL) is one of the main challenges facing its practical deployment over resource-constrained clients and systems. In this work, SpaFL: a communication-efficient FL framework is proposed to optimize sparse model structures with low computational overhead. In SpaFL, a trainable threshold is defined for each filter/neuron to prune its all connected parameters, thereby leading to structured sparsity. To optimize the pruning process itself, only thresholds are communicated between a server and clients instead of parameters, thereby learning how to prune. Further, global thresholds are used to update model parameters by extracting aggregated parameter importance. The generalization bound of SpaFL is also derived, thereby proving key insights on the relation between sparsity and performance. Experimental results show that SpaFL improves accuracy while requiring much less communication and computing resources compared to sparse baselines.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we propose MoDGS, a new pipeline to render novel-view images in dynamic scenes using only casually captured monocular videos. Previous monocular dynamic NeRF or Gaussian Splatting methods strongly rely on the rapid movement of input cameras to construct multiview consistency but fail to reconstruct dynamic scenes on casually captured input videos whose cameras are static or move slowly. To address this challenging task, MoDGS adopts recent single-view depth estimation methods to guide the learning of the dynamic scene. Then, a novel 3D-aware initialization method is proposed to learn a reasonable deformation field and a new robust depth loss is proposed to guide the learning of dynamic scene geometry. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MoDGS is able to render high-quality novel view images of dynamic scenes from just a casually captured monocular video, which outperforms baseline methods by a significant margin.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models have become prominent in creating high-quality images. However, unlike GAN models celebrated for their ability to edit images in a disentangled manner, diffusion-based text-to-image models struggle to achieve the same level of precise attribute manipulation without compromising image coherence. In this paper, CLIP which is often used in popular text-to-image diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion is capable of performing disentangled editing in a zero-shot manner. Through both qualitative and quantitative comparisons with state-of-the-art editing methods, we show that our approach yields competitive results. This insight may open opportunities for applying this method to various tasks, including image and video editing, providing a lightweight and efficient approach for disentangled editing.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Powered by massive curated training data, Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated its impressive generalization capabilities in open-world scenarios with the guidance of prompts. However, the vanilla SAM is class agnostic and heavily relies on user-provided prompts to segment objects of interest. Adapting this method to diverse tasks is crucial for accurate target identification and to avoid suboptimal segmentation results. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, termed AlignSAM, designed for automatic prompting for aligning SAM to an open context through reinforcement learning. Anchored by an agent, AlignSAM enables the generality of the SAM model across diverse downstream tasks while keeping its parameters frozen. Specifically, AlignSAM initiates a prompting agent to iteratively refine segmentation predictions by interacting with the foundational model. It integrates a reinforcement learning policy network to provide informative prompts to the foundational models. Additionally, a semantic recalibration module is introduced to provide fine-grained labels of prompts, enhancing the model's proficiency in handling tasks encompassing explicit and implicit semantics. Experiments conducted on various challenging segmentation tasks among existing foundation models demonstrate the superiority of the proposed AlignSAM over state-of-the-art approaches.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Model heterogeneous federated learning (MHeteroFL) enables FL clients to collaboratively train models with heterogeneous structures in a distributed fashion. However, existing MHeteroFL methods rely on training loss to transfer knowledge between the client model and the server model, resulting in limited knowledge exchange. To address this limitation, we propose the Federated model heterogeneous Matryoshka Representation Learning (FedMRL) approach for supervised learning tasks. It adds an auxiliary small homogeneous model shared by clients with heterogeneous local models. (1) The generalized and personalized representations extracted by the two models' feature extractors are fused by a personalized lightweight representation projector. This step enables representation fusion to adapt to local data distribution. (2) The fused representation is then used to construct Matryoshka representations with multi-dimensional and multi-granular embedded representations learned by the global homogeneous model header and the local heterogeneous model header. This step facilitates multi-perspective representation learning and improves model learning capability. Theoretical analysis shows that FedMRL achieves a $O(1/T)$ non-convex convergence rate. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate its superior model accuracy with low communication and computational costs compared to seven state-of-the-art baselines. It achieves up to 8.48% and 24.94% accuracy improvement compared with the state-of-the-art and the best same-category baseline, respectively.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Video Panoptic Segmentation (VPS) is a challenging task that is extends from image panoptic segmentation.VPS aims to simultaneously classify, track, segment all objects in a video, including both things and stuff. Due to its wide application in many downstream tasks such as video understanding, video editing, and autonomous driving. In order to deal with the task of video panoptic segmentation in the wild, we propose a robust integrated video panoptic segmentation solution. We use DVIS++ framework as our baseline to generate the initial masks. Then,we add an additional image semantic segmentation model to further improve the performance of semantic classes.Finally, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with a VPQ score of 56.36 and 57.12 in the development and test phases, respectively, and ultimately ranked 2nd in the VPS track of the PVUW Challenge at CVPR2024.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this study, we show that diffusion models can be used in industrial scenarios to improve the data augmentation procedure in the context of surface defect detection. In general, defect detection classifiers are trained on ground-truth data formed by normal samples (negative data) and samples with defects (positive data), where the latter are consistently fewer than normal samples. For these reasons, state-of-the-art data augmentation procedures add synthetic defect data by superimposing artifacts to normal samples. This leads to out-of-distribution augmented data so that the classification system learns what is not a normal sample but does not know what a defect really is. We show that diffusion models overcome this situation, providing more realistic in-distribution defects so that the model can learn the defect's genuine appearance. We propose a novel approach for data augmentation that mixes out-of-distribution with in-distribution samples, which we call In&Out. The approach can deal with two data augmentation setups: i) when no defects are available (zero-shot data augmentation) and ii) when defects are available, which can be in a small number (few-shot) or a large one (full-shot). We focus the experimental part on the most challenging benchmark in the state-of-the-art, i.e., the Kolektor Surface-Defect Dataset 2, defining the new state-of-the-art classification AP score under weak supervision of .782.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The recent emergence of latent diffusion models such as SDXL and SD 1.5 has shown significant capability in generating highly detailed and realistic images. Despite their remarkable ability to produce images, generating accurate text within images still remains a challenging task. In this paper, we examine the validity of fine-tuning approaches in generating legible text within the image. We propose a low-cost approach by leveraging SDXL without any time-consuming training on large-scale datasets. The proposed strategy employs a fine-tuning technique that examines the effects of data refinement levels and synthetic captions. Moreover, our results demonstrate how our small scale fine-tuning approach can improve the accuracy of text generation in different scenarios without the need of additional multimodal encoders. Our experiments show that with the addition of random letters to our raw dataset, our model's performance improves in producing well-formed visual text.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the capacity to improve summary quality by mirroring a human-like iterative process of critique and refinement starting from the initial draft. Two strategies are designed to perform this iterative process: Prompt Chaining and Stepwise Prompt. Prompt chaining orchestrates the drafting, critiquing, and refining phases through a series of three discrete prompts, while Stepwise prompt integrates these phases within a single prompt. However, the relative effectiveness of the two methods has not been extensively studied. This paper is dedicated to examining and comparing these two methods in the context of text summarization to ascertain which method stands out as the most effective. Experimental results show that the prompt chaining method can produce a more favorable outcome. This might be because stepwise prompt might produce a simulated refinement process according to our various experiments. Since refinement is adaptable to diverse tasks, our conclusions have the potential to be extrapolated to other applications, thereby offering insights that may contribute to the broader development of LLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Image enhancement holds extensive applications in real-world scenarios due to complex environments and limitations of imaging devices. Conventional methods are often constrained by their tailored models, resulting in diminished robustness when confronted with challenging degradation conditions. In response, we propose FlowIE, a simple yet highly effective flow-based image enhancement framework that estimates straight-line paths from an elementary distribution to high-quality images. Unlike previous diffusion-based methods that suffer from long-time inference, FlowIE constructs a linear many-to-one transport mapping via conditioned rectified flow. The rectification straightens the trajectories of probability transfer, accelerating inference by an order of magnitude. This design enables our FlowIE to fully exploit rich knowledge in the pre-trained diffusion model, rendering it well-suited for various real-world applications. Moreover, we devise a faster inference algorithm, inspired by Lagrange's Mean Value Theorem, harnessing midpoint tangent direction to optimize path estimation, ultimately yielding visually superior results. Thanks to these designs, our FlowIE adeptly manages a diverse range of enhancement tasks within a concise sequence of fewer than 5 steps. Our contributions are rigorously validated through comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, unveiling the compelling efficacy and efficiency of our proposed FlowIE.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered remarkable advancements across diverse code-related tasks, known as Code LLMs, particularly in code generation that generates source code with LLM from natural language descriptions. This burgeoning field has captured significant interest from both academic researchers and industry professionals due to its practical significance in software development, e.g., GitHub Copilot. Despite the active exploration of LLMs for a variety of code tasks, either from the perspective of natural language processing (NLP) or software engineering (SE) or both, there is a noticeable absence of a comprehensive and up-to-date literature review dedicated to LLM for code generation. In this survey, we aim to bridge this gap by providing a systematic literature review that serves as a valuable reference for researchers investigating the cutting-edge progress in LLMs for code generation. We introduce a taxonomy to categorize and discuss the recent developments in LLMs for code generation, covering aspects such as data curation, latest advances, performance evaluation, and real-world applications. In addition, we present a historical overview of the evolution of LLMs for code generation and offer an empirical comparison using the widely recognized HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks to highlight the progressive enhancements in LLM capabilities for code generation. We identify critical challenges and promising opportunities regarding the gap between academia and practical development. Furthermore, we have established a dedicated resource website (this https URL) to continuously document and disseminate the most recent advances in the field.</li>

Despite its encouraging prospect, formalization and theoretical insights into this crucial task are still lacking. In this work, we formalize concepts as discrete latent causal variables that are related via a hierarchical causal model that encodes different abstraction levels of concepts embedded in high-dimensional data (e.g., a dog breed and its eye shapes in natural images). We formulate conditions to facilitate the identification of the proposed causal model, which reveals when learning such concepts from unsupervised data is possible. Our conditions permit complex causal hierarchical structures beyond latent trees and multi-level directed acyclic graphs in prior work and can handle high-dimensional, continuous observed variables, which is well-suited for unstructured data modalities such as images. We substantiate our theoretical claims with synthetic data experiments. Further, we discuss our theory's implications for understanding the underlying mechanisms of latent diffusion models and provide corresponding empirical evidence for our theoretical insights.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As the field of Web3 continues its rapid expansion, the security of Web3 authentication, often the gateway to various Web3 applications, becomes increasingly crucial. Despite its widespread use as a login method by numerous Web3 applications, the security risks of Web3 authentication have not received much attention. This paper investigates the vulnerabilities in the Web3 authentication process and proposes a new type of attacks, dubbed blind message attacks. In blind message attacks, attackers trick users into blindly signing messages from target applications by exploiting users' inability to verify the source of messages, thereby achieving unauthorized access to the target application. We have developed Web3AuthChecker, a dynamic detection tool that interacts with Web3 authentication-related APIs to identify vulnerabilities. Our evaluation of real-world Web3 applications shows that a staggering 75.8% (22/29) of Web3 authentication deployments are at risk of blind message attacks. In response to this alarming situation, we implemented Web3AuthGuard on the open-source wallet MetaMask to alert users of potential attacks. Our evaluation results show that Web3AuthGuard can successfully raise alerts in 80% of the tested Web3 authentications. We have responsibly reported our findings to vulnerable websites and have been assigned two CVE IDs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Estimating treatment effects over time holds significance in various domains, including precision medicine, epidemiology, economy, and marketing. This paper introduces a unique approach to counterfactual regression over time, emphasizing long-term predictions. Distinguishing itself from existing models like Causal Transformer, our approach highlights the efficacy of employing RNNs for long-term forecasting, complemented by Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC) and Information Maximization (InfoMax). Emphasizing efficiency, we avoid the need for computationally expensive transformers. Leveraging CPC, our method captures long-term dependencies in the presence of time-varying confounders. Notably, recent models have disregarded the importance of invertible representation, compromising identification assumptions. To remedy this, we employ the InfoMax principle, maximizing a lower bound of mutual information between sequence data and its representation. Our method achieves state-of-the-art counterfactual estimation results using both synthetic and real-world data, marking the pioneering incorporation of Contrastive Predictive Encoding in causal inference.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep neural networks exhibit remarkable performance, yet their black-box nature limits their utility in fields like healthcare where interpretability is crucial. Existing explainability approaches often sacrifice accuracy and lack quantifiable measures of prediction uncertainty. In this study, we introduce Conformal Prediction for Interpretable Neural Networks (CONFINE), a versatile framework that generates prediction sets with statistically robust uncertainty estimates instead of point predictions to enhance model transparency and reliability. CONFINE not only provides example-based explanations and confidence estimates for individual predictions but also boosts accuracy by up to 3.6%. We define a new metric, correct efficiency, to evaluate the fraction of prediction sets that contain precisely the correct label and show that CONFINE achieves correct efficiency of up to 3.3% higher than the original accuracy, matching or exceeding prior methods. CONFINE's marginal and class-conditional coverages attest to its validity across tasks spanning medical image classification to language understanding. Being adaptable to any pre-trained classifier, CONFINE marks a significant advance towards transparent and trustworthy deep learning applications in critical domains.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The quality of Machine Learning (ML) models strongly depends on the input data, as such Feature Engineering (FE) is often required in ML. In addition, with the proliferation of ML-powered systems, especially in critical contexts, the need for interpretability and explainability becomes increasingly important. Since manual FE is time-consuming and requires case specific knowledge, we propose KRAFT, an AutoFE framework that leverages a knowledge graph to guide the generation of interpretable features. Our hybrid AI approach combines a neural generator to transform raw features through a series of transformations and a knowledge-based reasoner to evaluate features interpretability using Description Logics (DL). The generator is trained through Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to maximize the prediction accuracy and the interpretability of the generated features. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate that KRAFT significantly improves accuracy while ensuring a high level of interpretability.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The performance of supervised semantic segmentation methods highly relies on the availability of large-scale training data. To alleviate this dependence, few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) is introduced to leverage the model trained on base classes with sufficient data into the segmentation of novel classes with few data. FSS methods face the challenge of model generalization on novel classes due to the distribution shift between base and novel classes. To overcome this issue, we propose a class-shared memory (CSM) module consisting of a set of learnable memory vectors. These memory vectors learn elemental object patterns from base classes during training whilst re-encoding query features during both training and inference, thereby improving the distribution alignment between base and novel classes. Furthermore, to cope with the performance degradation resulting from the intra-class variance across images, we introduce an uncertainty-based feature augmentation (UFA) module to produce diverse query features during training for improving the model's robustness. We integrate CSM and UFA into representative FSS works, with experimental results on the widely-used PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ datasets demonstrating the superior performance of ours over state of the art.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, fair, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance on various natural language generation tasks. Nonetheless, they suffer from generating negative and harmful contents that are biased against certain demographic groups (e.g., female), raising severe fairness concerns. As remedies, prior works intervened the generation by removing attitude or demographic information, inevitably degrading the generation quality and resulting in notable \textit{fairness-fluency} trade-offs. However, it is still under-explored to what extent the fluency \textit{has to} be affected in order to achieve a desired level of fairness. In this work, we conduct the first formal study from an information-theoretic perspective. We show that previous approaches are excessive for debiasing and propose LIDAO, a general framework to debias a (L)LM at a better fluency provably. We further robustify LIDAO in adversarial scenarios, where a carefully-crafted prompt may stimulate LLMs exhibiting instruction-following abilities to generate texts with fairness issue appears only when the prompt is also taken into account. Experiments on three LMs ranging from 0.7B to 7B parameters demonstrate the superiority of our method.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) are capable of generating stories in response to open-ended user requests, but the resulting stories tend to be limited in their diversity. Older, symbolic approaches to story generation (such as planning) can generate substantially more diverse plot outlines, but are limited to producing stories that recombine a fixed set of hand-engineered character action templates. Can we combine the strengths of these approaches while mitigating their weaknesses? We propose to do so by using a higher-level and more abstract symbolic specification of high-level story structure -- implemented via answer set programming (ASP) -- to guide and diversify LLM-based story generation. Via semantic similarity analysis, we demonstrate that our approach produces more diverse stories than an unguided LLM, and via code excerpts, we demonstrate the improved compactness and flexibility of ASP-based outline generation over full-fledged narrative planning.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Learning dynamical systems from sparse observations is critical in numerous fields, including biology, finance, and physics. Even if tackling such problems is standard in general information fusion, it remains challenging for contemporary machine learning models, such as diffusion models. We introduce a method that integrates conditional particle filtering with ancestral sampling and diffusion models, enabling the generation of realistic trajectories that align with observed data. Our approach uses a smoother based on iterating a conditional particle filter with ancestral sampling to first generate plausible trajectories matching observed marginals, and learns the corresponding diffusion model. This approach provides both a generative method for high-quality, smoothed trajectories under complex constraints, and an efficient approximation of the particle smoothing distribution for classical tracking problems. We demonstrate the approach in time-series generation and interpolation tasks, including vehicle tracking and single-cell RNA sequencing data.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>federate, fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a pivotal approach in machine learning, enabling multiple participants to collaboratively train a global model without sharing raw data. While FL finds applications in various domains such as healthcare and finance, it is challenging to ensure global model convergence when participants do not contribute equally and/or honestly. To overcome this challenge, principled mechanisms are required to evaluate the contributions made by individual participants in the FL setting. Existing solutions for contribution assessment rely on general accuracy evaluation, often failing to capture nuanced dynamics and class-specific influences. This paper proposes a novel contribution assessment method called ShapFed for fine-grained evaluation of participant contributions in FL. Our approach uses Shapley values from cooperative game theory to provide a granular understanding of class-specific influences. Based on ShapFed, we introduce a weighted aggregation method called ShapFed-WA, which outperforms conventional federated averaging, especially in class-imbalanced scenarios. Personalizing participant updates based on their contributions further enhances collaborative fairness by delivering differentiated models commensurate with the participant contributions. Experiments on CIFAR-10, Chest X-Ray, and Fed-ISIC2019 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving utility, efficiency, and fairness in FL systems.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Based on transformed $\ell_1$ regularization, transformed total variation (TTV) has robust image recovery that is competitive with other nonconvex total variation (TV) regularizers, such as TV$^p$, $0<p<1$. Inspired by its performance, we propose a TTV-regularized Mumford--Shah model with fuzzy membership function for image segmentation. To solve it, we design an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm that utilizes the transformed $\ell_1$ proximal operator. Numerical experiments demonstrate that using TTV is more effective than classical TV and other nonconvex TV variants in image segmentation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability, explainability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we visualize and quantify the predictive uncertainty of gradient-based post hoc visual explanations for neural networks. Predictive uncertainty refers to the variability in the network predictions under perturbations to the input. Visual post hoc explainability techniques highlight features within an image to justify a network's prediction. We theoretically show that existing evaluation strategies of visual explanatory techniques partially reduce the predictive uncertainty of neural networks. This analysis allows us to construct a plug in approach to visualize and quantify the remaining predictive uncertainty of any gradient-based explanatory technique. We show that every image, network, prediction, and explanatory technique has a unique uncertainty. The proposed uncertainty visualization and quantification yields two key observations. Firstly, oftentimes under incorrect predictions, explanatory techniques are uncertain about the same features that they are attributing the predictions to, thereby reducing the trustworthiness of the explanation. Secondly, objective metrics of an explanation's uncertainty, empirically behave similarly to epistemic uncertainty. We support these observations on two datasets, four explanatory techniques, and six neural network architectures. The code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Normalizing flow-based generative models have been widely used in applications where the exact density estimation is of major importance. Recent research proposes numerous methods to improve their expressivity. However, conditioning on a context is largely overlooked area in the bijective flow research. Conventional conditioning with the vector concatenation is limited to only a few flow types. More importantly, this approach cannot support a practical setup where a set of context-conditioned (specialist) models are trained with the fixed pretrained general-knowledge (generalist) model. We propose ContextFlow++ approach to overcome these limitations using an additive conditioning with explicit generalist-specialist knowledge decoupling. Furthermore, we support discrete contexts by the proposed mixed-variable architecture with context encoders. Particularly, our context encoder for discrete variables is a surjective flow from which the context-conditioned continuous variables are sampled. Our experiments on rotated MNIST-R, corrupted CIFAR-10C, real-world ATM predictive maintenance and SMAP unsupervised anomaly detection benchmarks show that the proposed ContextFlow++ offers faster stable training and achieves higher performance metrics.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, privacy, protect</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Many Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices rely on cloud computation resources to perform machine learning inferences. This is expensive and may raise privacy concerns for users. Consumers of these devices often have hardware such as gaming consoles and PCs with graphics accelerators that are capable of performing these computations, which may be left idle for significant periods of time. While this presents a compelling potential alternative to cloud offloading, concerns about the integrity of inferences, the confidentiality of model parameters, and the privacy of users' data mean that device vendors may be hesitant to offload their inferences to a platform managed by another manufacturer. We propose VeriSplit, a framework for offloading machine learning inferences to locally-available devices that address these concerns. We introduce masking techniques to protect data privacy and model confidentiality, and a commitment-based verification protocol to address integrity. Unlike much prior work aimed at addressing these issues, our approach does not rely on computation over finite field elements, which may interfere with floating-point computation supports on hardware accelerators and require modification to existing models. We implemented a prototype of VeriSplit and our evaluation results show that, compared to performing computation locally, our secure and private offloading solution can reduce inference latency by 28%--83%.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Pixel-level Scene Understanding is one of the fundamental problems in computer vision, which aims at recognizing object classes, masks and semantics of each pixel in the given image. Compared with image scene parsing, video scene parsing introduces temporal information, which can effectively improve the consistency and accuracy of prediction,because the real-world is actually video-based rather than a static state. In this paper, we adopt semi-supervised video semantic segmentation method based on unreliable pseudo labels. Then, We ensemble the teacher network model with the student network model to generate pseudo labels and retrain the student network. Our method achieves the mIoU scores of 63.71% and 67.83% on development test and final test respectively. Finally, we obtain the 1st place in the Video Scene Parsing in the Wild Challenge at CVPR 2024.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The generalization bound is a crucial theoretical tool for assessing the generalizability of learning methods and there exist vast literatures on generalizability of normal learning, adversarial learning, and data poisoning. Unlike other data poison attacks, the backdoor attack has the special property that the poisoned triggers are contained in both the training set and the test set and the purpose of the attack is two-fold. To our knowledge, the generalization bound for the backdoor attack has not been established. In this paper, we fill this gap by deriving algorithm-independent generalization bounds in the clean-label backdoor attack scenario. Precisely, based on the goals of backdoor attack, we give upper bounds for the clean sample population errors and the poison population errors in terms of the empirical error on the poisoned training dataset. Furthermore, based on the theoretical result, a new clean-label backdoor attack is proposed that computes the poisoning trigger by combining adversarial noise and indiscriminate poison. We show its effectiveness in a variety of settings.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Visual tracking fundamentally involves regressing the state of the target in each frame of a video. Despite significant progress, existing regression-based trackers still tend to experience failures and inaccuracies. To enhance the precision of target estimation, this paper proposes a tracking technique based on robust regression. Firstly, we introduce a novel robust linear regression estimator, which achieves favorable performance when the error vector follows i.i.d Gaussian-Laplacian distribution. Secondly, we design an iterative process to quickly solve the problem of outliers. In fact, the coefficients are obtained by Iterative Gradient Descent and Threshold Selection algorithm (IGDTS). In addition, we expend IGDTS to a generative tracker, and apply IGDTS-distance to measure the deviation between the sample and the model. Finally, we propose an update scheme to capture the appearance changes of the tracked object and ensure that the model is updated correctly. Experimental results on several challenging image sequences show that the proposed tracker outperformance existing trackers.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Mining fairness in blockchain refers to the equality between the computational resources invested in mining and the block rewards received. There exists a dilemma where increasing the blockchain's transaction processing capacity damages mining fairness, consequently undermining its decentralization. This dilemma remains unresolved even with methods such as GHOST, indicating that mining fairness is an inherent bottleneck to the system's transaction processing capacity. Despite its significance, there have been insufficient studies quantitatively analyzing mining fairness. In this paper, we propose a method to calculate mining fairness. Initially, we approximate a complex blockchain network using a simple mathematical model, assuming that no more than two blocks are generated per round. Within this model, we quantitatively determine local mining fairness and derive several measures of global mining fairness based on local mining fairness. We validated that our calculation method accurately computes mining fairness in networks with a small number of miners. Furthermore, we analyzed various networks from the perspective of mining fairness.</li>

The novel model forecasts all variables (may in different type, such as continue variables, category variables, etc.) in power system at the same time and helps trade-off process between forecasting accuracy of single variable and variable-variable relations. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated samples. The predict results of electricity consumption of industrial enterprises by multi-variable adversarial time-series forecasting model show that the proposed approach is able to achieve better prediction accuracy. We also applied this model to real industrial enterprises power system data we gathered from several large industrial enterprises via advanced power monitors, and got impressed forecasting results.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We study the canonical fair clustering problem where each cluster is constrained to have close to population-level representation of each group. Despite significant attention, the salient issue of having incomplete knowledge about the group membership of each point has been superficially addressed. In this paper, we consider a setting where errors exist in the assigned group memberships. We introduce a simple and interpretable family of error models that require a small number of parameters to be given by the decision maker. We then present an algorithm for fair clustering with provable robustness guarantees. Our framework enables the decision maker to trade off between the robustness and the clustering quality. Unlike previous work, our algorithms are backed by worst-case theoretical guarantees. Finally, we empirically verify the performance of our algorithm on real world datasets and show its superior performance over existing baselines.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this research, we propose the first approach for integrating the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) with various pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for remote sensing (RS) scene classification tasks using the EuroSAT dataset. Our novel methodology, named KCN, aims to replace traditional Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) with KAN to enhance classification performance. We employed multiple CNN-based models, including VGG16, MobileNetV2, EfficientNet, ConvNeXt, ResNet101, and Vision Transformer (ViT), and evaluated their performance when paired with KAN. Our experiments demonstrated that KAN achieved high accuracy with fewer training epochs and parameters. Specifically, ConvNeXt paired with KAN showed the best performance, achieving 94% accuracy in the first epoch, which increased to 96% and remained consistent across subsequent epochs. The results indicated that KAN and MLP both achieved similar accuracy, with KAN performing slightly better in later epochs. By utilizing the EuroSAT dataset, we provided a robust testbed to investigate whether KAN is suitable for remote sensing classification tasks. Given that KAN is a novel algorithm, there is substantial capacity for further development and optimization, suggesting that KCN offers a promising alternative for efficient image analysis in the RS field.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce LongSkywork, a long-context Large Language Model (LLM) capable of processing up to 200,000 tokens. We provide a training recipe for efficiently extending context length of LLMs. We identify that the critical element in enhancing long-context processing capability is to incorporate a long-context SFT stage following the standard SFT stage. A mere 200 iterations can convert the standard SFT model into a long-context model. To reduce the effort in collecting and annotating data for long-context language modeling, we develop two novel methods for creating synthetic data. These methods are applied during the continual pretraining phase as well as the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) phase, greatly enhancing the training efficiency of our long-context LLMs. Our findings suggest that synthetic long-context SFT data can surpass the performance of data curated by humans to some extent. LongSkywork achieves outstanding performance on a variety of long-context benchmarks. In the Needle test, a benchmark for long-context information retrieval, our models achieved perfect accuracy across multiple context spans. Moreover, in realistic application scenarios, LongSkywork-13B demonstrates performance on par with Claude2.1, the leading long-context model, underscoring the effectiveness of our proposed methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the quest for super-human performance, Large Language Models (LLMs) have traditionally been tethered to human-annotated datasets and predefined training objectives-a process that is both labor-intensive and inherently limited. This paper presents a transformative approach: Autonomous Learning for LLMs, a self-sufficient learning paradigm that frees models from the constraints of human supervision. This method endows LLMs with the ability to self-educate through direct interaction with text, akin to a human reading and comprehending literature. Our approach eliminates the reliance on annotated data, fostering an Autonomous Learning environment where the model independently identifies and reinforces its knowledge gaps. Empirical results from our comprehensive experiments, which utilized a diverse array of learning materials and were evaluated against standard public quizzes, reveal that Autonomous Learning outstrips the performance of both Pre-training and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), as well as retrieval-augmented methods. These findings underscore the potential of Autonomous Learning to not only enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of LLM training but also to pave the way for the development of more advanced, self-reliant AI systems.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present a simple, modular, and generic method that upsamples coarse 3D models by adding geometric and appearance details. While generative 3D models now exist, they do not yet match the quality of their counterparts in image and video domains. We demonstrate that it is possible to directly repurpose existing (pretrained) video models for 3D super-resolution and thus sidestep the problem of the shortage of large repositories of high-quality 3D training models. We describe how to repurpose video upsampling models, which are not 3D consistent, and combine them with 3D consolidation to produce 3D-consistent results. As output, we produce high quality Gaussian Splat models, which are object centric and effective. Our method is category agnostic and can be easily incorporated into existing 3D workflows. We evaluate our proposed SuperGaussian on a variety of 3D inputs, which are diverse both in terms of complexity and representation (e.g., Gaussian Splats or NeRFs), and demonstrate that our simple method significantly improves the fidelity of the final 3D models.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Best practices of self-sovereign identity (SSI) are being intensively explored in academia and industry. Reusable solutions obtained from best practices are generalized as architectural patterns for systematic analysis and design reference, which significantly boosts productivity and increases the dependability of future implementations. For security-sensitive projects, architects make architectural decisions with careful consideration of security issues and solutions based on formal analysis and experiment results. In this paper, we propose a model-driven security analysis framework for analyzing architectural patterns of SSI systems with respect to a threat model built on our investigation of real-world security concerns. Our framework mechanizes a modeling language to formalize patterns and threats with security properties in temporal logic and automatically generates programs for verification via model checking. Besides, we present typical vulnerable patterns verified by SecureSSI, a standalone integrated development environment, integrating commonly used pattern and attacker models to practicalize our framework.</li>

These capabilities have garnered considerable interest in applications such as role-playing. However, the process of collecting individual role scripts (or profiles) data and manually evaluating the performance can be costly. We introduce a framework that uses prompts to leverage the state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs to construct role-playing dialogue datasets and evaluate the role-playing performance. Additionally, we employ recall-oriented evaluation Rouge-L metric to support the result of the LLM evaluator.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized how we interact with machines. However, this technological advancement has been paralleled by the emergence of "Mallas," malicious services operating underground that exploit LLMs for nefarious purposes. Such services create malware, phishing attacks, and deceptive websites, escalating the cyber security threats landscape. This paper delves into the proliferation of Mallas by examining the use of various pre-trained language models and their efficiency and vulnerabilities when misused. Building on a dataset from the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) program, it explores fine-tuning methodologies to generate code and explanatory text related to identified vulnerabilities. This research aims to shed light on the operational strategies and exploitation techniques of Mallas, leading to the development of more secure and trustworthy AI applications. The paper concludes by emphasizing the need for further research, enhanced safeguards, and ethical guidelines to mitigate the risks associated with the malicious application of LLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper proposes UHDformer, a general Transformer for Ultra-High-Definition (UHD) image restoration. UHDformer contains two learning spaces: (a) learning in high-resolution space and (b) learning in low-resolution space. The former learns multi-level high-resolution features and fuses low-high features and reconstructs the residual images, while the latter explores more representative features learning from the high-resolution ones to facilitate better restoration. To better improve feature representation in low-resolution space, we propose to build feature transformation from the high-resolution space to the low-resolution one. To that end, we propose two new modules: Dual-path Correlation Matching Transformation module (DualCMT) and Adaptive Channel Modulator (ACM). The DualCMT selects top C/r (r is greater or equal to 1 which controls the squeezing level) correlation channels from the max-pooling/mean-pooling high-resolution features to replace low-resolution ones in Transformers, which can effectively squeeze useless content to improve the feature representation in low-resolution space to facilitate better recovery. The ACM is exploited to adaptively modulate multi-level high-resolution features, enabling to provide more useful features to low-resolution space for better learning. Experimental results show that our UHDformer reduces about ninety-seven percent model sizes compared with most state-of-the-art methods while significantly improving performance under different training sets on 3 UHD image restoration tasks, including low-light image enhancement, image dehazing, and image deblurring.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Medicine is inherently a multimodal discipline. Medical images can reflect the pathological changes of cancer and tumors, while the expression of specific genes can influence their morphological characteristics. However, most deep learning models employed for these medical tasks are unimodal, making predictions using either image data or genomic data exclusively. In this paper, we propose a multimodal pre-training framework that jointly incorporates genomics and medical images for downstream tasks. To address the issues of high computational complexity and difficulty in capturing long-range dependencies in genes sequence modeling with MLP or Transformer architectures, we utilize Mamba to model these long genomic sequences. We aligns medical images and genes using a self-supervised contrastive learning approach which combines the Mamba as a genetic encoder and the Vision Transformer (ViT) as a medical image encoder. We pre-trained on the TCGA dataset using paired gene expression data and imaging data, and fine-tuned it for downstream tumor segmentation tasks. The results show that our model outperformed a wide range of related methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recently, researchers have proposed various deep learning methods to accurately detect infrared targets with the characteristics of indistinct shape and texture. Due to the limited variety of infrared datasets, training deep learning models with good generalization poses a challenge. To augment the infrared dataset, researchers employ data augmentation techniques, which often involve generating new images by combining images from different datasets. However, these methods are lacking in two respects. In terms of realism, the images generated by mixup-based methods lack realism and are difficult to effectively simulate complex real-world scenarios. In terms of diversity, compared with real-world scenes, borrowing knowledge from another dataset inherently has a limited diversity. Currently, the diffusion model stands out as an innovative generative approach. Large-scale trained diffusion models have a strong generative prior that enables real-world modeling of images to generate diverse and realistic images. In this paper, we propose Diff-Mosaic, a data augmentation method based on the diffusion model. This model effectively alleviates the challenge of diversity and realism of data augmentation methods via diffusion prior. Specifically, our method consists of two stages. Firstly, we introduce an enhancement network called Pixel-Prior, which generates highly coordinated and realistic Mosaic images by harmonizing pixels. In the second stage, we propose an image enhancement strategy named Diff-Prior. This strategy utilizes diffusion priors to model images in the real-world scene, further enhancing the diversity and realism of the images. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our approach significantly improves the performance of the detection network. The code is available at this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models have become the \textit{de-facto} approach for generating visual data, which are trained to match the distribution of the training dataset. In addition, we also want to control generation to fulfill desired properties such as alignment to a text description, which can be specified with a black-box reward function. Prior works fine-tune pretrained diffusion models to achieve this goal through reinforcement learning-based algorithms. Nonetheless, they suffer from issues including slow credit assignment as well as low quality in their generated samples. In this work, we explore techniques that do not directly maximize the reward but rather generate high-reward images with relatively high probability -- a natural scenario for the framework of generative flow networks (GFlowNets). To this end, we propose the \textbf{D}iffusion \textbf{A}lignment with \textbf{G}FlowNet (DAG) algorithm to post-train diffusion models with black-box property functions. Extensive experiments on Stable Diffusion and various reward specifications corroborate that our method could effectively align large-scale text-to-image diffusion models with given reward information.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we address the challenging problem of long-term 3D human motion generation. Specifically, we aim to generate a long sequence of smoothly connected actions from a stream of multiple sentences (i.e., paragraph). Previous long-term motion generating approaches were mostly based on recurrent methods, using previously generated motion chunks as input for the next step. However, this approach has two drawbacks: 1) it relies on sequential datasets, which are expensive; 2) these methods yield unrealistic gaps between motions generated at each step. To address these issues, we introduce simple yet effective T2LM, a continuous long-term generation framework that can be trained without sequential data. T2LM comprises two components: a 1D-convolutional VQVAE, trained to compress motion to sequences of latent vectors, and a Transformer-based Text Encoder that predicts a latent sequence given an input text. At inference, a sequence of sentences is translated into a continuous stream of latent vectors. This is then decoded into a motion by the VQVAE decoder; the use of 1D convolutions with a local temporal receptive field avoids temporal inconsistencies between training and generated sequences. This simple constraint on the VQ-VAE allows it to be trained with short sequences only and produces smoother transitions. T2LM outperforms prior long-term generation models while overcoming the constraint of requiring sequential data; it is also competitive with SOTA single-action generation models.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Zero-shot human skeleton-based action recognition aims to construct a model that can recognize actions outside the categories seen during training. Previous research has focused on aligning sequences' visual and semantic spatial distributions. However, these methods extract semantic features simply. They ignore that proper prompt design for rich and fine-grained action cues can provide robust representation space clustering. In order to alleviate the problem of insufficient information available for skeleton sequences, we design an information compensation learning framework from an information-theoretic perspective to improve zero-shot action recognition accuracy with a multi-granularity semantic interaction mechanism. Inspired by ensemble learning, we propose a multi-level alignment (MLA) approach to compensate information for action classes. MLA aligns multi-granularity embeddings with visual embedding through a multi-head scoring mechanism to distinguish semantically similar action names and visually similar actions. Furthermore, we introduce a new loss function sampling method to obtain a tight and robust representation. Finally, these multi-granularity semantic embeddings are synthesized to form a proper decision surface for classification. Significant action recognition performance is achieved when evaluated on the challenging NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and PKU-MMD benchmarks and validate that multi-granularity semantic features facilitate the differentiation of action clusters with similar visual features.</li>

Our system is fully unsupervised. It leverages a graph-based clustering approach to predict mappings between unknown word usages and dictionary entries for Subtask 1, and generates dictionary-like definitions for those novel word usages through the state-of-the-art Large Language Models such as GPT-4 and LLaMA-3 for Subtask 2. In Subtask 1, our system outperforms the baseline system by a large margin, and it offers interpretability for the mapping results by distinguishing between matched and unmatched (novel) word usages through our graph-based clustering approach. Our system ranks first in Finnish and German, and ranks second in Russian on the Subtask 2 test-phase leaderboard. These results show the potential of our system in managing dictionary entries, particularly for updating dictionaries to include novel sense entries.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We establish a new model-agnostic optimization framework for out-of-distribution generalization via multicalibration, a criterion that ensures a predictor is calibrated across a family of overlapping groups. Multicalibration is shown to be associated with robustness of statistical inference under covariate shift. We further establish a link between multicalibration and robustness for prediction tasks both under and beyond covariate shift. We accomplish this by extending multicalibration to incorporate grouping functions that consider covariates and labels jointly. This leads to an equivalence of the extended multicalibration and invariance, an objective for robust learning in existence of concept shift. We show a linear structure of the grouping function class spanned by density ratios, resulting in a unifying framework for robust learning by designing specific grouping functions. We propose MC-Pseudolabel, a post-processing algorithm to achieve both extended multicalibration and out-of-distribution generalization. The algorithm, with lightweight hyperparameters and optimization through a series of supervised regression steps, achieves superior performance on real-world datasets with distribution shift.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The recently released Segment Anything Model (SAM) has shown powerful zero-shot segmentation capabilities through a semi-automatic annotation setup in which the user can provide a prompt in the form of clicks or bounding boxes. There is growing interest around applying this to medical imaging, where the cost of obtaining expert annotations is high, privacy restrictions may limit sharing of patient data, and model generalisation is often poor. However, there are large amounts of inherent uncertainty in medical images, due to unclear object boundaries, low-contrast media, and differences in expert labelling style. Currently, SAM is known to struggle in a zero-shot setting to adequately annotate the contours of the structure of interest in medical images, where the uncertainty is often greatest, thus requiring significant manual correction. To mitigate this, we introduce \textbf{Sim}ulated Interaction for \textbf{S}egment \textbf{A}nything \textbf{M}odel (\textsc{\textbf{SimSAM}}), an approach that leverages simulated user interaction to generate an arbitrary number of candidate masks, and uses a novel aggregation approach to output the most compatible mask. Crucially, our method can be used during inference directly on top of SAM, without any additional training requirement. Quantitatively, we evaluate our method across three publicly available medical imaging datasets, and find that our approach leads to up to a 15.5\% improvement in contour segmentation accuracy compared to zero-shot SAM.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Pre-trained vision-language models, e.g., CLIP, have been successfully applied to zero-shot semantic segmentation. Existing CLIP-based approaches primarily utilize visual features from the last layer to align with text embeddings, while they neglect the crucial information in intermediate layers that contain rich object details. However, we find that directly aggregating the multi-level visual features weakens the zero-shot ability for novel classes. The large differences between the visual features from different layers make these features hard to align well with the text embeddings. We resolve this problem by introducing a series of independent decoders to align the multi-level visual features with the text embeddings in a cascaded way, forming a novel but simple framework named Cascade-CLIP. Our Cascade-CLIP is flexible and can be easily applied to existing zero-shot semantic segmentation methods. Experimental results show that our simple Cascade-CLIP achieves superior zero-shot performance on segmentation benchmarks, like COCO-Stuff, Pascal-VOC, and Pascal-Context.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the field of whole slide image (WSI) classification, multiple instance learning (MIL) serves as a promising approach, commonly decoupled into feature extraction and aggregation. In this paradigm, our observation reveals that discriminative embeddings are crucial for aggregation to the final prediction. Among all feature updating strategies, task-oriented ones can capture characteristics specifically for certain tasks. However, they can be prone to overfitting and contaminated by samples assigned with noisy labels. To address this issue, we propose a heuristic clustering-driven feature fine-tuning method (HC-FT) to enhance the performance of multiple instance learning by providing purified positive and hard negative samples. Our method first employs a well-trained MIL model to evaluate the confidence of patches. Then, patches with high confidence are marked as positive samples, while the remaining patches are used to identify crucial negative samples. After two rounds of heuristic clustering and selection, purified positive and hard negative samples are obtained to facilitate feature fine-tuning. The proposed method is evaluated on both CAMELYON16 and BRACS datasets, achieving an AUC of 97.13% and 85.85%, respectively, consistently outperforming all compared methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms typically parameterize the policy as a deep network that outputs either a deterministic action or a stochastic one modeled as a Gaussian distribution, hence restricting learning to a single behavioral mode. Meanwhile, diffusion models emerged as a powerful framework for multimodal learning. However, the use of diffusion policies in online RL is hindered by the intractability of policy likelihood approximation, as well as the greedy objective of RL methods that can easily skew the policy to a single mode. This paper presents Deep Diffusion Policy Gradient (DDiffPG), a novel actor-critic algorithm that learns from scratch multimodal policies parameterized as diffusion models while discovering and maintaining versatile behaviors. DDiffPG explores and discovers multiple modes through off-the-shelf unsupervised clustering combined with novelty-based intrinsic motivation. DDiffPG forms a multimodal training batch and utilizes mode-specific Q-learning to mitigate the inherent greediness of the RL objective, ensuring the improvement of the diffusion policy across all modes. Our approach further allows the policy to be conditioned on mode-specific embeddings to explicitly control the learned modes. Empirical studies validate DDiffPG's capability to master multimodal behaviors in complex, high-dimensional continuous control tasks with sparse rewards, also showcasing proof-of-concept dynamic online replanning when navigating mazes with unseen obstacles.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Originating from China's Shang Dynasty approximately 3,000 years ago, the Oracle Bone Script (OBS) is a cornerstone in the annals of linguistic history, predating many established writing systems. Despite the discovery of thousands of inscriptions, a vast expanse of OBS remains undeciphered, casting a veil of mystery over this ancient language. The emergence of modern AI technologies presents a novel frontier for OBS decipherment, challenging traditional NLP methods that rely heavily on large textual corpora, a luxury not afforded by historical languages. This paper introduces a novel approach by adopting image generation techniques, specifically through the development of Oracle Bone Script Decipher (OBSD). Utilizing a conditional diffusion-based strategy, OBSD generates vital clues for decipherment, charting a new course for AI-assisted analysis of ancient languages. To validate its efficacy, extensive experiments were conducted on an oracle bone script dataset, with quantitative results demonstrating the effectiveness of OBSD.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Adversarial training (AT) trains models using adversarial examples (AEs), which are natural images modified with specific perturbations to mislead the model. These perturbations are constrained by a predefined perturbation budget $\epsilon$ and are equally applied to each pixel within an image. However, in this paper, we discover that not all pixels contribute equally to the accuracy on AEs (i.e., robustness) and accuracy on natural images (i.e., accuracy). Motivated by this finding, we propose Pixel-reweighted AdveRsarial Training (PART), a new framework that partially reduces $\epsilon$ for less influential pixels, guiding the model to focus more on key regions that affect its outputs. Specifically, we first use class activation mapping (CAM) methods to identify important pixel regions, then we keep the perturbation budget for these regions while lowering it for the remaining regions when generating AEs. In the end, we use these pixel-reweighted AEs to train a model. PART achieves a notable improvement in accuracy without compromising robustness on CIFAR-10, SVHN and TinyImagenet-200, justifying the necessity to allocate distinct weights to different pixel regions in robust classification.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generating 3D visual scenes is at the forefront of visual generative AI, but current 3D generation techniques struggle with generating scenes with multiple high-resolution objects. Here we introduce Lay-A-Scene, which solves the task of Open-set 3D Object Arrangement, effectively arranging unseen objects. Given a set of 3D objects, the task is to find a plausible arrangement of these objects in a scene. We address this task by leveraging pre-trained text-to-image models. We personalize the model and explain how to generate images of a scene that contains multiple predefined objects without neglecting any of them. Then, we describe how to infer the 3D poses and arrangement of objects from a 2D generated image by finding a consistent projection of objects onto the 2D scene. We evaluate the quality of Lay-A-Scene using 3D objects from Objaverse and human raters and find that it often generates coherent and feasible 3D object arrangements.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As conventional topic models rely on word co-occurrence to infer latent topics, topic modeling for short texts has been a long-standing challenge. Large Language Models (LLMs) can potentially overcome this challenge by contextually learning the semantics of words via pretraining. This paper studies two approaches, parallel prompting and sequential prompting, to use LLMs for topic modeling. Due to the input length limitations, LLMs cannot process many texts at once. By splitting the texts into smaller subsets and processing them parallelly or sequentially, an arbitrary number of texts can be handled by LLMs. Experimental results demonstrated that our methods can identify more coherent topics than existing ones while maintaining the diversity of the induced topics. Furthermore, we found that the inferred topics adequately covered the input texts, while hallucinated topics were hardly generated.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The robustness of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is vital to modern AI-driven systems. It can be quantified by formal verification by providing a certified lower bound, within which any perturbation does not alter the original input's classification result. It is challenging due to nonlinear components, such as MaxPool. At present, many verification methods are sound but risk losing some precision to enhance efficiency and scalability, and thus, a certified lower bound is a crucial criterion for evaluating the performance of verification tools. In this paper, we present MaxLin, a robustness verifier for MaxPool-based CNNs with tight linear approximation. By tightening the linear approximation of the MaxPool function, we can certify larger certified lower bounds of CNNs. We evaluate MaxLin with open-sourced benchmarks, including LeNet and networks trained on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Tiny ImageNet datasets. The results show that MaxLin outperforms state-of-the-art tools with up to 110.60% improvement regarding the certified lower bound and 5.13 $\times$ speedup for the same neural networks.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving technology, there is a growing need for enhanced safety and efficiency in the automatic environmental perception of vehicles during their operation. In modern vehicle setups, cameras and mmWave radar (radar), being the most extensively employed sensors, demonstrate complementary characteristics, inherently rendering them conducive to fusion and facilitating the achievement of both robust performance and cost-effectiveness. This paper focuses on a comprehensive survey of radar-vision (RV) fusion based on deep learning methods for 3D object detection in autonomous driving. We offer a comprehensive overview of each RV fusion category, specifically those employing region of interest (ROI) fusion and end-to-end fusion strategies. As the most promising fusion strategy at present, we provide a deeper classification of end-to-end fusion methods, including those 3D bounding box prediction based and BEV based approaches. Moreover, aligning with recent advancements, we delineate the latest information on 4D radar and its cutting-edge applications in autonomous vehicles (AVs). Finally, we present the possible future trends of RV fusion and summarize this paper.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Graph-Level Anomaly Detection (GLAD) aims to distinguish anomalous graphs within a graph dataset. However, current methods are constrained by their receptive fields, struggling to learn global features within the graphs. Moreover, most contemporary methods are based on spatial domain and lack exploration of spectral characteristics. In this paper, we propose a multi-perspective hybrid graph-level anomaly detector namely GLADformer, consisting of two key modules. Specifically, we first design a Graph Transformer module with global spectrum enhancement, which ensures balanced and resilient parameter distributions by fusing global features and spectral distribution characteristics. Furthermore, to uncover local anomalous attributes, we customize a band-pass spectral GNN message passing module that further enhances the model's generalization capability. Through comprehensive experiments on ten real-world datasets from multiple domains, we validate the effectiveness and robustness of GLADformer. This demonstrates that GLADformer outperforms current state-of-the-art models in graph-level anomaly detection, particularly in effectively capturing global anomaly representations and spectral characteristics.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Accurately predicting future pedestrian trajectories is crucial across various domains. Due to the uncertainty in future pedestrian trajectories, it is important to learn complex spatio-temporal representations in multi-agent scenarios. To address this, we propose a novel Cross-Correction Framework (CCF) to learn spatio-temporal representations of pedestrian trajectories better. Our framework consists of two trajectory prediction models, known as subnets, which share the same architecture and are trained with both cross-correction loss and trajectory prediction loss. Cross-correction leverages the learning from both subnets and enables them to refine their underlying representations of trajectories through a mutual correction mechanism. Specifically, we use the cross-correction loss to learn how to correct each other through an inter-subnet interaction. To induce diverse learning among the subnets, we use the transformed observed trajectories produced by a neural network as input to one subnet and the original observed trajectories as input to the other subnet. We utilize transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture for each subnet to capture motion and social interaction among pedestrians. The encoder of the transformer captures motion patterns in trajectories, while the decoder focuses on pedestrian interactions with neighbors. Each subnet performs the primary task of predicting future trajectories (a regression task) along with the secondary task of classifying the predicted trajectories (a classification task). Extensive experiments on real-world benchmark datasets such as ETH-UCY and SDD demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed framework, CCF, in precisely predicting pedestrian future trajectories. We also conducted several ablation experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of various modules and loss functions used in our approach.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Creating 3D assets from single-view images is a complex task that demands a deep understanding of the world. Recently, feed-forward 3D generative models have made significant progress by training large reconstruction models on extensive 3D datasets, with triplanes being the preferred 3D geometry representation. However, effectively utilizing the geometric priors of triplanes, while minimizing artifacts caused by generated inconsistent multi-view images, remains a challenge. In this work, we present \textbf{Fre}quency modulat\textbf{e}d tri\textbf{plane} (\textbf{Freeplane}), a simple yet effective method to improve the generation quality of feed-forward models without additional training. We first analyze the role of triplanes in feed-forward methods and find that the inconsistent multi-view images introduce high-frequency artifacts on triplanes, leading to low-quality 3D meshes. Based on this observation, we propose strategically filtering triplane features and combining triplanes before and after filtering to produce high-quality textured meshes. These techniques incur no additional cost and can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained feed-forward models to enhance their robustness against the inconsistency of generated multi-view images. Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that our method improves the performance of feed-forward models by simply modulating triplanes. All you need is to modulate the triplanes during inference.</li>

Existing assessments predominantly focus on problem-solving from the examinee perspective, overlooking a dual perspective of examiner regarding error identification and correction. From the examiner perspective, we define four evaluation tasks for error identification and correction along with a new dataset with annotated error types and steps. We also design diverse prompts to thoroughly evaluate eleven representative LLMs. Our principal findings indicate that GPT-4 outperforms all models, while open-source model LLaMA-2-7B demonstrates comparable abilities to closed-source models GPT-3.5 and Gemini Pro. Notably, calculation error proves the most challenging error type. Moreover, prompting LLMs with the error types can improve the average correction accuracy by 47.9\%. These results reveal potential directions for developing the mathematical reasoning abilities of LLMs. Our code and dataset is available on this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We observe that current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods suffer from the performance imbalance issue when performing multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL) tasks. While these methods may achieve impressive performance on average, they perform extremely poorly on a few tasks. To address this, we propose a new and effective method called STARS, which consists of two novel strategies: a shared-unique feature extractor and task-aware prioritized sampling. First, the shared-unique feature extractor learns both shared and task-specific features to enable better synergy of knowledge between different tasks. Second, the task-aware sampling strategy is combined with the prioritized experience replay for efficient learning on tasks with poor performance. The effectiveness and stability of our STARS are verified through experiments on the mainstream Meta-World benchmark. From the results, our STARS statistically outperforms current SOTA methods and alleviates the performance imbalance issue. Besides, we visualize the learned features to support our claims and enhance the interpretability of STARS.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Probabilistic Circuits (PCs) are a general framework for tractable deep generative models, which support exact and efficient probabilistic inference on their learned distributions. Recent modeling and training advancements have enabled their application to complex real-world tasks. However, the time and memory inefficiency of existing PC implementations hinders further scaling up. This paper proposes PyJuice, a general GPU implementation design for PCs that improves prior art in several regards. Specifically, PyJuice is 1-2 orders of magnitude faster than existing systems (including very recent ones) at training large-scale PCs. Moreover, PyJuice consumes 2-5x less GPU memory, which enables us to train larger models. At the core of our system is a compilation process that converts a PC into a compact representation amenable to efficient block-based parallelization, which significantly reduces IO and makes it possible to leverage Tensor Cores available in modern GPUs. Empirically, PyJuice can be used to improve state-of-the-art PCs trained on image (e.g., ImageNet32) and language (e.g., WikiText, CommonGen) datasets. We further establish a new set of baselines on natural image and language datasets by benchmarking existing PC structures but with much larger sizes and more training epochs, with the hope of incentivizing future research.

However, designing effective evolving methods for instruction evolution requires substantial human expertise. This paper proposes Auto Evol-Instruct, an end-to-end framework that evolves instruction datasets using large language models without any human effort. The framework automatically analyzes and summarizes suitable evolutionary strategies for the given instruction data and iteratively improves the evolving method based on issues exposed during the instruction evolution process. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the best method optimized by Auto Evol-Instruct outperforms human-designed methods on various benchmarks, including MT-Bench, AlpacaEval, GSM8K, and HumanEval.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability, diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Contrastive Analysis (CA) regards the problem of identifying patterns in images that allow distinguishing between a background (BG) dataset (i.e. healthy subjects) and a target (TG) dataset (i.e. unhealthy subjects). Recent works on this topic rely on variational autoencoders (VAE) or contrastive learning strategies to learn the patterns that separate TG samples from BG samples in a supervised manner. However, the dependency on target (unhealthy) samples can be challenging in medical scenarios due to their limited availability. Also, the blurred reconstructions of VAEs lack utility and interpretability. In this work, we redefine the CA task by employing a self-supervised contrastive encoder to learn a latent representation encoding only common patterns from input images, using samples exclusively from the BG dataset during training, and approximating the distribution of the target patterns by leveraging data augmentation techniques. Subsequently, we exploit state-of-the-art generative methods, i.e. diffusion models, conditioned on the learned latent representation to produce a realistic (healthy) version of the input image encoding solely the common patterns. Thorough validation on a facial image dataset and experiments across three brain MRI datasets demonstrate that conditioning the generative process of state-of-the-art generative methods with the latent representation from our self-supervised contrastive encoder yields improvements in the generated image quality and in the accuracy of image classification.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models have significantly advanced the field of generative modeling. However, training a diffusion model is computationally expensive, creating a pressing need to adapt off-the-shelf diffusion models for downstream generation tasks. Current fine-tuning methods focus on parameter-efficient transfer learning but overlook the fundamental transfer characteristics of diffusion models. In this paper, we investigate the transferability of diffusion models and observe a monotonous chain of forgetting trend of transferability along the reverse process. Based on this observation and novel theoretical insights, we present Diff-Tuning, a frustratingly simple transfer approach that leverages the chain of forgetting tendency. Diff-Tuning encourages the fine-tuned model to retain the pre-trained knowledge at the end of the denoising chain close to the generated data while discarding the other noise side. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate Diff-Tuning, including the transfer of pre-trained Diffusion Transformer models to eight downstream generations and the adaptation of Stable Diffusion to five control conditions with ControlNet. Diff-Tuning achieves a 26% improvement over standard fine-tuning and enhances the convergence speed of ControlNet by 24%. Notably, parameter-efficient transfer learning techniques for diffusion models can also benefit from Diff-Tuning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>defense, attack, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>State-of-the-art deep learning models for tabular data have recently achieved acceptable performance to be deployed in industrial settings. However, the robustness of these models remains scarcely explored. Contrary to computer vision, there are no effective attacks to properly evaluate the adversarial robustness of deep tabular models due to intrinsic properties of tabular data, such as categorical features, immutability, and feature relationship constraints. To fill this gap, we first propose CAPGD, a gradient attack that overcomes the failures of existing gradient attacks with adaptive mechanisms. This new attack does not require parameter tuning and further degrades the accuracy, up to 81% points compared to the previous gradient attacks. Second, we design CAA, an efficient evasion attack that combines our CAPGD attack and MOEVA, the best search-based attack. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our attacks on five architectures and four critical use cases. Our empirical study demonstrates that CAA outperforms all existing attacks in 17 over the 20 settings, and leads to a drop in the accuracy by up to 96.1% points and 21.9% points compared to CAPGD and MOEVA respectively while being up to five times faster than MOEVA. Given the effectiveness and efficiency of our new attacks, we argue that they should become the minimal test for any new defense or robust architectures in tabular machine learning.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Pre-trained diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in synthesizing images across a wide range of scenarios with customizable prompts, indicating their effective capacity to capture universal features. Motivated by this, our study delves into the utilization of the implicit knowledge embedded within diffusion models to address challenges in cross-domain semantic segmentation. This paper investigates the approach that leverages the sampling and fusion techniques to harness the features of diffusion models efficiently. Contrary to the simplistic migration applications characterized by prior research, our finding reveals that the multi-step diffusion process inherent in the diffusion model manifests more robust semantic features. We propose DIffusion Feature Fusion (DIFF) as a backbone use for extracting and integrating effective semantic representations through the diffusion process. By leveraging the strength of text-to-image generation capability, we introduce a new training framework designed to implicitly learn posterior knowledge from it. Through rigorous evaluation in the contexts of domain generalization semantic segmentation, we establish that our methodology surpasses preceding approaches in mitigating discrepancies across distinct domains and attains the state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmark. Within the synthetic-to-real (syn-to-real) context, our method significantly outperforms ResNet-based and transformer-based backbone methods, achieving an average improvement of $3.84\%$ mIoU across various datasets. The implementation code will be released soon.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>AI-generated faces have enriched human life, such as entertainment, education, and art. However, they also pose misuse risks. Therefore, detecting AI-generated faces becomes crucial, yet current detectors show biased performance across different demographic groups. Mitigating biases can be done by designing algorithmic fairness methods, which usually require demographically annotated face datasets for model training. However, no existing dataset comprehensively encompasses both demographic attributes and diverse generative methods, which hinders the development of fair detectors for AI-generated faces. In this work, we introduce the AI-Face dataset, the first million-scale demographically annotated AI-generated face image dataset, including real faces, faces from deepfake videos, and faces generated by Generative Adversarial Networks and Diffusion Models. Based on this dataset, we conduct the first comprehensive fairness benchmark to assess various AI face detectors and provide valuable insights and findings to promote the future fair design of AI face detectors.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Most works on gender bias focus on intrinsic bias -- removing traces of information about a protected group from the model's internal representation. However, these works are often disconnected from the impact of such debiasing on downstream applications, which is the main motivation for debiasing in the first place. In this work, we systematically test how methods for intrinsic debiasing affect neural machine translation models, by measuring the extrinsic bias of such systems under different design choices. We highlight three challenges and mismatches between the debiasing techniques and their end-goal usage, including the choice of embeddings to debias, the mismatch between words and sub-word tokens debiasing, and the effect on different target languages. We find that these considerations have a significant impact on downstream performance and the success of debiasing.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Despite the observable benefit of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in processing a large amount of textual medical data within a limited time for information retrieval, a handful of research efforts have been devoted to uncovering novel data-cleaning methods. Data cleaning in NLP is at the centre point for extracting validated information. Another observed limitation in the NLP domain is having limited medical corpora that provide answers to a given medical question. Realising the limitations and challenges from two perspectives, this research aims to clean a medical dataset using ensemble techniques and to develop a corpus. The corpora expect that it will answer the question based on the semantic relationship of corpus sequences. However, the data cleaning method in this research suggests that the ensemble technique provides the highest accuracy (94%) compared to the single process, which includes vectorisation, exploratory data analysis, and feeding the vectorised data. The second aim of having an adequate corpus was realised by extracting answers from the dataset. This research is significant in machine learning, specifically data cleaning and the medical sector, but it also underscores the importance of NLP in the medical field, where accurate and timely information extraction can be a matter of life and death. It establishes text data processing using NLP as a powerful tool for extracting valuable information like image data.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Point cloud compression has garnered significant interest in computer vision. However, existing algorithms primarily cater to human vision, while most point cloud data is utilized for machine vision tasks. To address this, we propose a point cloud compression framework that simultaneously handles both human and machine vision tasks. Our framework learns a scalable bit-stream, using only subsets for different machine vision tasks to save bit-rate, while employing the entire bit-stream for human vision tasks. Building on mainstream octree-based frameworks like VoxelContext-Net, OctAttention, and G-PCC, we introduce a new octree depth-level predictor. This predictor adaptively determines the optimal depth level for each octree constructed from a point cloud, controlling the bit-rate for machine vision tasks. For simpler tasks (\textit{e.g.}, classification) or objects/scenarios, we use fewer depth levels with fewer bits, saving bit-rate. Conversely, for more complex tasks (\textit{e.g}., segmentation) or objects/scenarios, we use deeper depth levels with more bits to enhance performance. Experimental results on various datasets (\textit{e.g}., ModelNet10, ModelNet40, ShapeNet, ScanNet, and KITTI) show that our point cloud compression approach improves performance for machine vision tasks without compromising human vision quality.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown remarkable performance in learning 3D scenes. However, NeRF exhibits vulnerability when confronted with distractors in the training images -- unexpected objects are present only within specific views, such as moving entities like pedestrians or birds. Excluding distractors during dataset construction is a straightforward solution, but without prior knowledge of their types and quantities, it becomes prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we propose PruNeRF, a segment-centric dataset pruning framework via 3D spatial consistency, that effectively identifies and prunes the distractors. We first examine existing metrics for measuring pixel-wise distraction and introduce Influence Functions for more accurate measurements. Then, we assess 3D spatial consistency using a depth-based reprojection technique to obtain 3D-aware distraction. Furthermore, we incorporate segmentation for pixel-to-segment refinement, enabling more precise identification. Our experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that PruNeRF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in robustness against distractors.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, interpretability, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) are routinely used in retrieval-augmented applications to orchestrate tasks and process inputs from users and other sources. These inputs, even in a single LLM interaction, can come from a variety of sources, of varying trustworthiness and provenance. This opens the door to prompt injection attacks, where the LLM receives and acts upon instructions from supposedly data-only sources, thus deviating from the user's original instructions. We define this as task drift, and we propose to catch it by scanning and analyzing the LLM's activations. We compare the LLM's activations before and after processing the external input in order to detect whether this input caused instruction drift. We develop two probing methods and find that simply using a linear classifier can detect drift with near perfect ROC AUC on an out-of-distribution test set. We show that this approach generalizes surprisingly well to unseen task domains, such as prompt injections, jailbreaks, and malicious instructions, without being trained on any of these attacks. Our setup does not require any modification of the LLM (e.g., fine-tuning) or any text generation, thus maximizing deployability and cost efficiency and avoiding reliance on unreliable model output. To foster future research on activation-based task inspection, decoding, and interpretability, we will release our large-scale TaskTracker toolkit, comprising a dataset of over 500K instances, representations from 4 SoTA language models, and inspection tools.</li>

Although algorithms developed many years ago are still being used, the emergence of quantum computing has prompted the search for new solutions. Tree parity machines have been put forward as a potential solution. However, they possess inherent shortcomings, one of which is the uneven distribution of values in the secured key obtained after the key agreement process, especially when on-binary vectors are used during the synchronization process. This paper introduces a novel algorithm designed to address this issue. The results demonstrate a substantial enhancement in the quality of the secured key obtained.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is essential when deploying machine learning models in open-world scenarios. Zero-shot OOD detection, requiring no training on in-distribution (ID) data, has been possible with the advent of vision-language models like CLIP. Existing methods build a text-based classifier with only closed-set labels. However, this largely restricts the inherent capability of CLIP to recognize samples from large and open label space. In this paper, we propose to tackle this constraint by leveraging the expert knowledge and reasoning capability of large language models (LLM) to Envision potential Outlier Exposure, termed EOE, without access to any actual OOD data. Owing to better adaptation to open-world scenarios, EOE can be generalized to different tasks, including far, near, and fine-grained OOD detection. Technically, we design (1) LLM prompts based on visual similarity to generate potential outlier class labels specialized for OOD detection, as well as (2) a new score function based on potential outlier penalty to distinguish hard OOD samples effectively. Empirically, EOE achieves state-of-the-art performance across different OOD tasks and can be effectively scaled to the ImageNet-1K dataset. The code is publicly available at: this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>To make medical datasets accessible without sharing sensitive patient information, we introduce a novel end-to-end approach for generative de-identification of dynamic medical imaging data. Until now, generative methods have faced constraints in terms of fidelity, spatio-temporal coherence, and the length of generation, failing to capture the complete details of dataset distributions. We present a model designed to produce high-fidelity, long and complete data samples with near-real-time efficiency and explore our approach on a challenging task: generating echocardiogram videos. We develop our generation method based on diffusion models and introduce a protocol for medical video dataset anonymization. As an exemplar, we present EchoNet-Synthetic, a fully synthetic, privacy-compliant echocardiogram dataset with paired ejection fraction labels. As part of our de-identification protocol, we evaluate the quality of the generated dataset and propose to use clinical downstream tasks as a measurement on top of widely used but potentially biased image quality metrics. Experimental outcomes demonstrate that EchoNet-Synthetic achieves comparable dataset fidelity to the actual dataset, effectively supporting the ejection fraction regression task.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Following the enactment of the UN Regulation, substantial efforts have been directed toward implementing intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPSs) and vulnerability analysis in Controller Area Network (CAN). However, Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) J1939 protocol, despite its extensive application in camping cars and commercial vehicles, has seen limited vulnerability identification, which raises significant safety concerns in the event of security breaches. In this research, we explore and demonstrate attack techniques specific to SAE J1939 communication protocol. We introduce 14 attack scenarios, enhancing the discourse with seven scenarios recognized in the previous research and unveiling seven novel scenarios through our elaborate study. To verify the feasibility of these scenarios, we leverage a sophisticated testbed that facilitates real-time communication and the simulation of attacks. Our testing confirms the successful execution of 11 scenarios, underscoring their imminent threat to commercial vehicle operations. Some attacks will be difficult to detect because they only inject a single message. These results highlight unique vulnerabilities within SAE J1939 protocol, indicating the automotive cybersecurity community needs to address the identified risks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In recent years, diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in the realm of high-quality image generation, garnering increased attention. This surge in interest is paralleled by a growing concern over the security threats associated with diffusion models, largely attributed to their susceptibility to malicious exploitation. Notably, recent research has brought to light the vulnerability of diffusion models to backdoor attacks, enabling the generation of specific target images through corresponding triggers. However, prevailing backdoor attack methods rely on manually crafted trigger generation functions, often manifesting as discernible patterns incorporated into input noise, thus rendering them susceptible to human detection. In this paper, we present an innovative and versatile optimization framework designed to acquire invisible triggers, enhancing the stealthiness and resilience of inserted backdoors. Our proposed framework is applicable to both unconditional and conditional diffusion models, and notably, we are the pioneers in demonstrating the backdooring of diffusion models within the context of text-guided image editing and inpainting pipelines. Moreover, we also show that the backdoors in the conditional generation can be directly applied to model watermarking for model ownership verification, which further boosts the significance of the proposed framework. Extensive experiments on various commonly used samplers and datasets verify the efficacy and stealthiness of the proposed framework. Our code is publicly available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Training deep neural networks requires significant computational resources and large datasets that are often confidential or expensive to collect. As a result, owners tend to protect their models by allowing access only via an API. Many works demonstrated the possibility of stealing such protected models by repeatedly querying the API. However, to date, research has predominantly focused on stealing classification models, for which a very large number of queries has been found necessary. In this paper, we study the possibility of stealing image-to-image models. Surprisingly, we find that many such models can be stolen with as little as a single, small-sized, query image using simple distillation. We study this phenomenon on a wide variety of model architectures, datasets, and tasks, including denoising, deblurring, deraining, super-resolution, and biological image-to-image translation. Remarkably, we find that the vulnerability to stealing attacks is shared by CNNs and by models with attention mechanisms, and that stealing is commonly possible even without knowing the architecture of the target model.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper concerns the problem of aligning samples from large language models to human preferences using best-of-$n$ sampling, where we draw $n$ samples, rank them, and return the best one. We consider two fundamental problems. First: what is the relationship between best-of-$n$ and approaches to alignment that train LLMs to output samples with a high expected reward (e.g., RLHF or DPO)? To answer this, we embed both the best-of-$n$ distribution and the sampling distributions learned by alignment procedures in a common class of tiltings of the base LLM distribution. We then show that, within this class, best-of-$n$ is essentially optimal in terms of the trade-off between win-rate against the base model vs KL distance from the base model. That is, best-of-$n$ is the best choice of alignment distribution if the goal is to maximize win rate. However, best-of-$n$ requires drawing $n$ samples for each inference, a substantial cost. To avoid this, the second problem we consider is how to fine-tune a LLM to mimic the best-of-$n$ sampling distribution. We derive BoNBoN Alignment to achieve this by exploiting the special structure of the best-of-$n$ distribution. Experiments show that BoNBoN alignment yields substantial improvements in producing a model that is preferred to the base policy while minimally affecting off-target aspects.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid development of machine learning and deep learning has introduced increasingly complex optimization challenges that must be addressed. Indeed, training modern, advanced models has become difficult to implement without leveraging multiple computing nodes in a distributed environment. Distributed optimization is also fundamental to emerging fields such as federated learning. Specifically, there is a need to organize the training process to minimize the time lost due to communication. A widely used and extensively researched technique to mitigate the communication bottleneck involves performing local training before communication. This approach is the focus of our paper. Concurrently, adaptive methods that incorporate scaling, notably led by Adam, have gained significant popularity in recent years. Therefore, this paper aims to merge the local training technique with the adaptive approach to develop efficient distributed learning methods. We consider the classical Local SGD method and enhance it with a scaling feature. A crucial aspect is that the scaling is described generically, allowing us to analyze various approaches, including Adam, RMSProp, and OASIS, in a unified manner. In addition to theoretical analysis, we validate the performance of our methods in practice by training a neural network.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>A dramatic influx of diffusion-generated images has marked recent years, posing unique challenges to current detection technologies. While the task of identifying these images falls under binary classification, a seemingly straightforward category, the computational load is significant when employing the "reconstruction then compare" technique. This approach, known as DIRE (Diffusion Reconstruction Error), not only identifies diffusion-generated images but also detects those produced by GANs, highlighting the technique's broad applicability. To address the computational challenges and improve efficiency, we propose distilling the knowledge embedded in diffusion models to develop rapid deepfake detection models. Our approach, aimed at creating a small, fast, cheap, and lightweight diffusion synthesized deepfake detector, maintains robust performance while significantly reducing operational demands. Maintaining performance, our experimental results indicate an inference speed 3.2 times faster than the existing DIRE framework. This advance not only enhances the practicality of deploying these systems in real-world settings but also paves the way for future research endeavors that seek to leverage diffusion model knowledge.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Bike-sharing systems play a crucial role in easing traffic congestion and promoting healthier lifestyles. However, ensuring their reliability and user acceptance requires effective strategies for rebalancing bikes. This study introduces a novel approach to address the real-time rebalancing problem with a fleet of vehicles. It employs a dual policy reinforcement learning algorithm that decouples inventory and routing decisions, enhancing realism and efficiency compared to previous methods where both decisions were made simultaneously. We first formulate the inventory and routing subproblems as a multi-agent Markov Decision Process within a continuous time framework. Subsequently, we propose a DQN-based dual policy framework to jointly estimate the value functions, minimizing the lost demand. To facilitate learning, a comprehensive simulator is applied to operate under a first-arrive-first-serve rule, which enables the computation of immediate rewards across diverse demand scenarios. We conduct extensive experiments on various datasets generated from historical real-world data, affected by both temporal and weather factors. Our proposed algorithm demonstrates significant performance improvements over previous baseline methods. It offers valuable practical insights for operators and further explores the incorporation of reinforcement learning into real-world dynamic programming problems, paving the way for more intelligent and robust urban mobility solutions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent generalist vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities across diverse multimodal tasks. However, these models still struggle with fine-grained object-level understanding and grounding. In terms of modeling, existing VLMs implicitly align text tokens with image patch tokens, which is ineffective for embedding alignment at the same granularity and inevitably introduces noisy spurious background features. Additionally, these models struggle when generalizing to unseen visual concepts and may not be reliable for domain-specific tasks without further fine-tuning. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method to prompt large language models with in-context visual object vectors, thereby enabling controllable object-level reasoning. This eliminates the necessity of fusing a lengthy array of image patch features and significantly speeds up training. Furthermore, we propose region-level retrieval using our object representations, facilitating rapid adaptation to new objects without additional training. Our experiments reveal that our method achieves competitive referring object classification and captioning performance, while also offering zero-shot generalization and robustness to visually challenging contexts.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Do neural networks learn to implement algorithms such as look-ahead or search "in the wild"? Or do they rely purely on collections of simple heuristics? We present evidence of learned look-ahead in the policy network of Leela Chess Zero, the currently strongest neural chess engine. We find that Leela internally represents future optimal moves and that these representations are crucial for its final output in certain board states. Concretely, we exploit the fact that Leela is a transformer that treats every chessboard square like a token in language models, and give three lines of evidence (1) activations on certain squares of future moves are unusually important causally; (2) we find attention heads that move important information "forward and backward in time," e.g., from squares of future moves to squares of earlier ones; and (3) we train a simple probe that can predict the optimal move 2 turns ahead with 92% accuracy (in board states where Leela finds a single best line). These findings are an existence proof of learned look-ahead in neural networks and might be a step towards a better understanding of their capabilities.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We developed a novel reservoir characterization workflow that addresses reservoir history matching by coupling a physics-informed neural operator (PINO) forward model with a mixture of experts' approach, termed cluster classify regress (CCR). The inverse modelling is achieved via an adaptive Regularized Ensemble Kalman inversion (aREKI) method, ideal for rapid inverse uncertainty quantification during history matching. We parametrize unknown permeability and porosity fields for non-Gaussian posterior measures using a variational convolution autoencoder and a denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) exotic priors. The CCR works as a supervised model with the PINO surrogate to replicate nonlinear Peaceman well equations. The CCR's flexibility allows any independent machine-learning algorithm for each stage. The PINO reservoir surrogate's loss function is derived from supervised data loss and losses from the initial conditions and residual of the governing black oil PDE. The PINO-CCR surrogate outputs pressure, water, and gas saturations, along with oil, water, and gas production rates. The methodology was compared to a standard numerical black oil simulator for a waterflooding case on the Norne field, showing similar outputs. This PINO-CCR surrogate was then used in the aREKI history matching workflow, successfully recovering the unknown permeability, porosity and fault multiplier, with simulations up to 6000 times faster than conventional methods. Training the PINO-CCR surrogate on an NVIDIA H100 with 80G memory takes about 5 hours for 100 samples of the Norne field. This workflow is suitable for ensemble-based approaches, where posterior density sampling, given an expensive likelihood evaluation, is desirable for uncertainty quantification.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While Transformers underpin modern large language models (LMs), there is a growing list of alternative architectures with new capabilities, promises, and tradeoffs. This makes choosing the right LM architecture challenging. Recently-proposed $\textit{hybrid architectures}$ seek a best-of-all-worlds approach that reaps the benefits of all architectures. Hybrid design is difficult for two reasons: it requires manual expert-driven search, and new hybrids must be trained from scratch. We propose $\textbf{Manticore}$, a framework that addresses these challenges. Manticore $\textit{automates the design of hybrid architectures}$ while reusing pretrained models to create $\textit{pretrained}$ hybrids. Our approach augments ideas from differentiable Neural Architecture Search (NAS) by incorporating simple projectors that translate features between pretrained blocks from different architectures. We then fine-tune hybrids that combine pretrained models from different architecture families -- such as the GPT series and Mamba -- end-to-end. With Manticore, we enable LM selection without training multiple models, the construction of pretrained hybrids from existing pretrained models, and the ability to $\textit{program}$ pretrained hybrids to have certain capabilities. Manticore hybrids outperform existing manually-designed hybrids, achieve strong performance on Long Range Arena (LRA) tasks, and can improve on pretrained transformers and state space models.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Self-supervised learning (SSL) has potential for effective representation learning in medical imaging, but the choice of data augmentation is critical and domain-specific. It remains uncertain if general augmentation policies suit surgical applications. In this work, we automate the search for suitable augmentation policies through a new method called Dimensionality Driven Augmentation Search (DDA). DDA leverages the local dimensionality of deep representations as a proxy target, and differentiably searches for suitable data augmentation policies in contrastive learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of DDA in navigating a large search space and successfully identifying an appropriate data augmentation policy for laparoscopic surgery. We systematically evaluate DDA across three laparoscopic image classification and segmentation tasks, where it significantly improves over existing baselines. Furthermore, DDA's optimised set of augmentations provides insight into domain-specific dependencies when applying contrastive learning in medical applications. For example, while hue is an effective augmentation for natural images, it is not advantageous for laparoscopic images.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Video generation has made remarkable progress in recent years, especially since the advent of the video diffusion models. Many video generation models can produce plausible synthetic videos, e.g., Stable Video Diffusion (SVD). However, most video models can only generate low frame rate videos due to the limited GPU memory as well as the difficulty of modeling a large set of frames. The training videos are always uniformly sampled at a specified interval for temporal compression. Previous methods promote the frame rate by either training a video interpolation model in pixel space as a postprocessing stage or training an interpolation model in latent space for a specific base video model. In this paper, we propose a training-free video interpolation method for generative video diffusion models, which is generalizable to different models in a plug-and-play manner. We investigate the non-linearity in the feature space of video diffusion models and transform a video model into a self-cascaded video diffusion model with incorporating the designed hidden state correction modules. The self-cascaded architecture and the correction module are proposed to retain the temporal consistency between key frames and the interpolated frames. Extensive evaluations are preformed on multiple popular video models to demonstrate the effectiveness of the propose method, especially that our training-free method is even comparable to trained interpolation models supported by huge compute resources and large-scale datasets.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Perceptual hashing algorithms (PHAs) are utilized extensively for identifying illegal online content. Given their crucial role in sensitive applications, understanding their security strengths and weaknesses is critical. This paper compares three major PHAs deployed widely in practice: PhotoDNA, PDQ, and NeuralHash, and assesses their robustness against three typical attacks: normal image editing attacks, malicious adversarial attacks, and hash inversion attacks. Contrary to prevailing studies, this paper reveals that these PHAs exhibit resilience to black-box adversarial attacks when realistic constraints regarding the distortion and query budget are applied, attributed to the unique property of random hash variations. Moreover, this paper illustrates that original images can be reconstructed from the hash bits, raising significant privacy concerns. By comprehensively exposing their security vulnerabilities, this paper contributes to the ongoing efforts aimed at enhancing the security of PHAs for effective deployment.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In high-stakes domains like medical reasoning, AI assistants powered by large language models (LLMs) are yet to be reliable and safe. We identify a key obstacle towards reliability: existing LLMs are trained to answer any question, even with incomplete context in the prompt or insufficient parametric knowledge. We propose to change this paradigm to develop more careful LLMs that ask follow-up questions to gather necessary and sufficient information and respond reliably. We introduce MEDIQ, a framework to simulate realistic clinical interactions, which incorporates a Patient System and an adaptive Expert System. The Patient may provide incomplete information in the beginning; the Expert refrains from making diagnostic decisions when unconfident, and instead elicits missing details from the Patient via follow-up questions. To evaluate MEDIQ, we convert MEDQA and CRAFT-MD -- medical benchmarks for diagnostic question answering -- into an interactive setup. We develop a reliable Patient system and prototype several Expert systems, first showing that directly prompting state-of-the-art LLMs to ask questions degrades the quality of clinical reasoning, indicating that adapting LLMs to interactive information-seeking settings is nontrivial. We then augment the Expert with a novel abstention module to better estimate model confidence and decide whether to ask more questions, thereby improving diagnostic accuracy by 20.3%; however, performance still lags compared to an (unrealistic in practice) upper bound when full information is given upfront. Further analyses reveal that interactive performance can be improved by filtering irrelevant contexts and reformatting conversations. Overall, our paper introduces a novel problem towards LLM reliability, a novel MEDIQ framework, and highlights important future directions to extend the information-seeking abilities of LLM assistants in critical domains.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in proving discretization bounds for diffusion models. These works show that for essentially any data distribution, one can approximately sample in polynomial time given a sufficiently accurate estimate of its score functions at different noise levels. In this work, we propose a new discretization scheme for diffusion models inspired by Shen and Lee's randomized midpoint method for log-concave sampling~\cite{ShenL19}. We prove that this approach achieves the best known dimension dependence for sampling from arbitrary smooth distributions in total variation distance ($\widetilde O(d^{5/12})$ compared to $\widetilde O(\sqrt{d})$ from prior work). We also show that our algorithm can be parallelized to run in only $\widetilde O(\log^2 d)$ parallel rounds, constituting the first provable guarantees for parallel sampling with diffusion models. As a byproduct of our methods, for the well-studied problem of log-concave sampling in total variation distance, we give an algorithm and simple analysis achieving dimension dependence $\widetilde O(d^{5/12})$ compared to $\widetilde O(\sqrt{d})$ from prior work.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Monocular visual odometry is a key technology in a wide variety of autonomous systems. Relative to traditional feature-based methods, that suffer from failures due to poor lighting, insufficient texture, large motions, etc., recent learning-based SLAM methods exploit iterative dense bundle adjustment to address such failure cases and achieve robust accurate localization in a wide variety of real environments, without depending on domain-specific training data. However, despite its potential, learning-based SLAM still struggles with scenarios involving large motion and object dynamics. In this paper, we diagnose key weaknesses in a popular learning-based SLAM model (DROID-SLAM) by analyzing major failure cases on outdoor benchmarks and exposing various shortcomings of its optimization process. We then propose the use of self-supervised priors leveraging a frozen large-scale pre-trained monocular depth estimation to initialize the dense bundle adjustment process, leading to robust visual odometry without the need to fine-tune the SLAM backbone. Despite its simplicity, our proposed method demonstrates significant improvements on KITTI odometry, as well as the challenging DDAD benchmark. Code and pre-trained models will be released upon publication.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Lane detection (LD) is an essential component of autonomous driving systems, providing fundamental functionalities like adaptive cruise control and automated lane centering. Existing LD benchmarks primarily focus on evaluating common cases, neglecting the robustness of LD models against environmental illusions such as shadows and tire marks on the road. This research gap poses significant safety challenges since these illusions exist naturally in real-world traffic situations. For the first time, this paper studies the potential threats caused by these environmental illusions to LD and establishes the first comprehensive benchmark LanEvil for evaluating the robustness of LD against this natural corruption. We systematically design 14 prevalent yet critical types of environmental illusions (e.g., shadow, reflection) that cover a wide spectrum of real-world influencing factors in LD tasks. Based on real-world environments, we create 94 realistic and customizable 3D cases using the widely used CARLA simulator, resulting in a dataset comprising 90,292 sampled images. Through extensive experiments, we benchmark the robustness of popular LD methods using LanEvil, revealing substantial performance degradation (-5.37% Accuracy and -10.70% F1-Score on average), with shadow effects posing the greatest risk (-7.39% Accuracy). Additionally, we assess the performance of commercial auto-driving systems OpenPilot and Apollo through collaborative simulations, demonstrating that proposed environmental illusions can lead to incorrect decisions and potential traffic accidents. To defend against environmental illusions, we propose the Attention Area Mixing (AAM) approach using hard examples, which witness significant robustness improvement (+3.76%) under illumination effects. We hope our paper can contribute to advancing more robust auto-driving systems in the future. Website: this https URL.</li>

Furthermore, these systems generally struggle to identify novel, rapidly changing cyber threats. This paper delves into the potential of incorporating Neurosymbolic Artificial Intelligence (NSAI) into NIDS, combining deep learning's data-driven strengths with symbolic AI's logical reasoning to tackle the dynamic challenges in cybersecurity, which also includes detailed NSAI techniques introduction for cyber professionals to explore the potential strengths of NSAI in NIDS. The inclusion of NSAI in NIDS marks potential advancements in both the detection and interpretation of intricate network threats, benefiting from the robust pattern recognition of neural networks and the interpretive prowess of symbolic reasoning. By analyzing network traffic data types and machine learning architectures, we illustrate NSAI's distinctive capability to offer more profound insights into network behavior, thereby improving both detection performance and the adaptability of the system. This merging of technologies not only enhances the functionality of traditional NIDS but also sets the stage for future developments in building more resilient, interpretable, and dynamic defense mechanisms against advanced cyber threats. The continued progress in this area is poised to transform NIDS into a system that is both responsive to known threats and anticipatory of emerging, unseen ones.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Over the past few years, research on deep graph learning has shifted from static graphs to temporal graphs in response to real-world complex systems that exhibit dynamic behaviors. In practice, temporal graphs are formalized as an ordered sequence of static graph snapshots observed at discrete time points. Sequence models such as RNNs or Transformers have long been the predominant backbone networks for modeling such temporal graphs. Yet, despite the promising results, RNNs struggle with long-range dependencies, while transformers are burdened by quadratic computational complexity. Recently, state space models (SSMs), which are framed as discretized representations of an underlying continuous-time linear dynamical system, have garnered substantial attention and achieved breakthrough advancements in independent sequence modeling. In this work, we undertake a principled investigation that extends SSM theory to temporal graphs by integrating structural information into the online approximation objective via the adoption of a Laplacian regularization term. The emergent continuous-time system introduces novel algorithmic challenges, thereby necessitating our development of GraphSSM, a graph state space model for modeling the dynamics of temporal graphs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our GraphSSM framework across various temporal graph benchmarks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) utilizes retrieved texts to enhance large language models (LLMs). However, studies show that RAG is not consistently effective and can even mislead LLMs due to noisy or incorrect retrieved texts. This suggests that RAG possesses a duality including both benefit and detriment. Although many existing methods attempt to address this issue, they lack a theoretical explanation for the duality in RAG. The benefit and detriment within this duality remain a black box that cannot be quantified or compared in an explainable manner. This paper takes the first step in theoretically giving the essential explanation of benefit and detriment in RAG by: (1) decoupling and formalizing them from RAG prediction, (2) approximating the gap between their values by representation similarity and (3) establishing the trade-off mechanism between them, to make them explainable, quantifiable, and comparable. We demonstrate that the distribution difference between retrieved texts and LLMs' knowledge acts as double-edged sword, bringing both benefit and detriment. We also prove that the actual effect of RAG can be predicted at token level. Based on our theory, we propose a practical novel method, X-RAG, which achieves collaborative generation between pure LLM and RAG at token level to preserve benefit and avoid detriment. Experiments in real-world tasks based on LLMs including OPT, LLaMA-2, and Mistral show the effectiveness of our method and support our theoretical results.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Medical image analysis suffers from a shortage of data, whether annotated or not. This becomes even more pronounced when it comes to 3D medical images. Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) can partially ease this situation by using unlabeled data. However, most existing SSL methods can only make use of data in a single dimensionality (e.g. 2D or 3D), and are incapable of enlarging the training dataset by using data with differing dimensionalities jointly. In this paper, we propose a new cross-dimensional SSL framework based on a pseudo-3D transformation (CDSSL-P3D), that can leverage both 2D and 3D data for joint pre-training. Specifically, we introduce an image transformation based on the im2col algorithm, which converts 2D images into a format consistent with 3D data. This transformation enables seamless integration of 2D and 3D data, and facilitates cross-dimensional self-supervised learning for 3D medical image analysis. We run extensive experiments on 13 downstream tasks, including 2D and 3D classification and segmentation. The results indicate that our CDSSL-P3D achieves superior performance, outperforming other advanced SSL methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Various machine learning approaches have gained significant popularity for the automated classification of educational text to identify indicators of learning engagement -- i.e. learning engagement classification (LEC). LEC can offer comprehensive insights into human learning processes, attracting significant interest from diverse research communities, including Natural Language Processing (NLP), Learning Analytics, and Educational Data Mining. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have demonstrated remarkable performance in various NLP tasks. However, their comprehensive evaluation and improvement approaches in LEC tasks have not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we propose the Annotation Guidelines-based Knowledge Augmentation (AGKA) approach to improve LLMs. AGKA employs GPT 4.0 to retrieve label definition knowledge from annotation guidelines, and then applies the random under-sampler to select a few typical examples. Subsequently, we conduct a systematic evaluation benchmark of LEC, which includes six LEC datasets covering behavior classification (question and urgency level), emotion classification (binary and epistemic emotion), and cognition classification (opinion and cognitive presence). The study results demonstrate that AGKA can enhance non-fine-tuned LLMs, particularly GPT 4.0 and Llama 3 70B. GPT 4.0 with AGKA few-shot outperforms full-shot fine-tuned models such as BERT and RoBERTa on simple binary classification datasets. However, GPT 4.0 lags in multi-class tasks that require a deep understanding of complex semantic information. Notably, Llama 3 70B with AGKA is a promising combination based on open-source LLM, because its performance is on par with closed-source GPT 4.0 with AGKA. In addition, LLMs struggle to distinguish between labels with similar names in multi-class classification.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Do our facial expressions change when we speak over video calls? Given two unpaired sets of videos of people, we seek to automatically find spatio-temporal patterns that are distinctive of each set. Existing methods use discriminative approaches and perform post-hoc explainability analysis. Such methods are insufficient as they are unable to provide insights beyond obvious dataset biases, and the explanations are useful only if humans themselves are good at the task. Instead, we tackle the problem through the lens of generative domain translation: our method generates a detailed report of learned, input-dependent spatio-temporal features and the extent to which they vary between the domains. We demonstrate that our method can discover behavioral differences between conversing face-to-face (F2F) and on video-calls (VCs). We also show the applicability of our method on discovering differences in presidential communication styles. Additionally, we are able to predict temporal change-points in videos that decouple expressions in an unsupervised way, and increase the interpretability and usefulness of our model. Finally, our method, being generative, can be used to transform a video call to appear as if it were recorded in a F2F setting. Experiments and visualizations show our approach is able to discover a range of behaviors, taking a step towards deeper understanding of human behaviors.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The current variants of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), which include the original SAM and Medical SAM, still lack the capability to produce sufficiently accurate segmentation for medical images. In medical imaging contexts, it is not uncommon for human experts to rectify segmentations of specific test samples after SAM generates its segmentation predictions. These rectifications typically entail manual or semi-manual corrections employing state-of-the-art annotation tools. Motivated by this process, we introduce a novel approach that leverages the advantages of online machine learning to enhance Segment Anything (SA) during test time. We employ rectified annotations to perform online learning, with the aim of improving the segmentation quality of SA on medical images. To improve the effectiveness and efficiency of online learning when integrated with large-scale vision models like SAM, we propose a new method called Auxiliary Online Learning (AuxOL). AuxOL creates and applies a small auxiliary model (specialist) in conjunction with SAM (generalist), entails adaptive online-batch and adaptive segmentation fusion. Experiments conducted on eight datasets covering four medical imaging modalities validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our work proposes and validates a new, practical, and effective approach for enhancing SA on downstream segmentation tasks (e.g., medical image segmentation).</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, privacy, protect, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated Unlearning (FU) is gaining prominence for its capacity to eliminate influences of Federated Learning (FL) users' data from trained global FL models. A straightforward FU method involves removing the unlearned users and subsequently retraining a new global FL model from scratch with all remaining users, a process that leads to considerable overhead. To enhance unlearning efficiency, a widely adopted strategy employs clustering, dividing FL users into clusters, with each cluster maintaining its own FL model. The final inference is then determined by aggregating the majority vote from the inferences of these sub-models. This method confines unlearning processes to individual clusters for removing a user, thereby enhancing unlearning efficiency by eliminating the need for participation from all remaining users. However, current clustering-based FU schemes mainly concentrate on refining clustering to boost unlearning efficiency but overlook the potential information leakage from FL users' gradients, a privacy concern that has been extensively studied. Typically, integrating secure aggregation (SecAgg) schemes within each cluster can facilitate a privacy-preserving FU. Nevertheless, crafting a clustering methodology that seamlessly incorporates SecAgg schemes is challenging, particularly in scenarios involving adversarial users and dynamic users. In this connection, we systematically explore the integration of SecAgg protocols within the most widely used federated unlearning scheme, which is based on clustering, to establish a privacy-preserving FU framework, aimed at ensuring privacy while effectively managing dynamic user participation. Comprehensive theoretical assessments and experimental results show that our proposed scheme achieves comparable unlearning effectiveness, alongside offering improved privacy protection and resilience in the face of varying user participation.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The large scale usage of social media, combined with its significant impact, has made it increasingly important to understand it. In particular, identifying user communities, can be helpful for many downstream tasks. However, particularly when models are trained on past data and tested on future, doing this is difficult. In this paper, we hypothesize to take advantage of Large Language Models (LLMs), to better identify user communities. Due to the fact that many LLMs, such as ChatGPT, are fixed and must be treated as black-boxes, we propose an approach to better prompt them, by training a smaller LLM to do this. We devise strategies to train this smaller model, showing how it can improve the larger LLMs ability to detect communities. Experimental results show improvements on Reddit and Twitter data, on the tasks of community detection, bot detection, and news media profiling.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently seen significant advancements through integrating with Large Language Models (LLMs). The VLMs, which process image and text modalities simultaneously, have demonstrated the ability to learn and understand the interaction between images and texts across various multi-modal tasks. Reverse designing, which could be defined as a complex vision-language task, aims to predict the edits and their parameters, given a source image, an edited version, and an optional high-level textual edit description. This task requires VLMs to comprehend the interplay between the source image, the edited version, and the optional textual context simultaneously, going beyond traditional vision-language tasks. In this paper, we extend and fine-tune MiniGPT-4 for the reverse designing task. Our experiments demonstrate the extensibility of off-the-shelf VLMs, specifically MiniGPT-4, for more complex tasks such as reverse designing. Code is available at this \href{this https URL}</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Retriever Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have become pivotal in enhancing the capabilities of language models by incorporating external knowledge retrieval mechanisms. However, a significant challenge in deploying these systems in industry applications is the detection and mitigation of hallucinations: instances where the model generates information that is not grounded in the retrieved context. Addressing this issue is crucial for ensuring the reliability and accuracy of responses generated by large language models (LLMs) in diverse industry settings. Current hallucination detection techniques fail to deliver accuracy, low latency, and low cost simultaneously. We introduce Luna: a DeBERTA-large (440M) encoder, finetuned for hallucination detection in RAG settings. We demonstrate that Luna outperforms GPT-3.5 and commercial evaluation frameworks on the hallucination detection task, with 97% and 96% reduction in cost and latency, respectively. Luna is lightweight and generalizes across multiple industry verticals and out-of-domain data, making it an ideal candidate for industry LLM applications.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While recent advancements in speech language models have achieved significant progress, they face remarkable challenges in modeling the long acoustic sequences of neural audio codecs. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{G}enerative \textbf{P}re-trained \textbf{S}peech \textbf{T}ransformer (GPST), a hierarchical transformer designed for efficient speech language modeling. GPST quantizes audio waveforms into two distinct types of discrete speech representations and integrates them within a hierarchical transformer architecture, allowing for a unified one-stage generation process and enhancing Hi-Res audio generation capabilities. By training on large corpora of speeches in an end-to-end unsupervised manner, GPST can generate syntactically consistent speech with diverse speaker identities. Given a brief 3-second prompt, GPST can produce natural and coherent personalized speech, demonstrating in-context learning abilities. Moreover, our approach can be easily extended to spoken cross-lingual speech generation by incorporating multi-lingual semantic tokens and universal acoustic tokens. Experimental results indicate that GPST significantly outperforms the existing speech language models in terms of word error rate, speech quality, and speaker similarity.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Current methods of toxic language detection (TLD) typically rely on specific tokens to conduct decisions, which makes them suffer from lexical bias, leading to inferior performance and generalization. Lexical bias has both "useful" and "misleading" impacts on understanding toxicity. Unfortunately, instead of distinguishing between these impacts, current debiasing methods typically eliminate them indiscriminately, resulting in a degradation in the detection accuracy of the model. To this end, we propose a Counterfactual Causal Debiasing Framework (CCDF) to mitigate lexical bias in TLD. It preserves the "useful impact" of lexical bias and eliminates the "misleading impact". Specifically, we first represent the total effect of the original sentence and biased tokens on decisions from a causal view. We then conduct counterfactual inference to exclude the direct causal effect of lexical bias from the total effect. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the debiased TLD model incorporating CCDF achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and fairness compared to competitive baselines applied on several vanilla models. The generalization capability of our model outperforms current debiased models for out-of-distribution data.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text-driven image synthesis has made significant advancements with the development of diffusion models, transforming how visual content is generated from text prompts. Despite these advances, text-driven image editing, a key area in computer graphics, faces unique challenges. A major challenge is making simultaneous edits across multiple objects or attributes. Applying these methods sequentially for multi-aspect edits increases computational demands and efficiency losses. In this paper, we address these challenges with significant contributions. Our main contribution is the development of MultiEdits, a method that seamlessly manages simultaneous edits across multiple attributes. In contrast to previous approaches, MultiEdits not only preserves the quality of single attribute edits but also significantly improves the performance of multitasking edits. This is achieved through an innovative attention distribution mechanism and a multi-branch design that operates across several processing heads. Additionally, we introduce the PIE-Bench++ dataset, an expansion of the original PIE-Bench dataset, to better support evaluating image-editing tasks involving multiple objects and attributes simultaneously. This dataset is a benchmark for evaluating text-driven image editing methods in multifaceted scenarios. Dataset and code are available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Graph anomaly detection (GAD) is increasingly crucial in various applications, ranging from financial fraud detection to fake news detection. However, current GAD methods largely overlook the fairness problem, which might result in discriminatory decisions skewed toward certain demographic groups defined on sensitive attributes (e.g., gender, religion, ethnicity, etc.). This greatly limits the applicability of these methods in real-world scenarios in light of societal and ethical restrictions. To address this critical gap, we make the first attempt to integrate fairness with utility in GAD decision-making. Specifically, we devise a novel DisEntangle-based FairnEss-aware aNomaly Detection framework on the attributed graph, named DEFEND. DEFEND first introduces disentanglement in GNNs to capture informative yet sensitive-irrelevant node representations, effectively reducing societal bias inherent in graph representation learning. Besides, to alleviate discriminatory bias in evaluating anomalous nodes, DEFEND adopts a reconstruction-based anomaly detection, which concentrates solely on node attributes without incorporating any graph structure. Additionally, given the inherent association between input and sensitive attributes, DEFEND constrains the correlation between the reconstruction error and the predicted sensitive attributes. Our empirical evaluations on real-world datasets reveal that DEFEND performs effectively in GAD and significantly enhances fairness compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

However, diffusion models with neural networks inevitably make prediction errors, which leads to constraint violations such as unmet goals or collisions. This paper presents a novel constraint-aware diffusion model for trajectory optimization. We introduce a novel hybrid loss function for training that minimizes the constraint violation of diffusion samples compared to the groundtruth while recovering the original data distribution. Our model is demonstrated on tabletop manipulation and two-car reach-avoid problems, outperforming traditional diffusion models in minimizing constraint violations while generating samples close to locally optimal solutions.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent studies have shown that distributed machine learning is vulnerable to gradient inversion attacks, where private training data can be reconstructed by analyzing the gradients of the models shared in training. Previous attacks established that such reconstructions are possible using gradients from all parameters in the entire models. However, we hypothesize that most of the involved modules, or even their sub-modules, are at risk of training data leakage, and we validate such vulnerabilities in various intermediate layers of language models. Our extensive experiments reveal that gradients from a single Transformer layer, or even a single linear component with 0.54% parameters, are susceptible to training data leakage. Additionally, we show that applying differential privacy on gradients during training offers limited protection against the novel vulnerability of data disclosure.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Code Large Language Models (Code LLMs) have excelled at tasks like code completion but often miss deeper semantics such as execution effects and dynamic states. This paper aims to bridge the gap between Code LLMs' reliance on static text data and the need for thorough semantic understanding for complex tasks like debugging and program repair. We introduce a novel strategy to train Code LLMs with comprehensive semantics, encompassing high-level functional descriptions, local execution effects of individual statements, and overall input/output behavior, thereby linking static code text with dynamic execution states. We begin by collecting PyX, a clean code corpus of fully executable samples with functional descriptions and execution tracing. We propose training Code LLMs to write code and represent and reason about execution behaviors using natural language, mimicking human verbal debugging. This approach led to the development of SemCoder, a Code LLM with only 6.7B parameters, which shows competitive performance with GPT-3.5-turbo on code generation and execution reasoning tasks. SemCoder achieves 81.1% on HumanEval (GPT-3.5-turbo: 76.8%) and 54.5% on CRUXEval-I (GPT-3.5-turbo: 50.3%). We also study the effectiveness of SemCoder's monologue-style execution reasoning compared to concrete scratchpad reasoning, showing that our approach integrates semantics from multiple dimensions more smoothly. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of applying learned semantics to improve Code LLMs' debugging and self-refining capabilities.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Mobile device operation tasks are increasingly becoming a popular multi-modal AI application scenario. Current Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), constrained by their training data, lack the capability to function effectively as operation assistants. Instead, MLLM-based agents, which enhance capabilities through tool invocation, are gradually being applied to this scenario. However, the two major navigation challenges in mobile device operation tasks, task progress navigation and focus content navigation, are significantly complicated under the single-agent architecture of existing work. This is due to the overly long token sequences and the interleaved text-image data format, which limit performance. To address these navigation challenges effectively, we propose Mobile-Agent-v2, a multi-agent architecture for mobile device operation assistance. The architecture comprises three agents: planning agent, decision agent, and reflection agent. The planning agent generates task progress, making the navigation of history operations more efficient. To retain focus content, we design a memory unit that updates with task progress. Additionally, to correct erroneous operations, the reflection agent observes the outcomes of each operation and handles any mistakes accordingly. Experimental results indicate that Mobile-Agent-v2 achieves over a 30% improvement in task completion compared to the single-agent architecture of Mobile-Agent.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA), the challenge of limited dataset sizes hampers the development of robust and generalizable models. Conventional methods address this issue by utilizing large datasets to extract rich representations for IQA. Also, some approaches propose vision language models (VLM) based IQA, but the domain gap between generic VLM and IQA constrains their scalability. In this work, we propose a novel pretraining framework that constructs a generalizable representation for IQA by selectively extracting quality-related knowledge from VLM and leveraging the scalability of large datasets. Specifically, we carefully select optimal text prompts for five representative image quality attributes and use VLM to generate pseudo-labels. Numerous attribute-aware pseudo-labels can be generated with large image datasets, allowing our IQA model to learn rich representations about image quality. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple IQA datasets and exhibits remarkable generalization capabilities. Leveraging these strengths, we propose several applications, such as evaluating image generation models and training image enhancement models, demonstrating our model's real-world applicability. We will make the code available for access.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>What can we learn from the classics of Finnish literature by using computational emotion analysis? This article tries to answer this question by examining how computational methods of sentiment analysis can be used in the study of literary works in conjunction with a qualitative or more 'traditional' approach to literature and affect. We present and develop a simple but robust computational approach of affect analysis that uses a carefully curated emotion lexicon adapted to Finnish turn-of-the-century literary texts combined with word embeddings to map out the semantic emotional spaces of seminal works of Finnish literature. We focus our qualitative analysis on selected case studies: four works by Juhani Aho, Minna Canth, Maria Jotuni, and F. E. Sillanpää, but provide emotion arcs for a total of 975 Finnish novels. We argue that a computational analysis of a text's lexicon can be valuable in evaluating the large distribution of the emotional valence in a text and provide guidelines to help other researchers replicate our findings. We show that computational approaches have a place in traditional studies on affect in literature as a support tool for close-reading-based analyses, but also allowing for large-scale comparison between, for example, genres or national canons.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Modern recommender systems (RS) have profoundly enhanced user experience across digital platforms, yet they face significant threats from poisoning attacks. These attacks, aimed at manipulating recommendation outputs for unethical gains, exploit vulnerabilities in RS through injecting malicious data or intervening model training. This survey presents a unique perspective by examining these threats through the lens of an attacker, offering fresh insights into their mechanics and impacts. Concretely, we detail a systematic pipeline that encompasses four stages of a poisoning attack: setting attack goals, assessing attacker capabilities, analyzing victim architecture, and implementing poisoning strategies. The pipeline not only aligns with various attack tactics but also serves as a comprehensive taxonomy to pinpoint focuses of distinct poisoning attacks. Correspondingly, we further classify defensive strategies into two main categories: poisoning data filtering and robust training from the defender's perspective. Finally, we highlight existing limitations and suggest innovative directions for further exploration in this field.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) constitute a critical area of research in the study of Large Language Models (LLMs). Previous works have investigated the selection bias problem in MCQs within few-shot scenarios, in which the LLM's performance may be influenced by the presentation of answer choices, leaving the selection bias during Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) unexplored. In this paper, we reveal that selection bias persists in the SFT phase , primarily due to the LLM's inadequate Multiple Choice Symbol Binding (MCSB) ability. This limitation implies that the model struggles to associate the answer options with their corresponding symbols (e.g., A/B/C/D) effectively. To enhance the model's MCSB capability, we first incorporate option contents into the loss function and subsequently adjust the weights of the option symbols and contents, guiding the model to understand the option content of the current symbol. Based on this, we introduce an efficient SFT algorithm for MCQs, termed Point-wise Intelligent Feedback (PIF). PIF constructs negative instances by randomly combining the incorrect option contents with all candidate symbols, and proposes a point-wise loss to provide feedback on these negative samples into LLMs. Our experimental results demonstrate that PIF significantly reduces the model's selection bias by improving its MCSB capability. Remarkably, PIF exhibits a substantial enhancement in the accuracy for MCQs.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Transformer-based low-light enhancement methods have yielded promising performance by effectively capturing long-range dependencies in a global context. However, their elevated computational demand limits the scalability of multiple iterations in deep unfolding networks, and hence they have difficulty in flexibly balancing interpretability and distortion. To address this issue, we propose a novel Low-Light Enhancement method via relighting-guided Mamba with a deep unfolding network (LLEMamba), whose theoretical interpretability and fidelity are guaranteed by Retinex optimization and Mamba deep priors, respectively. Specifically, our LLEMamba first constructs a Retinex model with deep priors, embedding the iterative optimization process based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) within a deep unfolding network. Unlike Transformer, to assist the deep unfolding framework with multiple iterations, the proposed LLEMamba introduces a novel Mamba architecture with lower computational complexity, which not only achieves light-dependent global visual context for dark images during reflectance relight but also optimizes to obtain more stable closed-form solutions. Experiments on the benchmarks show that LLEMamba achieves superior quantitative evaluations and lower distortion visual results compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Video scene graph generation (VidSGG) has emerged as a transformative approach to capturing and interpreting the intricate relationships among objects and their temporal dynamics in video sequences. In this paper, we introduce the new AeroEye dataset that focuses on multi-object relationship modeling in aerial videos. Our AeroEye dataset features various drone scenes and includes a visually comprehensive and precise collection of predicates that capture the intricate relationships and spatial arrangements among objects. To this end, we propose the novel Cyclic Graph Transformer (CYCLO) approach that allows the model to capture both direct and long-range temporal dependencies by continuously updating the history of interactions in a circular manner. The proposed approach also allows one to handle sequences with inherent cyclical patterns and process object relationships in the correct sequential order. Therefore, it can effectively capture periodic and overlapping relationships while minimizing information loss. The extensive experiments on the AeroEye dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CYCLO model, demonstrating its potential to perform scene understanding on drone videos. Finally, the CYCLO method consistently achieves State-of-the-Art (SOTA) results on two in-the-wild scene graph generation benchmarks, i.e., PVSG and ASPIRe.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent progress in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has greatly enhanced the ability to model complex molecular structures for predicting properties. Nevertheless, molecular data encompasses more than just graph structures, including textual and visual information that GNNs do not handle well. To bridge this gap, we present an innovative framework that utilizes multimodal molecular data to extract insights from Large Language Models (LLMs). We introduce GALLON (Graph Learning from Large Language Model Distillation), a framework that synergizes the capabilities of LLMs and GNNs by distilling multimodal knowledge into a unified Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). This method integrates the rich textual and visual data of molecules with the structural analysis power of GNNs. Extensive experiments reveal that our distilled MLP model notably improves the accuracy and efficiency of molecular property predictions.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Jersey number recognition (JNR) has always been an important task in sports analytics. Improving recognition accuracy remains an ongoing challenge because images are subject to blurring, occlusion, deformity, and low resolution. Recent research has addressed these problems using number localization and optical character recognition. Some approaches apply player identification schemes to image sequences, ignoring the impact of human body rotation angles on jersey digit identification. Accurately predicting the number of jersey digits by using a multi-task scheme to recognize each individual digit enables more robust results. Based on the above considerations, this paper proposes a multi-task learning method called the angle-digit refine scheme (ADRS), which combines human body orientation angles and digit number clues to recognize athletic jersey numbers. Based on our experimental results, our approach increases inference information, significantly improving prediction accuracy. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, which can only handle a single type of sport, the proposed method produces a more diverse and practical JNR application. The incorporation of diverse types of team sports such as soccer, football, basketball, volleyball, and baseball into our dataset contributes greatly to generalized JNR in sports analytics. Our accuracy achieves 64.07% on Top-1 and 89.97% on Top-2, with corresponding F1 scores of 67.46% and 90.64%, respectively.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Accurate analysis of 3D myocardium deformation using high-resolution computerized tomography (CT) datasets with ground truth (GT) annotations is crucial for advancing cardiovascular imaging research. However, the scarcity of such datasets poses a significant challenge for developing robust myocardium deformation analysis models. To address this, we propose a novel approach to synthetic data generation for enriching cardiovascular imaging datasets. We introduce a synthetic data generation method, enriched with crucial GT 3D optical flow annotations. We outline the data preparation from a cardiac four-dimensional (4D) CT scan, selection of parameters, and the subsequent creation of synthetic data from the same or other sources of 3D cardiac CT data for training. Our work contributes to overcoming the limitations imposed by the scarcity of high-resolution CT datasets with precise annotations, thereby facilitating the development of accurate and reliable myocardium deformation analysis algorithms for clinical applications and diagnostics.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Gaussian Splatting (GS) has significantly elevated scene reconstruction efficiency and novel view synthesis (NVS) accuracy compared to Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), particularly for dynamic scenes. However, current 4D NVS methods, whether based on GS or NeRF, primarily rely on camera parameters provided by COLMAP and even utilize sparse point clouds generated by COLMAP for initialization, which lack accuracy as well are time-consuming. This sometimes results in poor dynamic scene representation, especially in scenes with large object movements, or extreme camera conditions e.g. small translations combined with large rotations. Some studies simultaneously optimize the estimation of camera parameters and scenes, supervised by additional information like depth, optical flow, etc. obtained from off-the-shelf models. Using this unverified information as ground truth can reduce robustness and accuracy, which does frequently occur for long monocular videos (with e.g. > hundreds of frames). We propose a novel approach that learns a high-fidelity 4D GS scene representation with self-calibration of camera parameters. It includes the extraction of 2D point features that robustly represent 3D structure, and their use for subsequent joint optimization of camera parameters and 3D structure towards overall 4D scene optimization. We demonstrate the accuracy and time efficiency of our method through extensive quantitative and qualitative experimental results on several standard benchmarks. The results show significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods for 4D novel view synthesis. The source code will be released soon at this https URL.</li>

Moreover, the proposed method integrates dynamic schema-aware augmented retrieval examples into prompts tailored for each specific inquiry, thereby extending and adapting advanced prompting techniques such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation. Evaluation findings on prominent event extraction benchmarks and results from a synthesized benchmark illustrate the method's superior performance compared to baseline approaches.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep learning models are widely recognized for their effectiveness in identifying medical image findings in disease classification. However, their limitations become apparent in the dynamic and ever-changing clinical environment, characterized by the continuous influx of newly annotated medical data from diverse sources. In this context, the need for continual learning becomes particularly paramount, not only to adapt to evolving medical scenarios but also to ensure the privacy of healthcare data. In our research, we emphasize the utilization of a network comprising expert classifiers, where a new expert classifier is added each time a new task is introduced. We present CTP, a task-id predictor that utilizes confidence scores, leveraging the probability distribution (logits) of the classifier to accurately determine the task-id at inference time. Logits are adjusted to ensure that classifiers yield a high-entropy distribution for data associated with tasks other than their own. By defining a noise region in the distribution and computing confidence scores, CTP achieves superior performance when compared to other relevant continual learning methods. Additionally, the performance of CTP can be further improved by providing it with a continuum of data at the time of inference.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we focus on resolving the problem of image outpainting, which aims to extrapolate the surrounding parts given the center contents of an image. Although recent works have achieved promising performance, the lack of versatility and customization hinders their practical applications in broader scenarios. Therefore, this work presents a novel image outpainting framework that is capable of customizing the results according to the requirement of users. First of all, we take advantage of a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that automatically extracts and organizes the corresponding textual descriptions of the masked and unmasked part of a given image. Accordingly, the obtained text prompts are introduced to endow our model with the capacity to customize the outpainting results. In addition, a special Cross-Attention module, namely Center-Total-Surrounding (CTS), is elaborately designed to enhance further the the interaction between specific space regions of the image and corresponding parts of the text prompts. Note that unlike most existing methods, our approach is very resource-efficient since it is just slightly fine-tuned on the off-the-shelf stable diffusion (SD) model rather than being trained from scratch. Finally, the experimental results on three commonly used datasets, i.e. Scenery, Building, and WikiArt, demonstrate our model significantly surpasses the SoTA methods. Moreover, versatile outpainting results are listed to show its customized ability.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While diffusion models have significantly advanced the quality of image generation, their capability to accurately and coherently render text within these images remains a substantial challenge. Conventional diffusion-based methods for scene text generation are typically limited by their reliance on an intermediate layout output. This dependency often results in a constrained diversity of text styles and fonts, an inherent limitation stemming from the deterministic nature of the layout generation phase. To address these challenges, this paper introduces SceneTextGen, a novel diffusion-based model specifically designed to circumvent the need for a predefined layout stage. By doing so, SceneTextGen facilitates a more natural and varied representation of text. The novelty of SceneTextGen lies in its integration of three key components: a character-level encoder for capturing detailed typographic properties, coupled with a character-level instance segmentation model and a word-level spotting model to address the issues of unwanted text generation and minor character inaccuracies. We validate the performance of our method by demonstrating improved character recognition rates on generated images across different public visual text datasets in comparison to both standard diffusion based methods and text specific methods.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Model-based offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) allows agents to fully utilise pre-collected datasets without requiring additional or unethical explorations. However, applying model-based offline RL to online systems presents challenges, primarily due to the highly suboptimal (noise-filled) and diverse nature of datasets generated by online systems. To tackle these issues, we introduce the Causal Prompting Reinforcement Learning (CPRL) framework, designed for highly suboptimal and resource-constrained online scenarios. The initial phase of CPRL involves the introduction of the Hidden-Parameter Block Causal Prompting Dynamic (Hip-BCPD) to model environmental dynamics. This approach utilises invariant causal prompts and aligns hidden parameters to generalise to new and diverse online users. In the subsequent phase, a single policy is trained to address multiple tasks through the amalgamation of reusable skills, circumventing the need for training from scratch. Experiments conducted across datasets with varying levels of noise, including simulation-based and real-world offline datasets from the Dnurse APP, demonstrate that our proposed method can make robust decisions in out-of-distribution and noisy environments, outperforming contemporary algorithms. Additionally, we separately verify the contributions of Hip-BCPDs and the skill-reuse strategy to the robustness of performance. We further analyse the visualised structure of Hip-BCPD and the interpretability of sub-skills. We released our source code and the first ever real-world medical dataset for precise medical decision-making tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used for node classification tasks but often fail to generalize when training and test nodes come from different distributions, limiting their practicality. To overcome this, recent approaches adopt invariant learning techniques from the out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization field, which seek to establish stable prediction methods across environments. However, the applicability of these invariant assumptions to graph data remains unverified, and such methods often lack solid theoretical support. In this work, we introduce the Topology-Aware Dynamic Reweighting (TAR) framework, which dynamically adjusts sample weights through gradient flow in the geometric Wasserstein space during training. Instead of relying on strict invariance assumptions, we prove that our method is able to provide distributional robustness, thereby enhancing the out-of-distribution generalization performance on graph data. By leveraging the inherent graph structure, TAR effectively addresses distribution shifts. Our framework's superiority is demonstrated through standard testing on four graph OOD datasets and three class-imbalanced node classification datasets, exhibiting marked improvements over existing methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Image Quality Assessment (IQA) and Image Aesthetic Assessment (IAA) aim to simulate human subjective perception of image visual quality and aesthetic appeal. Existing methods typically address these tasks independently due to distinct learning objectives. However, they neglect the underlying interconnectedness of both tasks, which hinders the learning of task-agnostic shared representations for human subjective perception. To confront this challenge, we propose Unified vision-language pre-training of Quality and Aesthetics (UniQA), to learn general perceptions of two tasks, thereby benefiting them simultaneously. Addressing the absence of text in the IQA datasets and the presence of textual noise in the IAA datasets, (1) we utilize multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to generate high-quality text descriptions; (2) the generated text for IAA serves as metadata to purify noisy IAA data. To effectively adapt the pre-trained UniQA to downstream tasks, we further propose a lightweight adapter that utilizes versatile cues to fully exploit the extensive knowledge of the pre-trained model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach attains a new state-of-the-art performance on both IQA and IAA tasks, while concurrently showcasing exceptional zero-shot and few-label image assessment capabilities.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advancements in machine learning, particularly in deep learning and object detection, have significantly improved performance in various tasks, including image classification and synthesis. However, challenges persist, particularly in acquiring labeled data that accurately represents specific use cases. In this work, we propose an automatic pipeline for generating synthetic image datasets using Stable Diffusion, an image synthesis model capable of producing highly realistic images. We leverage YOLOv8 for automatic bounding box detection and quality assessment of synthesized images. Our contributions include demonstrating the feasibility of training image classifiers solely on synthetic data, automating the image generation pipeline, and describing the computational requirements for our approach.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Visual anomaly detection (AD) inherently faces significant challenges due to the scarcity of anomalous data. Although numerous works have been proposed to synthesize anomalous samples, the generated samples often lack authenticity or can only reflect the distribution of the available training data samples. In this work, we propose CUT: a Controllable, Universal and Training-free visual anomaly generation framework, which leverages the capability of Stable Diffusion (SD) in image generation to generate diverse and realistic anomalies. With CUT, we achieve controllable and realistic anomaly generation universally across both unseen data and novel anomaly types, using a single model without acquiring additional training effort. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we propose a Vision-Language-based Anomaly Detection framework (VLAD). By training the VLAD model with our generated anomalous samples, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark anomaly detection tasks, highlighting the significant improvements enabled by our synthetic data.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, privacy, protect, attack, robust, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated learning allows several clients to train one machine learning model jointly without sharing private data, providing privacy protection. However, traditional federated learning is vulnerable to poisoning attacks, which can not only decrease the model performance, but also implant malicious backdoors. In addition, direct submission of local model parameters can also lead to the privacy leakage of the training dataset. In this paper, we aim to build a privacy-preserving and Byzantine-robust federated learning scheme to provide an environment with no vandalism (NoV) against attacks from malicious participants. Specifically, we construct a model filter for poisoned local models, protecting the global model from data and model poisoning attacks. This model filter combines zero-knowledge proofs to provide further privacy protection. Then, we adopt secret sharing to provide verifiable secure aggregation, removing malicious clients that disrupting the aggregation process. Our formal analysis proves that NoV can protect data privacy and weed out Byzantine attackers. Our experiments illustrate that NoV can effectively address data and model poisoning attacks, including PGD, and outperforms other related schemes.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, protect, attack, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a collaborative approach that allows multiple clients to jointly learn a machine learning model without sharing their private data. The concern about privacy leakage, albeit demonstrated under specific conditions, has triggered numerous follow-up research in designing powerful attacking methods and effective defending mechanisms aiming to thwart these attacking methods. Nevertheless, privacy-preserving mechanisms employed in these defending methods invariably lead to compromised model performances due to a fixed obfuscation applied to private data or gradients. In this article, we, therefore, propose a novel adaptive obfuscation mechanism, coined FedAdOb, to protect private data without yielding original model performances. Technically, FedAdOb utilizes passport-based adaptive obfuscation to ensure data privacy in both horizontal and vertical federated learning settings. The privacy-preserving capabilities of FedAdOb, specifically with regard to private features and labels, are theoretically proven through Theorems 1 and 2. Furthermore, extensive experimental evaluations conducted on various datasets and network architectures demonstrate the effectiveness of FedAdOb by manifesting its superior trade-off between privacy preservation and model performance, surpassing existing methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While supervised learning models have shown remarkable performance in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, their success heavily relies on the availability of large-scale labeled datasets, which can be costly and time-consuming to obtain. Conversely, unsupervised learning techniques can leverage abundant unlabeled text data to learn rich representations, but they do not directly optimize for specific NLP tasks. This paper presents a novel hybrid approach that synergizes unsupervised and supervised learning to improve the accuracy of NLP task modeling. While supervised models excel at specific tasks, they rely on large labeled datasets. Unsupervised techniques can learn rich representations from abundant unlabeled text but don't directly optimize for tasks. Our methodology integrates an unsupervised module that learns representations from unlabeled corpora (e.g., language models, word embeddings) and a supervised module that leverages these representations to enhance task-specific models. We evaluate our approach on text classification and named entity recognition (NER), demonstrating consistent performance gains over supervised baselines. For text classification, contextual word embeddings from a language model pretrain a recurrent or transformer-based classifier. For NER, word embeddings initialize a BiLSTM sequence labeler. By synergizing techniques, our hybrid approach achieves SOTA results on benchmark datasets, paving the way for more data-efficient and robust NLP systems.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper introduces the Lagrange Policy for Continuous Actions (LPCA), a reinforcement learning algorithm specifically designed for weakly coupled MDP problems with continuous action spaces. LPCA addresses the challenge of resource constraints dependent on continuous actions by introducing a Lagrange relaxation of the weakly coupled MDP problem within a neural network framework for Q-value computation. This approach effectively decouples the MDP, enabling efficient policy learning in resource-constrained environments. We present two variations of LPCA: LPCA-DE, which utilizes differential evolution for global optimization, and LPCA-Greedy, a method that incrementally and greadily selects actions based on Q-value gradients. Comparative analysis against other state-of-the-art techniques across various settings highlight LPCA's robustness and efficiency in managing resource allocation while maximizing rewards.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Dataset Distillation (DD) aims to distill knowledge from extensive datasets into more compact ones while preserving performance on the test set, thereby reducing storage costs and training expenses. However, existing methods often suffer from computational intensity, particularly exhibiting suboptimal performance with large dataset sizes due to the lack of a robust theoretical framework for analyzing the DD problem. To address these challenges, we propose the BAyesian optimal CONdensation framework (BACON), which is the first work to introduce the Bayesian theoretical framework to the literature of DD. This framework provides theoretical support for enhancing the performance of DD. Furthermore, BACON formulates the DD problem as the minimization of the expected risk function in joint probability distributions using the Bayesian framework. Additionally, by analyzing the expected risk function for optimal condensation, we derive a numerically feasible lower bound based on specific assumptions, providing an approximate solution for BACON. We validate BACON across several datasets, demonstrating its superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. For instance, under the IPC-10 setting, BACON achieves a 3.46% accuracy gain over the IDM method on the CIFAR-10 dataset and a 3.10% gain on the TinyImageNet dataset. Our extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of BACON and its seamless integration with existing methods, thereby enhancing their performance for the DD task. Code and distilled datasets are available at BACON.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Interpretability and explainability are among the most important challenges of modern artificial intelligence, being mentioned even in various legislative sources. In this article, we develop a method for extracting immediately human interpretable classifiers from tabular data. The classifiers are given in the form of short Boolean formulas built with propositions that can either be directly extracted from categorical attributes or dynamically computed from numeric ones. Our method is implemented using Answer Set Programming. We investigate seven datasets and compare our results to ones obtainable by state-of-the-art classifiers for tabular data, namely, XGBoost and random forests. Over all datasets, the accuracies obtainable by our method are similar to the reference methods. The advantage of our classifiers in all cases is that they are very short and immediately human intelligible as opposed to the black-box nature of the reference methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Virtually all federated learning (FL) methods, including FedAvg, operate in the following manner: i) an orchestrating server sends the current model parameters to a cohort of clients selected via certain rule, ii) these clients then independently perform a local training procedure (e.g., via SGD or Adam) using their own training data, and iii) the resulting models are shipped to the server for aggregation. This process is repeated until a model of suitable quality is found. A notable feature of these methods is that each cohort is involved in a single communication round with the server only. In this work we challenge this algorithmic design primitive and investigate whether it is possible to ``squeeze more juice" out of each cohort than what is possible in a single communication round. Surprisingly, we find that this is indeed the case, and our approach leads to up to 74% reduction in the total communication cost needed to train a FL model in the cross-device setting. Our method is based on a novel variant of the stochastic proximal point method (SPPM-AS) which supports a large collection of client sampling procedures some of which lead to further gains when compared to classical client selection approaches.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated Learning (FL) methods often struggle in highly statistically heterogeneous settings. Indeed, non-IID data distributions cause client drift and biased local solutions, particularly pronounced in the final classification layer, negatively impacting convergence speed and accuracy. To address this issue, we introduce Federated Recursive Ridge Regression (Fed3R). Our method fits a Ridge Regression classifier computed in closed form leveraging pre-trained features. Fed3R is immune to statistical heterogeneity and is invariant to the sampling order of the clients. Therefore, it proves particularly effective in cross-device scenarios. Furthermore, it is fast and efficient in terms of communication and computation costs, requiring up to two orders of magnitude fewer resources than the competitors. Finally, we propose to leverage the Fed3R parameters as an initialization for a softmax classifier and subsequently fine-tune the model using any FL algorithm (Fed3R with Fine-Tuning, Fed3R+FT). Our findings also indicate that maintaining a fixed classifier aids in stabilizing the training and learning more discriminative features in cross-device settings.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Modern high-stakes systems, such as healthcare or robotics, often generate vast streaming event sequences. Our goal is to design an efficient, plug-and-play tool to elicit logic tree-based explanations from Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide customized insights into each observed event sequence. Built on the temporal point process model for events, our method employs the likelihood function as a score to evaluate generated logic trees. We propose an amortized Expectation-Maximization (EM) learning framework and treat the logic tree as latent variables. In the E-step, we evaluate the posterior distribution over the latent logic trees using an LLM prior and the likelihood of the observed event sequences. LLM provides a high-quality prior for the latent logic trees, however, since the posterior is built over a discrete combinatorial space, we cannot get the closed-form solution. We propose to generate logic tree samples from the posterior using a learnable GFlowNet, which is a diversity-seeking generator for structured discrete variables. The M-step employs the generated logic rules to approximate marginalization over the posterior, facilitating the learning of model parameters and refining the tunable LLM prior parameters. In the online setting, our locally built, lightweight model will iteratively extract the most relevant rules from LLMs for each sequence using only a few iterations. Empirical demonstrations showcase the promising performance and adaptability of our framework.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models are widely recognized for generating high-quality and diverse images, but their poor real-time performance has led to numerous acceleration works, primarily focusing on UNet-based structures. With the more successful results achieved by diffusion transformers (DiT), there is still a lack of exploration regarding the impact of DiT structure on generation, as well as the absence of an acceleration framework tailored to the DiT architecture. To tackle these challenges, we conduct an investigation into the correlation between DiT blocks and image generation. Our findings reveal that the front blocks of DiT are associated with the outline of the generated images, while the rear blocks are linked to the details. Based on this insight, we propose an overall training-free inference acceleration framework $\Delta$-DiT: using a designed cache mechanism to accelerate the rear DiT blocks in the early sampling stages and the front DiT blocks in the later stages. Specifically, a DiT-specific cache mechanism called $\Delta$-Cache is proposed, which considers the inputs of the previous sampling image and reduces the bias in the inference. Extensive experiments on PIXART-$\alpha$ and DiT-XL demonstrate that the $\Delta$-DiT can achieve a $1.6\times$ speedup on the 20-step generation and even improves performance in most cases. In the scenario of 4-step consistent model generation and the more challenging $1.12\times$ acceleration, our method significantly outperforms existing methods. Our code will be publicly available.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) have performed remarkably well in various natural language processing tasks by benchmarking, including in the Western medical domain. However, the professional evaluation benchmarks for LLMs have yet to be covered in the traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) domain, which has a profound history and vast influence. To address this research gap, we introduce TCM-Bench, an comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLM performance in TCM. It comprises the TCM-ED dataset, consisting of 5,473 questions sourced from the TCM Licensing Exam (TCMLE), including 1,300 questions with authoritative analysis. It covers the core components of TCMLE, including TCM basis and clinical practice. To evaluate LLMs beyond accuracy of question answering, we propose TCMScore, a metric tailored for evaluating the quality of answers generated by LLMs for TCM related questions. It comprehensively considers the consistency of TCM semantics and knowledge. After conducting comprehensive experimental analyses from diverse perspectives, we can obtain the following findings: (1) The unsatisfactory performance of LLMs on this benchmark underscores their significant room for improvement in TCM. (2) Introducing domain knowledge can enhance LLMs' performance. However, for in-domain models like ZhongJing-TCM, the quality of generated analysis text has decreased, and we hypothesize that their fine-tuning process affects the basic LLM capabilities. (3) Traditional metrics for text generation quality like Rouge and BertScore are susceptible to text length and surface semantic ambiguity, while domain-specific metrics such as TCMScore can further supplement and explain their evaluation results. These findings highlight the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in the TCM and aim to provide a more profound assistance to medical research.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multi-modal salient object detection (MSOD) aims to boost saliency detection performance by integrating visible sources with depth or thermal infrared ones. Existing methods generally design different fusion schemes to handle certain issues or challenges. Although these fusion schemes are effective at addressing specific issues or challenges, they may struggle to handle multiple complex challenges simultaneously. To solve this problem, we propose a novel adaptive fusion bank that makes full use of the complementary benefits from a set of basic fusion schemes to handle different challenges simultaneously for robust MSOD. We focus on handling five major challenges in MSOD, namely center bias, scale variation, image clutter, low illumination, and thermal crossover or depth ambiguity. The fusion bank proposed consists of five representative fusion schemes, which are specifically designed based on the characteristics of each challenge, respectively. The bank is scalable, and more fusion schemes could be incorporated into the bank for more challenges. To adaptively select the appropriate fusion scheme for multi-modal input, we introduce an adaptive ensemble module that forms the adaptive fusion bank, which is embedded into hierarchical layers for sufficient fusion of different source data. Moreover, we design an indirect interactive guidance module to accurately detect salient hollow objects via the skip integration of high-level semantic information and low-level spatial details. Extensive experiments on three RGBT datasets and seven RGBD datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the outstanding performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Despite the recent advances in the so-called "cold start" generation from text prompts, their needs in data and computing resources, as well as the ambiguities around intellectual property and privacy concerns pose certain counterarguments for their utility. An interesting and relatively unexplored alternative has been the introduction of unconditional synthesis from a single sample, which has led to interesting generative applications. In this paper we focus on single-shot motion generation and more specifically on accelerating the training time of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). In particular, we tackle the challenge of GAN's equilibrium collapse when using mini-batch training by carefully annealing the weights of the loss functions that prevent mode collapse. Additionally, we perform statistical analysis in the generator and discriminator models to identify correlations between training stages and enable transfer learning. Our improved GAN achieves competitive quality and diversity on the Mixamo benchmark when compared to the original GAN architecture and a single-shot diffusion model, while being up to x6.8 faster in training time from the former and x1.75 from the latter. Finally, we demonstrate the ability of our improved GAN to mix and compose motion with a single forward pass.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The task of reasoning over Knowledge Graphs (KGs) poses a significant challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs) due to the complex structure and large amounts of irrelevant information. Existing LLM reasoning methods overlook the importance of compositional learning on KG to supply with precise knowledge. Besides, the fine-tuning and frequent interaction with LLMs incur substantial time and resource costs. This paper focuses on the Question Answering over Knowledge Graph (KGQA) task and proposes an Explore-then-Determine (EtD) framework that synergizes LLMs with graph neural networks (GNNs) for reasoning over KGs. The Explore stage employs a lightweight GNN to explore promising candidates and relevant fine-grained knowledge to the questions, while the Determine stage utilizes the explored information to construct a knowledge-enhanced multiple-choice prompt, guiding a frozen LLM to determine the final answer. Extensive experiments on three benchmark KGQA datasets demonstrate that EtD achieves state-of-the-art performance and generates faithful reasoning results.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are amortized sampling methods for learning a stochastic policy to sequentially generate compositional objects with probabilities proportional to their rewards. GFlowNets exhibit a remarkable ability to generate diverse sets of high-reward objects, in contrast to standard return maximization reinforcement learning approaches, which often converge to a single optimal solution. Recent works have arisen for learning goal-conditioned GFlowNets to acquire various useful properties, aiming to train a single GFlowNet capable of achieving different goals as the task specifies. However, training a goal-conditioned GFlowNet poses critical challenges due to extremely sparse rewards, which is further exacerbated in large state spaces. In this work, we propose a novel method named Retrospective Backward Synthesis (RBS) to address these challenges. Specifically, RBS synthesizes a new backward trajectory based on the backward policy in GFlowNets to enrich training trajectories with enhanced quality and diversity, thereby efficiently solving the sparse reward problem. Extensive empirical results show that our method improves sample efficiency by a large margin and outperforms strong baselines on various standard evaluation benchmarks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Ultrasound is a widely used imaging modality in clinical practice due to its low cost, portability, and safety. Current research in general AI for healthcare focuses on large language models and general segmentation models, with insufficient attention to solutions addressing both disease prediction and tissue segmentation. In this study, we propose a novel universal framework for ultrasound, namely DeepUniUSTransformer, which is a promptable model accommodating multiple clinical task. The universality of this model is derived from its versatility across various aspects. It proficiently manages any ultrasound nature, any anatomical position, any input type and excelling not only in segmentation tasks but also in computer-aided diagnosis tasks. We introduce a novel module that incorporates this information as a prompt and seamlessly embedding it within the model's learning process. To train and validate our proposed model, we curated a comprehensive ultrasound dataset from publicly accessible sources, encompassing up to 7 distinct anatomical positions with over 9.7K annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that our model surpasses both a model trained on a single dataset and an ablated version of the network lacking prompt guidance. We will continuously expand the dataset and optimize the task specific prompting mechanism towards the universality in medical ultrasound. Model weights, datasets, and code will be open source to the public.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper unveils Dimba, a new text-to-image diffusion model that employs a distinctive hybrid architecture combining Transformer and Mamba elements. Specifically, Dimba sequentially stacked blocks alternate between Transformer and Mamba layers, and integrate conditional information through the cross-attention layer, thus capitalizing on the advantages of both architectural paradigms. We investigate several optimization strategies, including quality tuning, resolution adaption, and identify critical configurations necessary for large-scale image generation. The model's flexible design supports scenarios that cater to specific resource constraints and objectives. When scaled appropriately, Dimba offers substantial throughput and a reduced memory footprint relative to conventional pure Transformers-based benchmarks. Extensive experiments indicate that Dimba achieves comparable performance compared with benchmarks in terms of image quality, artistic rendering, and semantic control. We also report several intriguing properties of architecture discovered during evaluation and release checkpoints in experiments. Our findings emphasize the promise of large-scale hybrid Transformer-Mamba architectures in the foundational stage of diffusion models, suggesting a bright future for text-to-image generation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Reinforcement learning (RL) excels in optimizing policies for discrete-time Markov decision processes (MDP). However, various systems are inherently continuous in time, making discrete-time MDPs an inexact modeling choice. In many applications, such as greenhouse control or medical treatments, each interaction (measurement or switching of action) involves manual intervention and thus is inherently costly. Therefore, we generally prefer a time-adaptive approach with fewer interactions with the system. In this work, we formalize an RL framework, Time-adaptive Control & Sensing (TaCoS), that tackles this challenge by optimizing over policies that besides control predict the duration of its application. Our formulation results in an extended MDP that any standard RL algorithm can solve. We demonstrate that state-of-the-art RL algorithms trained on TaCoS drastically reduce the interaction amount over their discrete-time counterpart while retaining the same or improved performance, and exhibiting robustness over discretization frequency. Finally, we propose OTaCoS, an efficient model-based algorithm for our setting. We show that OTaCoS enjoys sublinear regret for systems with sufficiently smooth dynamics and empirically results in further sample-efficiency gains.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recently, methods investigating how to adapt large language models (LLMs) for specific scenarios have gained great attention. Particularly, the concept of \textit{persona}, originally adopted in dialogue literature, has re-surged as a promising avenue. However, the growing research on persona is relatively disorganized, lacking a systematic overview. To close the gap, we present a comprehensive survey to categorize the current state of the field. We identify two lines of research, namely (1) LLM Role-Playing, where personas are assigned to LLMs, and (2) LLM Personalization, where LLMs take care of user personas. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first survey tailored for LLM role-playing and LLM personalization under the unified view of persona, including taxonomy, current challenges, and potential directions.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The widespread use of large language models (LLMs) has sparked concerns about the potential misuse of AI-generated text, as these models can produce content that closely resembles human-generated text. Current detectors for AI-generated text (AIGT) lack robustness against adversarial perturbations, with even minor changes in characters or words causing a reversal in distinguishing between human-created and AI-generated text. This paper investigates the robustness of existing AIGT detection methods and introduces a novel detector, the Siamese Calibrated Reconstruction Network (SCRN). The SCRN employs a reconstruction network to add and remove noise from text, extracting a semantic representation that is robust to local perturbations. We also propose a siamese calibration technique to train the model to make equally confidence predictions under different noise, which improves the model's robustness against adversarial perturbations. Experiments on four publicly available datasets show that the SCRN outperforms all baseline methods, achieving 6.5\%-18.25\% absolute accuracy improvement over the best baseline method under adversarial attacks. Moreover, it exhibits superior generalizability in cross-domain, cross-genre, and mixed-source scenarios. The code is available at \url{this https URL}.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Working with high-dimensional data is a common practice, in the field of machine learning. Identifying relevant input features is thus crucial, so as to obtain compact dataset more prone for effective numerical handling. Further, by isolating pivotal elements that form the basis of decision making, one can contribute to elaborate on - ex post - models' interpretability, so far rather elusive. Here, we propose a novel method to estimate the relative importance of the input components for a Deep Neural Network. This is achieved by leveraging on a spectral re-parametrization of the optimization process. Eigenvalues associated to input nodes provide in fact a robust proxy to gauge the relevance of the supplied entry features. Unlike existing techniques, the spectral features ranking is carried out automatically, as a byproduct of the network training. The technique is successfully challenged against both synthetic and real data.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Cloud computing is a ubiquitous solution to handle today's complex computing demands. However, it comes with data privacy concerns, as the cloud service provider has complete access to code and data running on their infrastructure. VM-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) are a promising solution to solve this issue. They provide strong isolation guarantees to lock out the cloud service provider, as well as an attestation mechanism to enable the end user to verify their trustworthiness. Attesting the whole boot chain of a VM is a challenging task that requires modifications to several software components. While there are open source solutions for the individual components, the tooling and documentation for properly integrating them remains scarce. In this paper, we try to fill this gap by elaborating on two common boot workflows and providing open source tooling to perform them with low manual effort. The first workflow assumes that the VM image does only require integrity but not confidentiality, allowing for an uninterrupted boot process. The second workflow covers booting a VM with an encrypted root filesystem, requiring secure provisioning of the decryption key during early boot. While our tooling targets AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) VMs, the concepts also apply to other VM-based TEEs such as Intel Trusted Domain Extensions (TDX).</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent diffusion-based human image animation techniques have demonstrated impressive success in synthesizing videos that faithfully follow a given reference identity and a sequence of desired movement poses. Despite this, there are still two limitations: i) an extra reference model is required to align the identity image with the main video branch, which significantly increases the optimization burden and model parameters; ii) the generated video is usually short in time (e.g., 24 frames), hampering practical applications. To address these shortcomings, we present a UniAnimate framework to enable efficient and long-term human video generation. First, to reduce the optimization difficulty and ensure temporal coherence, we map the reference image along with the posture guidance and noise video into a common feature space by incorporating a unified video diffusion model. Second, we propose a unified noise input that supports random noised input as well as first frame conditioned input, which enhances the ability to generate long-term video. Finally, to further efficiently handle long sequences, we explore an alternative temporal modeling architecture based on state space model to replace the original computation-consuming temporal Transformer. Extensive experimental results indicate that UniAnimate achieves superior synthesis results over existing state-of-the-art counterparts in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Notably, UniAnimate can even generate highly consistent one-minute videos by iteratively employing the first frame conditioning strategy. Code and models will be publicly available.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>SoftMax is a ubiquitous ingredient of modern machine learning algorithms. It maps an input vector onto a probability simplex and reweights the input by concentrating the probability mass at large entries. Yet, as a smooth approximation to the Argmax function, a significant amount of probability mass is distributed to other, residual entries, leading to poor interpretability and noise. Although sparsity can be achieved by a family of SoftMax variants, they often require an alternative loss function and do not preserve multi-modality. We show that this trade-off between multi-modality and sparsity limits the expressivity of SoftMax as well as its variants. We provide a solution to this tension between objectives by proposing a piece-wise differentiable function, termed MultiMax, which adaptively modulates the output distribution according to input entry range. Through comprehensive analysis and evaluation, we show that MultiMax successfully produces a distribution that supresses irrelevant entries while preserving multimodality, with benefits in image classification, language modeling and machine translation.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep image clustering methods are typically evaluated on small-scale balanced classification datasets while feature-based $k$-means has been applied on proprietary billion-scale datasets. In this work, we explore the performance of feature-based deep clustering approaches on large-scale benchmarks whilst disentangling the impact of the following data-related factors: i) class imbalance, ii) class granularity, iii) easy-to-recognize classes, and iv) the ability to capture multiple classes. Consequently, we develop multiple new benchmarks based on ImageNet21K. Our experimental analysis reveals that feature-based $k$-means is often unfairly evaluated on balanced datasets. However, deep clustering methods outperform $k$-means across most large-scale benchmarks. Interestingly, $k$-means underperforms on easy-to-classify benchmarks by large margins. The performance gap, however, diminishes on the highest data regimes such as ImageNet21K. Finally, we find that non-primary cluster predictions capture meaningful classes (i.e. coarser classes).</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Cross-modal transformers have demonstrated superiority in various vision tasks by effectively integrating different modalities. This paper first critiques prior token exchange methods which replace less informative tokens with inter-modal features, and demonstrate exchange based methods underperform cross-attention mechanisms, while the computational demand of the latter inevitably restricts its use with longer sequences. To surmount the computational challenges, we propose GeminiFusion, a pixel-wise fusion approach that capitalizes on aligned cross-modal representations. GeminiFusion elegantly combines intra-modal and inter-modal attentions, dynamically integrating complementary information across modalities. We employ a layer-adaptive noise to adaptively control their interplay on a per-layer basis, thereby achieving a harmonized fusion process. Notably, GeminiFusion maintains linear complexity with respect to the number of input tokens, ensuring this multimodal framework operates with efficiency comparable to unimodal networks. Comprehensive evaluations across multimodal image-to-image translation, 3D object detection and arbitrary-modal semantic segmentation tasks, including RGB, depth, LiDAR, event data, etc. demonstrate the superior performance of our GeminiFusion against leading-edge techniques.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated an impressive capability known as In-context Learning (ICL), which enables them to acquire knowledge from textual demonstrations without the need for parameter updates. However, many studies have highlighted that the model's performance is sensitive to the choice of demonstrations, presenting a significant challenge for practical applications where we lack prior knowledge of user queries. Consequently, we need to construct an extensive demonstration pool and incorporate external databases to assist the model, leading to considerable time and financial costs. In light of this, some recent research has shifted focus towards zero-shot ICL, aiming to reduce the model's reliance on external information by leveraging their inherent generative capabilities. Despite the effectiveness of these approaches, the content generated by the model may be unreliable, and the generation process is time-consuming. To address these issues, we propose Demonstration Augmentation for In-context Learning (DAIL), which employs the model's previously predicted historical samples as demonstrations for subsequent ones. DAIL brings no additional inference cost and does not rely on the model's generative capabilities. Our experiments reveal that DAIL can significantly improve the model's performance over direct zero-shot inference and can even outperform few-shot ICL without any external information.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In recent years, continual learning (CL) techniques have made significant progress in learning from streaming data while preserving knowledge across sequential tasks, particularly in the realm of euclidean data. To foster fair evaluation and recognize challenges in CL settings, several evaluation frameworks have been proposed, focusing mainly on the single- and multi-label classification task on euclidean data. However, these evaluation frameworks are not trivially applicable when the input data is graph-structured, as they do not consider the topological structure inherent in graphs. Existing continual graph learning (CGL) evaluation frameworks have predominantly focussed on single-label scenarios in the node classification (NC) task. This focus has overlooked the complexities of multi-label scenarios, where nodes may exhibit affiliations with multiple labels, simultaneously participating in multiple tasks. We develop a graph-aware evaluation (\agale) framework that accommodates both single-labeled and multi-labeled nodes, addressing the limitations of previous evaluation frameworks. In particular, we define new incremental settings and devise data partitioning algorithms tailored to CGL datasets. We perform extensive experiments comparing methods from the domains of continual learning, continual graph learning, and dynamic graph learning (DGL). We theoretically analyze \agale and provide new insights about the role of homophily in the performance of compared methods. We release our framework at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in natural language processing, they struggle with complex, multi-step reasoning tasks involving knowledge graphs (KGs). Existing approaches that integrate LLMs and KGs either underutilize the reasoning abilities of LLMs or suffer from prohibitive computational costs due to tight coupling. To address these limitations, we propose a novel collaborative framework named EffiQA that can strike a balance between performance and efficiency via an iterative paradigm. EffiQA consists of three stages: global planning, efficient KG exploration, and self-reflection. Specifically, EffiQA leverages the commonsense capability of LLMs to explore potential reasoning pathways through global planning. Then, it offloads semantic pruning to a small plug-in model for efficient KG exploration. Finally, the exploration results are fed to LLMs for self-reflection to further improve the global planning and efficient KG exploration. Empirical evidence on multiple KBQA benchmarks shows EffiQA's effectiveness, achieving an optimal balance between reasoning accuracy and computational costs. We hope the proposed new framework will pave the way for efficient, knowledge-intensive querying by redefining the integration of LLMs and KGs, fostering future research on knowledge-based question answering.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Alignment is the most critical step in building large language models (LLMs) that meet human needs. With the rapid development of LLMs gradually surpassing human capabilities, traditional alignment methods based on human-annotation are increasingly unable to meet the scalability demands. Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore new sources of automated alignment signals and technical approaches. In this paper, we systematically review the recently emerging methods of automated alignment, attempting to explore how to achieve effective, scalable, automated alignment once the capabilities of LLMs exceed those of humans. Specifically, we categorize existing automated alignment methods into 4 major categories based on the sources of alignment signals and discuss the current status and potential development of each category. Additionally, we explore the underlying mechanisms that enable automated alignment and discuss the essential factors that make automated alignment technologies feasible and effective from the fundamental role of alignment.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>AI-driven tumor analysis has garnered increasing attention in healthcare. However, its progress is significantly hindered by the lack of annotated tumor cases, which requires radiologists to invest a lot of effort in collecting and annotation. In this paper, we introduce a highly practical solution for robust tumor synthesis and segmentation, termed FreeTumor, which refers to annotation-free synthetic tumors and our desire to free patients that suffering from tumors. Instead of pursuing sophisticated technical synthesis modules, we aim to design a simple yet effective tumor synthesis paradigm to unleash the power of large-scale data. Specifically, FreeTumor advances existing methods mainly from three aspects: (1) Existing methods only leverage small-scale labeled data for synthesis training, which limits their ability to generalize well on unseen data from different sources. To this end, we introduce the adversarial training strategy to leverage large-scale and diversified unlabeled data in synthesis training, significantly improving tumor synthesis. (2) Existing methods largely ignored the negative impact of low-quality synthetic tumors in segmentation training. Thus, we employ an adversarial-based discriminator to automatically filter out the low-quality synthetic tumors, which effectively alleviates their negative impact. (3) Existing methods only used hundreds of cases in tumor segmentation. In FreeTumor, we investigate the data scaling law in tumor segmentation by scaling up the dataset to 11k cases. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of FreeTumor, e.g., on three tumor segmentation benchmarks, average $+8.9\%$ DSC over the baseline that only using real tumors and $+6.6\%$ DSC over the state-of-the-art tumor synthesis method.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Although input-gradients techniques have evolved to mitigate and tackle the challenges associated with gradients, modern gradient-weighted CAM approaches still rely on vanilla gradients, which are inherently susceptible to the saturation phenomena. Despite recent enhancements have incorporated counterfactual gradient strategies as a mitigating measure, these local explanation techniques still exhibit a lack of sensitivity to their baseline parameter. Our work proposes a gradient-weighted CAM augmentation that tackles both the saturation and sensitivity problem by reshaping the gradient computation, incorporating two well-established and provably approaches: Expected Gradients and kernel smoothing. By revisiting the original formulation as the smoothed expectation of the perturbed integrated gradients, one can concurrently construct more faithful, localized and robust explanations which minimize infidelity. Through fine modulation of the perturbation distribution it is possible to regulate the complexity characteristic of the explanation, selectively discriminating stable features. Our technique, Expected Grad-CAM, differently from recent works, exclusively optimizes the gradient computation, purposefully designed as an enhanced substitute of the foundational Grad-CAM algorithm and any method built therefrom. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations have been conducted to assess the effectiveness of our method.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The notion of visual similarity is essential for computer vision, and in applications and studies revolving around vector embeddings of images. However, the scarcity of benchmark datasets poses a significant hurdle in exploring how these models perceive similarity. Here we introduce Style Aligned Artwork Datasets (SALADs), and an example of fruit-SALAD with 10,000 images of fruit depictions. This combined semantic category and style benchmark comprises 100 instances each of 10 easy-to-recognize fruit categories, across 10 easy distinguishable styles. Leveraging a systematic pipeline of generative image synthesis, this visually diverse yet balanced benchmark demonstrates salient differences in semantic category and style similarity weights across various computational models, including machine learning models, feature extraction algorithms, and complexity measures, as well as conceptual models for reference. This meticulously designed dataset offers a controlled and balanced platform for the comparative analysis of similarity perception. The SALAD framework allows the comparison of how these models perform semantic category and style recognition task to go beyond the level of anecdotal knowledge, making it robustly quantifiable and qualitatively interpretable.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While Hyperbolic Graph Neural Network (HGNN) has recently emerged as a powerful tool dealing with hierarchical graph data, the limitations of scalability and efficiency hinder itself from generalizing to deep models. In this paper, by envisioning depth as a continuous-time embedding evolution, we decouple the HGNN and reframe the information propagation as a partial differential equation, letting node-wise attention undertake the role of diffusivity within the Hyperbolic Neural PDE (HPDE). By introducing theoretical principles \textit{e.g.,} field and flow, gradient, divergence, and diffusivity on a non-Euclidean manifold for HPDE integration, we discuss both implicit and explicit discretization schemes to formulate numerical HPDE solvers. Further, we propose the Hyperbolic Graph Diffusion Equation (HGDE) -- a flexible vector flow function that can be integrated to obtain expressive hyperbolic node embeddings. By analyzing potential energy decay of embeddings, we demonstrate that HGDE is capable of modeling both low- and high-order proximity with the benefit of local-global diffusivity functions. Experiments on node classification and link prediction and image-text classification tasks verify the superiority of the proposed method, which consistently outperforms various competitive models by a significant margin.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Transformer-based models have achieved dominant performance in numerous NLP tasks. Despite their remarkable successes, pre-trained transformers such as BERT suffer from a computationally expensive self-attention mechanism that interacts with all tokens, including the ones unfavorable to classification performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose integrating two strategies: token pruning and token combining. Token pruning eliminates less important tokens in the attention mechanism's key and value as they pass through the layers. Additionally, we adopt fuzzy logic to handle uncertainty and alleviate potential mispruning risks arising from an imbalanced distribution of each token's importance. Token combining, on the other hand, condenses input sequences into smaller sizes in order to further compress the model. By integrating these two approaches, we not only improve the model's performance but also reduce its computational demands. Experiments with various datasets demonstrate superior performance compared to baseline models, especially with the best improvement over the existing BERT model, achieving +5%p in accuracy and +5.6%p in F1 score. Additionally, memory cost is reduced to 0.61x, and a speedup of 1.64x is achieved.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>defense</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recently, Anil et al. (2024) show that many-shot (up to hundreds of) demonstrations can jailbreak state-of-the-art LLMs by exploiting their long-context capability. Nevertheless, is it possible to use few-shot demonstrations to efficiently jailbreak LLMs within limited context sizes? While the vanilla few-shot jailbreaking may be inefficient, we propose improved techniques such as injecting special system tokens like [/INST] and employing demo-level random search from a collected demo pool. These simple techniques result in surprisingly effective jailbreaking against aligned LLMs (even with advanced defenses). For examples, our method achieves >80% (mostly >95%) ASRs on Llama-2-7B and Llama-3-8B without multiple restarts, even if the models are enhanced by strong defenses such as perplexity detection and/or SmoothLLM, which is challenging for suffix-based jailbreaking. In addition, we conduct comprehensive and elaborate (e.g., making sure to use correct system prompts) evaluations against other aligned LLMs and advanced defenses, where our method consistently achieves nearly 100% ASRs.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Access to resources strongly constrains the decisions we make. While we might wish to offer every student a scholarship, or schedule every patient for follow-up meetings with a specialist, limited resources mean that this is not possible. Existing tools for fair machine learning ignore these key constraints, with the majority of methods disregarding any finite resource limitations under which decisions are made. Our research introduces the concept of ``resource-constrained fairness" and quantifies the cost of fairness within this framework. We demonstrate that the level of available resources significantly influences this cost, a factor that has been overlooked in previous evaluations.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Self-correction is an approach to improving responses from large language models (LLMs) by refining the responses using LLMs during inference. Prior work has proposed various self-correction frameworks using different sources of feedback, including self-evaluation and external feedback. However, there is still no consensus on the question of when LLMs can correct their own mistakes, as recent studies also report negative results. In this work, we critically survey broad papers and discuss the conditions required for successful self-correction. We first find that prior studies often do not define their research questions in detail and involve impractical frameworks or unfair evaluations that over-evaluate self-correction. To tackle these issues, we categorize research questions in self-correction research and provide a checklist for designing appropriate experiments. Our critical survey based on the newly categorized research questions shows that (1) no prior work demonstrates successful self-correction with feedback from prompted LLMs in general tasks, (2) self-correction works well in tasks that can use reliable external feedback, and (3) large-scale fine-tuning enables self-correction.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text-guided image generation enables the creation of visual content from textual descriptions. However, certain visual concepts cannot be effectively conveyed through language alone. This has sparked a renewed interest in utilizing the CLIP image embedding space for more visually-oriented tasks through methods such as IP-Adapter. Interestingly, the CLIP image embedding space has been shown to be semantically meaningful, where linear operations within this space yield semantically meaningful results. Yet, the specific meaning of these operations can vary unpredictably across different images. To harness this potential, we introduce pOps, a framework that trains specific semantic operators directly on CLIP image embeddings. Each pOps operator is built upon a pretrained Diffusion Prior model. While the Diffusion Prior model was originally trained to map between text embeddings and image embeddings, we demonstrate that it can be tuned to accommodate new input conditions, resulting in a diffusion operator. Working directly over image embeddings not only improves our ability to learn semantic operations but also allows us to directly use a textual CLIP loss as an additional supervision when needed. We show that pOps can be used to learn a variety of photo-inspired operators with distinct semantic meanings, highlighting the semantic diversity and potential of our proposed approach.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Within the context of reading comprehension, the task of Distractor Generation (DG) aims to generate several incorrect options to confuse readers. Traditional supervised methods for DG rely heavily on expensive human-annotated distractor labels. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised DG framework, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) as cost-effective annotators to enhance the DG capability of smaller student models. Specially, to perform knowledge distilling, we propose a dual task training strategy that integrates pseudo distractors from LLMs and the original answer in-formation as the objective targets with a two-stage training process. Moreover, we devise a counterfactual contrastive decoding mechanism for increasing the distracting capability of the DG model. Experiments show that our unsupervised generation method with Bart-base greatly surpasses GPT-3.5-turbo performance with only 200 times fewer model parameters. Our proposed unsupervised DG method offers a cost-effective framework for practical reading comprehension applications, without the need of laborious distractor annotation and costly large-size models</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Fact-checking is a crucial natural language processing (NLP) task that verifies the truthfulness of claims by considering reliable evidence. Traditional methods are often limited by labour-intensive data curation and rule-based approaches. In this paper, we present FactGenius, a novel method that enhances fact-checking by combining zero-shot prompting of large language models (LLMs) with fuzzy text matching on knowledge graphs (KGs). Leveraging DBpedia, a structured linked data dataset derived from Wikipedia, FactGenius refines LLM-generated connections using similarity measures to ensure accuracy. The evaluation of FactGenius on the FactKG, a benchmark dataset for fact verification, demonstrates that it significantly outperforms existing baselines, particularly when fine-tuning RoBERTa as a classifier. The two-stage approach of filtering and validating connections proves crucial, achieving superior performance across various reasoning types and establishing FactGenius as a promising tool for robust fact-checking.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The Transformer model has been pivotal in advancing fields such as natural language processing, speech recognition, and computer vision. However, a critical limitation of this model is its quadratic computational and memory complexity relative to the sequence length, which constrains its application to longer sequences. This is especially crucial in medical imaging where high-resolution images can reach gigapixel scale. Efforts to address this issue have predominantely focused on complex techniques, such as decomposing the softmax operation integral to the Transformer's architecture. This paper addresses this quadratic computational complexity of Transformer models and introduces a remarkably simple and effective method that circumvents this issue by eliminating the softmax function from the attention mechanism and adopting a sequence normalization technique for the key, query, and value tokens. Coupled with a reordering of matrix multiplications this approach reduces the memory- and compute complexity to a linear scale. We evaluate this approach across various medical imaging datasets comprising fundoscopic, dermascopic, radiologic and histologic imaging data. Our findings highlight that these models exhibit a comparable performance to traditional transformer models, while efficiently handling longer sequences.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Tables contain factual and quantitative data accompanied by various structures and contents that pose challenges for machine comprehension. Previous methods generally design task-specific architectures and objectives for individual tasks, resulting in modal isolation and intricate workflows. In this paper, we present a novel large vision-language model, TabPedia, equipped with a concept synergy mechanism. In this mechanism, all the involved diverse visual table understanding (VTU) tasks and multi-source visual embeddings are abstracted as concepts. This unified framework allows TabPedia to seamlessly integrate VTU tasks, such as table detection, table structure recognition, table querying, and table question answering, by leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Moreover, the concept synergy mechanism enables table perception-related and comprehension-related tasks to work in harmony, as they can effectively leverage the needed clues from the corresponding source perception embeddings. Furthermore, to better evaluate the VTU task in real-world scenarios, we establish a new and comprehensive table VQA benchmark, ComTQA, featuring approximately 9,000 QA pairs. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on both table perception and comprehension tasks, conducted across various public benchmarks, validate the effectiveness of our TabPedia. The superior performance further confirms the feasibility of using LLMs for understanding visual tables when all concepts work in synergy. The benchmark ComTQA has been open-sourced at this https URL. The source code and model will be released later.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown their impressive capabilities, while also raising concerns about the data contamination problems due to privacy issues and leakage of benchmark datasets in the pre-training phase. Therefore, it is vital to detect the contamination by checking whether an LLM has been pre-trained on the target texts. Recent studies focus on the generated texts and compute perplexities, which are superficial features and not reliable. In this study, we propose to utilize the probing technique for pre-training data detection by examining the model's internal activations. Our method is simple and effective and leads to more trustworthy pre-training data detection. Additionally, we propose ArxivMIA, a new challenging benchmark comprising arxiv abstracts from Computer Science and Mathematics categories. Our experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms all baselines, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on both WikiMIA and ArxivMIA, with additional experiments confirming its efficacy (Our code and dataset are available at this https URL).</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent years have witnessed a trend of the deep integration of the generation and reconstruction paradigms. In this paper, we extend the ability of controllable generative models for a more comprehensive hand mesh recovery task: direct hand mesh generation, inpainting, reconstruction, and fitting in a single framework, which we name as Holistic Hand Mesh Recovery (HHMR). Our key observation is that different kinds of hand mesh recovery tasks can be achieved by a single generative model with strong multimodal controllability, and in such a framework, realizing different tasks only requires giving different signals as conditions. To achieve this goal, we propose an all-in-one diffusion framework based on graph convolution and attention mechanisms for holistic hand mesh recovery. In order to achieve strong control generation capability while ensuring the decoupling of multimodal control signals, we map different modalities to a shared feature space and apply cross-scale random masking in both modality and feature levels. In this way, the correlation between different modalities can be fully exploited during the learning of hand priors. Furthermore, we propose Condition-aligned Gradient Guidance to enhance the alignment of the generated model with the control signals, which significantly improves the accuracy of the hand mesh reconstruction and fitting. Experiments show that our novel framework can realize multiple hand mesh recovery tasks simultaneously and outperform the existing methods in different tasks, which provides more possibilities for subsequent downstream applications including gesture recognition, pose generation, mesh editing, and so on.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Precise segmentation of architectural structures provides detailed information about various building components, enhancing our understanding and interaction with our built environment. Nevertheless, existing outdoor 3D point cloud datasets have limited and detailed annotations on architectural exteriors due to privacy concerns and the expensive costs of data acquisition and annotation. To overcome this shortfall, this paper introduces a semantically-enriched, photo-realistic 3D architectural models dataset and benchmark for semantic segmentation. It features 4 different building purposes of real-world buildings as well as an open architectural landscape in Hong Kong. Each point cloud is annotated into one of 14 semantic classes.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Using generative models to synthesize new data has become a de-facto standard in autonomous driving to address the data scarcity issue. Though existing approaches are able to boost perception models, we discover that these approaches fail to improve the performance of planning of end-to-end autonomous driving models as the generated videos are usually less than 8 frames and the spatial and temporal inconsistencies are not negligible. To this end, we propose Delphi, a novel diffusion-based long video generation method with a shared noise modeling mechanism across the multi-views to increase spatial consistency, and a feature-aligned module to achieves both precise controllability and temporal consistency. Our method can generate up to 40 frames of video without loss of consistency which is about 5 times longer compared with state-of-the-art methods. Instead of randomly generating new data, we further design a sampling policy to let Delphi generate new data that are similar to those failure cases to improve the sample efficiency. This is achieved by building a failure-case driven framework with the help of pre-trained visual language models. Our extensive experiment demonstrates that our Delphi generates a higher quality of long videos surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods. Consequentially, with only generating 4% of the training dataset size, our framework is able to go beyond perception and prediction tasks, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, boost the planning performance of the end-to-end autonomous driving model by a margin of 25%.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The integration of Differential Privacy (DP) with diffusion models (DMs) presents a promising yet challenging frontier, particularly due to the substantial memorization capabilities of DMs that pose significant privacy risks. Differential privacy offers a rigorous framework for safeguarding individual data points during model training, with Differential Privacy Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) being a prominent implementation. Diffusion method decomposes image generation into iterative steps, theoretically aligning well with DP's incremental noise addition. Despite the natural fit, the unique architecture of DMs necessitates tailored approaches to effectively balance privacy-utility trade-off. Recent developments in this field have highlighted the potential for generating high-quality synthetic data by pre-training on public data (i.e., ImageNet) and fine-tuning on private data, however, there is a pronounced gap in research on optimizing the trade-offs involved in DP settings, particularly concerning parameter efficiency and model scalability. Our work addresses this by proposing a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy optimized for private diffusion models, which minimizes the number of trainable parameters to enhance the privacy-utility trade-off. We empirically demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in DP synthesis, significantly surpassing previous benchmarks on widely studied datasets (e.g., with only 0.47M trainable parameters, achieving a more than 35% improvement over the previous state-of-the-art with a small privacy budget on the CelebA-64 dataset).

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While there are a lot of models for instance segmentation, PolarMask stands out as a unique one that represents an object by a Polar coordinate system. With an anchor-box-free design and a single-stage framework that conducts detection and segmentation at one time, PolarMask is proved to be able to balance efficiency and accuracy. Hence, it can be easily connected with other downstream real-time applications. In this work, we observe that there are two deficiencies associated with PolarMask: (i) inability of representing concave objects and (ii) inefficiency in using ray regression. We propose MP-PolarMask (Multi-Point PolarMask) by taking advantage of multiple Polar systems. The main idea is to extend from one main Polar system to four auxiliary Polar systems, thus capable of representing more complicated convex-and-concave-mixed shapes. We validate MP-PolarMask on both general objects and food objects of the COCO dataset, and the results demonstrate significant improvement of 13.69% in AP_L and 7.23% in AP over PolarMask with 36 rays.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Code completion models have made significant progress in recent years. Recently, repository-level code completion has drawn more attention in modern software development, and several baseline methods and benchmarks have been proposed. However, existing repository-level code completion methods often fall short of fully using the extensive context of a project repository, such as the intricacies of relevant files and class hierarchies. Besides, the existing benchmarks usually focus on limited code completion scenarios, which cannot reflect the repository-level code completion abilities well of existing methods. To address these limitations, we propose the R2C2-Coder to enhance and benchmark the real-world repository-level code completion abilities of code Large Language Models, where the R2C2-Coder includes a code prompt construction method R2C2-Enhance and a well-designed benchmark R2C2-Bench. Specifically, first, in R2C2-Enhance, we first construct the candidate retrieval pool and then assemble the completion prompt by retrieving from the retrieval pool for each completion cursor position. Second, based on R2C2 -Enhance, we can construct a more challenging and diverse R2C2-Bench with training, validation and test splits, where a context perturbation strategy is proposed to simulate the real-world repository-level code completion well. Extensive results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our R2C2-Coder.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Model-based reinforcement learning agents utilizing transformers have shown improved sample efficiency due to their ability to model extended context, resulting in more accurate world models. However, for complex reasoning and planning tasks, these methods primarily rely on continuous representations. This complicates modeling of discrete properties of the real world such as disjoint object classes between which interpolation is not plausible. In this work, we introduce discrete abstract representations for transformer-based learning (DART), a sample-efficient method utilizing discrete representations for modeling both the world and learning behavior. We incorporate a transformer-decoder for auto-regressive world modeling and a transformer-encoder for learning behavior by attending to task-relevant cues in the discrete representation of the world model. For handling partial observability, we aggregate information from past time steps as memory tokens. DART outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods that do not use look-ahead search on the Atari 100k sample efficiency benchmark with a median human-normalized score of 0.790 and beats humans in 9 out of 26 games.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Input-output safeguards are used to detect anomalies in the traces produced by Large Language Models (LLMs) systems. These detectors are at the core of diverse safety-critical applications such as real-time monitoring, offline evaluation of traces, and content moderation. However, there is no widely recognized methodology to evaluate them. To fill this gap, we introduce the Benchmarks for the Evaluation of LLM Safeguards (BELLS), a structured collection of tests, organized into three categories: (1) established failure tests, based on already-existing benchmarks for well-defined failure modes, aiming to compare the performance of current input-output safeguards; (2) emerging failure tests, to measure generalization to never-seen-before failure modes and encourage the development of more general safeguards; (3) next-gen architecture tests, for more complex scaffolding (such as LLM-agents and multi-agent systems), aiming to foster the development of safeguards that could adapt to future applications for which no safeguard currently exists. Furthermore, we implement and share the first next-gen architecture test, using the MACHIAVELLI environment, along with an interactive visualization of the dataset.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Understanding the inner working functionality of large-scale deep neural networks is challenging yet crucial in several high-stakes applications. Mechanistic inter- pretability is an emergent field that tackles this challenge, often by identifying human-understandable subgraphs in deep neural networks known as circuits. In vision-pretrained models, these subgraphs are usually interpreted by visualizing their node features through a popular technique called feature visualization. Recent works have analyzed the stability of different feature visualization types under the adversarial model manipulation framework. This paper starts by addressing limitations in existing works by proposing a novel attack called ProxPulse that simultaneously manipulates the two types of feature visualizations. Surprisingly, when analyzing these attacks under the umbrella of visual circuits, we find that visual circuits show some robustness to ProxPulse. We, therefore, introduce a new attack based on ProxPulse that unveils the manipulability of visual circuits, shedding light on their lack of robustness. The effectiveness of these attacks is validated using pre-trained AlexNet and ResNet-50 models on ImageNet.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Continual Pre-Training (CPT) on Large Language Models (LLMs) has been widely used to expand the model's fundamental understanding of specific downstream domains (e.g., math and code). For the CPT on domain-specific LLMs, one important question is how to choose the optimal mixture ratio between the general-corpus (e.g., Dolma, Slim-pajama) and the downstream domain-corpus. Existing methods usually adopt laborious human efforts by grid-searching on a set of mixture ratios, which require high GPU training consumption costs. Besides, we cannot guarantee the selected ratio is optimal for the specific domain. To address the limitations of existing methods, inspired by the Scaling Law for performance prediction, we propose to investigate the Scaling Law of the Domain-specific Continual Pre-Training (D-CPT Law) to decide the optimal mixture ratio with acceptable training costs for LLMs of different sizes. Specifically, by fitting the D-CPT Law, we can easily predict the general and downstream performance of arbitrary mixture ratios, model sizes, and dataset sizes using small-scale training costs on limited experiments. Moreover, we also extend our standard D-CPT Law on cross-domain settings and propose the Cross-Domain D-CPT Law to predict the D-CPT law of target domains, where very small training costs (about 1% of the normal training costs) are needed for the target domains. Comprehensive experimental results on six downstream domains demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our proposed D-CPT Law and Cross-Domain D-CPT Law.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multi-object tracking (MOT) is an essential technique for navigation in autonomous driving. In tracking-by-detection systems, biases, false positives, and misses, which are referred to as outliers, are inevitable due to complex traffic scenarios. Recent tracking methods are based on filtering algorithms that overlook these outliers, leading to reduced tracking accuracy or even loss of the objects trajectory. To handle this challenge, we adopt a probabilistic perspective, regarding the generation of outliers as misspecification between the actual distribution of measurement data and the nominal measurement model used for filtering. We further demonstrate that, by designing a convolutional operation, we can mitigate this misspecification. Incorporating this operation into the widely used unscented Kalman filter (UKF) in commonly adopted tracking algorithms, we derive a variant of the UKF that is robust to outliers, called the convolutional UKF (ConvUKF). We show that ConvUKF maintains the Gaussian conjugate property, thus allowing for real-time tracking. We also prove that ConvUKF has a bounded tracking error in the presence of outliers, which implies robust stability. The experimental results on the KITTI and nuScenes datasets show improved accuracy compared to representative baseline algorithms for MOT tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>What makes large language models (LLMs) impressive is also what makes them hard to evaluate: their diversity of uses. To evaluate these models, we must understand the purposes they will be used for. We consider a setting where these deployment decisions are made by people, and in particular, people's beliefs about where an LLM will perform well. We model such beliefs as the consequence of a human generalization function: having seen what an LLM gets right or wrong, people generalize to where else it might succeed. We collect a dataset of 19K examples of how humans make generalizations across 79 tasks from the MMLU and BIG-Bench benchmarks. We show that the human generalization function can be predicted using NLP methods: people have consistent structured ways to generalize. We then evaluate LLM alignment with the human generalization function. Our results show that -- especially for cases where the cost of mistakes is high -- more capable models (e.g. GPT-4) can do worse on the instances people choose to use them for, exactly because they are not aligned with the human generalization function.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As cutting-edge Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models already excel at producing remarkable single images, an even more challenging task, i.e., multi-turn interactive image generation begins to attract the attention of related research communities. This task requires models to interact with users over multiple turns to generate a coherent sequence of images. However, since users may switch subjects frequently, current efforts struggle to maintain subject consistency while generating diverse images. To address this issue, we introduce a training-free multi-agent framework called AutoStudio. AutoStudio employs three agents based on large language models (LLMs) to handle interactions, along with a stable diffusion (SD) based agent for generating high-quality images. Specifically, AutoStudio consists of (i) a subject manager to interpret interaction dialogues and manage the context of each subject, (ii) a layout generator to generate fine-grained bounding boxes to control subject locations, (iii) a supervisor to provide suggestions for layout refinements, and (iv) a drawer to complete image generation. Furthermore, we introduce a Parallel-UNet to replace the original UNet in the drawer, which employs two parallel cross-attention modules for exploiting subject-aware features. We also introduce a subject-initialized generation method to better preserve small subjects. Our AutoStudio hereby can generate a sequence of multi-subject images interactively and consistently. Extensive experiments on the public CMIGBench benchmark and human evaluations show that AutoStudio maintains multi-subject consistency across multiple turns well, and it also raises the state-of-the-art performance by 13.65% in average Frechet Inception Distance and 2.83% in average character-character similarity.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated proficiency across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks but often require additional training, such as continual pre-training and supervised fine-tuning. However, the costs associated with this, primarily due to their large parameter count, remain high. This paper proposes leveraging \emph{sparsity} in pre-trained LLMs to expedite this training process. By observing sparsity in activated neurons during forward iterations, we identify the potential for computational speed-ups by excluding inactive neurons. We address associated challenges by extending existing neuron importance evaluation metrics and introducing a ladder omission rate scheduler. Our experiments on Llama-2 demonstrate that Sparsity-Accelerated Training (SAT) achieves comparable or superior performance to standard training while significantly accelerating the process. Specifically, SAT achieves a $45\%$ throughput improvement in continual pre-training and saves $38\%$ training time in supervised fine-tuning in practice. It offers a simple, hardware-agnostic, and easily deployable framework for additional LLM training. Our code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The widespread usage of online Large Language Models (LLMs) inference services has raised significant privacy concerns about the potential exposure of private information in user inputs to eavesdroppers or untrustworthy service providers. Existing privacy protection methods for LLMs suffer from insufficient privacy protection, performance degradation, or severe inference time overhead. In this paper, we propose PrivacyRestore to protect the privacy of user inputs during LLM inference. PrivacyRestore directly removes privacy spans in user inputs and restores privacy information via activation steering during inference. The privacy spans are encoded as restoration vectors. We propose Attention-aware Weighted Aggregation (AWA) which aggregates restoration vectors of all privacy spans in the input into a meta restoration vector. AWA not only ensures proper representation of all privacy spans but also prevents attackers from inferring the privacy spans from the meta restoration vector alone. This meta restoration vector, along with the query with privacy spans removed, is then sent to the server. The experimental results show that PrivacyRestore can protect private information while maintaining acceptable levels of performance and inference efficiency.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper presents TE-NeXt, a novel and efficient architecture for Traversability Estimation (TE) from sparse LiDAR point clouds based on a residual convolution block. TE-NeXt block fuses notions of current trends such as attention mechanisms and 3D sparse convolutions. TE-NeXt aims to demonstrate high capacity for generalisation in a variety of urban and natural environments, using well-known and accessible datasets such as SemanticKITTI, Rellis-3D and SemanticUSL. Thus, the designed architecture ouperforms state-of-the-art methods in the problem of semantic segmentation, demonstrating better results in unstructured environments and maintaining high reliability and robustness in urbans environments, which leads to better abstraction. Implementation is available in a open repository to the scientific community with the aim of ensuring the reproducibility of results.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Subgroup-discovery methods allow users to obtain simple descriptions of interesting regions in a dataset. Using constraints in subgroup discovery can enhance interpretability even further. In this article, we focus on two types of constraints: First, we limit the number of features used in subgroup descriptions, making the latter sparse. Second, we propose the novel optimization problem of finding alternative subgroup descriptions, which cover a similar set of data objects as a given subgroup but use different features. We describe how to integrate both constraint types into heuristic subgroup-discovery methods. Further, we propose a novel Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) formulation of subgroup discovery as a white-box optimization problem, which allows solver-based search for subgroups and is open to a variety of constraint types. Additionally, we prove that both constraint types lead to an NP-hard optimization problem. Finally, we employ 27 binary-classification datasets to compare heuristic and solver-based search for unconstrained and constrained subgroup discovery. We observe that heuristic search methods often yield high-quality subgroups within a short runtime, also in scenarios with constraints.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This work presents a novel approach to neural architecture search (NAS) that aims to increase carbon efficiency for the model design process. The proposed framework CE-NAS addresses the key challenge of high carbon cost associated with NAS by exploring the carbon emission variations of energy and energy differences of different NAS algorithms. At the high level, CE-NAS leverages a reinforcement-learning agent to dynamically adjust GPU resources based on carbon intensity, predicted by a time-series transformer, to balance energy-efficient sampling and energy-intensive evaluation tasks. Furthermore, CE-NAS leverages a recently proposed multi-objective optimizer to effectively reduce the NAS search space. We demonstrate the efficacy of CE-NAS in lowering carbon emissions while achieving SOTA results for both NAS datasets and open-domain NAS tasks. For example, on the HW-NasBench dataset, CE-NAS reduces carbon emissions by up to 7.22X while maintaining a search efficiency comparable to vanilla NAS. For open-domain NAS tasks, CE-NAS achieves SOTA results with 97.35% top-1 accuracy on CIFAR-10 with only 1.68M parameters and a carbon consumption of 38.53 lbs of CO2. On ImageNet, our searched model achieves 80.6% top-1 accuracy with a 0.78 ms TensorRT latency using FP16 on NVIDIA V100, consuming only 909.86 lbs of CO2, making it comparable to other one-shot-based NAS baselines.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Mixup and its variants form a popular class of data augmentation techniques.Using a random sample pair, it generates a new sample by linear interpolation of the inputs and labels. However, generating only one single interpolation may limit its augmentation ability. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective extension called multi-mix, which generates multiple interpolations from a sample pair. With an ordered sequence of generated samples, multi-mix can better guide the training process than standard mixup. Moreover, theoretically, this can also reduce the stochastic gradient variance. Extensive experiments on a number of synthetic and large-scale data sets demonstrate that multi-mix outperforms various mixup variants and non-mixup-based baselines in terms of generalization, robustness, and calibration.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability, transformer, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Zero-shot and in-context learning enable solving tasks without model fine-tuning, making them essential for developing generative model solutions. Therefore, it is crucial to understand whether a pretrained model can be prompted to approximate any function, i.e., whether it is a universal in-context approximator. While it was recently shown that transformer models do possess this property, these results rely on their attention mechanism. Hence, these findings do not apply to fully recurrent architectures like RNNs, LSTMs, and the increasingly popular SSMs. We demonstrate that RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs, Linear RNNs, and linear gated architectures such as Mamba and Hawk/Griffin can also serve as universal in-context approximators. To streamline our argument, we introduce a programming language called LSRL that compiles to these fully recurrent architectures. LSRL may be of independent interest for further studies of fully recurrent models, such as constructing interpretability benchmarks. We also study the role of multiplicative gating and observe that architectures incorporating such gating (e.g., LSTMs, GRUs, Hawk/Griffin) can implement certain operations more stably, making them more viable candidates for practical in-context universal approximation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Segmentation is an integral module in many visual computing applications such as virtual try-on, medical imaging, autonomous driving, and agricultural automation. These applications often involve either widespread consumer use or highly variable environments, both of which can degrade the quality of visual sensor data, whether from a common mobile phone or an expensive satellite imaging camera. In addition to external noises like user difference or weather conditions, internal noises such as variations in camera quality or lens distortion can affect the performance of segmentation models during both development and deployment. In this work, we present an efficient, adaptable, and gradient-free method to enhance the robustness of learning-based segmentation models across training. First, we introduce a novel adaptive sensitivity analysis (ASA) using Kernel Inception Distance (KID) on basis perturbations to benchmark perturbation sensitivity of pre-trained segmentation models. Then, we model the sensitivity curve using the adaptive SA and sample perturbation hyperparameter values accordingly. Finally, we conduct adversarial training with the selected perturbation values and dynamically re-evaluate robustness during online training. Our method, implemented end-to-end with minimal fine-tuning required, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art data augmentation techniques for segmentation. It shows significant improvement in both clean data evaluation and real-world adverse scenario evaluation across various segmentation datasets used in visual computing and computer graphics applications.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing medical Question-Answering (medQA) through extensive use of medical literature. However, their performance is often hampered by outdated training data and a lack of explainability, which limits clinical applicability. This study aimed to create and assess UroBot, a urology-specialized chatbot, by comparing it with state-of-the-art models and the performance of urologists on urological board questions, ensuring full clinician-verifiability. UroBot was developed using OpenAI's GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and GPT-4o models, employing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and the latest 2023 guidelines from the European Association of Urology (EAU). The evaluation included ten runs of 200 European Board of Urology (EBU) In-Service Assessment (ISA) questions, with performance assessed by the mean Rate of Correct Answers (RoCA). UroBot-4o achieved an average RoCA of 88.4%, surpassing GPT-4o by 10.8%, with a score of 77.6%. It was also clinician-verifiable and exhibited the highest run agreement as indicated by Fleiss' Kappa (k = 0.979). By comparison, the average performance of urologists on board questions, as reported in the literature, is 68.7%. UroBot's clinician-verifiable nature and superior accuracy compared to both existing models and urologists on board questions highlight its potential for clinical integration. The study also provides the necessary code and instructions for further development of UroBot.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Unsupervised Domain Adaptation has been an efficient approach to transferring the semantic segmentation model across data distributions. Meanwhile, the recent Open-vocabulary Semantic Scene understanding based on large-scale vision language models is effective in open-set settings because it can learn diverse concepts and categories. However, these prior methods fail to generalize across different camera views due to the lack of cross-view geometric modeling. At present, there are limited studies analyzing cross-view learning. To address this problem, we introduce a novel Unsupervised Cross-view Adaptation Learning approach to modeling the geometric structural change across views in Semantic Scene Understanding. First, we introduce a novel Cross-view Geometric Constraint on Unpaired Data to model structural changes in images and segmentation masks across cameras. Second, we present a new Geodesic Flow-based Correlation Metric to efficiently measure the geometric structural changes across camera views. Third, we introduce a novel view-condition prompting mechanism to enhance the view-information modeling of the open-vocabulary segmentation network in cross-view adaptation learning. The experiments on different cross-view adaptation benchmarks have shown the effectiveness of our approach in cross-view modeling, demonstrating that we achieve State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance compared to prior unsupervised domain adaptation and open-vocabulary semantic segmentation methods.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The Vision-Language Foundation Model has recently shown outstanding performance in various perception learning tasks. The outstanding performance of the vision-language model mainly relies on large-scale pre-training datasets and different data augmentation techniques. However, the domain generalization problem of the vision-language foundation model needs to be addressed. This problem has limited the generalizability of the vision-language foundation model to unknown data distributions. In this paper, we introduce a new simple but efficient Diffusion Sampling approach to Domain Generalization (ED-SAM) to improve the generalizability of the vision-language foundation model. Our theoretical analysis in this work reveals the critical role and relation of the diffusion model to domain generalization in the vision-language foundation model. Then, based on the insightful analysis, we introduce a new simple yet effective Transport Transformation to diffusion sampling method. It can effectively generate adversarial samples to improve the generalizability of the foundation model against unknown data distributions. The experimental results on different scales of vision-language pre-training datasets, including CC3M, CC12M, and LAION400M, have consistently shown State-of-the-Art performance and scalability of the proposed ED-SAM approach compared to the other recent methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Ridgeless regression has garnered attention among researchers, particularly in light of the ``Benign Overfitting'' phenomenon, where models interpolating noisy samples demonstrate robust generalization. However, kernel ridgeless regression does not always perform well due to the lack of flexibility. This paper enhances kernel ridgeless regression with Locally-Adaptive-Bandwidths (LAB) RBF kernels, incorporating kernel learning techniques to improve performance in both experiments and theory. For the first time, we demonstrate that functions learned from LAB RBF kernels belong to an integral space of Reproducible Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHSs). Despite the absence of explicit regularization in the proposed model, its optimization is equivalent to solving an $\ell_0$-regularized problem in the integral space of RKHSs, elucidating the origin of its generalization ability. Taking an approximation analysis viewpoint, we introduce an $l_q$-norm analysis technique (with $0<q<1$) to derive the learning rate for the proposed model under mild conditions. This result deepens our theoretical understanding, explaining that our algorithm's robust approximation ability arises from the large capacity of the integral space of RKHSs, while its generalization ability is ensured by sparsity, controlled by the number of support vectors. Experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets validate our theoretical conclusions.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Knowledge editing is a rising technique for efficiently updating factual knowledge in Large Language Models (LLMs) with minimal alteration of parameters. However, recent studies have identified concerning side effects, such as knowledge distortion and the deterioration of general abilities, that have emerged after editing. This survey presents a comprehensive study of these side effects, providing a unified view of the challenges associated with knowledge editing in LLMs. We discuss related works and summarize potential research directions to overcome these limitations. Our work highlights the limitations of current knowledge editing methods, emphasizing the need for deeper understanding of inner knowledge structures of LLMs and improved knowledge editing methods.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated learning (FL) enables a set of geographically distributed clients to collectively train a model through a server. Classically, the training process is synchronous, but can be made asynchronous to maintain its speed in presence of slow clients and in heterogeneous networks. The vast majority of Byzantine fault-tolerant FL systems however rely on a synchronous training process. Our solution is one of the first Byzantine-resilient and asynchronous FL algorithms that does not require an auxiliary server dataset and is not delayed by stragglers, which are shortcomings of previous works. Intuitively, the server in our solution waits to receive a minimum number of updates from clients on its latest model to safely update it, and is later able to safely leverage the updates that late clients might send. We compare the performance of our solution with state-of-the-art algorithms on both image and text datasets under gradient inversion, perturbation, and backdoor attacks. Our results indicate that our solution trains a model faster than previous synchronous FL solution, and maintains a higher accuracy, up to 1.54x and up to 1.75x for perturbation and gradient inversion attacks respectively, in the presence of Byzantine clients than previous asynchronous FL solutions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated learning (FL) systems enable multiple clients to train a machine learning model iteratively through synchronously exchanging the intermediate model weights with a single server. The scalability of such FL systems can be limited by two factors: server idle time due to synchronous communication and the risk of a single server becoming the bottleneck. In this paper, we propose a new FL architecture, to our knowledge, the first multi-server FL system that is entirely asynchronous, and therefore addresses these two limitations simultaneously. Our solution keeps both servers and clients continuously active. As in previous multi-server methods, clients interact solely with their nearest server, ensuring efficient update integration into the model. Differently, however, servers also periodically update each other asynchronously, and never postpone interactions with clients. We compare our solution to three representative baselines - FedAvg, FedAsync and HierFAVG - on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 image classification datasets and on the WikiText-2 language modeling dataset. Our solution converges to similar or higher accuracy levels than previous baselines and requires 61% less time to do so in geo-distributed settings.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The fine-tuning of open-source large language models (LLMs) for machine translation has recently received considerable attention, marking a shift towards data-centric research from traditional neural machine translation. However, the area of data collection for instruction fine-tuning in machine translation remains relatively underexplored. In this paper, we present LexMatcher, a simple yet effective method for data collection that leverages bilingual dictionaries to generate a dataset, the design of which is driven by the coverage of senses found in these dictionaries. The dataset comprises a subset retrieved from an existing corpus and a smaller synthesized subset which supplements the infrequent senses of polysemous words. Utilizing LLaMA2 as our base model, our approach outperforms the established baselines on the WMT2022 test sets and also exhibits significant performance improvements in tasks related to word sense disambiguation and specialized terminology translation. These results underscore the effectiveness of LexMatcher in enhancing LLM-based machine translation.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Online content is filled with logos, from ads and social media posts to website branding and product placements. Consequently, these logos are prevalent in the extensive web-scraped datasets used to pretrain Vision-Language Models, which are used for a wide array of tasks (content moderation, object classification). While these models have been shown to learn harmful correlations in various tasks, whether these correlations include logos remains understudied. Understanding this is especially important due to logos often being used by public-facing entities like brands and government agencies. To that end, we develop SLANT: A Spurious Logo ANalysis Toolkit. Our key finding is that some logos indeed lead to spurious incorrect predictions, for example, adding the Adidas logo to a photo of a person causes a model classify the person as greedy. SLANT contains a semi-automatic mechanism for mining such "spurious" logos. The mechanism consists of a comprehensive logo bank, CC12M-LogoBank, and an algorithm that searches the bank for logos that VLMs spuriously correlate with a user-provided downstream recognition target. We uncover various seemingly harmless logos that VL models correlate 1) with negative human adjectives 2) with the concept of `harmlessness'; causing models to misclassify harmful online content as harmless, and 3) with user-provided object concepts; causing lower recognition accuracy on ImageNet zero-shot classification. Furthermore, SLANT's logos can be seen as effective attacks against foundational models; an attacker could place a spurious logo on harmful content, causing the model to misclassify it as harmless. This threat is alarming considering the simplicity of logo attacks, increasing the attack surface of VL models. As a defense, we include in our Toolkit two effective mitigation strategies that seamlessly integrate with zero-shot inference of foundation models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we introduce SemiRES, a semi-supervised framework that effectively leverages a combination of labeled and unlabeled data to perform RES. A significant hurdle in applying semi-supervised techniques to RES is the prevalence of noisy pseudo-labels, particularly at the boundaries of objects. SemiRES incorporates the Segment Anything Model (SAM), renowned for its precise boundary demarcation, to improve the accuracy of these pseudo-labels. Within SemiRES, we offer two alternative matching strategies: IoU-based Optimal Matching (IOM) and Composite Parts Integration (CPI). These strategies are designed to extract the most accurate masks from SAM's output, thus guiding the training of the student model with enhanced precision. In instances where a precise mask cannot be matched from the available candidates, we develop the Pixel-Wise Adjustment (PWA) strategy, guiding the student model's training directly by the pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments on three RES benchmarks--RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and G-Ref reveal its superior performance compared to fully supervised methods. Remarkably, with only 1% labeled data, our SemiRES outperforms the supervised baseline by a large margin, e.g. +18.64% gains on RefCOCO val set.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Plant classification is vital for ecological conservation and agricultural productivity, enhancing our understanding of plant growth dynamics and aiding species preservation. The advent of deep learning (DL) techniques has revolutionized this field by enabling autonomous feature extraction, significantly reducing the dependence on manual expertise. However, conventional DL models often rely solely on single data sources, failing to capture the full biological diversity of plant species comprehensively. Recent research has turned to multimodal learning to overcome this limitation by integrating multiple data types, which enriches the representation of plant characteristics. This shift introduces the challenge of determining the optimal point for modality fusion. In this paper, we introduce a pioneering multimodal DL-based approach for plant classification with automatic modality fusion. Utilizing the multimodal fusion architecture search, our method integrates images from multiple plant organs-flowers, leaves, fruits, and stems-into a cohesive model. Our method achieves 83.48% accuracy on 956 classes of the PlantCLEF2015 dataset, surpassing state-of-the-art methods. It outperforms late fusion by 11.07% and is more robust to missing modalities. We validate our model against established benchmarks using standard performance metrics and McNemar's test, further underscoring its superiority.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Synthetic tabular data generation with differential privacy is a crucial problem to enable data sharing with formal privacy. Despite a rich history of methodological research and development, developing differentially private tabular data generators that can provide realistic synthetic datasets remains challenging. This paper introduces DP-LLMTGen -- a novel framework for differentially private tabular data synthesis that leverages pretrained large language models (LLMs). DP-LLMTGen models sensitive datasets using a two-stage fine-tuning procedure with a novel loss function specifically designed for tabular data. Subsequently, it generates synthetic data through sampling the fine-tuned LLMs. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that DP-LLMTGen outperforms a variety of existing mechanisms across multiple datasets and privacy settings. Additionally, we conduct an ablation study and several experimental analyses to deepen our understanding of LLMs in addressing this important problem. Finally, we highlight the controllable generation ability of DP-LLMTGen through a fairness-constrained generation setting.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Learning from human preference data has emerged as the dominant paradigm for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). The two most common families of techniques -- online reinforcement learning (RL) such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and offline contrastive methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) -- were positioned as equivalent in prior work due to the fact that both have to start from the same offline preference dataset. To further expand our theoretical understanding of the similarities and differences between online and offline techniques for preference fine-tuning, we conduct a rigorous analysis through the lens of dataset coverage, a concept that captures how the training data covers the test distribution and is widely used in RL. We prove that a global coverage condition is both necessary and sufficient for offline contrastive methods to converge to the optimal policy, but a weaker partial coverage condition suffices for online RL methods. This separation provides one explanation of why online RL methods can perform better than offline methods, especially when the offline preference data is not diverse enough. Finally, motivated by our preceding theoretical observations, we derive a hybrid preference optimization (HyPO) algorithm that uses offline data for contrastive-based preference optimization and online data for KL regularization. Theoretically and empirically, we demonstrate that HyPO is more performant than its pure offline counterpart DPO, while still preserving its computation and memory efficiency.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We demonstrate a multi-fidelity (MF) machine learning ensemble framework for the inverse design of photonic surfaces, trained on a dataset of 11,759 samples that we fabricate using high throughput femtosecond laser processing. The MF ensemble combines an initial low fidelity model for generating design solutions, with a high fidelity model that refines these solutions through local optimization. The combined MF ensemble can generate multiple disparate sets of laser-processing parameters that can each produce the same target input spectral emissivity with high accuracy (root mean squared errors < 2%). SHapley Additive exPlanations analysis shows transparent model interpretability of the complex relationship between laser parameters and spectral emissivity. Finally, the MF ensemble is experimentally validated by fabricating and evaluating photonic surface designs that it generates for improved efficiency energy harvesting devices. Our approach provides a powerful tool for advancing the inverse design of photonic surfaces in energy harvesting applications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Dynamic 3D interaction has witnessed great interest in recent works, while creating such 4D content remains challenging. One solution is to animate 3D scenes with physics-based simulation, and the other is to learn the deformation of static 3D objects with the distillation of video generative models. The former one requires assigning precise physical properties to the target object, otherwise the simulated results would become unnatural. The latter tends to formulate the video with minor motions and discontinuous frames, due to the absence of physical constraints in deformation learning. We think that video generative models are trained with real-world captured data, capable of judging physical phenomenon in simulation environments. To this end, we propose DreamPhysics in this work, which estimates physical properties of 3D Gaussian Splatting with video diffusion priors. DreamPhysics supports both image- and text-conditioned guidance, optimizing physical parameters via score distillation sampling with frame interpolation and log gradient. Based on a material point method simulator with proper physical parameters, our method can generate 4D content with realistic motions. Experimental results demonstrate that, by distilling the prior knowledge of video diffusion models, inaccurate physical properties can be gradually refined for high-quality simulation.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Training on mixtures of data distributions is now common in many modern machine learning pipelines, useful for performing well on several downstream tasks. Group distributionally robust optimization (group DRO) is one popular way to learn mixture weights for training a specific model class, but group DRO methods suffer for non-linear models due to non-convex loss functions and when the models are non-parametric. We address these challenges by proposing to solve a more general DRO problem, giving a method we call MixMax. MixMax selects mixture weights by maximizing a particular concave objective with entropic mirror ascent, and, crucially, we prove that optimally fitting this mixture distribution over the set of bounded predictors returns a group DRO optimal model. Experimentally, we tested MixMax on a sequence modeling task with transformers and on a variety of non-parametric learning problems. In all instances MixMax matched or outperformed the standard data mixing and group DRO baselines, and in particular, MixMax improved the performance of XGBoost over the only baseline, data balancing, for variations of the ACSIncome and CelebA annotations datasets.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The increasing difficulty in accurately detecting forged images generated by AIGC(Artificial Intelligence Generative Content) poses many risks, necessitating the development of effective methods to identify and further locate forged areas. In this paper, to facilitate research efforts, we construct a DA-HFNet forged image dataset guided by text or image-assisted GAN and Diffusion model. Our goal is to utilize a hierarchical progressive network to capture forged artifacts at different scales for detection and localization. Specifically, it relies on a dual-attention mechanism to adaptively fuse multi-modal image features in depth, followed by a multi-branch interaction network to thoroughly interact image features at different scales and improve detector performance by leveraging dependencies between layers. Additionally, we extract more sensitive noise fingerprints to obtain more prominent forged artifact features in the forged areas. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating significant performance improvements compared to state-of-the-art methods for forged image detection and localization.The code and dataset will be released in the future.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This work addresses the challenge of video depth estimation, which expects not only per-frame accuracy but, more importantly, cross-frame consistency. Instead of directly developing a depth estimator from scratch, we reformulate the prediction task into a conditional generation problem. This allows us to leverage the prior knowledge embedded in existing video generation models, thereby reducing learn- ing difficulty and enhancing generalizability. Concretely, we study how to tame the public Stable Video Diffusion (SVD) to predict reliable depth from input videos using a mixture of image depth and video depth datasets. We empirically confirm that a procedural training strategy - first optimizing the spatial layers of SVD and then optimizing the temporal layers while keeping the spatial layers frozen - yields the best results in terms of both spatial accuracy and temporal consistency. We further examine the sliding window strategy for inference on arbitrarily long videos. Our observations indicate a trade-off between efficiency and performance, with a one-frame overlap already producing favorable results. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach, termed ChronoDepth, over existing alternatives, particularly in terms of the temporal consistency of the estimated depth. Additionally, we highlight the benefits of more consistent video depth in two practical applications: depth-conditioned video generation and novel view synthesis.

The method is simple to implement, introduces negligible overheads, and can be combined with existing augmentations. We demonstrate improved robustness and uncertainty quantification on the corrupted image benchmarks of the CIFAR and TinyImageNet datasets.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Understanding how semantic meaning is encoded in the representation spaces of large language models is a fundamental problem in interpretability. In this paper, we study the two foundational questions in this area. First, how are categorical concepts, such as {'mammal', 'bird', 'reptile', 'fish'}, represented? Second, how are hierarchical relations between concepts encoded? For example, how is the fact that 'dog' is a kind of 'mammal' encoded? We show how to extend the linear representation hypothesis to answer these questions. We find a remarkably simple structure: simple categorical concepts are represented as simplices, hierarchically related concepts are orthogonal in a sense we make precise, and (in consequence) complex concepts are represented as polytopes constructed from direct sums of simplices, reflecting the hierarchical structure. We validate these theoretical results on the Gemma large language model, estimating representations for 957 hierarchically related concepts using data from WordNet.</li>

Our main idea is to exploit knowledge distillation to extract the alignment information from existing well-aligned LLMs and integrate it into unaligned LLMs in a plug-and-play fashion. Methodology, we employ delta debugging to identify the critical components of knowledge necessary for effective distillation. On the harmful question dataset, our method significantly enhances the average defense success rate by approximately 14.41%, reaching as high as 51.39%, in 17 unaligned pre-trained LLMs, without compromising performance.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Delegating authentication to identity providers like Google or Facebook, while convenient, compromises user privacy. Global identifiers enable internet-wide tracking; furthermore, identity providers can also record users' associations. We show that neither is a necessary evil by presenting the BISON pseudonym derivation protocol, inspired by Oblivious Pseudorandom Functions. It hides the service provider's identity from the identity provider, yet produces a trusted, scoped, immutable pseudonym. Colluding service providers cannot link BISON pseudonyms. This prevents user tracking. BISON does not require long-lived state on the user device, and does not add additional actors to the authentication process. BISON uses lightweight cryptography. Pseudonym derivation requires a total of four elliptic curve scalar-point multiplications and four hash function evaluations, totaling to ~3 ms in our proof of concept implementation. BISON is designed to integrate into existing authentication protocols. We provide an OpenID Connect extension that allows OIDC's PPID pseudonyms to be derived using BISON. This demonstrates that BISON's privacy guarantees can be realized in practice. For these reasons, BISON is a crucial stepping stone towards realizing the privacy-preserving internet of tomorrow.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Given the remarkable capabilities of large language models (LLMs), there has been a growing interest in evaluating their similarity to the human brain. One approach towards quantifying this similarity is by measuring how well a model predicts neural signals, also called "brain score". Internal representations from LLMs achieve state-of-the-art brain scores, leading to speculation that they share computational principles with human language processing. This inference is only valid if the subset of neural activity predicted by LLMs reflects core elements of language processing. Here, we question this assumption by analyzing three neural datasets used in an impactful study on LLM-to-brain mappings, with a particular focus on an fMRI dataset where participants read short passages. We first find that when using shuffled train-test splits, as done in previous studies with these datasets, a trivial feature that encodes temporal autocorrelation not only outperforms LLMs but also accounts for the majority of neural variance that LLMs explain. We therefore use contiguous splits moving forward. Second, we explain the surprisingly high brain scores of untrained LLMs by showing they do not account for additional neural variance beyond two simple features: sentence length and sentence position. This undermines evidence used to claim that the transformer architecture biases computations to be more brain-like. Third, we find that brain scores of trained LLMs on this dataset can largely be explained by sentence length, position, and pronoun-dereferenced static word embeddings; a small, additional amount is explained by sense-specific embeddings and contextual representations of sentence structure. We conclude that over-reliance on brain scores can lead to over-interpretations of similarity between LLMs and brains, and emphasize the importance of deconstructing what LLMs are mapping to in neural signals.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>On the forefront of scientific computing, Deep Learning (DL), i.e., machine learning with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), has emerged a powerful new tool for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). It has been observed that DNNs are particularly well suited to weakening the effect of the curse of dimensionality, a term coined by Richard E. Bellman in the late `50s to describe challenges such as the exponential dependence of the sample complexity, i.e., the number of samples required to solve an approximation problem, on the dimension of the ambient space. However, although DNNs have been used to solve PDEs since the `90s, the literature underpinning their mathematical efficiency in terms of numerical analysis (i.e., stability, accuracy, and sample complexity), is only recently beginning to emerge. In this paper, we leverage recent advancements in function approximation using sparsity-based techniques and random sampling to develop and analyze an efficient high-dimensional PDE solver based on DL. We show, both theoretically and numerically, that it can compete with a novel stable and accurate compressive spectral collocation method. In particular, we demonstrate a new practical existence theorem, which establishes the existence of a class of trainable DNNs with suitable bounds on the network architecture and a sufficient condition on the sample complexity, with logarithmic or, at worst, linear scaling in dimension, such that the resulting networks stably and accurately approximate a diffusion-reaction PDE with high probability.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Retrieval-augmented generation integrates the capabilities of large language models with relevant information retrieved from an extensive corpus, yet encounters challenges when confronted with real-world noisy data. One recent solution is to train a filter module to find relevant content but only achieve suboptimal noise compression. In this paper, we propose to introduce the information bottleneck theory into retrieval-augmented generation. Our approach involves the filtration of noise by simultaneously maximizing the mutual information between compression and ground output, while minimizing the mutual information between compression and retrieved passage. In addition, we derive the formula of information bottleneck to facilitate its application in novel comprehensive evaluations, the selection of supervised fine-tuning data, and the construction of reinforcement learning rewards. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves significant improvements across various question answering datasets, not only in terms of the correctness of answer generation but also in the conciseness with $2.5\%$ compression rate.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Single image reflection removal is inherently ambiguous, as both the reflection and transmission components requiring separation may follow natural image statistics. Existing methods attempt to address the issue by using various types of low-level and physics-based cues as sources of reflection signals. However, these cues are not universally applicable, since they are only observable in specific capture scenarios. This leads to a significant performance drop when test images do not align with their assumptions. In this paper, we aim to explore a novel flexible interactive reflection removal approach that leverages various forms of sparse human guidance, such as points and bounding boxes, as auxiliary high-level prior to achieve robust reflection removal. However, incorporating the raw user guidance naively into the existing reflection removal network does not result in performance gains. To this end, we innovatively transform raw user input into a unified form -- reflection masks using an Interactive Segmentation Foundation Model. Such a design absorbs the quintessence of the foundational segmentation model and flexible human guidance, thereby mitigating the challenges of reflection separations. Furthermore, to fully utilize user guidance and reduce user annotation costs, we design a mask-guided reflection removal network, comprising our proposed self-adaptive prompt block. This block adaptively incorporates user guidance as anchors and refines transmission features via cross-attention mechanisms. Extensive results on real-world images validate that our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on various datasets with the help of flexible and sparse user guidance.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion-based text-to-image generation models trained on extensive text-image pairs have shown the capacity to generate photorealistic images consistent with textual descriptions. However, a significant limitation of these models is their slow sample generation, which requires iterative refinement through the same network. In this paper, we enhance Score identity Distillation (SiD) by developing long and short classifier-free guidance (LSG) to efficiently distill pretrained Stable Diffusion models without using real training data. SiD aims to optimize a model-based explicit score matching loss, utilizing a score-identity-based approximation alongside the proposed LSG for practical computation. By training exclusively with fake images synthesized with its one-step generator, SiD equipped with LSG rapidly improves FID and CLIP scores, achieving state-of-the-art FID performance while maintaining a competitive CLIP score. Specifically, its data-free distillation of Stable Diffusion 1.5 achieves a record low FID of 8.15 on the COCO-2014 validation set, with a CLIP score of 0.304 at an LSG scale of 1.5, and a FID of 9.56 with a CLIP score of 0.313 at an LSG scale of 2. We will make our PyTorch implementation and distilled Stable Diffusion one-step generators available at this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent work in interpretability shows that large language models (LLMs) can be adapted for new tasks in a learning-free way: it is possible to intervene on LLM representations to elicit desired behaviors for alignment. For instance, adding certain bias vectors to the outputs of certain attention heads is reported to boost the truthfulness of models. In this work, we show that localized fine-tuning serves as an effective alternative to such representation intervention methods. We introduce a framework called Localized Fine-Tuning on LLM Representations (LoFiT), which identifies a subset of attention heads that are most important for learning a specific task, then trains offset vectors to add to the model's hidden representations at those selected heads. LoFiT localizes to a sparse set of heads (3%) and learns the offset vectors from limited training data, comparable to the settings used for representation intervention. For truthfulness and reasoning tasks, we find that LoFiT's intervention vectors are more effective for LLM adaptation than vectors from representation intervention methods such as Inference-time Intervention. We also find that the localization step is important: selecting a task-specific set of attention heads can lead to higher performance than intervening on heads selected for a different task. Finally, for the tasks we study, LoFiT achieves comparable performance to other parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods such as LoRA, despite modifying 20x-200x fewer parameters than these methods.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative models on discrete state-spaces have a wide range of potential applications, particularly in the domain of natural sciences. In continuous state-spaces, controllable and flexible generation of samples with desired properties has been realized using guidance on diffusion and flow models. However, these guidance approaches are not readily amenable to discrete state-space models. Consequently, we introduce a general and principled method for applying guidance on such models. Our method depends on leveraging continuous-time Markov processes on discrete state-spaces, which unlocks computational tractability for sampling from a desired guided distribution. We demonstrate the utility of our approach, Discrete Guidance, on a range of applications including guided generation of images, small-molecules, DNA sequences and protein sequences.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the age of large-scale language models, benchmarks like the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) have been pivotal in pushing the boundaries of what AI can achieve in language comprehension and reasoning across diverse domains. However, as models continue to improve, their performance on these benchmarks has begun to plateau, making it increasingly difficult to discern differences in model capabilities. This paper introduces MMLU-Pro, an enhanced dataset designed to extend the mostly knowledge-driven MMLU benchmark by integrating more challenging, reasoning-focused questions and expanding the choice set from four to ten options. Additionally, MMLU-Pro eliminates the trivial and noisy questions in MMLU. Our experimental results show that MMLU-Pro not only raises the challenge, causing a significant drop in accuracy by 16% to 33% compared to MMLU but also demonstrates greater stability under varying prompts. With 24 different prompt styles tested, the sensitivity of model scores to prompt variations decreased from 4-5% in MMLU to just 2% in MMLU-Pro. Additionally, we found that models utilizing Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning achieved better performance on MMLU-Pro compared to direct answering, which is in stark contrast to the findings on the original MMLU, indicating that MMLU-Pro includes more complex reasoning questions. Our assessments confirm that MMLU-Pro is a more discriminative benchmark to better track progress in the field.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>3D representation is essential to the significant advance of 3D generation with 2D diffusion priors. As a flexible representation, NeRF has been first adopted for 3D representation. With density-based volumetric rendering, it however suffers both intensive computational overhead and inaccurate mesh extraction. Using a signed distance field and Marching Tetrahedra, DMTet allows for precise mesh extraction and real-time rendering but is limited in handling large topological changes in meshes, leading to optimization challenges. Alternatively, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is favored in both training and rendering efficiency while falling short in mesh extraction. In this work, we introduce a novel 3D representation, Tetrahedron Splatting (TeT-Splatting), that supports easy convergence during optimization, precise mesh extraction, and real-time rendering simultaneously. This is achieved by integrating surface-based volumetric rendering within a structured tetrahedral grid while preserving the desired ability of precise mesh extraction, and a tile-based differentiable tetrahedron rasterizer. Furthermore, we incorporate eikonal and normal consistency regularization terms for the signed distance field to improve generation quality and stability. Critically, our representation can be trained without mesh extraction, making the optimization process easier to converge. Our TeT-Splatting can be readily integrated in existing 3D generation pipelines, along with polygonal mesh for texture optimization. Extensive experiments show that our TeT-Splatting strikes a superior tradeoff among convergence speed, render efficiency, and mesh quality as compared to previous alternatives under varying 3D generation settings.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent works have explored how individual components of the CLIP-ViT model contribute to the final representation by leveraging the shared image-text representation space of CLIP. These components, such as attention heads and MLPs, have been shown to capture distinct image features like shape, color or texture. However, understanding the role of these components in arbitrary vision transformers (ViTs) is challenging. To this end, we introduce a general framework which can identify the roles of various components in ViTs beyond CLIP. Specifically, we (a) automate the decomposition of the final representation into contributions from different model components, and (b) linearly map these contributions to CLIP space to interpret them via text. Additionally, we introduce a novel scoring function to rank components by their importance with respect to specific features. Applying our framework to various ViT variants (e.g. DeiT, DINO, DINOv2, Swin, MaxViT), we gain insights into the roles of different components concerning particular image features.These insights facilitate applications such as image retrieval using text descriptions or reference images, visualizing token importance heatmaps, and mitigating spurious correlations.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper presents Deformable Neural Vessel Representations (DeNVeR), an unsupervised approach for vessel segmentation in X-ray videos without annotated ground truth. DeNVeR uses optical flow and layer separation, enhancing segmentation accuracy and adaptability through test-time training. A key component of our research is the introduction of the XACV dataset, the first X-ray angiography coronary video dataset with high-quality, manually labeled segmentation ground truth. Our evaluation demonstrates that DeNVeR outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in vessel segmentation. This paper marks an advance in medical imaging, providing a robust, data-efficient tool for disease diagnosis and treatment planning and setting a new standard for future research in video vessel segmentation.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text-to-image diffusion models have proven effective for solving many image editing tasks. However, the seemingly straightforward task of seamlessly relocating objects within a scene remains surprisingly challenging. Existing methods addressing this problem often struggle to function reliably in real-world scenarios due to lacking spatial reasoning. In this work, we propose a training-free method, dubbed DiffUHaul, that harnesses the spatial understanding of a localized text-to-image model, for the object dragging task. Blindly manipulating layout inputs of the localized model tends to cause low editing performance due to the intrinsic entanglement of object representation in the model. To this end, we first apply attention masking in each denoising step to make the generation more disentangled across different objects and adopt the self-attention sharing mechanism to preserve the high-level object appearance. Furthermore, we propose a new diffusion anchoring technique: in the early denoising steps, we interpolate the attention features between source and target images to smoothly fuse new layouts with the original appearance; in the later denoising steps, we pass the localized features from the source images to the interpolated images to retain fine-grained object details. To adapt DiffUHaul to real-image editing, we apply a DDPM self-attention bucketing that can better reconstruct real images with the localized model. Finally, we introduce an automated evaluation pipeline for this task and showcase the efficacy of our method. Our results are reinforced through a user preference study.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present MultiPly, a novel framework to reconstruct multiple people in 3D from monocular in-the-wild videos. Reconstructing multiple individuals moving and interacting naturally from monocular in-the-wild videos poses a challenging task. Addressing it necessitates precise pixel-level disentanglement of individuals without any prior knowledge about the subjects. Moreover, it requires recovering intricate and complete 3D human shapes from short video sequences, intensifying the level of difficulty. To tackle these challenges, we first define a layered neural representation for the entire scene, composited by individual human and background models. We learn the layered neural representation from videos via our layer-wise differentiable volume rendering. This learning process is further enhanced by our hybrid instance segmentation approach which combines the self-supervised 3D segmentation and the promptable 2D segmentation module, yielding reliable instance segmentation supervision even under close human interaction. A confidence-guided optimization formulation is introduced to optimize the human poses and shape/appearance alternately. We incorporate effective objectives to refine human poses via photometric information and impose physically plausible constraints on human dynamics, leading to temporally consistent 3D reconstructions with high fidelity. The evaluation of our method shows the superiority over prior art on publicly available datasets and in-the-wild videos.</li>
