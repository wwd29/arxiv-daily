<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Table extraction has long been a pervasive problem in financial services. This is more challenging in the image domain, where content is locked behind cumbersome pixel format. Luckily, advances in deep learning for image segmentation, OCR, and sequence modeling provides the necessary heavy lifting to achieve impressive results. This paper presents an end-to-end pipeline for identifying, extracting and transcribing tabular content in image documents, while retaining the original spatial relations with high fidelity.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, attack, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Anomaly detection is critical for the secure and reliable operation of industrial control systems. As our reliance on such complex cyber-physical systems grows, it becomes paramount to have automated methods for detecting anomalies, preventing attacks, and responding intelligently. {This paper presents a novel deep generative model to meet this need. The proposed model follows a variational autoencoder architecture with a convolutional encoder and decoder to extract features from both spatial and temporal dimensions. Additionally, we incorporate an attention mechanism that directs focus towards specific regions, enhancing the representation of relevant features and improving anomaly detection accuracy. We also employ a dynamic threshold approach leveraging the reconstruction probability and make our source code publicly available to promote reproducibility and facilitate further research. Comprehensive experimental analysis is conducted on data from all six stages of the Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) testbed, and the experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to several state-of-the-art baseline techniques.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The applications of artificial intelligence (AI) are rapidly evolving, and they are also commonly used in safety-critical domains, such as autonomous driving and medical diagnosis, where functional safety is paramount. In AI-driven systems, uncertainty estimation allows the user to avoid overconfidence predictions and achieve functional safety. Therefore, the robustness and reliability of model predictions can be improved. However, conventional uncertainty estimation methods, such as the deep ensemble method, impose high computation and, accordingly, hardware (latency and energy) overhead because they require the storage and processing of multiple models. Alternatively, Monte Carlo dropout (MC-dropout) methods, although having low memory overhead, necessitate numerous ($\sim 100$) forward passes, leading to high computational overhead and latency. Thus, these approaches are not suitable for battery-powered edge devices with limited computing and memory resources. In this paper, we propose the Tiny-Deep Ensemble approach, a low-cost approach for uncertainty estimation on edge devices. In our approach, only normalization layers are ensembled $M$ times, with all ensemble members sharing common weights and biases, leading to a significant decrease in storage requirements and latency. Moreover, our approach requires only one forward pass in a hardware architecture that allows batch processing for inference and uncertainty estimation. Furthermore, it has approximately the same memory overhead compared to a single model. Therefore, latency and memory overhead are reduced by a factor of up to $\sim M\times$. Nevertheless, our method does not compromise accuracy, with an increase in inference accuracy of up to $\sim 1\%$ and a reduction in RMSE of $17.17\%$ in various benchmark datasets, tasks, and state-of-the-art architectures.</li>

          Deep Learning Method to Predict Wound Healing Progress Based on Collagen Fibers in Wound Tissue(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Wound healing is a complex process involving changes in collagen fibers. Accurate monitoring of these changes is crucial for assessing the progress of wound healing and has significant implications for guiding clinical treatment strategies and drug screening. However, traditional quantitative analysis methods focus on spatial characteristics such as collagen fiber alignment and variance, lacking threshold standards to differentiate between different stages of wound healing. To address this issue, we propose an innovative approach based on deep learning to predict the progression of wound healing by analyzing collagen fiber features in histological images of wound tissue. Leveraging the unique learning capabilities of deep learning models, our approach captures the feature variations of collagen fibers in histological images from different categories and classifies them into various stages of wound healing. To overcome the limited availability of histological image data, we employ a transfer learning strategy. Specifically, we fine-tune a VGG16 model pretrained on the ImageNet dataset to adapt it to the classification task of histological images of wounds. Through this process, our model achieves 82% accuracy in classifying six stages of wound healing. Furthermore, to enhance the interpretability of the model, we employ a class activation mapping technique called LayerCAM. LayerCAM reveals the image regions on which the model relies when making predictions, providing transparency to the model's decision-making process. This visualization not only helps us understand how the model identifies and evaluates collagen fiber features but also enhances trust in the model's prediction results. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed model is the first deep learning-based classification model used for predicting wound healing stages.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>explainability, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) are becoming bigger to boost performance. However, little is known about how explainability is affected by this trend. This work explores LIME explanations for DeBERTaV3 models of four different sizes on natural language inference (NLI) and zero-shot classification (ZSC) tasks. We evaluate the explanations based on their faithfulness to the models' internal decision processes and their plausibility, i.e. their agreement with human explanations. The key finding is that increased model size does not correlate with plausibility despite improved model performance, suggesting a misalignment between the LIME explanations and the models' internal processes as model size increases. Our results further suggest limitations regarding faithfulness metrics in NLI contexts.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Offline optimization is an emerging problem in many experimental engineering domains including protein, drug or aircraft design, where online experimentation to collect evaluation data is too expensive or dangerous. To avoid that, one has to optimize an unknown function given only its offline evaluation at a fixed set of inputs. A naive solution to this problem is to learn a surrogate model of the unknown function and optimize this surrogate instead. However, such a naive optimizer is prone to erroneous overestimation of the surrogate (possibly due to over-fitting on a biased sample of function evaluation) on inputs outside the offline dataset. Prior approaches addressing this challenge have primarily focused on learning robust surrogate models. However, their search strategies are derived from the surrogate model rather than the actual offline data. To fill this important gap, we introduce a new learning-to-search perspective for offline optimization by reformulating it as an offline reinforcement learning problem. Our proposed policy-guided gradient search approach explicitly learns the best policy for a given surrogate model created from the offline data. Our empirical results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the learned optimization policy can be combined with existing offline surrogates to significantly improve the optimization performance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, steal, extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Counterfactual explanations find ways of achieving a favorable model outcome with minimum input perturbation. However, counterfactual explanations can also be exploited to steal the model by strategically training a surrogate model to give similar predictions as the original (target) model. In this work, we investigate model extraction by specifically leveraging the fact that the counterfactual explanations also lie quite close to the decision boundary. We propose a novel strategy for model extraction that we call Counterfactual Clamping Attack (CCA) which trains a surrogate model using a unique loss function that treats counterfactuals differently than ordinary instances. Our approach also alleviates the related problem of decision boundary shift that arises in existing model extraction attacks which treat counterfactuals as ordinary instances. We also derive novel mathematical relationships between the error in model approximation and the number of queries using polytope theory. Experimental results demonstrate that our strategy provides improved fidelity between the target and surrogate model predictions on several real world datasets.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as an integral part of modern societies, powering user-facing applications such as personal assistants and enterprise applications like recruitment tools. Despite their utility, research indicates that LLMs perpetuate systemic biases. Yet, prior works on LLM harms predominantly focus on Western concepts like race and gender, often overlooking cultural concepts from other parts of the world. Additionally, these studies typically investigate "harm" as a singular dimension, ignoring the various and subtle forms in which harms manifest. To address this gap, we introduce the Covert Harms and Social Threats (CHAST), a set of seven metrics grounded in social science literature. We utilize evaluation models aligned with human assessments to examine the presence of covert harms in LLM-generated conversations, particularly in the context of recruitment. Our experiments reveal that seven out of the eight LLMs included in this study generated conversations riddled with CHAST, characterized by malign views expressed in seemingly neutral language unlikely to be detected by existing methods. Notably, these LLMs manifested more extreme views and opinions when dealing with non-Western concepts like caste, compared to Western ones such as race.</li>

          Interpretability Needs a New Paradigm(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Interpretability is the study of explaining models in understandable terms to humans. At present, interpretability is divided into two paradigms: the intrinsic paradigm, which believes that only models designed to be explained can be explained, and the post-hoc paradigm, which believes that black-box models can be explained. At the core of this debate is how each paradigm ensures its explanations are faithful, i.e., true to the model's behavior. This is important, as false but convincing explanations lead to unsupported confidence in artificial intelligence (AI), which can be dangerous. This paper's position is that we should think about new paradigms while staying vigilant regarding faithfulness. First, by examining the history of paradigms in science, we see that paradigms are constantly evolving. Then, by examining the current paradigms, we can understand their underlying beliefs, the value they bring, and their limitations. Finally, this paper presents 3 emerging paradigms for interpretability. The first paradigm designs models such that faithfulness can be easily measured. Another optimizes models such that explanations become faithful. The last paradigm proposes to develop models that produce both a prediction and an explanation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Transformers have shown impressive capabilities across various tasks, but their performance on compositional problems remains a topic of debate. In this work, we investigate the mechanisms of how transformers behave on unseen compositional tasks using anchor functions. We discover that the parameter initialization scale plays a critical role in determining whether the model learns inferential solutions, which capture the underlying compositional primitives, or symmetric solutions, which simply memorize mappings without understanding the compositional structure. By analyzing the information flow and vector representations within the model, we reveal the distinct mechanisms underlying these solution types. We further find that inferential solutions exhibit low complexity bias, which we hypothesize is a key factor enabling them to learn individual mappings for single anchors. Building upon our understanding of these mechanisms, we can predict the learning behavior of models with different initialization scales when faced with data of varying inferential complexity. Our findings provide valuable insights into the role of initialization scale in shaping the type of solution learned by transformers and their ability to learn and generalize compositional functions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The disconnect between tokenizer creation and model training in language models has been known to allow for certain inputs, such as the infamous SolidGoldMagikarp token, to induce unwanted behaviour. Although such `glitch tokens' that are present in the tokenizer vocabulary, but are nearly or fully absent in training, have been observed across a variety of different models, a consistent way of identifying them has been missing. We present a comprehensive analysis of Large Language Model (LLM) tokenizers, specifically targeting this issue of detecting untrained and under-trained tokens. Through a combination of tokenizer analysis, model weight-based indicators, and prompting techniques, we develop effective methods for automatically detecting these problematic tokens. Our findings demonstrate the prevalence of such tokens across various models and provide insights into improving the efficiency and safety of language models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As the popularity of Large Language Models (LLMs) grow, combining model safety with utility becomes increasingly important. The challenge is making sure that LLMs can recognize and decline dangerous prompts without sacrificing their ability to be helpful. The problem of "exaggerated safety" demonstrates how difficult this can be. To reduce excessive safety behaviours -- which was discovered to be 26.1% of safe prompts being misclassified as dangerous and refused -- we use a combination of XSTest dataset prompts as well as interactive, contextual, and few-shot prompting to examine the decision bounds of LLMs such as Llama2, Gemma Command R+, and Phi-3. We find that few-shot prompting works best for Llama2, interactive prompting works best Gemma, and contextual prompting works best for Command R+ and Phi-3. Using a combination of these prompting strategies, we are able to mitigate exaggerated safety behaviors by an overall 92.9% across all LLMs. Our work presents a multiple prompting strategies to jailbreak LLMs' decision-making processes, allowing them to navigate the tight line between refusing unsafe prompts and remaining helpful.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Precise, pixel-wise geolocalization of astronaut photography is critical to unlocking the potential of this unique type of remotely sensed Earth data, particularly for its use in disaster management and climate change research. Recent works have established the Astronaut Photography Localization task, but have either proved too costly for mass deployment or generated too coarse a localization. Thus, we present EarthMatch, an iterative homography estimation method that produces fine-grained localization of astronaut photographs while maintaining an emphasis on speed. We refocus the astronaut photography benchmark, AIMS, on the geolocalization task itself, and prove our method's efficacy on this dataset. In addition, we offer a new, fair method for image matcher comparison, and an extensive evaluation of different matching models within our localization pipeline. Our method will enable fast and accurate localization of the 4.5 million and growing collection of astronaut photography of Earth. Webpage with code and data at this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Skeleton-based motion visualization is a rising field in computer vision, especially in the case of virtual reality (VR). With further advancements in human-pose estimation and skeleton extracting sensors, more and more applications that utilize skeleton data have come about. These skeletons may appear to be anonymous but they contain embedded personally identifiable information (PII). In this paper we present a new anonymization technique that is based on motion retargeting, utilizing adversary classifiers to further remove PII embedded in the skeleton. Motion retargeting is effective in anonymization as it transfers the movement of the user onto the a dummy skeleton. In doing so, any PII linked to the skeleton will be based on the dummy skeleton instead of the user we are protecting. We propose a Privacy-centric Deep Motion Retargeting model (PMR) which aims to further clear the retargeted skeleton of PII through adversarial learning. In our experiments, PMR achieves motion retargeting utility performance on par with state of the art models while also reducing the performance of privacy attacks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the transformative landscape of smart cities, the integration of the cutting-edge web technologies into time series forecasting presents a pivotal opportunity to enhance urban planning, sustainability, and economic growth. The advancement of deep neural networks has significantly improved forecasting performance. However, a notable challenge lies in the ability of these models to generalize well to out-of-distribution (OOD) time series data. The inherent spatial heterogeneity and domain shifts across urban environments create hurdles that prevent models from adapting and performing effectively in new urban environments. To tackle this problem, we propose a solution to derive invariant representations for more robust predictions under different urban environments instead of relying on spurious correlation across urban environments for better generalizability. Through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world data, we demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms traditional time series forecasting models when tackling domain shifts in changing urban environments. The effectiveness and robustness of our method can be extended to diverse fields including climate modeling, urban planning, and smart city resource management.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, attack, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Phishing email attacks are among the most common and most harmful cybersecurity attacks. With the emergence of generative AI, phishing attacks can be based on emails generated automatically, making it more difficult to detect them. That is, instead of a single email format sent to a large number of recipients, generative AI can be used to send each potential victim a different email, making it more difficult for cybersecurity systems to identify the scam email before it reaches the recipient. Here we describe a corpus of AI-generated phishing emails. We also use different machine learning tools to test the ability of automatic text analysis to identify AI-generated phishing emails. The results are encouraging, and show that machine learning tools can identify an AI-generated phishing email with high accuracy compared to regular emails or human-generated scam email. By applying descriptive analytic, the specific differences between AI-generated emails and manually crafted scam emails are profiled, and show that AI-generated emails are different in their style from human-generated phishing email scams. Therefore, automatic identification tools can be used as a warning for the user. The paper also describes the corpus of AI-generated phishing emails that is made open to the public, and can be used for consequent studies. While the ability of machine learning to detect AI-generated phishing email is encouraging, AI-generated phishing emails are different from regular phishing emails, and therefore it is important to train machine learning systems also with AI-generated emails in order to repel future phishing attacks that are powered by generative AI.</li>

Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) present a promising opportunity to balance the need for thorough evaluation with efficient use of educators' time. In our study, we explore the effectiveness of LLMs ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, Claude-3, and Mistral-Large in assessing university students' open-ended answers to questions made about reference material they have studied. Each model was instructed to evaluate 54 answers repeatedly under two conditions: 10 times (10-shot) with a temperature setting of 0.0 and 10 times with a temperature of 0.5, expecting a total of 1,080 evaluations per model and 4,320 evaluations across all models. The RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) framework was used as the framework to make the LLMs to process the evaluation of the answers. As of spring 2024, our analysis revealed notable variations in consistency and the grading outcomes provided by studied LLMs. There is a need to comprehend strengths and weaknesses of LLMs in educational settings for evaluating open-ended written responses. Further comparative research is essential to determine the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of using LLMs for educational assessments.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Pre-trained large language models (LLM) have emerged as a powerful tool for simulating various scenarios and generating output given specific instructions and multimodal input. In this work, we analyze the specific use of LLM to enhance a classical supervised machine learning method for classification problems. We propose a few approaches to integrate LLM into a classical machine learning estimator to further enhance the prediction performance. We examine the performance of the proposed approaches through both standard supervised learning binary classification tasks, and a transfer learning task where the test data observe distribution changes compared to the training data. Numerical experiments using four publicly available datasets are conducted and suggest that using LLM to enhance classical machine learning estimators can provide significant improvement on prediction performance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>A rich line of recent work has studied distributionally robust learning approaches that seek to learn a hypothesis that performs well, in the worst-case, on many different distributions over a population. We argue that although the most common approaches seek to minimize the worst-case loss over distributions, a more reasonable goal is to minimize the worst-case distance to the true conditional expectation of labels given each covariate. Focusing on the minmax loss objective can dramatically fail to output a solution minimizing the distance to the true conditional expectation when certain distributions contain high levels of label noise. We introduce a new min-max objective based on what is known as the adversarial moment violation and show that minimizing this objective is equivalent to minimizing the worst-case $\ell_2$-distance to the true conditional expectation if we take the adversary's strategy space to be sufficiently rich. Previous work has suggested minimizing the maximum regret over the worst-case distribution as a way to circumvent issues arising from differential noise levels. We show that in the case of square loss, minimizing the worst-case regret is also equivalent to minimizing the worst-case $\ell_2$-distance to the true conditional expectation. Although their objective and our objective both minimize the worst-case distance to the true conditional expectation, we show that our approach provides large empirical savings in computational cost in terms of the number of groups, while providing the same noise-oblivious worst-distribution guarantee as the minimax regret approach, thus making positive progress on an open question posed by Agarwal and Zhang (2022).</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Optimizing the deployment of Large language models (LLMs) is expensive today since it requires experimentally running an application workload against an LLM implementation while exploring large configuration space formed by system knobs such as parallelization strategies, batching techniques, and scheduling policies. To address this challenge, we present Vidur - a large-scale, high-fidelity, easily-extensible simulation framework for LLM inference performance. Vidur models the performance of LLM operators using a combination of experimental profiling and predictive modeling, and evaluates the end-to-end inference performance for different workloads by estimating several metrics of interest such as latency and throughput. We validate the fidelity of Vidur on several LLMs and show that it estimates inference latency with less than 9% error across the range. Further, we present Vidur-Search, a configuration search tool that helps optimize LLM deployment. Vidur-Search uses Vidur to automatically identify the most cost-effective deployment configuration that meets application performance constraints. For example, Vidur-Search finds the best deployment configuration for LLaMA2-70B in one hour on a CPU machine, in contrast to a deployment-based exploration which would require 42K GPU hours - costing ~218K dollars.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Like a criminal under investigation, Large Language Models (LLMs) might pretend to be aligned while evaluated and misbehave when they have a good opportunity. Can current interpretability methods catch these 'alignment fakers?' To answer this question, we introduce a benchmark that consists of 324 pairs of LLMs fine-tuned to select actions in role-play scenarios. One model in each pair is consistently benign (aligned). The other model misbehaves in scenarios where it is unlikely to be caught (alignment faking). The task is to identify the alignment faking model using only inputs where the two models behave identically. We test five detection strategies, one of which identifies 98% of alignment-fakers.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The robust $\phi$-regularized Markov Decision Process (RRMDP) framework focuses on designing control policies that are robust against parameter uncertainties due to mismatches between the simulator (nominal) model and real-world settings. This work makes two important contributions. First, we propose a model-free algorithm called Robust $\phi$-regularized fitted Q-iteration (RPQ) for learning an $\epsilon$-optimal robust policy that uses only the historical data collected by rolling out a behavior policy (with robust exploratory requirement) on the nominal model. To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first unified analysis for a class of $\phi$-divergences achieving robust optimal policies in high-dimensional systems with general function approximation. Second, we introduce the hybrid robust $\phi$-regularized reinforcement learning framework to learn an optimal robust policy using both historical data and online sampling. Towards this framework, we propose a model-free algorithm called Hybrid robust Total-variation-regularized Q-iteration (HyTQ: pronounced height-Q). To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first improved out-of-data-distribution assumption in large-scale problems with general function approximation under the hybrid robust $\phi$-regularized reinforcement learning framework. Finally, we provide theoretical guarantees on the performance of the learned policies of our algorithms on systems with arbitrary large state space.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Satellite networks are vital in facilitating communication services for various critical infrastructures. These networks can seamlessly integrate with a diverse array of systems. However, some of these systems are vulnerable due to the absence of effective intrusion detection systems, which can be attributed to limited research and the high costs associated with deploying, fine-tuning, monitoring, and responding to security breaches. To address these challenges, we propose a pretrained Large Language Model for Cyber Security , for short PLLM-CS, which is a variant of pre-trained Transformers [1], which includes a specialized module for transforming network data into contextually suitable inputs. This transformation enables the proposed LLM to encode contextual information within the cyber data. To validate the efficacy of the proposed method, we conducted empirical experiments using two publicly available network datasets, UNSW_NB 15 and TON_IoT, both providing Internet of Things (IoT)-based traffic data. Our experiments demonstrate that proposed LLM method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques such as BiLSTM, GRU, and CNN. Notably, the PLLM-CS method achieves an outstanding accuracy level of 100% on the UNSW_NB 15 dataset, setting a new standard for benchmark performance in this domain.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Our work tackles the fundamental challenge of image segmentation in computer vision, which is crucial for diverse applications. While supervised methods demonstrate proficiency, their reliance on extensive pixel-level annotations limits scalability. In response to this challenge, we present an enhanced unsupervised Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based algorithm called DynaSeg. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on a fixed weight factor to balance feature similarity and spatial continuity, requiring manual adjustments, our novel, dynamic weighting scheme automates parameter tuning, adapting flexibly to image details. We also introduce the novel concept of a Silhouette Score Phase that addresses the challenge of dynamic clustering during iterations. Additionally, our methodology integrates both CNN-based and pre-trained ResNet feature extraction, offering a comprehensive and adaptable approach. We achieve state-of-the-art results on diverse datasets, with a notable 12.2% and 14.12% mIOU improvement compared to the current benchmarks on COCO-All and COCO-Stuff, respectively. The proposed approach unlocks the potential for unsupervised image segmentation and addresses scalability concerns in real-world scenarios by obviating the need for meticulous parameter tuning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is an important subtask of sentiment analysis, which aims to extract the aspects and predict their sentiments. Most existing studies focus on improving the performance of the target domain by fine-tuning domain-specific models (trained on source domains) based on the target domain dataset. Few works propose continual learning tasks for ABSA, which aim to learn the target domain's ability while maintaining the history domains' abilities. In this paper, we propose a Large Language Model-based Continual Learning (\texttt{LLM-CL}) model for ABSA. First, we design a domain knowledge decoupling module to learn a domain-invariant adapter and separate domain-variant adapters dependently with an orthogonal constraint. Then, we introduce a domain knowledge warmup strategy to align the representation between domain-invariant and domain-variant knowledge. In the test phase, we index the corresponding domain-variant knowledge via domain positioning to not require each sample's domain ID. Extensive experiments over 19 datasets indicate that our \texttt{LLM-CL} model obtains new state-of-the-art performance.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Stereo image super-resolution utilizes the cross-view complementary information brought by the disparity effect of left and right perspective images to reconstruct higher-quality images. Cascading feature extraction modules and cross-view feature interaction modules to make use of the information from stereo images is the focus of numerous methods. However, this adds a great deal of network parameters and structural redundancy. To facilitate the application of stereo image super-resolution in downstream tasks, we propose an efficient Multi-Level Feature Fusion Network for Lightweight Stereo Image Super-Resolution (MFFSSR). Specifically, MFFSSR utilizes the Hybrid Attention Feature Extraction Block (HAFEB) to extract multi-level intra-view features. Using the channel separation strategy, HAFEB can efficiently interact with the embedded cross-view interaction module. This structural configuration can efficiently mine features inside the view while improving the efficiency of cross-view information sharing. Hence, reconstruct image details and textures more accurately. Abundant experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of MFFSSR. We achieve superior performance with fewer parameters.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>To defend deep neural networks from adversarial attacks, adversarial training has been drawing increasing attention for its effectiveness. However, the accuracy and robustness resulting from the adversarial training are limited by the architecture, because adversarial training improves accuracy and robustness by adjusting the weight connection affiliated to the architecture. In this work, we propose ARNAS to search for accurate and robust architectures for adversarial training. First we design an accurate and robust search space, in which the placement of the cells and the proportional relationship of the filter numbers are carefully determined. With the design, the architectures can obtain both accuracy and robustness by deploying accurate and robust structures to their sensitive positions, respectively. Then we propose a differentiable multi-objective search strategy, performing gradient descent towards directions that are beneficial for both natural loss and adversarial loss, thus the accuracy and robustness can be guaranteed at the same time. We conduct comprehensive experiments in terms of white-box attacks, black-box attacks, and transferability. Experimental results show that the searched architecture has the strongest robustness with the competitive accuracy, and breaks the traditional idea that NAS-based architectures cannot transfer well to complex tasks in robustness scenarios. By analyzing outstanding architectures searched, we also conclude that accurate and robust neural architectures tend to deploy different structures near the input and output, which has great practical significance on both hand-crafting and automatically designing of accurate and robust architectures.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly essential in processing natural languages, yet their application is frequently compromised by biases and inaccuracies originating in their training data. In this study, we introduce Cross-Care, the first benchmark framework dedicated to assessing biases and real world knowledge in LLMs, specifically focusing on the representation of disease prevalence across diverse demographic groups. We systematically evaluate how demographic biases embedded in pre-training corpora like $ThePile$ influence the outputs of LLMs. We expose and quantify discrepancies by juxtaposing these biases against actual disease prevalences in various U.S. demographic groups. Our results highlight substantial misalignment between LLM representation of disease prevalence and real disease prevalence rates across demographic subgroups, indicating a pronounced risk of bias propagation and a lack of real-world grounding for medical applications of LLMs. Furthermore, we observe that various alignment methods minimally resolve inconsistencies in the models' representation of disease prevalence across different languages. For further exploration and analysis, we make all data and a data visualization tool available at: this http URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose the characteristic generator, a novel one-step generative model that combines the efficiency of sampling in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with the stable performance of flow-based models. Our model is driven by characteristics, along which the probability density transport can be described by ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Specifically, We estimate the velocity field through nonparametric regression and utilize Euler method to solve the probability flow ODE, generating a series of discrete approximations to the characteristics. We then use a deep neural network to fit these characteristics, ensuring a one-step mapping that effectively pushes the prior distribution towards the target distribution. In the theoretical aspect, we analyze the errors in velocity matching, Euler discretization, and characteristic fitting to establish a non-asymptotic convergence rate for the characteristic generator in 2-Wasserstein distance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first thorough analysis for simulation-free one step generative models. Additionally, our analysis refines the error analysis of flow-based generative models in prior works. We apply our method on both synthetic and real datasets, and the results demonstrate that the characteristic generator achieves high generation quality with just a single evaluation of neural network.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, attack, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vision-language pre-trained (VLP) models have been the foundation of numerous vision-language tasks. Given their prevalence, it be- comes imperative to assess their adversarial robustness, especially when deploying them in security-crucial real-world applications. Traditionally, adversarial perturbations generated for this assessment target specific VLP models, datasets, and/or downstream tasks. This practice suffers from low transferability and additional computation costs when transitioning to new scenarios. In this work, we thoroughly investigate whether VLP models are commonly sensitive to imperceptible perturbations of a specific pattern for the image modality. To this end, we propose a novel black-box method to generate Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs), which is so called the Effective and T ransferable Universal Adversarial Attack (ETU), aiming to mislead a variety of existing VLP models in a range of downstream tasks. The ETU comprehensively takes into account the characteristics of UAPs and the intrinsic cross-modal interactions to generate effective UAPs. Under this regime, the ETU encourages both global and local utilities of UAPs. This benefits the overall utility while reducing interactions between UAP units, improving the transferability. To further enhance the effectiveness and transferability of UAPs, we also design a novel data augmentation method named ScMix. ScMix consists of self-mix and cross-mix data transformations, which can effectively increase the multi-modal data diversity while preserving the semantics of the original data. Through comprehensive experiments on various downstream tasks, VLP models, and datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method is able to achieve effective and transferrable universal adversarial attacks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, privacy, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Due to the rising privacy concerns on sensitive client data and trained models like Transformers, secure multi-party computation (MPC) techniques are employed to enable secure inference despite attendant overhead. Existing works attempt to reduce the overhead using more MPC-friendly non-linear function approximations. However, the integration of quantization widely used in plaintext inference into the MPC domain remains unclear. To bridge this gap, we propose the framework named Ditto to enable more efficient quantization-aware secure Transformer inference. Concretely, we first incorporate an MPC-friendly quantization into Transformer inference and employ a quantization-aware distillation procedure to maintain the model utility. Then, we propose novel MPC primitives to support the type conversions that are essential in quantization and implement the quantization-aware MPC execution of secure quantized inference. This approach significantly decreases both computation and communication overhead, leading to improvements in overall efficiency. We conduct extensive experiments on Bert and GPT2 models to evaluate the performance of Ditto. The results demonstrate that Ditto is about $3.14\sim 4.40\times$ faster than MPCFormer (ICLR 2023) and $1.44\sim 2.35\times$ faster than the state-of-the-art work PUMA with negligible utility degradation.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Malnutrition among newborns is a top public health concern in developing countries. Identification and subsequent growth monitoring are key to successful interventions. However, this is challenging in rural communities where health systems tend to be inaccessible and under-equipped, with poor adherence to protocol. Our goal is to equip health workers and public health systems with a solution for contactless newborn anthropometry in the community. We propose NurtureNet, a multi-task model that fuses visual information (a video taken with a low-cost smartphone) with tabular inputs to regress multiple anthropometry estimates including weight, length, head circumference, and chest circumference. We show that visual proxy tasks of segmentation and keypoint prediction further improve performance. We establish the efficacy of the model through several experiments and achieve a relative error of 3.9% and mean absolute error of 114.3 g for weight estimation. Model compression to 15 MB also allows offline deployment to low-cost smartphones.</li>

          A Survey on Personalized Content Synthesis with Diffusion Models(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advancements in generative models have significantly impacted content creation, leading to the emergence of Personalized Content Synthesis (PCS). With a small set of user-provided examples, PCS aims to customize the subject of interest to specific user-defined prompts. Over the past two years, more than 150 methods have been proposed. However, existing surveys mainly focus on text-to-image generation, with few providing up-to-date summaries on PCS. This paper offers a comprehensive survey of PCS, with a particular focus on the diffusion models. Specifically, we introduce the generic frameworks of PCS research, which can be broadly classified into optimization-based and learning-based approaches. We further categorize and analyze these methodologies, discussing their strengths, limitations, and key techniques. Additionally, we delve into specialized tasks within the field, such as personalized object generation, face synthesis, and style personalization, highlighting their unique challenges and innovations. Despite encouraging progress, we also present an analysis of the challenges such as overfitting and the trade-off between subject fidelity and text alignment. Through this detailed overview and analysis, we propose future directions to advance the development of PCS.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Object detection plays an important role in various fields. Developing detection models for 2D objects that experience rotation and texture variations is a challenge. In this research, the initial stage of the proposed model integrates the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) and local binary patterns (LBP) texture feature extraction to obtain feature vectors. The next stage is classifying features using k-nearest neighbors (KNN) and random forest (RF), as well as voting ensemble (VE). System testing used a dataset of 4,437 2D images, the results for KNN accuracy were 92.7% and F1-score 92.5%, while RF performance was lower. Although GLCM features improve performance on both algorithms, KNN is more consistent. The VE approach provides the best performance with an accuracy of 93.9% and an F1 score of 93.8%, this shows the effectiveness of the ensemble technique in increasing object detection accuracy. This study contributes to the field of object detection with a new approach combining GLCM and LBP as feature vectors as well as VE for classification</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Interaction intention anticipation aims to jointly predict future hand trajectories and interaction hotspots. Existing research often treated trajectory forecasting and interaction hotspots prediction as separate tasks or solely considered the impact of trajectories on interaction hotspots, which led to the accumulation of prediction errors over time. However, a deeper inherent connection exists between hand trajectories and interaction hotspots, which allows for continuous mutual correction between them. Building upon this relationship, a novel Bidirectional prOgressive Transformer (BOT), which introduces a Bidirectional Progressive mechanism into the anticipation of interaction intention is established. Initially, BOT maximizes the utilization of spatial information from the last observation frame through the Spatial-Temporal Reconstruction Module, mitigating conflicts arising from changes of view in first-person videos. Subsequently, based on two independent prediction branches, a Bidirectional Progressive Enhancement Module is introduced to mutually improve the prediction of hand trajectories and interaction hotspots over time to minimize error accumulation. Finally, acknowledging the intrinsic randomness in human natural behavior, we employ a Trajectory Stochastic Unit and a C-VAE to introduce appropriate uncertainty to trajectories and interaction hotspots, respectively. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on three benchmark datasets Epic-Kitchens-100, EGO4D, and EGTEA Gaze+, demonstrating superior in complex scenarios.</li>

          Towards Robust Physical-world Backdoor Attacks on Lane Detection(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep learning-based lane detection (LD) plays a critical role in autonomous driving systems, such as adaptive cruise control. However, it is vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Existing backdoor attack methods on LD exhibit limited effectiveness in dynamic real-world scenarios, primarily because they fail to consider dynamic scene factors, including changes in driving perspectives (e.g., viewpoint transformations) and environmental conditions (e.g., weather or lighting changes). To tackle this issue, this paper introduces BadLANE, a dynamic scene adaptation backdoor attack for LD designed to withstand changes in real-world dynamic scene factors. To address the challenges posed by changing driving perspectives, we propose an amorphous trigger pattern composed of shapeless pixels. This trigger design allows the backdoor to be activated by various forms or shapes of mud spots or pollution on the road or lens, enabling adaptation to changes in vehicle observation viewpoints during driving. To mitigate the effects of environmental changes, we design a meta-learning framework to train meta-generators tailored to different environmental conditions. These generators produce meta-triggers that incorporate diverse environmental information, such as weather or lighting conditions, as the initialization of the trigger patterns for backdoor implantation, thus enabling adaptation to dynamic environments. Extensive experiments on various commonly used LD models in both digital and physical domains validate the effectiveness of our attacks, outperforming other baselines significantly (+25.15\% on average in Attack Success Rate). Our codes will be available upon paper publication.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Current computational approaches for analysing or generating code-mixed sentences do not explicitly model "naturalness" or "acceptability" of code-mixed sentences, but rely on training corpora to reflect distribution of acceptable code-mixed sentences. Modelling human judgement for the acceptability of code-mixed text can help in distinguishing natural code-mixed text and enable quality-controlled generation of code-mixed text. To this end, we construct Cline - a dataset containing human acceptability judgements for English-Hindi (en-hi) code-mixed text. Cline is the largest of its kind with 16,642 sentences, consisting of samples sourced from two sources: synthetically generated code-mixed text and samples collected from online social media. Our analysis establishes that popular code-mixing metrics such as CMI, Number of Switch Points, Burstines, which are used to filter/curate/compare code-mixed corpora have low correlation with human acceptability judgements, underlining the necessity of our dataset. Experiments using Cline demonstrate that simple Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models trained solely on code-mixing metrics are outperformed by fine-tuned pre-trained Multilingual Large Language Models (MLLMs). Specifically, XLM-Roberta and Bernice outperform IndicBERT across different configurations in challenging data settings. Comparison with ChatGPT's zero and fewshot capabilities shows that MLLMs fine-tuned on larger data outperform ChatGPT, providing scope for improvement in code-mixed tasks. Zero-shot transfer from English-Hindi to English-Telugu acceptability judgments using our model checkpoints proves superior to random baselines, enabling application to other code-mixed language pairs and providing further avenues of research. We publicly release our human-annotated dataset, trained checkpoints, code-mix corpus, and code for data generation and model training.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>defense, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Poisoning-based backdoor attacks expose vulnerabilities in the data preparation stage of deep neural network (DNN) training. The DNNs trained on the poisoned dataset will be embedded with a backdoor, making them behave well on clean data while outputting malicious predictions whenever a trigger is applied. To exploit the abundant information contained in the input data to output label mapping, our scheme utilizes the network trained from the clean dataset as a trigger generator to produce poisons that significantly raise the success rate of backdoor attacks versus conventional approaches. Specifically, we provide a new categorization of triggers inspired by the adversarial technique and develop a multi-label and multi-payload Poisoning-based backdoor attack with Positive Triggers (PPT), which effectively moves the input closer to the target label on benign classifiers. After the classifier is trained on the poisoned dataset, we can generate an input-label-aware trigger to make the infected classifier predict any given input to any target label with a high possibility. Under both dirty- and clean-label settings, we show empirically that the proposed attack achieves a high attack success rate without sacrificing accuracy across various datasets, including SVHN, CIFAR10, GTSRB, and Tiny ImageNet. Furthermore, the PPT attack can elude a variety of classical backdoor defenses, proving its effectiveness.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The intrinsic capability to perceive depth of field and extract salient information by the Human Vision System (HVS) stimulates a pilot to perform manual landing over an autoland approach. However, harsh weather creates visibility hindrances, and a pilot must have a clear view of runway elements before the minimum decision altitude. To help a pilot in manual landing, a vision-based system tailored to localize runway elements likewise gets affected, especially during crosswind due to the projective distortion of aircraft camera images. To combat this, we propose to integrate a prompt-based climatic diffusion network with a weather distillation model using a novel diffusion-distillation loss. Precisely, the diffusion model synthesizes climatic-conditioned landing images, and the weather distillation model learns inverse mapping by clearing those visual degradations. Then, to tackle the crosswind landing scenario, a novel Regularized Spatial Transformer Networks (RuSTaN) learns to accurately calibrate for projective distortion using self-supervised learning, which minimizes localization error by the downstream runway object detector. Finally, we have simulated a clear-day landing scenario at the busiest airport globally to curate an image-based Aircraft Landing Dataset (AIRLAD) and experimentally validated our contributions using this dataset to benchmark the performance.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The increased use of large language models (LLMs) across a variety of real-world applications calls for mechanisms to verify the factual accuracy of their outputs. Difficulties lie in assessing the factuality of free-form responses in open domains. Also, different papers use disparate evaluation benchmarks and measurements, which renders them hard to compare and hampers future progress. To mitigate these issues, we propose OpenFactCheck, a unified factuality evaluation framework for LLMs. OpenFactCheck consists of three modules: (i) CUSTCHECKER allows users to easily customize an automatic fact-checker and verify the factual correctness of documents and claims, (ii) LLMEVAL, a unified evaluation framework assesses LLM's factuality ability from various perspectives fairly, and (iii) CHECKEREVAL is an extensible solution for gauging the reliability of automatic fact-checkers' verification results using human-annotated datasets.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Action recognition is a key technology in building interactive metaverses. With the rapid development of deep learning, methods in action recognition have also achieved great advancement. Researchers design and implement the backbones referring to multiple standpoints, which leads to the diversity of methods and encountering new challenges. This paper reviews several action recognition methods based on deep neural networks. We introduce these methods in three parts: 1) Two-Streams networks and their variants, which, specifically in this paper, use RGB video frame and optical flow modality as input; 2) 3D convolutional networks, which make efforts in taking advantage of RGB modality directly while extracting different motion information is no longer necessary; 3) Transformer-based methods, which introduce the model from natural language processing into computer vision and video understanding. We offer objective sights in this review and hopefully provide a reference for future research.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Model Inversion (MI) attacks aim to reconstruct private training data by abusing access to machine learning models. Contemporary MI attacks have achieved impressive attack performance, posing serious threats to privacy. Meanwhile, all existing MI defense methods rely on regularization that is in direct conflict with the training objective, resulting in noticeable degradation in model utility. In this work, we take a different perspective, and propose a novel and simple Transfer Learning-based Defense against Model Inversion (TL-DMI) to render MI-robust models. Particularly, by leveraging TL, we limit the number of layers encoding sensitive information from private training dataset, thereby degrading the performance of MI attack. We conduct an analysis using Fisher Information to justify our method. Our defense is remarkably simple to implement. Without bells and whistles, we show in extensive experiments that TL-DMI achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) MI robustness.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Due to cost benefits, supply chains of integrated circuits (ICs) are largely outsourced nowadays. However, passing ICs through various third-party providers gives rise to many security threats, like piracy of IC intellectual property or insertion of hardware Trojans, i.e., malicious circuit modifications. In this work, we proactively and systematically protect the physical layouts of ICs against post-design insertion of Trojans. Toward that end, we propose TroLLoc, a novel scheme for IC security closure that employs, for the first time, logic locking and layout hardening in unison. TroLLoc is fully integrated into a commercial-grade design flow, and TroLLoc is shown to be effective, efficient, and robust. Our work provides in-depth layout and security analysis considering the challenging benchmarks of the ISPD'22/23 contests for security closure. We show that TroLLoc successfully renders layouts resilient, with reasonable overheads, against (i) general prospects for Trojan insertion as in the ISPD'22 contest, (ii) actual Trojan insertion as in the ISPD'23 contest, and (iii) potential second-order attacks where adversaries would first (i.e., before Trojan insertion) try to bypass the locking defense, e.g., using advanced machine learning attacks. Finally, we release all our artifacts for independent verification [2].</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in various natural language processing tasks, especially in dialogue systems. However, LLM may also pose security and moral threats, especially in multi round conversations where large models are more easily guided by contextual content, resulting in harmful or biased responses. In this paper, we present a novel method to attack LLMs in multi-turn dialogues, called CoA (Chain of Attack). CoA is a semantic-driven contextual multi-turn attack method that adaptively adjusts the attack policy through contextual feedback and semantic relevance during multi-turn of dialogue with a large model, resulting in the model producing unreasonable or harmful content. We evaluate CoA on different LLMs and datasets, and show that it can effectively expose the vulnerabilities of LLMs, and outperform existing attack methods. Our work provides a new perspective and tool for attacking and defending LLMs, and contributes to the security and ethical assessment of dialogue systems.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are generally designed for scenarios in which all data is stored in one data center, where the training is performed. However, in many applications, e.g., in the healthcare domain, the training data is distributed among several entities, e.g., different hospitals or patients' mobile devices/sensors. At the same time, transferring the data to a central location for learning is certainly not an option, due to privacy concerns and legal issues, and in certain cases, because of the communication and computation overheads. Federated Learning (FL) is the state-of-the-art collaborative ML approach for training an ML model across multiple parties holding local data samples, without sharing them. However, enabling learning from distributed data over such edge Internet of Things (IoT) systems (e.g., mobile-health and wearable technologies, involving sensitive personal/medical data) in a privacy-preserving fashion presents a major challenge mainly due to their stringent resource constraints, i.e., limited computing capacity, communication bandwidth, memory storage, and battery lifetime. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving edge FL framework for resource-constrained mobile-health and wearable technologies over the IoT infrastructure. We evaluate our proposed framework extensively and provide the implementation of our technique on Amazon's AWS cloud platform based on the seizure detection application in epilepsy monitoring using wearable technologies.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Unsupervised Visible-Infrared Person Re-identification (USVI-ReID) presents a formidable challenge, which aims to match pedestrian images across visible and infrared modalities without any annotations. Recently, clustered pseudo-label methods have become predominant in USVI-ReID, although the inherent noise in pseudo-labels presents a significant obstacle. Most existing works primarily focus on shielding the model from the harmful effects of noise, neglecting to calibrate noisy pseudo-labels usually associated with hard samples, which will compromise the robustness of the model. To address this issue, we design a Robust Pseudo-label Learning with Neighbor Relation (RPNR) framework for USVI-ReID. To be specific, we first introduce a straightforward yet potent Noisy Pseudo-label Calibration module to correct noisy pseudo-labels. Due to the high intra-class variations, noisy pseudo-labels are difficult to calibrate completely. Therefore, we introduce a Neighbor Relation Learning module to reduce high intra-class variations by modeling potential interactions between all samples. Subsequently, we devise an Optimal Transport Prototype Matching module to establish reliable cross-modality correspondences. On that basis, we design a Memory Hybrid Learning module to jointly learn modality-specific and modality-invariant information. Comprehensive experiments conducted on two widely recognized benchmarks, SYSU-MM01 and RegDB, demonstrate that RPNR outperforms the current state-of-the-art GUR with an average Rank-1 improvement of 10.3%. The source codes will be released soon.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Commonsense question answering has demonstrated considerable potential across various applications like assistants and social robots. Although fully fine-tuned pre-trained Language Models(LM) have achieved remarkable performance in commonsense reasoning, their tendency to excessively prioritize textual information hampers the precise transfer of structural knowledge and undermines interpretability. Some studies have explored combining LMs with Knowledge Graphs(KGs) by coarsely fusing the two modalities to perform Graph Neural Network(GNN)-based reasoning that lacks a profound interaction between heterogeneous modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel Graph-based Structure-Aware Prompt Learning Model for commonsense reasoning, named G-SAP, aiming to maintain a balance between heterogeneous knowledge and enhance the cross-modal interaction within the LM+GNNs model. In particular, an evidence graph is constructed by integrating multiple knowledge sources, i.e. ConceptNet, Wikipedia, and Cambridge Dictionary to boost the performance. Afterward, a structure-aware frozen PLM is employed to fully incorporate the structured and textual information from the evidence graph, where the generation of prompts is driven by graph entities and relations. Finally, a heterogeneous message-passing reasoning module is used to facilitate deep interaction of knowledge between the LM and graph-based networks. Empirical validation, conducted through extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, demonstrates the notable performance of the proposed model. The results reveal a significant advancement over the existing models, especially, with 6.12% improvement over the SoTA LM+GNNs model on the OpenbookQA dataset.</li>

          An Automatic Prompt Generation System for Tabular Data Tasks(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Efficient processing of tabular data is important in various industries, especially when working with datasets containing a large number of columns. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their ability on several tasks through carefully crafted prompts. However, creating effective prompts for tabular datasets is challenging due to the structured nature of the data and the need to manage numerous columns. This paper presents an innovative auto-prompt generation system suitable for multiple LLMs, with minimal training. It proposes two novel methods; 1) A Reinforcement Learning-based algorithm for identifying and sequencing task-relevant columns 2) Cell-level similarity-based approach for enhancing few-shot example selection. Our approach has been extensively tested across 66 datasets, demonstrating improved performance in three downstream tasks: data imputation, error detection, and entity matching using two distinct LLMs; Google flan-t5-xxl and Mixtral 8x7B.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we show two new variants of multi-view k-means (MVKM) algorithms to address multi-view data. The general idea is to outline the distance between $h$-th view data points $x_i^h$ and $h$-th view cluster centers $a_k^h$ in a different manner of centroid-based approach. Unlike other methods, our proposed methods learn the multi-view data by calculating the similarity using Euclidean norm in the space of Gaussian-kernel, namely as multi-view k-means with exponent distance (MVKM-ED). By simultaneously aligning the stabilizer parameter $p$ and kernel coefficients $\beta^h$, the compression of Gaussian-kernel based weighted distance in Euclidean norm reduce the sensitivity of MVKM-ED. To this end, this paper designated as Gaussian-kernel multi-view k-means (GKMVKM) clustering algorithm. Numerical evaluation of five real-world multi-view data demonstrates the robustness and efficiency of our proposed MVKM-ED and GKMVKM approaches.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Point-based representations have recently gained popularity in novel view synthesis, for their unique advantages, e.g., intuitive geometric representation, simple manipulation, and faster convergence. However, based on our observation, these point-based neural re-rendering methods are only expected to perform well under ideal conditions and suffer from noisy, patchy points and unbounded scenes, which are challenging to handle but defacto common in real applications. To this end, we revisit one such influential method, known as Neural Point-based Graphics (NPBG), as our baseline, and propose Robust Point-based Graphics (RPBG). We in-depth analyze the factors that prevent NPBG from achieving satisfactory renderings on generic datasets, and accordingly reform the pipeline to make it more robust to varying datasets in-the-wild. Inspired by the practices in image restoration, we greatly enhance the neural renderer to enable the attention-based correction of point visibility and the inpainting of incomplete rasterization, with only acceptable overheads. We also seek for a simple and lightweight alternative for environment modeling and an iterative method to alleviate the problem of poor geometry. By thorough evaluation on a wide range of datasets with different shooting conditions and camera trajectories, RPBG stably outperforms the baseline by a large margin, and exhibits its great robustness over state-of-the-art NeRF-based variants.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Molecular representation learning has shown great success in advancing AI-based drug discovery. The core of many recent works is based on the fact that the 3D geometric structure of molecules provides essential information about their physical and chemical characteristics. Recently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models have achieved impressive performance in 3D molecular representation learning. However, most existing molecular diffusion models treat each atom as an independent entity, overlooking the dependency among atoms within the molecular substructures. This paper introduces a novel approach that enhances molecular representation learning by incorporating substructural information within the diffusion process. We propose a novel diffusion model termed SubGDiff for involving the molecular subgraph information in diffusion. Specifically, SubGDiff adopts three vital techniques: i) subgraph prediction, ii) expectation state, and iii) k-step same subgraph diffusion, to enhance the perception of molecular substructure in the denoising network. Experimentally, extensive downstream tasks demonstrate the superior performance of our approach. The code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Early identification of head and neck cancer (HNC) patients who would experience significant anatomical change during radiotherapy (RT) is important to optimize patient clinical benefit and treatment resources. This study aims to assess the feasibility of using a vision-transformer (ViT) based neural network to predict RT-induced anatomic change in HNC patients. We retrospectively included 121 HNC patients treated with definitive RT/CRT. We collected the planning CT (pCT), planned dose, CBCTs acquired at the initial treatment (CBCT01) and fraction 21 (CBCT21), and primary tumor volume (GTVp) and involved nodal volume (GTVn) delineated on both pCT and CBCTs for model construction and evaluation. A UNet-style ViT network was designed to learn spatial correspondence and contextual information from embedded CT, dose, CBCT01, GTVp, and GTVn image patches. The model estimated the deformation vector field between CBCT01 and CBCT21 as the prediction of anatomic change, and deformed CBCT01 was used as the prediction of CBCT21. We also generated binary masks of GTVp, GTVn, and patient body for volumetric change evaluation. The predicted image from the proposed method yielded the best similarity to the real image (CBCT21) over pCT, CBCT01, and predicted CBCTs from other comparison models. The average MSE and SSIM between the normalized predicted CBCT to CBCT21 are 0.009 and 0.933, while the average dice coefficient between body mask, GTVp mask, and GTVn mask are 0.972, 0.792, and 0.821 respectively. The proposed method showed promising performance for predicting radiotherapy-induced anatomic change, which has the potential to assist in the decision-making of HNC Adaptive RT.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With an evergrowing number of LLMs reporting superlative performance for English, their ability to perform equitably for different dialects of English (i.e., dialect robustness) needs to be ascertained. Specifically, we use English language (US English or Indian English) conversations between humans who play the word-guessing game of `taboo'. We formulate two evaluative tasks: target word prediction (TWP) (i.e.predict the masked target word in a conversation) and target word selection (TWS) (i.e., select the most likely masked target word in a conversation, from among a set of candidate words). Extending MD3, an existing dialectic dataset of taboo-playing conversations, we introduce M-MD3, a target-word-masked version of MD3 with the USEng and IndEng subsets. We add two subsets: AITrans (where dialectic information is removed from IndEng) and AIGen (where LLMs are prompted to generate conversations). Our evaluation uses pre-trained and fine-tuned versions of two closed-source (GPT-4/3.5) and two open-source LLMs (Mistral and Gemma). LLMs perform significantly better for US English than Indian English for both TWP and TWS, for all settings. While GPT-based models perform the best, the comparatively smaller models work more equitably for short conversations (<8 turns). Our results on AIGen and AITrans (the best and worst-performing subset) respectively show that LLMs may learn a dialect of their own based on the composition of the training data, and that dialect robustness is indeed a challenging task. Our evaluation methodology exhibits a novel way to examine attributes of language models using pre-existing dialogue datasets.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Thanks to the powerful generative capacity of diffusion models, recent years have witnessed rapid progress in human motion generation. Existing diffusion-based methods employ disparate network architectures and training strategies. The effect of the design of each component is still unclear. In addition, the iterative denoising process consumes considerable computational overhead, which is prohibitive for real-time scenarios such as virtual characters and humanoid robots. For this reason, we first conduct a comprehensive investigation into network architectures, training strategies, and inference processs. Based on the profound analysis, we tailor each component for efficient high-quality human motion generation. Despite the promising performance, the tailored model still suffers from foot skating which is an ubiquitous issue in diffusion-based solutions. To eliminate footskate, we identify foot-ground contact and correct foot motions along the denoising process. By organically combining these well-designed components together, we present StableMoFusion, a robust and efficient framework for human motion generation. Extensive experimental results show that our StableMoFusion performs favorably against current state-of-the-art methods. Project page: this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While current research predominantly focuses on image-based colorization, the domain of video-based colorization remains relatively unexplored. Most existing video colorization techniques operate on a frame-by-frame basis, often overlooking the critical aspect of temporal coherence between successive frames. This approach can result in inconsistencies across frames, leading to undesirable effects like flickering or abrupt color transitions between frames. To address these challenges, we harness the generative capabilities of a fine-tuned latent diffusion model designed specifically for video colorization, introducing a novel solution for achieving temporal consistency in video colorization, as well as demonstrating strong improvements on established image quality metrics compared to other existing methods. Furthermore, we perform a subjective study, where users preferred our approach to the existing state of the art. Our dataset encompasses a combination of conventional datasets and videos from television/movies. In short, by leveraging the power of a fine-tuned latent diffusion-based colorization system with a temporal consistency mechanism, we can improve the performance of automatic video colorization by addressing the challenges of temporal inconsistency. A short demonstration of our results can be seen in some example videos available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The off-policy learning paradigm allows for recommender systems and general ranking applications to be framed as decision-making problems, where we aim to learn decision policies that optimize an unbiased offline estimate of an online reward metric. With unbiasedness comes potentially high variance, and prevalent methods exist to reduce estimation variance. These methods typically make use of control variates, either additive (i.e., baseline corrections or doubly robust methods) or multiplicative (i.e., self-normalisation). Our work unifies these approaches by proposing a single framework built on their equivalence in learning scenarios. The foundation of our framework is the derivation of an equivalent baseline correction for all of the existing control variates. Consequently, our framework enables us to characterize the variance-optimal unbiased estimator and provide a closed-form solution for it. This optimal estimator brings significantly improved performance in both evaluation and learning, and minimizes data requirements. Empirical observations corroborate our theoretical findings.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have shown significant advancements across diverse natural language understanding (NLU) tasks, including intelligent dialogue and autonomous agents. Yet, lacking widely acknowledged testing mechanisms, answering `whether LLMs are stochastic parrots or genuinely comprehend the world' remains unclear, fostering numerous studies and sparking heated debates. Prevailing research mainly focuses on surface-level NLU, neglecting fine-grained explorations. However, such explorations are crucial for understanding their unique comprehension mechanisms, aligning with human cognition, and finally enhancing LLMs' general NLU capacities. To address this gap, our study delves into LLMs' nuanced semantic comprehension capabilities, particularly regarding common words with uncommon meanings. The idea stems from foundational principles of human communication within psychology, which underscore accurate shared understandings of word semantics. Specifically, this paper presents the innovative construction of a Lexical Semantic Comprehension (LeSC) dataset with novel evaluation metrics, the first benchmark encompassing both fine-grained and cross-lingual dimensions. Introducing models of both open-source and closed-source, varied scales and architectures, our extensive empirical experiments demonstrate the inferior performance of existing models in this basic lexical-meaning understanding task. Notably, even the state-of-the-art LLMs GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 lag behind 16-year-old humans by 3.9% and 22.3%, respectively. Additionally, multiple advanced prompting techniques and retrieval-augmented generation are also introduced to help alleviate this trouble, yet limitations persist. By highlighting the above critical shortcomings, this research motivates further investigation and offers novel insights for developing more intelligent LLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, explainability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we propose a No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NRIQA) guided cut-off point selection (CPS) strategy to enhance the performance of a fine-grained classification system. Scores given by existing NRIQA methods on the same image may vary and not be as independent of natural image augmentations as expected, which weakens their connection and explainability to fine-grained image classification. Taking the three most commonly adopted image augmentation configurations -- cropping, rotating, and blurring -- as the entry point, we formulate a two-step mechanism for selecting the most discriminative subset from a given image dataset by considering both the confidence of model predictions and the density distribution of image qualities over several NRIQA methods. Concretely, the cut-off points yielded by those methods are aggregated via majority voting to inform the process of image subset selection. The efficacy and efficiency of such a mechanism have been confirmed by comparing the models being trained on high-quality images against a combination of high- and low-quality ones, with a range of 0.7% to 4.2% improvement on a commercial product dataset in terms of mean accuracy through four deep neural classifiers. The robustness of the mechanism has been proven by the observations that all the selected high-quality images can work jointly with 70% low-quality images with 1.3% of classification precision sacrificed when using ResNet34 in an ablation study.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, transformer, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Element segmentation is a key step in nondestructive testing of Printed Circuit Boards (PCB) based on Computed Tomography (CT) technology. In recent years, the rapid development of self-supervised pretraining technology can obtain general image features without labeled samples, and then use a small amount of labeled samples to solve downstream tasks, which has a good potential in PCB element segmentation. At present, Masked Image Modeling (MIM) pretraining model has been initially applied in PCB CT image element segmentation. However, due to the small and regular size of PCB elements such as vias, wires, and pads, the global visual field has redundancy for a single element reconstruction, which may damage the performance of the model. Based on this issue, we propose an efficient pretraining model based on multi-scale local visual field feature reconstruction for PCB CT image element segmentation (EMLR-seg). In this model, the teacher-guided MIM pretraining model is introduced into PCB CT image element segmentation for the first time, and a multi-scale local visual field extraction (MVE) module is proposed to reduce redundancy by focusing on local visual fields. At the same time, a simple 4-Transformer-blocks decoder is used. Experiments show that EMLR-seg can achieve 88.6% mIoU on the PCB CT image dataset we proposed, which exceeds 1.2% by the baseline model, and the training time is reduced by 29.6 hours, a reduction of 17.4% under the same experimental condition, which reflects the advantage of EMLR-seg in terms of performance and efficiency.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Audio-driven talking head generation is advancing from 2D to 3D content. Notably, Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) is in the spotlight as a means to synthesize high-quality 3D talking head outputs. Unfortunately, this NeRF-based approach typically requires a large number of paired audio-visual data for each identity, thereby limiting the scalability of the method. Although there have been attempts to generate audio-driven 3D talking head animations with a single image, the results are often unsatisfactory due to insufficient information on obscured regions in the image. In this paper, we mainly focus on addressing the overlooked aspect of 3D consistency in the one-shot, audio-driven domain, where facial animations are synthesized primarily in front-facing perspectives. We propose a novel method, NeRFFaceSpeech, which enables to produce high-quality 3D-aware talking head. Using prior knowledge of generative models combined with NeRF, our method can craft a 3D-consistent facial feature space corresponding to a single image. Our spatial synchronization method employs audio-correlated vertex dynamics of a parametric face model to transform static image features into dynamic visuals through ray deformation, ensuring realistic 3D facial motion. Moreover, we introduce LipaintNet that can replenish the lacking information in the inner-mouth area, which can not be obtained from a given single image. The network is trained in a self-supervised manner by utilizing the generative capabilities without additional data. The comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method in generating audio-driven talking heads from a single image with enhanced 3D consistency compared to previous approaches. In addition, we introduce a quantitative way of measuring the robustness of a model against pose changes for the first time, which has been possible only qualitatively.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with channel-wise feature refining mechanisms have brought noticeable benefits to modelling channel dependencies. However, current attention paradigms fail to infer an optimal channel descriptor capable of simultaneously exploiting statistical and spatial relationships among feature maps. In this paper, to overcome this shortcoming, we present a novel channel-wise spatially autocorrelated (CSA) attention mechanism. Inspired by geographical analysis, the proposed CSA exploits the spatial relationships between channels of feature maps to produce an effective channel descriptor. To the best of our knowledge, this is the f irst time that the concept of geographical spatial analysis is utilized in deep CNNs. The proposed CSA imposes negligible learning parameters and light computational overhead to the deep model, making it a powerful yet efficient attention module of choice. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed CSA networks (CSA-Nets) through extensive experiments and analysis on ImageNet, and MS COCO benchmark datasets for image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation. The experimental results demonstrate that CSA-Nets are able to consistently achieve competitive performance and superior generalization than several state-of-the-art attention-based CNNs over different benchmark tasks and datasets.</li>

However, this task becomes challenging due to the presence of noise and irrelevant information in "text-image" pairs. Existing methods suffer from insufficient feature representations and fail to consider the comprehensive integration of similarity at different granularities, making it difficult to filter out noise and irrelevant information. To address these challenges, we propose a Similarity-Guided Multimodal Fusion Transformer (SG-MFT) for predicting social users' semantic locations. First, we utilize a pre-trained large-scale vision-language model to extract high-quality feature representations from social media posts. Then, we introduce a Similarity-Guided Interaction Module (SIM) to alleviate modality heterogeneity and noise interference by incorporating coarse-grained and fine-grained similarity guidance for modality interactions. Specifically, we propose a novel similarity-aware feature interpolation attention mechanism at the coarse level, leveraging modality-wise similarity to mitigate heterogeneity and reduce noise within each modality. Meanwhile, we employ a similarity-aware feed-forward block at the fine level, utilizing element-wise similarity to further mitigate the impact of modality heterogeneity. Building upon pre-processed features with minimal noise and modal interference, we propose a Similarity-aware Feature Fusion Module (SFM) to fuse two modalities with cross-attention mechanism. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method in handling modality imbalance while maintaining efficient fusion effectiveness.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Detail features of magnetic resonance images play a cru-cial role in accurate medical diagnosis and treatment, as they capture subtle changes that pose challenges for doc-tors when performing precise judgments. However, the widely utilized naive diffusion model has limitations, as it fails to accurately capture more intricate details. To en-hance the quality of MRI reconstruction, we propose a comprehensive detail-preserving reconstruction method using multiple diffusion models to extract structure and detail features in k-space domain instead of image do-main. Moreover, virtual binary modal masks are utilized to refine the range of values in k-space data through highly adaptive center windows, which allows the model to focus its attention more efficiently. Last but not least, an inverted pyramid structure is employed, where the top-down image information gradually decreases, ena-bling a cascade representation. The framework effective-ly represents multi-scale sampled data, taking into ac-count the sparsity of the inverted pyramid architecture, and utilizes cascade training data distribution to repre-sent multi-scale data. Through a step-by-step refinement approach, the method refines the approximation of de-tails. Finally, the proposed method was evaluated by con-ducting experiments on clinical and public datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed method outper-forms other methods.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Artificial Intelligence Generative Content (AIGC) technologies have significantly influenced the remote sensing domain, particularly in the realm of image generation. However, remote sensing image editing, an equally vital research area, has not garnered sufficient attention. Different from text-guided editing in natural images, which relies on extensive text-image paired data for semantic correlation, the application scenarios of remote sensing image editing are often extreme, such as forest on fire, so it is difficult to obtain sufficient paired samples. At the same time, the lack of remote sensing semantics and the ambiguity of text also restrict the further application of image editing in remote sensing field. To solve above problems, this letter proposes a diffusion based method to fulfill stable and controllable remote sensing image editing with text guidance. Our method avoids the use of a large number of paired image, and can achieve good image editing results using only a single image. The quantitative evaluation system including CLIP score and subjective evaluation metrics shows that our method has better editing effect on remote sensing images than the existing image editing model.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Human communication is based on a variety of inferences that we draw from sentences, often going beyond what is literally said. While there is wide agreement on the basic distinction between entailment, implicature, and presupposition, the status of many inferences remains controversial. In this paper, we focus on three inferences of plain and embedded disjunctions, and compare them with regular scalar implicatures. We investigate this comparison from the novel perspective of the predictions of state-of-the-art large language models, using the same experimental paradigms as recent studies investigating the same inferences with humans. The results of our best performing models mostly align with those of humans, both in the large differences we find between those inferences and implicatures, as well as in fine-grained distinctions among different aspects of those inferences.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Sámi, an indigenous language group comprising multiple languages, faces digital marginalization due to the limited availability of data and sophisticated language models designed for its linguistic intricacies. This work focuses on increasing technological participation for the Sámi language. We draw the attention of the ML community towards the language modeling problem of Ultra Low Resource (ULR) languages. ULR languages are those for which the amount of available textual resources is very low, and the speaker count for them is also very low. ULRLs are also not supported by mainstream Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, due to which gathering artificial training data for them becomes even more challenging. Mainstream AI foundational model development has given less attention to this category of languages. Generally, these languages have very few speakers, making it hard to find them. However, it is important to develop foundational models for these ULR languages to promote inclusion and the tangible abilities and impact of LLMs. To this end, we have compiled the available Sámi language resources from the web to create a clean dataset for training language models. In order to study the behavior of modern LLM models with ULR languages (Sámi), we have experimented with different kinds of LLMs, mainly at the order of $\sim$ seven billion parameters. We have also explored the effect of multilingual LLM training for ULRLs. We found that the decoder-only models under a sequential multilingual training scenario perform better than joint multilingual training, whereas multilingual training with high semantic overlap, in general, performs better than training from scratch.This is the first study on the Sámi language for adapting non-statistical language models that use the latest developments in the field of natural language processing (NLP).</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, defense, attack, robust, steal</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>A graph neural network (GNN) is a type of neural network that is specifically designed to process graph-structured data. Typically, GNNs can be implemented in two settings, including the transductive setting and the inductive setting. In the transductive setting, the trained model can only predict the labels of nodes that were observed at the training time. In the inductive setting, the trained model can be generalized to new nodes/graphs. Due to its flexibility, the inductive setting is the most popular GNN setting at the moment. Previous work has shown that transductive GNNs are vulnerable to a series of privacy attacks. However, a comprehensive privacy analysis of inductive GNN models is still missing. This paper fills the gap by conducting a systematic privacy analysis of inductive GNNs through the lens of link stealing attacks, one of the most popular attacks that are specifically designed for GNNs. We propose two types of link stealing attacks, i.e., posterior-only attacks and combined attacks. We define threat models of the posterior-only attacks with respect to node topology and the combined attacks by considering combinations of posteriors, node attributes, and graph features. Extensive evaluation on six real-world datasets demonstrates that inductive GNNs leak rich information that enables link stealing attacks with advantageous properties. Even attacks with no knowledge about graph structures can be effective. We also show that our attacks are robust to different node similarities and different graph features. As a counterpart, we investigate two possible defenses and discover they are ineffective against our attacks, which calls for more effective defenses.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Matrix completion has important applications in trajectory recovery and mobile social networks. However, sending raw data containing personal, sensitive information to cloud computing nodes may lead to privacy exposure issue.The privacy-preserving matrix completion is a useful approach to perform matrix completion while preserving privacy. In this paper, we propose a high-performance method for privacy-preserving matrix completion. First,we use a lightweight encryption scheme to encrypt the raw data and then perform matrix completion using alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Then,the complemented matrix is decrypted and compared with the original matrix to calculate the error. This method has faster speed with higher accuracy. The results of numerical experiments reveal that the proposed method is faster than other algorithms.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>To fully understand the 3D context of a single image, a visual system must be able to segment both the visible and occluded regions of objects, while discerning their occlusion order. Ideally, the system should be able to handle any object and not be restricted to segmenting a limited set of object classes, especially in robotic applications. Addressing this need, we introduce a diffusion model with cumulative occlusion learning designed for sequential amodal segmentation of objects with uncertain categories. This model iteratively refines the prediction using the cumulative mask strategy during diffusion, effectively capturing the uncertainty of invisible regions and adeptly reproducing the complex distribution of shapes and occlusion orders of occluded objects. It is akin to the human capability for amodal perception, i.e., to decipher the spatial ordering among objects and accurately predict complete contours for occluded objects in densely layered visual scenes. Experimental results across three amodal datasets show that our method outperforms established baselines.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demand considerable computations for inference due to the extensive parameters and the additional input tokens needed for visual information representation. Herein, we introduce Visual Tokens Withdrawal (VTW), a plug-and-play module to boost MLLMs for rapid inference. Our approach is inspired by two intriguing phenomena we have observed: (1) the attention sink phenomenon that is prevalent in LLMs also persists in MLLMs, suggesting that initial tokens and nearest tokens receive the majority of attention, while middle vision tokens garner minimal attention in deep layers; (2) the presence of information migration, which implies that visual information is transferred to subsequent text tokens within the first few layers of MLLMs. As per our findings, we conclude that vision tokens are not necessary in the deep layers of MLLMs. Thus, we strategically withdraw them at a certain layer, enabling only text tokens to engage in subsequent layers. To pinpoint the ideal layer for vision tokens withdrawal, we initially analyze a limited set of tiny datasets and choose the first layer that meets the Kullback-Leibler divergence criterion. Our VTW approach can cut computational overhead by over 40\% across diverse multimodal tasks while maintaining performance. Our code is released at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have shown significant success in personalized text-to-image generation, which aims to generate novel images with human identities indicated by the reference images. Despite promising identity fidelity has been achieved by several tuning-free methods, they usually suffer from overfitting issues. The learned identity tends to entangle with irrelevant information, resulting in unsatisfied text controllability, especially on faces. In this work, we present MasterWeaver, a test-time tuning-free method designed to generate personalized images with both faithful identity fidelity and flexible editability. Specifically, MasterWeaver adopts an encoder to extract identity features and steers the image generation through additional introduced cross attention. To improve editability while maintaining identity fidelity, we propose an editing direction loss for training, which aligns the editing directions of our MasterWeaver with those of the original T2I model. Additionally, a face-augmented dataset is constructed to facilitate disentangled identity learning, and further improve the editability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our MasterWeaver can not only generate personalized images with faithful identity, but also exhibit superiority in text controllability.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The objective of single image dehazing is to restore hazy images and produce clear, high-quality visuals. Traditional convolutional models struggle with long-range dependencies due to their limited receptive field size. While Transformers excel at capturing such dependencies, their quadratic computational complexity in relation to feature map resolution makes them less suitable for pixel-to-pixel dense prediction tasks. Moreover, fixed kernels or tokens in most models do not adapt well to varying blur sizes, resulting in suboptimal dehazing performance. In this study, we introduce a novel dehazing network based on Parallel Stripe Cross Attention (PCSA) with a multi-scale strategy. PCSA efficiently integrates long-range dependencies by simultaneously capturing horizontal and vertical relationships, allowing each pixel to capture contextual cues from an expanded spatial domain. To handle different sizes and shapes of blurs flexibly, We employs a channel-wise design with varying convolutional kernel sizes and strip lengths in each PCSA to capture context information at different scales.Additionally, we incorporate a softmax-based adaptive weighting mechanism within PCSA to prioritize and leverage more critical features.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Lots of popular calibration methods in medical images focus on classification, but there are few comparable studies on semantic segmentation. In polyp segmentation of medical images, we find most diseased area occupies only a small portion of the entire image, resulting in previous models being not well-calibrated for lesion regions but well-calibrated for background, despite their seemingly better Expected Calibration Error (ECE) scores overall. Therefore, we proposed four-branches calibration network with Mask-Loss and Mask-TS strategies to more focus on the scaling of logits within potential lesion regions, which serves to mitigate the influence of background interference. In the experiments, we compare the existing calibration methods with the proposed Mask Temperature Scaling (Mask-TS). The results indicate that the proposed calibration network outperforms other methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The past few years have witnessed substantial advancement in text-guided image generation powered by diffusion models. However, it was shown that text-to-image diffusion models are vulnerable to training image memorization, raising concerns on copyright infringement and privacy invasion. In this work, we perform practical analysis of memorization in text-to-image diffusion models. Targeting a set of images to protect, we conduct quantitive analysis on them without need to collect any prompts. Specifically, we first formally define the memorization of image and identify three necessary conditions of memorization, respectively similarity, existence and probability. We then reveal the correlation between the model's prediction error and image replication. Based on the correlation, we propose to utilize inversion techniques to verify the safety of target images against memorization and measure the extent to which they are memorized. Model developers can utilize our analysis method to discover memorized images or reliably claim safety against memorization. Extensive experiments on the Stable Diffusion, a popular open-source text-to-image diffusion model, demonstrate the effectiveness of our analysis method.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Representation learning, and interpreting learned representations, are key areas of focus in machine learning and neuroscience. Both fields generally use representations as a means to understand or improve a system's computations. In this work, however, we explore surprising dissociations between representation and computation that may pose challenges for such efforts. We create datasets in which we attempt to match the computational role that different features play, while manipulating other properties of the features or the data. We train various deep learning architectures to compute these multiple abstract features about their inputs. We find that their learned feature representations are systematically biased towards representing some features more strongly than others, depending upon extraneous properties such as feature complexity, the order in which features are learned, and the distribution of features over the inputs. For example, features that are simpler to compute or learned first tend to be represented more strongly and densely than features that are more complex or learned later, even if all features are learned equally well. We also explore how these biases are affected by architectures, optimizers, and training regimes (e.g., in transformers, features decoded earlier in the output sequence also tend to be represented more strongly). Our results help to characterize the inductive biases of gradient-based representation learning. These results also highlight a key challenge for interpretability $-$ or for comparing the representations of models and brains $-$ disentangling extraneous biases from the computationally important aspects of a system's internal representations.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Embodied AI agents require a fine-grained understanding of the physical world mediated through visual and language inputs. Such capabilities are difficult to learn solely from task-specific data. This has led to the emergence of pre-trained vision-language models as a tool for transferring representations learned from internet-scale data to downstream tasks and new domains. However, commonly used contrastively trained representations such as in CLIP have been shown to fail at enabling embodied agents to gain a sufficiently fine-grained scene understanding -- a capability vital for control. To address this shortcoming, we consider representations from pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, which are explicitly optimized to generate images from text prompts and as such, contain text-conditioned representations that reflect highly fine-grained visuo-spatial information. Using pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, we construct Stable Control Representations which allow learning downstream control policies that generalize to complex, open-ended environments. We show that policies learned using Stable Control Representations are competitive with state-of-the-art representation learning approaches across a broad range of simulated control settings, encompassing challenging manipulation and navigation tasks. Most notably, we show that Stable Control Representations enable learning policies that exhibit state-of-the-art performance on OVMM, a difficult open-vocabulary navigation benchmark.</li>

Subsequently, a new dataset becomes available, prompting the desire to make a pivotal decision for achieving enhanced and leveraged inference performance on both sides: Should one opt to train datasets from scratch or fine-tune the model trained on the initial dataset using the newly released dataset? The existing literature reveals a lack of methods to systematically determine the optimal training strategy, necessitating explainability. To this end, we present an automatic best-suit training solution searching framework, the Dual-Carriageway Framework (DCF), to fill this gap. DCF benefits from the design of a dual-direction search (starting from the pre-existing or the newly released dataset) where five different training settings are enforced. In addition, DCF is not only capable of figuring out the optimal training strategy with the capability of avoiding overfitting but also yields built-in quantitative and visual explanations derived from the actual input and weights of the trained model. We validated DCF's effectiveness through experiments with three convolutional neural networks (ResNet18, ResNet34 and Inception-v3) on two temporally continued commercial product datasets. Results showed fine-tuning pathways outperformed training-from-scratch ones by up to 2.13% and 1.23% on the pre-existing and new datasets, respectively, in terms of mean accuracy. Furthermore, DCF identified reflection padding as the superior padding method, enhancing testing accuracy by 3.72% on average. This framework stands out for its potential to guide the development of robust and explainable AI solutions in fine-grained visual classification tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Bayesian Federated Learning (FL) has been recently introduced to provide well-calibrated Machine Learning (ML) models quantifying the uncertainty of their predictions. Despite their advantages compared to frequentist FL setups, Bayesian FL tools implemented over decentralized networks are subject to high communication costs due to the iterated exchange of local posterior distributions among cooperating devices. Therefore, this paper proposes a communication-efficient decentralized Bayesian FL policy to reduce the communication overhead without sacrificing final learning accuracy and calibration. The proposed method integrates compression policies and allows devices to perform multiple optimization steps before sending the local posterior distributions. We integrate the developed tool in an Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) use case where collaborating nodes equipped with autonomous radar sensors are tasked to reliably localize human operators in a workplace shared with robots. Numerical results show that the developed approach obtains highly accurate yet well-calibrated ML models compatible with the ones provided by conventional (uncompressed) Bayesian FL tools while substantially decreasing the communication overhead (i.e., up to 99%). Furthermore, the proposed approach is advantageous when compared with state-of-the-art compressed frequentist FL setups in terms of calibration, especially when the statistical distribution of the testing dataset changes.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>A major challenge in deploying reinforcement learning in online tasks is ensuring that safety is maintained throughout the learning process. In this work, we propose CERL, a new method for solving constrained Markov decision processes while keeping the policy safe during learning. Our method leverages Bayesian world models and suggests policies that are pessimistic w.r.t. the model's epistemic uncertainty. This makes CERL robust towards model inaccuracies and leads to safe exploration during learning. In our experiments, we demonstrate that CERL outperforms the current state-of-the-art in terms of safety and optimality in solving CMDPs from image observations.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Masked face recognition (MFR) has emerged as a critical domain in biometric identification, especially by the global COVID-19 pandemic, which introduced widespread face masks. This survey paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the challenges and advancements in recognising and detecting individuals with masked faces, which has seen innovative shifts due to the necessity of adapting to new societal norms. Advanced through deep learning techniques, MFR, along with Face Mask Recognition (FMR) and Face Unmasking (FU), represent significant areas of focus. These methods address unique challenges posed by obscured facial features, from fully to partially covered faces. Our comprehensive review delves into the various deep learning-based methodologies developed for MFR, FMR, and FU, highlighting their distinctive challenges and the solutions proposed to overcome them. Additionally, we explore benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics specifically tailored for assessing performance in MFR research. The survey also discusses the substantial obstacles still facing researchers in this field and proposes future directions for the ongoing development of more robust and effective masked face recognition systems. This paper serves as an invaluable resource for researchers and practitioners, offering insights into the evolving landscape of face recognition technologies in the face of global health crises and beyond.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>When large language models are aligned via supervised fine-tuning, they may encounter new factual information that was not acquired through pre-training. It is often conjectured that this can teach the model the behavior of hallucinating factually incorrect responses, as the model is trained to generate facts that are not grounded in its pre-existing knowledge. In this work, we study the impact of such exposure to new knowledge on the capability of the fine-tuned model to utilize its pre-existing knowledge. To this end, we design a controlled setup, focused on closed-book QA, where we vary the proportion of the fine-tuning examples that introduce new knowledge. We demonstrate that large language models struggle to acquire new factual knowledge through fine-tuning, as fine-tuning examples that introduce new knowledge are learned significantly slower than those consistent with the model's knowledge. However, we also find that as the examples with new knowledge are eventually learned, they linearly increase the model's tendency to hallucinate. Taken together, our results highlight the risk in introducing new factual knowledge through fine-tuning, and support the view that large language models mostly acquire factual knowledge through pre-training, whereas fine-tuning teaches them to use it more efficiently.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>AI-generated content (AIGC) models, represented by large language models (LLM), have brought revolutionary changes to the content generation fields. The high-speed and extensive 6G technology is an ideal platform for providing powerful AIGC mobile service applications, while future 6G mobile networks also need to support intelligent and personalized mobile generation services. However, the significant ethical and security issues of current AIGC models, such as adversarial attacks, privacy, and fairness, greatly affect the credibility of 6G intelligent networks, especially in ensuring secure, private, and fair AIGC applications. In this paper, we propose TrustGAIN, a novel paradigm for trustworthy AIGC in 6G networks, to ensure trustworthy large-scale AIGC services in future 6G networks. We first discuss the adversarial attacks and privacy threats faced by AIGC systems in 6G networks, as well as the corresponding protection issues. Subsequently, we emphasize the importance of ensuring the unbiasedness and fairness of the mobile generative service in future intelligent networks. In particular, we conduct a use case to demonstrate that TrustGAIN can effectively guide the resistance against malicious or generated false information. We believe that TrustGAIN is a necessary paradigm for intelligent and trustworthy 6G networks to support AIGC services, ensuring the security, privacy, and fairness of AIGC network services.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Ensuring fair predictions across many distinct subpopulations in the training data can be prohibitive for large models. Recently, simple linear last layer retraining strategies, in combination with data augmentation methods such as upweighting, downsampling and mixup, have been shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance for worst-group accuracy, which quantifies accuracy for the least prevalent subpopulation. For linear last layer retraining and the abovementioned augmentations, we present the optimal worst-group accuracy when modeling the distribution of the latent representations (input to the last layer) as Gaussian for each subpopulation. We evaluate and verify our results for both synthetic and large publicly available datasets.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, transformer, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Sora unveils the potential of scaling Diffusion Transformer for generating photorealistic images and videos at arbitrary resolutions, aspect ratios, and durations, yet it still lacks sufficient implementation details. In this technical report, we introduce the Lumina-T2X family - a series of Flow-based Large Diffusion Transformers (Flag-DiT) equipped with zero-initialized attention, as a unified framework designed to transform noise into images, videos, multi-view 3D objects, and audio clips conditioned on text instructions. By tokenizing the latent spatial-temporal space and incorporating learnable placeholders such as [nextline] and [nextframe] tokens, Lumina-T2X seamlessly unifies the representations of different modalities across various spatial-temporal resolutions. This unified approach enables training within a single framework for different modalities and allows for flexible generation of multimodal data at any resolution, aspect ratio, and length during inference. Advanced techniques like RoPE, RMSNorm, and flow matching enhance the stability, flexibility, and scalability of Flag-DiT, enabling models of Lumina-T2X to scale up to 7 billion parameters and extend the context window to 128K tokens. This is particularly beneficial for creating ultra-high-definition images with our Lumina-T2I model and long 720p videos with our Lumina-T2V model. Remarkably, Lumina-T2I, powered by a 5-billion-parameter Flag-DiT, requires only 35% of the training computational costs of a 600-million-parameter naive DiT. Our further comprehensive analysis underscores Lumina-T2X's preliminary capability in resolution extrapolation, high-resolution editing, generating consistent 3D views, and synthesizing videos with seamless transitions. We expect that the open-sourcing of Lumina-T2X will further foster creativity, transparency, and diversity in the generative AI community.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) have focused primarily on scaling by increasing text-image pair data and enhancing LLMs to improve performance on multimodal tasks. However, these scaling approaches are computationally expensive and overlook the significance of improving model capabilities from the vision side. Inspired by the successful applications of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) in LLMs, which improves model scalability during training while keeping inference costs similar to those of smaller models, we propose CuMo. CuMo incorporates Co-upcycled Top-K sparsely-gated Mixture-of-experts blocks into both the vision encoder and the MLP connector, thereby enhancing the multimodal LLMs with minimal additional activated parameters during inference. CuMo first pre-trains the MLP blocks and then initializes each expert in the MoE block from the pre-trained MLP block during the visual instruction tuning stage. Auxiliary losses are used to ensure a balanced loading of experts. CuMo outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs across various VQA and visual-instruction-following benchmarks using models within each model size group, all while training exclusively on open-sourced datasets. The code and model weights for CuMo are open-sourced at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper introduces a federated learning framework tailored for online combinatorial optimization with bandit feedback. In this setting, agents select subsets of arms, observe noisy rewards for these subsets without accessing individual arm information, and can cooperate and share information at specific intervals. Our framework transforms any offline resilient single-agent $(\alpha-\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm, having a complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\frac{\psi}{\epsilon^\beta})$, where the logarithm is omitted, for some function $\psi$ and constant $\beta$, into an online multi-agent algorithm with $m$ communicating agents and an $\alpha$-regret of no more than $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(m^{-\frac{1}{3+\beta}} \psi^\frac{1}{3+\beta} T^\frac{2+\beta}{3+\beta})$. This approach not only eliminates the $\epsilon$ approximation error but also ensures sublinear growth with respect to the time horizon $T$ and demonstrates a linear speedup with an increasing number of communicating agents. Additionally, the algorithm is notably communication-efficient, requiring only a sublinear number of communication rounds, quantified as $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\psi T^\frac{\beta}{\beta+1}\right)$. Furthermore, the framework has been successfully applied to online stochastic submodular maximization using various offline algorithms, yielding the first results for both single-agent and multi-agent settings and recovering specialized single-agent theoretical guarantees. We empirically validate our approach to a stochastic data summarization problem, illustrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework, even in single-agent scenarios.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent work in Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) tries to formulate VFI as a diffusion-based conditional image generation problem, synthesizing the intermediate frame given a random noise and neighboring frames. Due to the relatively high resolution of videos, Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are employed as the conditional generation model, where the autoencoder compresses images into latent representations for diffusion and then reconstructs images from these latent representations. Such a formulation poses a crucial challenge: VFI expects that the output is deterministically equal to the ground truth intermediate frame, but LDMs randomly generate a diverse set of different images when the model runs multiple times. The reason for the diverse generation is that the cumulative variance (variance accumulated at each step of generation) of generated latent representations in LDMs is large. This makes the sampling trajectory random, resulting in diverse rather than deterministic generations. To address this problem, we propose our unique solution: Frame Interpolation with Consecutive Brownian Bridge Diffusion. Specifically, we propose consecutive Brownian Bridge diffusion that takes a deterministic initial value as input, resulting in a much smaller cumulative variance of generated latent representations. Our experiments suggest that our method can improve together with the improvement of the autoencoder and achieve state-of-the-art performance in VFI, leaving strong potential for further enhancement.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has opened up unprecedented possibilities for automating complex tasks that are often comparable to human performance. Despite their capabilities, LLMs still encounter difficulties in completing tasks that require high levels of accuracy and complexity due to their inherent limitations in handling multifaceted problems single-handedly. This paper introduces "Smurfs", a cutting-edge multi-agent framework designed to revolutionize the application of LLMs. By transforming a conventional LLM into a synergistic multi-agent ensemble, Smurfs enhances task decomposition and execution without necessitating extra training. This is achieved through innovative prompting strategies that allocate distinct roles within the model, thereby facilitating collaboration among specialized agents. The framework gives access to external tools to efficiently solve complex tasks. Our empirical investigation, featuring the mistral-7b-instruct model as a case study, showcases Smurfs' superior capability in intricate tool utilization scenarios. Notably, Smurfs outmatches the ChatGPT-ReACT in the ToolBench I2 and I3 benchmark with a remarkable 84.4% win rate, surpassing the highest recorded performance of a GPT-4 model at 73.5%. Furthermore, through comprehensive ablation studies, we dissect the contribution of the core components of the multi-agent framework to its overall efficacy. This not only verifies the effectiveness of the framework, but also sets a route for future exploration of multi-agent LLM systems.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have played an important role in many fields due to their powerful capabilities.However, their massive number of parameters leads to high deployment requirements and incurs significant inference costs, which impedes their practical applications. Training smaller models is an effective way to address this problem. Therefore, we introduce OpenBA-V2, a 3.4B model derived from multi-stage compression and continual pre-training from the original 15B OpenBA model. OpenBA-V2 utilizes more data, more flexible training objectives, and techniques such as layer pruning, neural pruning, and vocabulary pruning to achieve a compression rate of 77.3\% with minimal performance loss. OpenBA-V2 demonstrates competitive performance compared to other open-source models of similar size, achieving results close to or on par with the 15B OpenBA model in downstream tasks such as common sense reasoning and Named Entity Recognition (NER). OpenBA-V2 illustrates that LLMs can be compressed into smaller ones with minimal performance loss by employing advanced training objectives and data strategies, which may help deploy LLMs in resource-limited scenarios.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, transformer, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Time Series Representation Learning (TSRL) focuses on generating informative representations for various Time Series (TS) modeling tasks. Traditional Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods in TSRL fall into four main categories: reconstructive, adversarial, contrastive, and predictive, each with a common challenge of sensitivity to noise and intricate data nuances. Recently, diffusion-based methods have shown advanced generative capabilities. However, they primarily target specific application scenarios like imputation and forecasting, leaving a gap in leveraging diffusion models for generic TSRL. Our work, Time Series Diffusion Embedding (TSDE), bridges this gap as the first diffusion-based SSL TSRL approach. TSDE segments TS data into observed and masked parts using an Imputation-Interpolation-Forecasting (IIF) mask. It applies a trainable embedding function, featuring dual-orthogonal Transformer encoders with a crossover mechanism, to the observed part. We train a reverse diffusion process conditioned on the embeddings, designed to predict noise added to the masked part. Extensive experiments demonstrate TSDE's superiority in imputation, interpolation, forecasting, anomaly detection, classification, and clustering. We also conduct an ablation study, present embedding visualizations, and compare inference speed, further substantiating TSDE's efficiency and validity in learning representations of TS data.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper explores differentially-private federated learning (FL) across time-varying databases, delving into a nuanced three-way tradeoff involving age, accuracy, and differential privacy (DP). Emphasizing the potential advantages of scheduling, we propose an optimization problem aimed at meeting DP requirements while minimizing the loss difference between the aggregated model and the model obtained without DP constraints. To harness the benefits of scheduling, we introduce an age-dependent upper bound on the loss, leading to the development of an age-aware scheduling design. Simulation results underscore the superior performance of our proposed scheme compared to FL with classic DP, which does not consider scheduling as a design factor. This research contributes insights into the interplay of age, accuracy, and DP in federated learning, with practical implications for scheduling strategies.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have become capable of generating highly fluent text in certain languages, without modules specially designed to capture grammar or semantic coherence. What does this mean for the future of linguistic expertise in NLP? We highlight several aspects in which NLP (still) relies on linguistics, or where linguistic thinking can illuminate new directions. We argue our case around the acronym $RELIES$ that encapsulates six major facets where linguistics contributes to NLP: $R$esources, $E$valuation, $L$ow-resource settings, $I$nterpretability, $E$xplanation, and the $S$tudy of language. This list is not exhaustive, nor is linguistics the main point of reference for every effort under these themes; but at a macro level, these facets highlight the enduring importance of studying machine systems vis-a-vis systems of human language.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose a method to distill a complex multistep diffusion model into a single-step conditional GAN student model, dramatically accelerating inference, while preserving image quality. Our approach interprets diffusion distillation as a paired image-to-image translation task, using noise-to-image pairs of the diffusion model's ODE trajectory. For efficient regression loss computation, we propose E-LatentLPIPS, a perceptual loss operating directly in diffusion model's latent space, utilizing an ensemble of augmentations. Furthermore, we adapt a diffusion model to construct a multi-scale discriminator with a text alignment loss to build an effective conditional GAN-based formulation. E-LatentLPIPS converges more efficiently than many existing distillation methods, even accounting for dataset construction costs. We demonstrate that our one-step generator outperforms cutting-edge one-step diffusion distillation models - DMD, SDXL-Turbo, and SDXL-Lightning - on the zero-shot COCO benchmark.</li>
