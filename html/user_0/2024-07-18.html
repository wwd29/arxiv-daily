<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, security, privacy</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Portable genome sequencing technology is revolutionizing genomic research by providing a faster, more flexible method of sequencing DNA and RNA [1, 2]. The unprecedented shift from bulky stand-alone benchtop equipment confined in a laboratory setting to small portable devices which can be easily carried anywhere outside the laboratory network and connected to untrusted external computers to perform sequencing raises new security and privacy threats not considered before. Current research primarily addresses the privacy of DNA/RNA data in online databases [3] and the security of stand-alone sequencing devices such as Illumina [4]. However, it overlooks the security risks arising from compromises of computer devices directly connected to portable sequencers as illustrated in Fig. 1. While highly sensitive data, such as the human genome, has become easier to sequence, the networks connecting to these smaller devices and the hardware running basecalling can no longer implicitly be trusted, and doing so can deteriorate the confidentiality and integrity of the genomic data being processed. Here, we present new security and privacy threats of portable sequencing technology and recommendations to aid in ensuring sequencing data is kept private and secure. First, to prevent unauthorized access to sequencing devices, IP addresses should not be considered a sufficient authentication mechanism. Second, integrity checks are necessary for all data passed from the sequencer to external computers to avoid data manipulation. Finally, encryption should be considered as data is passed from the sequencer to such external computers to prevent eavesdropping on data as it is sent and stored. As devices and technology rapidly change, it becomes paramount to reevaluate security requirements alongside them or risk leaving some of our most sensitive data exposed.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Teaching text-to-image models to be creative involves using style ambiguity loss, which requires a pretrained classifier. In this work, we explore a new form of the style ambiguity training objective, used to approximate creativity, that does not require training a classifier or even a labeled dataset. We then train a diffusion model to maximize style ambiguity to imbue the diffusion model with creativity and find our new methods improve upon the traditional method, based on automated metrics for human judgment, while still maintaining creativity and novelty.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Specific Language Impairment (SLI) is a disorder that affects communication and can affect both comprehension and expression. This study focuses on effectively detecting SLI in children using transcripts of spontaneous narratives from 1063 interviews. A three-stage cascading pipeline was proposed f. In the first stage, feature extraction and dimensionality reduction of the data are performed using the Random Forest (RF) and Spearman correlation methods. In the second stage, the most predictive variables from the first stage are estimated using logistic regression, which is used in the last stage to detect SLI in children from transcripts of spontaneous narratives using a nearest neighbor classifier. The results revealed an accuracy of 97.13% in identifying SLI, highlighting aspects such as the length of the responses, the quality of their utterances, and the complexity of the language. This new approach, framed in natural language processing, offers significant benefits to the field of SLI detection by avoiding complex subjective variables and focusing on quantitative metrics directly related to the child's performance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative AI (GenAI) use in research writing is growing fast. However, it is unclear how peer reviewers recognize or misjudge AI-augmented manuscripts. To investigate the impact of AI-augmented writing on peer reviews, we conducted a snippet-based online survey with 17 peer reviewers from top-tier HCI conferences. Our findings indicate that while AI-augmented writing improves readability, language diversity, and informativeness, it often lacks research details and reflective insights from authors. Reviewers consistently struggled to distinguish between human and AI-augmented writing but their judgements remained consistent. They noted the loss of a "human touch" and subjective expressions in AI-augmented writing. Based on our findings, we advocate for reviewer guidelines that promote impartial evaluations of submissions, regardless of any personal biases towards GenAI. The quality of the research itself should remain a priority in reviews, regardless of any preconceived notions about the tools used to create it. We emphasize that researchers must maintain their authorship and control over the writing process, even when using GenAI's assistance.</li>

          LLM-based Frameworks for API Argument Filling in Task-Oriented Conversational Systems(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Task-orientated conversational agents interact with users and assist them via leveraging external APIs. A typical task-oriented conversational system can be broken down into three phases: external API selection, argument filling, and response generation. The focus of our work is the task of argument filling, which is in charge of accurately providing arguments required by the selected API. Upon comprehending the dialogue history and the pre-defined API schema, the argument filling task is expected to provide the external API with the necessary information to generate a desirable agent action. In this paper, we study the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) for the problem of API argument filling task. Our initial investigation reveals that LLMs require an additional grounding process to successfully perform argument filling, inspiring us to design training and prompting frameworks to ground their responses. Our experimental results demonstrate that when paired with proposed techniques, the argument filling performance of LLMs noticeably improves, paving a new way toward building an automated argument filling framework.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This study investigates the impact of Large Language Models generating follow up questions in response to user requests for short text documents. Users provided prompts requesting documents they would like the AI to produce. The AI then generated questions to clarify the user needs before generating the requested documents. Users answered the questions and then indicated their preference between a document generated using both the initial prompt and the questions and answers, and a document generated using only the initial prompt, and gave feedback about their experience with the question-answering process. The findings of this study show clear benefits to question-asking both in document preference and in the qualitative user experience.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Our study delves into Multimodal Entity Linking, aligning the mention in multimodal information with entities in knowledge base. Existing methods are still facing challenges like ambiguous entity representations and limited image information utilization. Thus, we propose dynamic entity extraction using ChatGPT, which dynamically extracts entities and enhances datasets. We also propose a method: Dynamically Integrate Multimodal information with knowledge base (DIM), employing the capability of the Large Language Model (LLM) for visual understanding. The LLM, such as BLIP-2, extracts information relevant to entities in the image, which can facilitate improved extraction of entity features and linking them with the dynamic entity representations provided by ChatGPT. The experiments demonstrate that our proposed DIM method outperforms the majority of existing methods on the three original datasets, and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) on the dynamically enhanced datasets (Wiki+, Rich+, Diverse+).

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The lack of fluency in sign language remains a barrier to seamless communication for hearing and speech-impaired communities. In this work, we propose a low-cost, real-time ASL-to-speech translation glove and an exhaustive training dataset of sign language patterns. We then benchmarked this dataset with supervised learning models, such as LSTMs, GRUs and Transformers, where our best model achieved 92% accuracy. The SignSpeak dataset has 7200 samples encompassing 36 classes (A-Z, 1-10) and aims to capture realistic signing patterns by using five low-cost flex sensors to measure finger positions at each time step at 36 Hz. Our open-source dataset, models and glove designs, provide an accurate and efficient ASL translator while maintaining cost-effectiveness, establishing a framework for future work to build on.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language model (LLM) decoding involves generating a sequence of tokens based on a given context, where each token is predicted one at a time using the model's learned probabilities. The typical autoregressive decoding method requires a separate forward pass through the model for each token generated, which is computationally inefficient and poses challenges for deploying LLMs in latency-sensitive scenarios. The main limitations of current decoding methods stem from their inefficiencies and resource demands. Existing approaches either necessitate fine-tuning smaller models, which is resource-intensive, or rely on fixed retrieval schemes to construct drafts for the next tokens, which lack adaptability and fail to generalize across different models and contexts. To address these issues, we introduce a novel methodology called ADED, which accelerates LLM decoding without requiring fine-tuning. Our approach involves an adaptive draft-verification process that evolves over time to improve efficiency. We utilize a tri-gram matrix-based LLM representation to dynamically approximate the output distribution of the LLM, allowing the model to adjust to changing token probabilities during the decoding process. Additionally, we implement a draft construction mechanism that effectively balances exploration and exploitation, ensuring that the drafts generated are both diverse and close to the true output distribution of the LLM. The importance of this design lies in its ability to optimize the draft distribution adaptively, leading to faster and more accurate decoding. Through extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets and LLM architectures, we demonstrate that ADED significantly accelerates the decoding process while maintaining high accuracy, making it suitable for deployment in a wide range of practical applications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated excellent performance in understanding human instructions and generating code, which has inspired researchers to explore the feasibility of generating RTL code with LLMs. However, the existing approaches to fine-tune LLMs on RTL codes typically are conducted on fixed datasets, which do not fully stimulate the capability of LLMs and require large amounts of reference data. To mitigate these issues , we introduce a simple yet effective iterative training paradigm named ITERTL. During each iteration, samples are drawn from the model trained in the previous cycle. Then these new samples are employed for training in this loop. Through this iterative approach, the distribution mismatch between the model and the training samples is reduced. Additionally, the model is thus enabled to explore a broader generative space and receive more comprehensive feedback. Theoretical analyses are conducted to investigate the mechanism of the effectiveness. Experimental results show the model trained through our proposed approach can compete with and even outperform the state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-source model with nearly 37\% reference samples, achieving remarkable 42.9\% and 62.2\% pass@1 rate on two VerilogEval evaluation datasets respectively. While using the same amount of reference samples, our method can achieved a relative improvement of 16.9\% and 12.5\% in pass@1 compared to the non-iterative method. This study facilitates the application of LLMs for generating RTL code in practical scenarios with limited data.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Due to the rapid advancements in multimodal large language models, evaluating their multimodal mathematical capabilities continues to receive wide attention. Despite the datasets like MathVista proposed benchmarks for assessing mathematical capabilities in multimodal scenarios, there is still a lack of corresponding evaluation tools and datasets for fine-grained assessment in the context of K12 education in Chinese language. To systematically evaluate the capability of multimodal large models in solving Chinese multimodal mathematical problems, we propose a Chinese Multi-modal Math Skill Evaluation Benchmark, named CMMaTH, contraining 23k multimodal K12 math related questions, forming the largest Chinese multimodal mathematical problem benchmark to date. CMMaTH questions from elementary to high school levels, provide increased diversity in problem types, solution objectives, visual elements, detailed knowledge points, and standard solution annotations. We have constructed an open-source tool GradeGPT integrated with the CMMaTH dataset, facilitating stable, rapid, and cost-free model evaluation. Our data and code are available.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>From organizing recorded videos and meetings into chapters, to breaking down large inputs in order to fit them into the context window of commoditized Large Language Models (LLMs), topic segmentation of large transcripts emerges as a task of increasing significance. Still, accurate segmentation presents many challenges, including (a) the noisy nature of the Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) software typically used to obtain the transcripts, (b) the lack of diverse labeled data and (c) the difficulty in pin-pointing the ground-truth number of segments. In this work we present TreeSeg, an approach that combines off-the-shelf embedding models with divisive clustering, to generate hierarchical, structured segmentations of transcripts in the form of binary trees. Our approach is robust to noise and can handle large transcripts efficiently. We evaluate TreeSeg on the ICSI and AMI corpora, demonstrating that it outperforms all baselines. Finally, we introduce TinyRec, a small-scale corpus of manually annotated transcripts, obtained from self-recorded video sessions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Transformer based large-language models (LLMs) display extreme proficiency with language yet a precise understanding of how they work remains elusive. One way of demystifying transformer predictions would be to describe how they depend on their context in terms of simple template functions. This paper takes a first step in this direction by considering families of functions (i.e. rules) formed out of simple N-gram based statistics of the training data. By studying how well these rulesets approximate transformer predictions, we obtain a variety of novel discoveries: a simple method to detect overfitting during training without using a holdout set, a quantitative measure of how transformers progress from learning simple to more complex statistical rules over the course of training, a model-variance criterion governing when transformer predictions tend to be described by N-gram rules, and insights into how well transformers can be approximated by N-gram rulesets in the limit where these rulesets become increasingly complex. In this latter direction, we find that for 78% of LLM next-token distributions on TinyStories, their top-1 predictions agree with those provided by our N-gram rulesets.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Investigating conformational landscapes of proteins is a crucial way to understand their biological functions and properties. AlphaFlow stands out as a sequence-conditioned generative model that introduces flexibility into structure prediction models by fine-tuning AlphaFold under the flow-matching framework. Despite the advantages of efficient sampling afforded by flow-matching, AlphaFlow still requires multiple runs of AlphaFold to finally generate one single conformation. Due to the heavy consumption of AlphaFold, its applicability is limited in sampling larger set of protein ensembles or the longer chains within a constrained timeframe. In this work, we propose a feature-conditioned generative model called AlphaFlow-Lit to realize efficient protein ensembles generation. In contrast to the full fine-tuning on the entire structure, we focus solely on the light-weight structure module to reconstruct the conformation. AlphaFlow-Lit performs on-par with AlphaFlow and surpasses its distilled version without pretraining, all while achieving a significant sampling acceleration of around 47 times. The advancement in efficiency showcases the potential of AlphaFlow-Lit in enabling faster and more scalable generation of protein ensembles.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Video tasks are compute-heavy and thus pose a challenge when deploying in real-time applications, particularly for tasks that require state-of-the-art Vision Transformers (ViTs). Several research efforts have tried to address this challenge by leveraging the fact that large portions of the video undergo very little change across frames, leading to redundant computations in frame-based video processing. In particular, some works leverage pixel or semantic differences across frames, however, this yields limited latency benefits with significantly increased memory overhead. This paper, in contrast, presents a strategy for masking regions in video frames that leverages the semantic information in images and the temporal correlation between frames to significantly reduce FLOPs and latency with little to no penalty in performance over baseline models. In particular, we demonstrate that by leveraging extracted features from previous frames, ViT backbones directly benefit from region masking, skipping up to 80% of input regions, improving FLOPs and latency by 3.14x and 1.5x. We improve memory and latency over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) by 2.3x and 1.14x, while maintaining similar detection performance. Additionally, our approach demonstrates promising results on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and provides latency improvements over the SOTA up to 1.3x using specialized computational kernels.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various natural language processing tasks. Recently, several LLMs-based pipelines have been developed to enhance learning on graphs with text attributes, showcasing promising performance. However, graphs are well-known to be susceptible to adversarial attacks and it remains unclear whether LLMs exhibit robustness in learning on graphs. To address this gap, our work aims to explore the potential of LLMs in the context of adversarial attacks on graphs. Specifically, we investigate the robustness against graph structural and textual perturbations in terms of two dimensions: LLMs-as-Enhancers and LLMs-as-Predictors. Through extensive experiments, we find that, compared to shallow models, both LLMs-as-Enhancers and LLMs-as-Predictors offer superior robustness against structural and textual attacks.Based on these findings, we carried out additional analyses to investigate the underlying causes. Furthermore, we have made our benchmark library openly available to facilitate quick and fair evaluations, and to encourage ongoing innovative research in this field.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Machine unlearning (MU) aims to erase data from a model as if it never saw them during training. To this extent, existing MU approaches assume complete or partial access to the training data, which can be limited over time due to privacy regulations. However, no setting or benchmark exists to probe the effectiveness of MU methods in such scenarios, i.e. when training data is missing. To fill this gap, we propose a novel task we call One-Shot Unlearning of Personal Identities (O-UPI) that evaluates unlearning models when the training data is not accessible. Specifically, we focus on the identity unlearning case, which is relevant due to current regulations requiring data deletion after training. To cope with data absence, we expect users to provide a portraiting picture to perform unlearning. To evaluate methods in O-UPI, we benchmark the forgetting on CelebA and CelebA-HQ datasets with different unlearning set sizes. We test applicable methods on this challenging benchmark, proposing also an effective method that meta-learns to forget identities from a single image. Our findings indicate that existing approaches struggle when data availability is limited, with greater difficulty when there is dissimilarity between provided samples and data used at training time. We will release the code and benchmark upon acceptance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Transformer models have revolutionized AI tasks, but their large size hinders real-world deployment on resource-constrained and latency-critical edge devices. While binarized Transformers offer a promising solution by significantly reducing model size, existing approaches suffer from algorithm-hardware mismatches with limited co-design exploration, leading to suboptimal performance on edge devices. Hence, we propose a co-design method for efficient end-to-end edge deployment of Transformers from three aspects: algorithm, hardware, and joint optimization. First, we propose BMT, a novel hardware-friendly binarized Transformer with optimized quantization methods and components, and we further enhance its model accuracy by leveraging the weighted ternary weight splitting training technique. Second, we develop a streaming processor mixed binarized Transformer accelerator, namely BAT, which is equipped with specialized units and scheduling pipelines for efficient inference of binarized Transformers. Finally, we co-optimize the algorithm and hardware through a design space exploration approach to achieve a global trade-off between accuracy, latency, and robustness for real-world deployments. Experimental results show our co-design achieves up to 2.14-49.37x throughput gains and 3.72-88.53x better energy efficiency over state-of-the-art Transformer accelerators, enabling efficient end-to-end edge deployment.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective method for transferring knowledge from a large, well-trained teacher model to a smaller, more efficient student model. Despite its success, one of the main challenges in KD is ensuring the efficient transfer of complex knowledge while maintaining the student's computational efficiency. Unlike previous works that applied contrastive objectives promoting explicit negative instances, we introduce Relational Representation Distillation (RRD). Our approach leverages pairwise similarities to explore and reinforce the relationships between the teacher and student models. Inspired by self-supervised learning principles, it uses a relaxed contrastive loss that focuses on similarity rather than exact replication. This method aligns the output distributions of teacher samples in a large memory buffer, improving the robustness and performance of the student model without the need for strict negative instance differentiation. Our approach demonstrates superior performance on CIFAR-100, outperforming traditional KD techniques and surpassing 13 state-of-the-art methods. It also transfers successfully to other datasets like Tiny ImageNet and STL-10. The code will be made public soon.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large pre-trained models, such as large language models (LLMs), present significant resource challenges for fine-tuning due to their extensive parameter sizes, especially for applications in mobile systems. To address this, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has been developed to reduce resource consumption while maintaining satisfactory fine-tuning results. Despite its effectiveness, the original LoRA method faces challenges of suboptimal performance and overfitting. This paper investigates the intrinsic dimension of the matrix updates approximated by the LoRA method and reveals the performance benefits of increasing this intrinsic dimension. By employing regularization and a gradient masking method that encourages higher intrinsic dimension, the proposed method, termed Regularized and Masked LoRA (RM-LoRA), achieves superior generalization performance with the same or lower trainable parameter budget compared to the original LoRA and its latest variants across various open-source vision and language datasets.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) enable efficient deep learning by saving on storage and computational costs. However, as the size of neural networks continues to grow, meeting computational requirements remains a challenge. In this work, we propose a new form of quantization to tile neural network layers with sequences of bits to achieve sub-bit compression of binary-weighted neural networks. The method learns binary vectors (i.e. tiles) to populate each layer of a model via aggregation and reshaping operations. During inference, the method reuses a single tile per layer to represent the full tensor. We employ the approach to both fully-connected and convolutional layers, which make up the breadth of space in most neural architectures. Empirically, the approach achieves near fullprecision performance on a diverse range of architectures (CNNs, Transformers, MLPs) and tasks (classification, segmentation, and time series forecasting) with up to an 8x reduction in size compared to binary-weighted models. We provide two implementations for Tiled Bit Networks: 1) we deploy the model to a microcontroller to assess its feasibility in resource-constrained environments, and 2) a GPU-compatible inference kernel to facilitate the reuse of a single tile per layer in memory.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce GoldFinch, a hybrid Linear Attention/Transformer sequence model that uses a new technique to efficiently generate a highly compressed and reusable KV-Cache in linear time and space with respect to sequence length. GoldFinch stacks our new GOLD transformer on top of an enhanced version of the Finch (RWKV-6) architecture. We train up to 1.5B parameter class models of the Finch, Llama, and GoldFinch architectures, and find dramatically improved modeling performance relative to both Finch and Llama. Our cache size savings increase linearly with model layer count, ranging from 756-2550 times smaller than the traditional transformer cache for common sizes, enabling inference of extremely large context lengths even on limited hardware. Although autoregressive generation has O(n) time complexity per token because of attention, pre-fill computation of the entire initial cache state for a submitted context costs only O(1) time per token due to the use of a recurrent neural network (RNN) to generate this cache. We release our trained weights and training code under the Apache 2.0 license for community use.</li>

We propose novel transformer-based models tailored for SpeakerID, leveraging contextual cues within dialogues to accurately attribute speaker names.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>A common way to extend the memory of large language models (LLMs) is by retrieval augmented generation (RAG), which inserts text retrieved from a larger memory into an LLM's context window. However, the context window is typically limited to several thousand tokens, which limits the number of retrieved passages that can inform a model's response. For this reason, it's important to avoid occupying context window space with redundant information by ensuring a degree of diversity among retrieved passages. At the same time, the information should also be relevant to the current task. Most prior methods that encourage diversity among retrieved results, such as Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR), do so by incorporating an objective that explicitly trades off diversity and relevance. We propose a novel simple optimization metric based on relevant information gain, a probabilistic measure of the total information relevant to a query for a set of retrieved results. By optimizing this metric, diversity organically emerges from our system. When used as a drop-in replacement for the retrieval component of a RAG system, this method yields state-of-the-art performance on question answering tasks from the Retrieval Augmented Generation Benchmark (RGB), outperforming existing metrics that directly optimize for relevance and diversity.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, generative, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present an approach for generating differentially private synthetic text using large language models (LLMs), via private prediction. In the private prediction framework, we only require the output synthetic data to satisfy differential privacy guarantees. This is in contrast to approaches that train a generative model on potentially sensitive user-supplied source data and seek to ensure the model itself is safe to release. We prompt a pretrained LLM with source data, but ensure that next-token predictions are made with differential privacy guarantees. Previous work in this paradigm reported generating a small number of examples (<10) at reasonable privacy levels, an amount of data that is useful only for downstream in-context learning or prompting. In contrast, we make changes that allow us to generate thousands of high-quality synthetic data points, greatly expanding the set of potential applications. Our improvements come from an improved privacy analysis and a better private selection mechanism, which makes use of the equivalence between the softmax layer for sampling tokens in LLMs and the exponential mechanism. Furthermore, we introduce a novel use of public predictions via the sparse vector technique, in which we do not pay privacy costs for tokens that are predictable without sensitive data; we find this to be particularly effective for structured data.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Fairness-aware graph learning has gained increasing attention in recent years. Nevertheless, there lacks a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate and compare different fairness-aware graph learning methods, which blocks practitioners from choosing appropriate ones for broader real-world applications. In this paper, we present an extensive benchmark on ten representative fairness-aware graph learning methods. Specifically, we design a systematic evaluation protocol and conduct experiments on seven real-world datasets to evaluate these methods from multiple perspectives, including group fairness, individual fairness, the balance between different fairness criteria, and computational efficiency. Our in-depth analysis reveals key insights into the strengths and limitations of existing methods. Additionally, we provide practical guidance for applying fairness-aware graph learning methods in applications. To the best of our knowledge, this work serves as an initial step towards comprehensively understanding representative fairness-aware graph learning methods to facilitate future advancements in this area.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The advent of Urban Air Mobility (UAM) presents the scope for a transformative shift in the domain of urban transportation. However, its widespread adoption and economic viability depends in part on the ability to optimally schedule the fleet of aircraft across vertiports in a UAM network, under uncertainties attributed to airspace congestion, changing weather conditions, and varying demands. This paper presents a comprehensive optimization formulation of the fleet scheduling problem, while also identifying the need for alternate solution approaches, since directly solving the resulting integer nonlinear programming problem is computationally prohibitive for daily fleet scheduling. Previous work has shown the effectiveness of using (graph) reinforcement learning (RL) approaches to train real-time executable policy models for fleet scheduling. However, such policies can often be brittle on out-of-distribution scenarios or edge cases. Moreover, training performance also deteriorates as the complexity (e.g., number of constraints) of the problem increases. To address these issues, this paper presents an imitation learning approach where the RL-based policy exploits expert demonstrations yielded by solving the exact optimization using a Genetic Algorithm. The policy model comprises Graph Neural Network (GNN) based encoders that embed the space of vertiports and aircraft, Transformer networks to encode demand, passenger fare, and transport cost profiles, and a Multi-head attention (MHA) based decoder. Expert demonstrations are used through the Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) algorithm. Interfaced with a UAM simulation environment involving 8 vertiports and 40 aircrafts, in terms of the daily profits earned reward, the new imitative approach achieves better mean performance and remarkable improvement in the case of unseen worst-case scenarios, compared to pure RL results.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Nowadays, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been trained using extended context lengths to foster more creative applications. However, long context training poses great challenges considering the constraint of GPU memory. It not only leads to substantial activation memory consumption during training, but also incurs considerable memory fragmentation. To facilitate long context training, existing frameworks have adopted strategies such as recomputation and various forms of parallelisms. Nevertheless, these techniques rely on redundant computation or extensive communication, resulting in low Model FLOPS Utilization (MFU). In this paper, we propose MEMO, a novel LLM training framework designed for fine-grained activation memory management. Given the quadratic scaling of computation and linear scaling of memory with sequence lengths when using FlashAttention, we offload memory-consuming activations to CPU memory after each layer's forward pass and fetch them during the backward pass. To maximize the swapping of activations without hindering computation, and to avoid exhausting limited CPU memory, we implement a token-wise activation recomputation and swapping mechanism. Furthermore, we tackle the memory fragmentation issue by employing a bi-level Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) approach, optimizing the reuse of memory across transformer layers. Empirical results demonstrate that MEMO achieves an average of 2.42x and 2.26x MFU compared to Megatron-LM and DeepSpeed, respectively. This improvement is attributed to MEMO's ability to minimize memory fragmentation, reduce recomputation and intensive communication, and circumvent the delays associated with the memory reorganization process due to fragmentation. By leveraging fine-grained activation memory management, MEMO facilitates efficient training of 7B LLM with 1 million sequence length on just 8 A800 GPUs, achieving an MFU of 52.30%.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Food segmentation, including in videos, is vital for addressing real-world health, agriculture, and food biotechnology issues. Current limitations lead to inaccurate nutritional analysis, inefficient crop management, and suboptimal food processing, impacting food security and public health. Improving segmentation techniques can enhance dietary assessments, agricultural productivity, and the food production process. This study introduces the development of a robust framework for high-quality, near-real-time segmentation and tracking of food items in videos, using minimal hardware resources. We present FoodMem, a novel framework designed to segment food items from video sequences of 360-degree unbounded scenes. FoodMem can consistently generate masks of food portions in a video sequence, overcoming the limitations of existing semantic segmentation models, such as flickering and prohibitive inference speeds in video processing contexts. To address these issues, FoodMem leverages a two-phase solution: a transformer segmentation phase to create initial segmentation masks and a memory-based tracking phase to monitor food masks in complex scenes. Our framework outperforms current state-of-the-art food segmentation models, yielding superior performance across various conditions, such as camera angles, lighting, reflections, scene complexity, and food diversity. This results in reduced segmentation noise, elimination of artifacts, and completion of missing segments. Here, we also introduce a new annotated food dataset encompassing challenging scenarios absent in previous benchmarks. Extensive experiments conducted on Nutrition5k and Vegetables & Fruits datasets demonstrate that FoodMem enhances the state-of-the-art by 2.5% mean average precision in food video segmentation and is 58 x faster on average.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Machine translation is indispensable in healthcare for enabling the global dissemination of medical knowledge across languages. However, complex medical terminology poses unique challenges to achieving adequate translation quality and accuracy. This study introduces a novel "LLMs-in-the-loop" approach to develop supervised neural machine translation models optimized specifically for medical texts. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful capabilities, this research shows that small, specialized models trained on high-quality in-domain (mostly synthetic) data can outperform even vastly larger LLMs. Custom parallel corpora in six languages were compiled from scientific articles, synthetically generated clinical documents, and medical texts. Our LLMs-in-the-loop methodology employs synthetic data generation, rigorous evaluation, and agent orchestration to enhance performance. We developed small medical translation models using the MarianMT base model. We introduce a new medical translation test dataset to standardize evaluation in this domain. Assessed using BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, and BERT scores on this test set, our MarianMT-based models outperform Google Translate, DeepL, and GPT-4-Turbo. Results demonstrate that our LLMs-in-the-loop approach, combined with fine-tuning high-quality, domain-specific data, enables specialized models to outperform general-purpose and some larger systems. This research, part of a broader series on expert small models, paves the way for future healthcare-related AI developments, including deidentification and bio-medical entity extraction models. Our study underscores the potential of tailored neural translation models and the LLMs-in-the-loop methodology to advance the field through improved data generation, evaluation, agent, and modeling techniques.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We revisit the effectiveness of topological descriptors for molecular graph classification and design a simple, yet strong baseline. We demonstrate that a simple approach to feature engineering - employing histogram aggregation of edge descriptors and one-hot encoding for atomic numbers and bond types - when combined with a Random Forest classifier, can establish a strong baseline for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The novel algorithm, Molecular Topological Profile (MOLTOP), integrates Edge Betweenness Centrality, Adjusted Rand Index and SCAN Structural Similarity score. This approach proves to be remarkably competitive when compared to modern GNNs, while also being simple, fast, low-variance and hyperparameter-free. Our approach is rigorously tested on MoleculeNet datasets using fair evaluation protocol provided by Open Graph Benchmark. We additionally show out-of-domain generation capabilities on peptide classification task from Long Range Graph Benchmark. The evaluations across eleven benchmark datasets reveal MOLTOP's strong discriminative capabilities, surpassing the $1$-WL test and even $3$-WL test for some classes of graphs. Our conclusion is that descriptor-based baselines, such as the one we propose, are still crucial for accurately assessing advancements in the GNN domain.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This study explores the use of large language models (LLMs) to predict emotion intensity in Polish political texts, a resource-poor language context. The research compares the performance of several LLMs against a supervised model trained on an annotated corpus of 10,000 social media texts, evaluated for the intensity of emotions by expert judges. The findings indicate that while the supervised model generally outperforms LLMs, offering higher accuracy and lower variance, LLMs present a viable alternative, especially given the high costs associated with data annotation. The study highlights the potential of LLMs in low-resource language settings and underscores the need for further research on emotion intensity prediction and its application across different languages and continuous features. The implications suggest a nuanced decision-making process to choose the right approach to emotion prediction for researchers and practitioners based on resource availability and the specific requirements of their tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Despite their apparent simplicity, devices like smart light bulbs and electrical plugs are often perceived as exempt from rigorous security measures. However, this paper challenges this misconception, uncovering how vulnerabilities in these seemingly innocuous devices can expose users to significant risks. This paper extends the findings outlined in previous work, introducing a novel attack scenario. This new attack allows malicious actors to obtain sensitive credentials, including the victim's Tapo account email and password, as well as the SSID and password of her local network. Furthermore, we demonstrate how these findings can be replicated, either partially or fully, across other smart devices within the same IoT ecosystem, specifically those manufactured by Tp-Link. Our investigation focused on the Tp-Link Tapo range, encompassing smart bulbs (Tapo L530E, Tapo L510E V2, and Tapo L630), a smart plug (Tapo P100), and a smart camera (Tapo C200). Utilizing similar communication protocols, or slight variants thereof, we found that the Tapo L530E, Tapo L510E V2, and Tapo L630 are susceptible to complete exploitation of all attack scenarios, including the newly identified one. Conversely, the Tapo P100 and Tapo C200 exhibit vulnerabilities to only a subset of attack scenarios. In conclusion, by highlighting these vulnerabilities and their potential impact, we aim to raise awareness and encourage proactive steps towards mitigating security risks in smart device deployment.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text-to-image generative models have recently attracted considerable interest, enabling the synthesis of high-quality images from textual prompts. However, these models often lack the capability to generate specific subjects from given reference images or to synthesize novel renditions under varying conditions. Methods like DreamBooth and Subject-driven Text-to-Image (SuTI) have made significant progress in this area. Yet, both approaches primarily focus on enhancing similarity to reference images and require expensive setups, often overlooking the need for efficient training and avoiding overfitting to the reference images. In this work, we present the $\lambda$-Harmonic reward function, which provides a reliable reward signal and enables early stopping for faster training and effective regularization. By combining the Bradley-Terry preference model, the $\lambda$-Harmonic reward function also provides preference labels for subject-driven generation tasks. We propose Reward Preference Optimization (RPO), which offers a simpler setup (requiring only $3\%$ of the negative samples used by DreamBooth) and fewer gradient steps for fine-tuning. Unlike most existing methods, our approach does not require training a text encoder or optimizing text embeddings and achieves text-image alignment by fine-tuning only the U-Net component. Empirically, $\lambda$-Harmonic proves to be a reliable approach for model selection in subject-driven generation tasks. Based on preference labels and early stopping validation from the $\lambda$-Harmonic reward function, our algorithm achieves a state-of-the-art CLIP-I score of 0.833 and a CLIP-T score of 0.314 on DreamBench.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The weather and climate domains are undergoing a significant transformation thanks to advances in AI-based foundation models such as FourCastNet, GraphCast, ClimaX and Pangu-Weather. While these models show considerable potential, they are not ready yet for operational use in weather forecasting or climate prediction. This is due to the lack of a data assimilation method as part of their workflow to enable the assimilation of incoming Earth system observations in real time. This limitation affects their effectiveness in predicting complex atmospheric phenomena such as tropical cyclones and atmospheric rivers. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce a generic real-time data assimilation framework and demonstrate its end-to-end performance on the Frontier supercomputer. This framework comprises two primary modules: an ensemble score filter (EnSF), which significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art data assimilation method, namely, the Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter (LETKF); and a vision transformer-based surrogate capable of real-time adaptation through the integration of observational data. The ViT surrogate can represent either physics-based models or AI-based foundation models. We demonstrate both the strong and weak scaling of our framework up to 1024 GPUs on the Exascale supercomputer, Frontier. Our results not only illustrate the framework's exceptional scalability on high-performance computing systems, but also demonstrate the importance of supercomputers in real-time data assimilation for weather and climate predictions. Even though the proposed framework is tested only on a benchmark surface quasi-geostrophic (SQG) turbulence system, it has the potential to be combined with existing AI-based foundation models, making it suitable for future operational implementations.</li>

          The Latency Price of Threshold Cryptosystem in Blockchains(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Threshold cryptography is essential for many blockchain protocols. For example, many protocols rely on threshold common coin to implement asynchronous consensus, leader elections, and provide support for randomized applications. Similarly, threshold signature schemes are frequently used for protocol efficiency and state certification, and threshold decryption and threshold time-lock puzzles are often necessary for privacy. In this paper, we study the interplay between threshold cryptography and a class of blockchains that use Byzantine-fault tolerant (BFT) consensus protocols with a focus on latency. More specifically, we focus on blockchain-native threshold cryptosystem, where the blockchain validators seek to run a threshold cryptographic protocol once for every block with the block contents as an input to the threshold cryptographic protocol. All existing approaches for blockchain-native threshold cryptosystems introduce a latency overhead of at least one message delay for running the threshold cryptographic protocol. In this paper, we first propose a mechanism to eliminate this overhead for blockchain-native threshold cryptosystems with tight thresholds, i.e., in threshold cryptographic protocols where the secrecy and reconstruction thresholds are the same. However, many real-world proof-of-stake-based blockchain-native threshold cryptosystems rely on ramp thresholds, where reconstruction thresholds are strictly greater than secrecy thresholds. For these blockchains, we formally demonstrate that the additional delay is unavoidable. We then introduce a mechanism to minimize this delay in the optimistic case. We implement our optimistic protocol for the proof-of-stake distributed randomness scheme on the Aptos blockchain. Our measurements from the Aptos mainnet show that the optimistic approach reduces latency overhead by 71%.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative diffusion models have emerged as a powerful tool for high-quality image synthesis, yet their iterative nature demands significant computational resources. This paper proposes an efficient time step sampling method based on an image spectral analysis of the diffusion process, aimed at optimizing the denoising process. Instead of the traditional uniform distribution-based time step sampling, we introduce a Beta distribution-like sampling technique that prioritizes critical steps in the early and late stages of the process. Our hypothesis is that certain steps exhibit significant changes in image content, while others contribute minimally. We validated our approach using Fourier transforms to measure frequency response changes at each step, revealing substantial low-frequency changes early on and high-frequency adjustments later. Experiments with ADM and Stable Diffusion demonstrated that our Beta Sampling method consistently outperforms uniform sampling, achieving better FID and IS scores, and offers competitive efficiency relative to state-of-the-art methods like AutoDiffusion. This work provides a practical framework for enhancing diffusion model efficiency by focusing computational resources on the most impactful steps, with potential for further optimization and broader application.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair, interpretability, explainability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is a set of tools and algorithms that applied or embedded to machine learning models to understand and interpret the models. They are recommended especially for complex or advanced models including deep neural network because they are not interpretable from human point of view. On the other hand, simple models including linear regression are easy to implement, has less computational complexity and easy to visualize the output. The common notion in the literature that simple models including linear regression are considered as "white box" because they are more interpretable and easier to understand. This is based on the idea that linear regression models have several favorable outcomes including the effect of the features in the model and whether they affect positively or negatively toward model output. Moreover, uncertainty of the model can be measured or estimated using the confidence interval. However, we argue that this perception is not accurate and linear regression models are not easy to interpret neither easy to understand considering common XAI metrics and possible challenges might face. This includes linearity, local explanation, multicollinearity, covariates, normalization, uncertainty, features contribution and fairness. Consequently, we recommend the so-called simple models should be treated equally to complex models when it comes to explainability and interpretability.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, security, biometric</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Medical Internet of Things (IoMT) is the next frontier in the digital revolution and is utilized in healthcare. In this context, IoT enables individuals to remotely manage their essential activities with minimal interaction. However, the limitations of network resources and the challenges of establishing a secure channel, as well as sharing and collecting sensitive information through an insecure public channel, pose security challenges for the medical IoT. This paper presents a lightweight multi-factor authentication and anonymous user authentication scheme to access real-time data in a blockchain-based environment. The scheme utilizes an insecure channel called L2AI. L2AI ensures security and efficiency while enhancing user anonymity through the use of pseudo-identity and dynamic indexing. The proposed method supports highly scalable systems with an efficient user registration process, allowing authenticated users to access both existing and newly added system entities without additional processes. Although the scheme is primarily designed for large systems, such as health infrastructure, it is also suitable for resource-constrained devices. The scheme relies on one-way cryptographic hashing functions and bitwise XOR operations. Additionally, a fuzzy mining algorithm is employed on the user side to verify the user's biometric information. L2AI adopts the "Real-Or-Random (ROR)" model for security proof and employs BAN logic for proof of authenticity. Formal security verification is conducted using the "Automatic Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Programs" (Proverif) tool, complemented by informal security analysis demonstrating the proper functionality of L2AI.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We combine concept-based neural networks with generative, flow-based classifiers into a novel, intrinsically explainable, exactly invertible approach to supervised learning. Prototypical neural networks, a type of concept-based neural network, represent an exciting way forward in realizing human-comprehensible machine learning without concept annotations, but a human-machine semantic gap continues to haunt current approaches. We find that reliance on indirect interpretation functions for prototypical explanations imposes a severe limit on prototypes' informative power. From this, we posit that invertibly learning prototypes as distributions over the latent space provides more robust, expressive, and interpretable modeling. We propose one such model, called ProtoFlow, by composing a normalizing flow with Gaussian mixture models. ProtoFlow (1) sets a new state-of-the-art in joint generative and predictive modeling and (2) achieves predictive performance comparable to existing prototypical neural networks while enabling richer interpretation.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>State-of-the-art approaches for 6D object pose estimation assume the availability of CAD models and require the user to manually set up physically-based rendering (PBR) pipelines for synthetic training data generation. Both factors limit the application of these methods in real-world scenarios. In this work, we present a pipeline that does not require CAD models and allows training a state-of-the-art pose estimator requiring only a small set of real images as input. Our method is based on a NeuS2 object representation, that we learn through a semi-automated procedure based on Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and object-agnostic segmentation. We exploit the novel-view synthesis ability of NeuS2 and simple cut-and-paste augmentation to automatically generate photorealistic object renderings, which we use to train the correspondence-based SurfEmb pose estimator. We evaluate our method on the LINEMOD-Occlusion dataset, extensively studying the impact of its individual components and showing competitive performance with respect to approaches based on CAD models and PBR data. We additionally demonstrate the ease of use and effectiveness of our pipeline on self-collected real-world objects, showing that our method outperforms state-of-the-art CAD-model-free approaches, with better accuracy and robustness to mild occlusions. To allow the robotics community to benefit from this system, we will publicly release it at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a machine learning approach where the data itself provides supervision, eliminating the need for external labels. The model is forced to learn about the data structure or context by solving a pretext task. With SSL, models can learn from abundant and cheap unlabeled data, significantly reducing the cost of training models where labels are expensive or this http URL Computer Vision, SSL is widely used as pre-training followed by a downstream task, such as supervised transfer, few-shot learning on smaller labeled data sets, and/or unsupervised clustering. Unfortunately, it is infeasible to evaluate SSL methods on all possible downstream tasks and objectively measure the quality of the learned representation. Instead, SSL methods are evaluated using in-domain evaluation protocols, such as fine-tuning, linear probing, and k-nearest neighbors (kNN). However, it is not well understood how well these evaluation protocols estimate the representation quality of a pre-trained model for different downstream tasks under different conditions, such as dataset, metric, and model architecture. We study how classification-based evaluation protocols for SSL correlate and how well they predict downstream performance on different dataset types. Our study includes eleven common image datasets and 26 models that were pre-trained with different SSL methods or have different model backbones. We find that in-domain linear/kNN probing protocols are, on average, the best general predictors for out-of-domain performance. We further investigate the importance of batch normalization and evaluate how robust correlations are for different kinds of dataset domain shifts. We challenge assumptions about the relationship between discriminative and generative self-supervised methods, finding that most of their performance differences can be explained by changes to model backbones.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The ProbCover method of Yehuda et al. is a well-motivated algorithm for active learning in low-budget regimes, which attempts to "cover" the data distribution with balls of a given radius at selected data points. We demonstrate, however, that the performance of this algorithm is extremely sensitive to the choice of this radius hyper-parameter, and that tuning it is quite difficult, with the original heuristic frequently failing. We thus introduce (and theoretically motivate) a generalized notion of "coverage," including ProbCover's objective as a special case, but also allowing smoother notions that are far more robust to hyper-parameter choice. We propose an efficient greedy method to optimize this coverage, generalizing ProbCover's algorithm; due to its close connection to kernel herding, we call it "MaxHerding." The objective can also be optimized non-greedily through a variant of $k$-medoids, clarifying the relationship to other low-budget active learning methods. In comprehensive experiments, MaxHerding surpasses existing active learning methods across multiple low-budget image classification benchmarks, and does so with less computational cost than most competitive methods.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Evaluating modern ML models is hard. The strong incentive for researchers and companies to report a state-of-the-art result on some metric often leads to questionable research practices (QRPs): bad practices which fall short of outright research fraud. We describe 43 such practices which can undermine reported results, giving examples where possible. Our list emphasises the evaluation of large language models (LLMs) on public benchmarks. We also discuss "irreproducible research practices", i.e. decisions that make it difficult or impossible for other researchers to reproduce, build on or audit previous research.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Within the domain of short video recommendation, predicting users' watch time is a critical but challenging task. Prevailing deterministic solutions obtain accurate debiased statistical models, yet they neglect the intrinsic uncertainty inherent in user environments. In our observation, we found that this uncertainty could potentially limit these methods' accuracy in watch-time prediction on our online platform, despite that we have employed numerous features and complex network architectures. Consequently, we believe that a better solution is to model the conditional distribution of this uncertain watch time. In this paper, we introduce a novel estimation technique -- Conditional Quantile Estimation (CQE), which utilizes quantile regression to capture the nuanced distribution of watch time. The learned distribution accounts for the stochastic nature of users, thereby it provides a more accurate and robust estimation. In addition, we also design several strategies to enhance the quantile prediction including conditional expectation, conservative estimation, and dynamic quantile combination. We verify the effectiveness of our method through extensive offline evaluations using public datasets as well as deployment in a real-world video application with over 300 million daily active users.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Low-latency traffic prediction is vital for smart city traffic management. Federated Learning has emerged as a promising technique for Traffic Prediction (FLTP), offering several advantages such as privacy preservation, reduced communication overhead, improved prediction accuracy, and enhanced adaptability to changing traffic conditions. However, majority of the current FLTP frameworks lack a real-time model updating scheme, which hinders their ability to continuously incorporate new incoming traffic data and adapt effectively to the changing dynamics of traffic trends. Another concern with the existing FLTP frameworks is their reliance on the conventional FL model aggregation method, which involves assigning an identical model (i.e., the global model) to all traffic monitoring devices to predict their individual local traffic trends, thereby neglecting the non-IID characteristics of traffic data collected in different locations. Building upon these findings and harnessing insights from reinforcement learning, we propose NeighborFL, an individualized real-time federated learning scheme that introduces a haversine distance-based and error-driven, personalized local models grouping heuristic from the perspective of each individual traffic node. This approach allows NeighborFL to create location-aware and tailored prediction models for each client while fostering collaborative learning. Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of NeighborFL, offering improved real-time prediction accuracy over three baseline models, with one experimental setting showing a 16.9% reduction in MSE value compared to a naive FL setting.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) appear in many disciplines to model the evolution of various mathematical objects, such as probability flows, value functions in control theory, and derivative prices in finance. It is often necessary to compute the solutions or a function of the solutions to a parametric PDE in multiple scenarios corresponding to different parameters of this PDE. This process often requires resolving the PDEs from scratch, which is time-consuming. To better employ existing simulations for the PDEs, we propose a framework for finding solutions to parabolic PDEs across different scenarios by meta-learning an underlying base distribution. We build upon this base distribution to propose a method for computing solutions to parametric PDEs under different parameter settings. Finally, we illustrate the application of the proposed methods through extensive experiments in generative modeling, stochastic control, and finance. The empirical results suggest that the proposed approach improves generalization to solving PDEs under new parameter regimes.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recovering the camera motion and scene geometry from visual data is a fundamental problem in the field of computer vision. Its success in standard vision is attributed to the maturity of feature extraction, data association and multi-view geometry. The recent emergence of neuromorphic event-based cameras places great demands on approaches that use raw event data as input to solve this fundamental problem.Existing state-of-the-art solutions typically infer implicitly data association by iteratively reversing the event data generation process. However, the nonlinear nature of these methods limits their applicability in real-time tasks, and the constant-motion assumption leads to unstable results under agile this http URL this end, we rethink the problem formulation in a way that aligns better with the differential working principle of event cameras.We show that the event-based normal flow can be used, via the proposed geometric error term, as an alternative to the full flow in solving a family of geometric problems that involve instantaneous first-order kinematics and scene geometry. Furthermore, we develop a fast linear solver and a continuous-time nonlinear solver on top of the proposed geometric error term.Experiments on both synthetic and real data show the superiority of our linear solver in terms of accuracy and efficiency, and indicate its complementary feature as an initialization method for existing nonlinear solvers. Besides, our continuous-time non-linear solver exhibits exceptional capability in accommodating sudden variations in motion since it does not rely on the constant-motion assumption.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Specular highlight removal plays a pivotal role in multimedia applications, as it enhances the quality and interpretability of images and videos, ultimately improving the performance of downstream tasks such as content-based retrieval, object recognition, and scene understanding. Despite significant advances in deep learning-based methods, current state-of-the-art approaches often rely on additional priors or supervision, limiting their practicality and generalization capability. In this paper, we propose the Dual-Hybrid Attention Network for Specular Highlight Removal (DHAN-SHR), an end-to-end network that introduces novel hybrid attention mechanisms to effectively capture and process information across different scales and domains without relying on additional priors or supervision. DHAN-SHR consists of two key components: the Adaptive Local Hybrid-Domain Dual Attention Transformer (L-HD-DAT) and the Adaptive Global Dual Attention Transformer (G-DAT). The L-HD-DAT captures local inter-channel and inter-pixel dependencies while incorporating spectral domain features, enabling the network to effectively model the complex interactions between specular highlights and the underlying surface properties. The G-DAT models global inter-channel relationships and long-distance pixel dependencies, allowing the network to propagate contextual information across the entire image and generate more coherent and consistent highlight-free results. To evaluate the performance of DHAN-SHR and facilitate future research in this area, we compile a large-scale benchmark dataset comprising a diverse range of images with varying levels of specular highlights. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that DHAN-SHR outperforms 18 state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively, setting a new standard for specular highlight removal in multimedia applications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The growing demand for high-resolution maps across various applications has underscored the necessity of accurately segmenting building vectors from overhead imagery. However, current deep neural networks often produce raster data outputs, leading to the need for extensive post-processing that compromises the fidelity, regularity, and simplicity of building representations. In response, this paper introduces a novel deep convolutional neural network named OriCornerNet, which directly extracts delineated building polygons from input images. Specifically, our approach involves a deep model that predicts building footprint masks, corners, and orientation vectors that indicate directions toward adjacent corners. These predictions are then used to reconstruct an initial polygon, followed by iterative refinement using a graph convolutional network that leverages semantic and geometric features. Our method inherently generates simplified polygons by initializing the refinement process with predicted corners. Also, including geometric information from oriented corners contributes to producing more regular and accurate results. Performance evaluations conducted on SpaceNet Vegas and CrowdAI-small datasets demonstrate the competitive efficacy of our approach compared to the state-of-the-art in building segmentation from overhead imagery.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Compound Expression Recognition (CER) is vital for effective interpersonal interactions. Human emotional expressions are inherently complex due to the presence of compound expressions, requiring the consideration of both local and global facial cues for accurate judgment. In this paper, we propose an ensemble learning-based solution to address this complexity. Our approach involves training three distinct expression classification models using convolutional networks, Vision Transformers, and multiscale local attention networks. By employing late fusion for model ensemble, we combine the outputs of these models to predict the final results. Our method demonstrates high accuracy on the RAF-DB datasets and is capable of recognizing expressions in certain portions of the C-EXPR-DB through zero-shot learning.</li>

To tackle these challenges, we employ state-of-the-art models to extract powerful visual features. Subsequently, a Transformer Encoder is utilized to integrate these features for the VA, Expr, and AU sub-challenges. To mitigate the impact of varying feature dimensions, we introduce an affine module to align the features to a common dimension. Overall, our results significantly outperform the baselines.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Data valuation quantifies the value of training data, and is used for data attribution (i.e., determining the contribution of training data towards model predictions), and data selection; both of which are important for curating high-quality datasets to train large language models. In our paper, we show that data valuation through in-context probing (i.e., prompting a LLM) approximates influence functions for selecting training data. We provide a theoretical sketch on this connection based on transformer models performing "implicit" gradient descent on its in-context inputs. Our empirical findings show that in-context probing and gradient-based influence frameworks are similar in how they rank training data. Furthermore, fine-tuning experiments on data selected by either method reveal similar model performance.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present a new approach for generating 3D house wireframes with semantic enrichment using an autoregressive model. Unlike conventional generative models that independently process vertices, edges, and faces, our approach employs a unified wire-based representation for improved coherence in learning 3D wireframe structures. By re-ordering wire sequences based on semantic meanings, we facilitate seamless semantic integration during sequence generation. Our two-phase technique merges a graph-based autoencoder with a transformer-based decoder to learn latent geometric tokens and generate semantic-aware wireframes. Through iterative prediction and decoding during inference, our model produces detailed wireframes that can be easily segmented into distinct components, such as walls, roofs, and rooms, reflecting the semantic essence of the shape. Empirical results on a comprehensive house dataset validate the superior accuracy, novelty, and semantic fidelity of our model compared to existing generative models.

Additionally, we offer an open-source annotation tool and a benchmark dataset comprising 40 images annotated with retinal branching angles. Our methodology for retinal branching angle detection and calculation is detailed, followed by a benchmark analysis comparing our method with previous approaches. The results indicate that our method is robust under various conditions with high accuracy and efficiency, which offers a valuable instrument for ophthalmic research and clinical applications.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deception detection has garnered increasing attention in recent years due to the significant growth of digital media and heightened ethical and security concerns. It has been extensively studied using multimodal methods, including video, audio, and text. In addition, individual differences in deception production and detection are believed to play a crucial role.Although some studies have utilized individual information such as personality traits to enhance the performance of deception detection, current systems remain limited, partly due to a lack of sufficient datasets for evaluating performance. To address this issue, we introduce a multimodal deception dataset MDPE. Besides deception features, this dataset also includes individual differences information in personality and emotional expression characteristics. It can explore the impact of individual differences on deception behavior. It comprises over 104 hours of deception and emotional videos from 193 subjects. Furthermore, we conducted numerous experiments to provide valuable insights for future deception detection research. MDPE not only supports deception detection, but also provides conditions for tasks such as personality recognition and emotion recognition, and can even study the relationships between them. We believe that MDPE will become a valuable resource for promoting research in the field of affective computing.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Many tasks can be composed from a few independent components. This gives rise to a combinatorial explosion of possible tasks, only some of which might be encountered during training. Under what circumstances can transformers compositionally generalize from a subset of tasks to all possible combinations of tasks that share similar components? Here we study a modular multitask setting that allows us to precisely control compositional structure in the data generation process. We present evidence that transformers learning in-context struggle to generalize compositionally on this task despite being in principle expressive enough to do so. Compositional generalization becomes possible only when introducing a bottleneck that enforces an explicit separation between task inference and task execution.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recently, large-scale vision-language models such as CLIP have demonstrated immense potential in zero-shot anomaly segmentation (ZSAS) task, utilizing a unified model to directly detect anomalies on any unseen product with painstakingly crafted text prompts. However, existing methods often assume that the product category to be inspected is known, thus setting product-specific text prompts, which is difficult to achieve in the data privacy scenarios. Moreover, even the same type of product exhibits significant differences due to specific components and variations in the production process, posing significant challenges to the design of text prompts. In this end, we propose a visual context prompting model (VCP-CLIP) for ZSAS task based on CLIP. The insight behind VCP-CLIP is to employ visual context prompting to activate CLIP's anomalous semantic perception ability. In specific, we first design a Pre-VCP module to embed global visual information into the text prompt, thus eliminating the necessity for product-specific prompts. Then, we propose a novel Post-VCP module, that adjusts the text embeddings utilizing the fine-grained features of the images. In extensive experiments conducted on 10 real-world industrial anomaly segmentation datasets, VCP-CLIP achieved state-of-the-art performance in ZSAS task.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, defense, attack, steal, generative, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The increasing use of large language models (LLMs) trained by third parties raises significant security concerns. In particular, malicious actors can introduce backdoors through poisoning attacks to generate undesirable outputs. While such attacks have been extensively studied in image domains and classification tasks, they remain underexplored for natural language generation (NLG) tasks. To address this gap, we conduct an investigation of various poisoning techniques targeting the LLM's fine-tuning phase via prefix-tuning, a Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method. We assess their effectiveness across two generative tasks: text summarization and text completion; and we also introduce new metrics to quantify the success and stealthiness of such NLG poisoning attacks. Through our experiments, we find that the prefix-tuning hyperparameters and trigger designs are the most crucial factors to influence attack success and stealthiness. Moreover, we demonstrate that existing popular defenses are ineffective against our poisoning attacks. Our study presents the first systematic approach to understanding poisoning attacks targeting NLG tasks during fine-tuning via PEFT across a wide range of triggers and attack settings. We hope our findings will aid the AI security community in developing effective defenses against such threats.</li>

          Chip Placement with Diffusion(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Macro placement is a vital step in digital circuit design that defines the physical location of large collections of components, known as macros, on a 2-dimensional chip. The physical layout obtained during placement determines key performance metrics of the chip, such as power consumption, area, and performance. Existing learning-based methods typically fall short because of their reliance on reinforcement learning, which is slow and limits the flexibility of the agent by casting placement as a sequential process. Instead, we use a powerful diffusion model to place all components simultaneously. To enable such models to train at scale, we propose a novel architecture for the denoising model, as well as an algorithm to generate large synthetic datasets for pre-training. We empirically show that our model can tackle the placement task, and achieve competitive performance on placement benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the realm of ubiquitous computing, Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is vital for the automation and intelligent identification of human actions through data from diverse sensors. However, traditional machine learning approaches by aggregating data on a central server and centralized processing are memory-intensive and raise privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a solution by training a global model collaboratively across multiple devices by exchanging their local model parameters instead of local data. However, in realistic settings, sensor data on devices is non-independently and identically distributed (Non-IID). This means that data activity recorded by most devices is sparse, and sensor data distribution for each client may be inconsistent. As a result, typical FL frameworks in heterogeneous environments suffer from slow convergence and poor performance due to deviation of the global model's objective from the global objective. Most FL methods applied to HAR are either designed for overly ideal scenarios without considering the Non-IID problem or present privacy and scalability concerns. This work addresses these challenges, proposing CDFL, an efficient federated learning framework for image-based HAR. CDFL efficiently selects a representative set of privacy-preserved images using contrastive learning and deep clustering, reduces communication overhead by selecting effective clients for global model updates, and improves global model quality by training on privacy-preserved data. Our comprehensive experiments carried out on three public datasets, namely Stanford40, PPMI, and VOC2012, demonstrate the superiority of CDFL in terms of performance, convergence rate, and bandwidth usage compared to state-of-the-art approaches.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) by well-trained 2D diffusion models has shown great promise in text-to-3D generation. However, this paradigm distills view-agnostic 2D image distributions into the rendering distribution of 3D representation for each view independently, overlooking the coherence across views and yielding 3D inconsistency in generations. In this work, we propose \textbf{J}oint \textbf{S}core \textbf{D}istillation (JSD), a new paradigm that ensures coherent 3D generations. Specifically, we model the joint image distribution, which introduces an energy function to capture the coherence among denoised images from the diffusion model. We then derive the joint score distillation on multiple rendered views of the 3D representation, as opposed to a single view in SDS. In addition, we instantiate three universal view-aware models as energy functions, demonstrating compatibility with JSD. Empirically, JSD significantly mitigates the 3D inconsistency problem in SDS, while maintaining text congruence. Moreover, we introduce the Geometry Fading scheme and Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) Switching strategy to enhance generative details. Our framework, JointDreamer, establishes a new benchmark in text-to-3D generation, achieving outstanding results with an 88.5\% CLIP R-Precision and 27.7\% CLIP Score. These metrics demonstrate exceptional text congruence, as well as remarkable geometric consistency and texture fidelity.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Targeted adversarial attack, which aims to mislead a model to recognize any image as a target object by imperceptible perturbations, has become a mainstream tool for vulnerability assessment of deep neural networks (DNNs). Since existing targeted attackers only learn to attack known target classes, they cannot generalize well to unknown classes. To tackle this issue, we propose $\bf{G}$eneralized $\bf{A}$dversarial attac$\bf{KER}$ ($\bf{GAKer}$), which is able to construct adversarial examples to any target class. The core idea behind GAKer is to craft a latently infected representation during adversarial example generation. To this end, the extracted latent representations of the target object are first injected into intermediate features of an input image in an adversarial generator. Then, the generator is optimized to ensure visual consistency with the input image while being close to the target object in the feature space. Since the GAKer is class-agnostic yet model-agnostic, it can be regarded as a general tool that not only reveals the vulnerability of more DNNs but also identifies deficiencies of DNNs in a wider range of classes. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed method in generating adversarial examples for both known and unknown classes. Notably, compared with other generative methods, our method achieves an approximately $14.13\%$ higher attack success rate for unknown classes and an approximately $4.23\%$ higher success rate for known classes.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep learning-based methods have garnered significant attention in remote sensing (RS) image compression due to their superior performance. Most of these methods focus on enhancing the coding capability of the compression network and improving entropy model prediction accuracy. However, they typically compress and decompress each image independently, ignoring the significant inter-image similarity prior. In this paper, we propose a codebook-based RS image compression (Code-RSIC) method with a generated discrete codebook, which is deployed at the decoding end of a compression algorithm to provide inter-image similarity prior. Specifically, we first pretrain a high-quality discrete codebook using the competitive generation model VQGAN. We then introduce a Transformer-based prediction model to align the latent features of the decoded images from an existing compression algorithm with the frozen high-quality codebook. Finally, we develop a hierarchical prior integration network (HPIN), which mainly consists of Transformer blocks and multi-head cross-attention modules (MCMs) that can query hierarchical prior from the codebook, thus enhancing the ability of the proposed method to decode texture-rich RS images. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed Code-RSIC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art traditional and learning-based image compression algorithms in terms of perception quality.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>WebAssembly is revolutionizing the approach to developing modern applications. Although this technology was born to create portable and performant modules in web browsers, currently, its capabilities are extensively exploited in multiple and heterogeneous use-case scenarios. With the extensive effort of the community, new toolkits make the use of this technology more suitable for real-world applications. In this context, it is crucial to study the liaisons between the WebAssembly ecosystem and software security. Indeed, WebAssembly can be a medium for improving the security of a system, but it can also be exploited to evade detection systems or for performing cryptomining activities. In addition, programs developed in low-level languages such as C can be compiled in WebAssembly binaries, and it is interesting to evaluate the security impacts of executing programs vulnerable to attacks against memory in the WebAssembly sandboxed environment. Also, WebAssembly has been designed to provide a secure and isolated environment, but such capabilities should be assessed in order to analyze their weaknesses and propose new mechanisms for addressing them. Although some research works have provided surveys of the most relevant solutions aimed at discovering WebAssembly vulnerabilities or detecting attacks, at the time of writing, there is no comprehensive review of security-related literature in the WebAssembly ecosystem. We aim to fill this gap by proposing a comprehensive review of research works dealing with security in WebAssembly. We analyze 121 papers by identifying seven different security categories. We hope that our work will provide insights into the complex landscape of WebAssembly and guide researchers, developers, and security professionals towards novel avenues in the realm of the WebAssembly ecosystem.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Electronic health records (EHRs) are multimodal by nature, consisting of structured tabular features like lab tests and unstructured clinical notes. In real-life clinical practice, doctors use complementary multimodal EHR data sources to get a clearer picture of patients' health and support clinical decision-making. However, most EHR predictive models do not reflect these procedures, as they either focus on a single modality or overlook the inter-modality interactions/redundancy. In this work, we propose MEDFuse, a Multimodal EHR Data Fusion framework that incorporates masked lab-test modeling and large language models (LLMs) to effectively integrate structured and unstructured medical data. MEDFuse leverages multimodal embeddings extracted from two sources: LLMs fine-tuned on free clinical text and masked tabular transformers trained on structured lab test results. We design a disentangled transformer module, optimized by a mutual information loss to 1) decouple modality-specific and modality-shared information and 2) extract useful joint representation from the noise and redundancy present in clinical notes. Through comprehensive validation on the public MIMIC-III dataset and the in-house FEMH dataset, MEDFuse demonstrates great potential in advancing clinical predictions, achieving over 90% F1 score in the 10-disease multi-label classification task.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Scene Text Recognition (STR) methods have demonstrated robust performance in word-level text recognition. However, in applications the text image is sometimes long due to detected with multiple horizontal words. It triggers the requirement to build long text recognition models from readily available short word-level text datasets, which has been less studied previously. In this paper, we term this the Out of Length (OOL) text recognition. We establish a new Long Text Benchmark (LTB) to facilitate the assessment of different methods in long text recognition. Meanwhile, we propose a novel method called OOL Text Recognition with sub-String Matching (SMTR). SMTR comprises two cross-attention-based modules: one encodes a sub-string containing multiple characters into next and previous queries, and the other employs the queries to attend to the image features, matching the sub-string and simultaneously recognizing its next and previous character. SMTR can recognize text of arbitrary length by iterating the process above. To avoid being trapped in recognizing highly similar sub-strings, we introduce a regularization training to compel SMTR to effectively discover subtle differences between similar sub-strings for precise matching. In addition, we propose an inference augmentation to alleviate confusion caused by identical sub-strings and improve the overall recognition efficiency. Extensive experimental results reveal that SMTR, even when trained exclusively on short text, outperforms existing methods in public short text benchmarks and exhibits a clear advantage on LTB.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Point cloud segmentation is crucial for robotic visual perception and environmental understanding, enabling applications such as robotic navigation and 3D reconstruction. However, handling the sparse and unordered nature of point cloud data presents challenges for efficient and accurate segmentation. Inspired by the Mamba model's success in natural language processing, we propose the Serialized Point Cloud Mamba Segmentation Model (Serialized Point Mamba), which leverages a state-space model to dynamically compress sequences, reduce memory usage, and enhance computational efficiency. Serialized Point Mamba integrates local-global modeling capabilities with linear complexity, achieving state-of-the-art performance on both indoor and outdoor datasets. This approach includes novel techniques such as staged point cloud sequence learning, grid pooling, and Conditional Positional Encoding, facilitating effective segmentation across diverse point cloud tasks. Our method achieved 76.8 mIoU on Scannet and 70.3 mIoU on S3DIS. In Scannetv2 instance segmentation, it recorded 40.0 mAP. It also had the lowest latency and reasonable memory use, making it the SOTA among point semantic segmentation models based on mamba.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recently, transformers have demonstrated great potential for modeling long-term dependencies from skeleton sequences and thereby gained ever-increasing attention in skeleton action recognition. However, the existing transformer-based approaches heavily rely on the naive attention mechanism for capturing the spatiotemporal features, which falls short in learning discriminative representations that exhibit similar motion patterns. To address this challenge, we introduce the Frequency-aware Mixed Transformer (FreqMixFormer), specifically designed for recognizing similar skeletal actions with subtle discriminative motions. First, we introduce a frequency-aware attention module to unweave skeleton frequency representations by embedding joint features into frequency attention maps, aiming to distinguish the discriminative movements based on their frequency coefficients. Subsequently, we develop a mixed transformer architecture to incorporate spatial features with frequency features to model the comprehensive frequency-spatial patterns. Additionally, a temporal transformer is proposed to extract the global correlations across frames. Extensive experiments show that FreqMiXFormer outperforms SOTA on 3 popular skeleton action recognition datasets, including NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA datasets.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep learning-based segmentation techniques have shown remarkable performance in brain segmentation, yet their success hinges on the availability of extensive labeled training data. Acquiring such vast datasets, however, poses a significant challenge in many clinical applications. To address this issue, in this work, we propose a novel 3D brain segmentation approach using complementary 2D diffusion models. The core idea behind our approach is to first mine 2D features with semantic information extracted from the 2D diffusion models by taking orthogonal views as input, followed by fusing them into a 3D contextual feature representation. Then, we use these aggregated features to train multi-layer perceptrons to classify the segmentation labels. Our goal is to achieve reliable segmentation quality without requiring complete labels for each individual subject. Our experiments on training in brain subcortical structure segmentation with a dataset from only one subject demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods. Further experiments on the minimum requirement of annotation by sparse labeling yield promising results even with only nine slices and a labeled background region.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the rapid advancement in the performance of deep neural networks (DNNs), there has been significant interest in deploying and incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) systems into real-world scenarios. However, many DNNs lack the ability to represent uncertainty, often exhibiting excessive confidence even when making incorrect predictions. To ensure the reliability of AI systems, particularly in safety-critical cases, DNNs should transparently reflect the uncertainty in their predictions. In this paper, we investigate robust post-hoc uncertainty calibration methods for DNNs within the context of multi-class classification tasks. While previous studies have made notable progress, they still face challenges in achieving robust calibration, particularly in scenarios involving out-of-distribution (OOD). We identify that previous methods lack adaptability to individual input data and struggle to accurately estimate uncertainty when processing inputs drawn from the wild dataset. To address this issue, we introduce a novel instance-wise calibration method based on an energy model. Our method incorporates energy scores instead of softmax confidence scores, allowing for adaptive consideration of DNN uncertainty for each prediction within a logit space. In experiments, we show that the proposed method consistently maintains robust performance across the spectrum, spanning from in-distribution to OOD scenarios, when compared to other state-of-the-art methods.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large-scale diffusion models have made significant advancements in the field of image generation, especially through the use of cross-attention mechanisms that guide image formation based on textual descriptions. While the analysis of text-guided cross-attention in diffusion models has been extensively studied in recent years, its application in image-to-image diffusion models remains underexplored. This paper introduces the Image-to-Image Attribution Maps I2AM method, which aggregates patch-level cross-attention scores to enhance the interpretability of latent diffusion models across time steps, heads, and attention layers. I2AM facilitates detailed image-to-image attribution analysis, enabling observation of how diffusion models prioritize key features over time and head during the image generation process from reference images. Through extensive experiments, we first visualize the attribution maps of both generated and reference images, verifying that critical information from the reference image is effectively incorporated into the generated image, and vice versa. To further assess our understanding, we introduce a new evaluation metric tailored for reference-based image inpainting tasks. This metric, measuring the consistency between the attribution maps of generated and reference images, shows a strong correlation with established performance metrics for inpainting tasks, validating the potential use of I2AM in future research endeavors.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present a theoretical explanation of the ``grokking'' phenomenon, where a model generalizes long after overfitting,for the originally-studied problem of modular addition. First, we show that early in gradient descent, when the ``kernel regime'' approximately holds, no permutation-equivariant model can achieve small population error on modular addition unless it sees at least a constant fraction of all possible data points. Eventually, however, models escape the kernel regime. We show that two-layer quadratic networks that achieve zero training loss with bounded $\ell_{\infty}$ norm generalize well with substantially fewer training points, and further show such networks exist and can be found by gradient descent with small $\ell_{\infty}$ regularization. We further provide empirical evidence that these networks as well as simple Transformers, leave the kernel regime only after initially overfitting. Taken together, our results strongly support the case for grokking as a consequence of the transition from kernel-like behavior to limiting behavior of gradient descent on deep networks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Confidential computing safeguards sensitive computations from untrusted clouds, with Confidential Virtual Machines (CVMs) providing a secure environment for guest OS. However, CVMs often come with large and vulnerable operating system kernels, making them susceptible to attacks exploiting kernel weaknesses. The imprecise control over the read/write access in the page table has allowed attackers to exploit vulnerabilities. The lack of security hierarchy leads to insufficient separation between untrusted applications and guest OS, making the kernel susceptible to direct threats from untrusted programs. This study proposes Cabin, an isolated execution framework within guest VM utilizing the latest AMD SEV-SNP technology. Cabin shields untrusted processes to the user space of a lower virtual machine privilege level (VMPL) by introducing a proxy-kernel between the confined processes and the guest OS. Furthermore, we propose execution protection mechanisms based on fine-gained control of VMPL privilege for vulnerable programs and the proxy-kernel to minimize the attack surface. We introduce asynchronous forwarding mechanism and anonymous memory management to reduce the performance impact. The evaluation results show that the Cabin framework incurs a modest overhead (5% on average) on Nbench and WolfSSL benchmarks.</li>

          Exploring Deeper! Segment Anything Model with Depth Perception for Camouflaged Object Detection(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper introduces a new Segment Anything Model with Depth Perception (DSAM) for Camouflaged Object Detection (COD). DSAM exploits the zero-shot capability of SAM to realize precise segmentation in the RGB-D domain. It consists of the Prompt-Deeper Module and the Finer Module. The Prompt-Deeper Module utilizes knowledge distillation and the Bias Correction Module to achieve the interaction between RGB features and depth features, especially using depth features to correct erroneous parts in RGB features. Then, the interacted features are combined with the box prompt in SAM to create a prompt with depth perception. The Finer Module explores the possibility of accurately segmenting highly camouflaged targets from a depth perspective. It uncovers depth cues in areas missed by SAM through mask reversion, self-filtering, and self-attention operations, compensating for its defects in the COD domain. DSAM represents the first step towards the SAM-based RGB-D COD model. It maximizes the utilization of depth features while synergizing with RGB features to achieve multimodal complementarity, thereby overcoming the segmentation limitations of SAM and improving its accuracy in COD. Experimental results on COD benchmarks demonstrate that DSAM achieves excellent segmentation performance and reaches the state-of-the-art (SOTA) on COD benchmarks with less consumption of training resources.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, fair, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Personality psychologists have analyzed the relationship between personality and safety behaviors in human society. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate personality traits, the relationship between personality traits and safety abilities in LLMs still remains a mystery. In this paper, we discover that LLMs' personality traits are closely related to their safety abilities, i.e., toxicity, privacy, and fairness, based on the reliable MBTI-M scale. Meanwhile, the safety alignment generally increases various LLMs' Extraversion, Sensing, and Judging traits. According to such findings, we can edit LLMs' personality traits and improve their safety performance, e.g., inducing personality from ISTJ to ISTP resulted in a relative improvement of approximately 43% and 10% in privacy and fairness performance, respectively. Additionally, we find that LLMs with different personality traits are differentially susceptible to jailbreak. This study pioneers the investigation of LLM safety from a personality perspective, providing new insights into LLM safety enhancement.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Predicting future trajectories for other road agents is an essential task for autonomous vehicles. Established trajectory prediction methods primarily use agent tracks generated by a detection and tracking system and HD map as inputs. In this work, we propose a novel method that also incorporates visual input from surround-view cameras, allowing the model to utilize visual cues such as human gazes and gestures, road conditions, vehicle turn signals, etc, which are typically hidden from the model in prior methods. Furthermore, we use textual descriptions generated by a Vision-Language Model (VLM) and refined by a Large Language Model (LLM) as supervision during training to guide the model on what to learn from the input data. Despite using these extra inputs, our method achieves a latency of 53 ms, making it feasible for real-time processing, which is significantly faster than that of previous single-agent prediction methods with similar performance. Our experiments show that both the visual inputs and the textual descriptions contribute to improvements in trajectory prediction performance, and our qualitative analysis highlights how the model is able to exploit these additional inputs. Lastly, in this work we create and release the nuScenes-Text dataset, which augments the established nuScenes dataset with rich textual annotations for every scene, demonstrating the positive impact of utilizing VLM on trajectory prediction.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, defense, steal, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>A globally distributed IC supply chain brings risks due to untrusted third parties. The risks span inadvertent use of hardware Trojan (HT), inserted Intellectual Property (3P-IP) or Electronic Design Automation (EDA) flows. HT can introduce stealthy HT behavior, prevent an IC work as intended, or leak sensitive data via side channels. To counter HTs, rapidly examining HT scenarios is a key requirement. While Trust-Hub benchmarks are a good starting point to assess defenses, they encompass a small subset of manually created HTs within the expanse of HT designs. Further, the HTs may disappear during synthesis. We propose a large language model (LLM) framework SENTAUR to generate a suite of legitimate HTs for a Register Transfer Level (RTL) design by learning its specifications, descriptions, and natural language descriptions of HT effects. Existing tools and benchmarks are limited; they need a learning period to construct an ML model to mimic the threat model and are difficult to reproduce. SENTAUR can swiftly produce HT instances by leveraging LLMs without any learning period and sanitizing the HTs facilitating their rapid assessment. Evaluation of SENTAUR involved generating effective, synthesizable, and practical HTs from TrustHub and elsewhere, investigating impacts of payloads/triggers at the RTL. While our evaluation focused on HT insertion, SENTAUR can generalize to automatically transform an RTL code to have defined functional modifications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recently, large language models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated promising results on document visual question answering (VQA) task, particularly after training on document instruction datasets. An effective evaluation method for document instruction data is crucial in constructing instruction data with high efficacy, which, in turn, facilitates the training of LLMs and MLLMs for document VQA. However, most existing evaluation methods for instruction data are limited to the textual content of the instructions themselves, thereby hindering the effective assessment of document instruction datasets and constraining their construction. In this paper, we propose ProcTag, a data-oriented method that assesses the efficacy of document instruction data. ProcTag innovatively performs tagging on the execution process of instructions rather than the instruction text itself. By leveraging the diversity and complexity of these tags to assess the efficacy of the given dataset, ProcTag enables selective sampling or filtering of document instructions. Furthermore, DocLayPrompt, a novel semi-structured layout-aware document prompting strategy, is proposed for effectively representing documents. Experiments demonstrate that sampling existing open-sourced and generated document VQA/instruction datasets with ProcTag significantly outperforms current methods for evaluating instruction data. Impressively, with ProcTag-based sampling in the generated document datasets, only 30.5\% of the document instructions are required to achieve 100\% efficacy compared to the complete dataset.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Conversational search seeks to retrieve relevant passages for the given questions in Conversational QA (ConvQA). Questions in ConvQA face challenges such as omissions and coreferences, making it difficult to obtain desired search results. Conversational Query Reformulation (CQR) transforms these current queries into de-contextualized forms to resolve these issues. However, existing CQR methods focus on rewriting human-friendly queries, which may not always yield optimal search results for the retriever. To overcome this challenge, we introduce GuideCQR, a framework that utilizes guided documents to refine queries, ensuring that they are optimal for retrievers. Specifically, we augment keywords, generate expected answers from the re-ranked documents, and unify them with the filtering process. Experimental results show that queries enhanced by guided documents outperform previous CQR methods. Especially, GuideCQR surpasses the performance of Large Language Model (LLM) prompt-powered approaches and demonstrates the importance of the guided documents in formulating retriever-friendly queries across diverse setups.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Capitalizing on the remarkable advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a burgeoning initiative to harness LLMs for instruction following robotic navigation. Such a trend underscores the potential of LLMs to generalize navigational reasoning and diverse language understanding. However, a significant discrepancy in agent performance is observed when integrating LLMs in the Vision-and-Language navigation (VLN) tasks compared to previous downstream specialist models. Furthermore, the inherent capacity of language to interpret and facilitate communication in agent interactions is often underutilized in these integrations. In this work, we strive to bridge the divide between VLN-specialized models and LLM-based navigation paradigms, while maintaining the interpretative prowess of LLMs in generating linguistic navigational reasoning. By aligning visual content in a frozen LLM, we encompass visual observation comprehension for LLMs and exploit a way to incorporate LLMs and navigation policy networks for effective action predictions and navigational reasoning. We demonstrate the data efficiency of the proposed methods and eliminate the gap between LM-based agents and state-of-the-art VLN specialists.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generating human-object interactions (HOIs) is critical with the tremendous advances of digital avatars. Existing datasets are typically limited to humans interacting with a single object while neglecting the ubiquitous manipulation of multiple objects. Thus, we propose HIMO, a large-scale MoCap dataset of full-body human interacting with multiple objects, containing 3.3K 4D HOI sequences and 4.08M 3D HOI frames. We also annotate HIMO with detailed textual descriptions and temporal segments, benchmarking two novel tasks of HOI synthesis conditioned on either the whole text prompt or the segmented text prompts as fine-grained timeline control. To address these novel tasks, we propose a dual-branch conditional diffusion model with a mutual interaction module for HOI synthesis. Besides, an auto-regressive generation pipeline is also designed to obtain smooth transitions between HOI segments. Experimental results demonstrate the generalization ability to unseen object geometries and temporal compositions.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Sentiment analysis (SA), is an approach of natural language processing (NLP) for determining a text's emotional tone by analyzing subjective information such as views, feelings, and attitudes toward specific topics, products, services, events, or experiences. This study attempts to develop an advanced deep learning (DL) model for SA to understand global audience emotions through tweets in the context of the Olympic Games. The findings represent global attitudes around the Olympics and contribute to advancing the SA models. We have used NLP for tweet pre-processing and sophisticated DL models for arguing with SA, this research enhances the reliability and accuracy of sentiment classification. The study focuses on data selection, preprocessing, visualization, feature extraction, and model building, featuring a baseline Naïve Bayes (NB) model and three advanced DL models: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). The results of the experiments show that the BERT model can efficiently classify sentiments related to the Olympics, achieving the highest accuracy of 99.23%.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text-to-image models encounter safety issues, including concerns related to copyright and Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW) content. Despite several methods have been proposed for erasing inappropriate concepts from diffusion models, they often exhibit incomplete erasure, consume a lot of computing resources, and inadvertently damage generation ability. In this work, we introduce Reliable and Efficient Concept Erasure (RECE), a novel approach that modifies the model in 3 seconds without necessitating additional fine-tuning. Specifically, RECE efficiently leverages a closed-form solution to derive new target embeddings, which are capable of regenerating erased concepts within the unlearned model. To mitigate inappropriate content potentially represented by derived embeddings, RECE further aligns them with harmless concepts in cross-attention layers. The derivation and erasure of new representation embeddings are conducted iteratively to achieve a thorough erasure of inappropriate concepts. Besides, to preserve the model's generation ability, RECE introduces an additional regularization term during the derivation process, resulting in minimizing the impact on unrelated concepts during the erasure process. All the processes above are in closed-form, guaranteeing extremely efficient erasure in only 3 seconds. Benchmarking against previous approaches, our method achieves more efficient and thorough erasure with minor damage to original generation ability and demonstrates enhanced robustness against red-teaming tools.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>3D point cloud segmentation has received significant interest for its growing applications. However, the generalization ability of models suffers in dynamic scenarios due to the distribution shift between test and training data. To promote robustness and adaptability across diverse scenarios, test-time adaptation (TTA) has recently been introduced. Nevertheless, most existing TTA methods are developed for images, and limited approaches applicable to point clouds ignore the inherent hierarchical geometric structures in point cloud streams, i.e., local (point-level), global (object-level), and temporal (frame-level) structures. In this paper, we delve into TTA in 3D point cloud segmentation and propose a novel Hierarchical Geometry Learning (HGL) framework. HGL comprises three complementary modules from local, global to temporal learning in a bottom-up manner.Technically, we first construct a local geometry learning module for pseudo-label generation. Next, we build prototypes from the global geometry perspective for pseudo-label fine-tuning. Furthermore, we introduce a temporal consistency regularization module to mitigate negative transfer. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our HGL. Remarkably, on the SynLiDAR to SemanticKITTI task, HGL achieves an overall mIoU of 46.91\%, improving GIPSO by 3.0\% and significantly reducing the required adaptation time by 80\%.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models exhibit aspects of human-level intelligence that catalyze their application as human-like agents in domains such as social simulations, human-machine interactions, and collaborative multi-agent systems. However, the absence of distinct personalities, such as displaying ingratiating behaviors, inconsistent opinions, and uniform response patterns, diminish LLMs utility in practical applications. Addressing this, the development of personality traits in LLMs emerges as a crucial area of research to unlock their latent potential. Existing methods to personify LLMs generally involve strategies like employing stylized training data for instruction tuning or using prompt engineering to simulate different personalities. These methods only capture superficial linguistic styles instead of the core of personalities and are therefore not stable. In this study, we propose PersLLM, integrating psychology-grounded principles of personality: social practice, consistency, and dynamic development, into a comprehensive training methodology. We incorporate personality traits directly into the model parameters, enhancing the model's resistance to induction, promoting consistency, and supporting the dynamic evolution of personality. Single-agent evaluation validates our method's superiority, as it produces responses more aligned with reference personalities compared to other approaches. Case studies for multi-agent communication highlight its benefits in enhancing opinion consistency within individual agents and fostering collaborative creativity among multiple agents in dialogue contexts, potentially benefiting human simulation and multi-agent cooperation. Additionally, human-agent interaction evaluations indicate that our personified models significantly enhance interactive experiences, underscoring the practical implications of our research.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in implicit scene representation enable high-fidelity street view novel view synthesis. However, existing methods optimize a neural radiance field for each scene, relying heavily on dense training images and extensive computation resources. To mitigate this shortcoming, we introduce a new method called Efficient Depth-Guided Urban View Synthesis (EDUS) for fast feed-forward inference and efficient per-scene fine-tuning. Different from prior generalizable methods that infer geometry based on feature matching, EDUS leverages noisy predicted geometric priors as guidance to enable generalizable urban view synthesis from sparse input images. The geometric priors allow us to apply our generalizable model directly in the 3D space, gaining robustness across various sparsity levels. Through comprehensive experiments on the KITTI-360 and Waymo datasets, we demonstrate promising generalization abilities on novel street scenes. Moreover, our results indicate that EDUS achieves state-of-the-art performance in sparse view settings when combined with fast test-time optimization.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Modern recurrent layers are emerging as a promising path toward edge deployment of foundation models, especially in the context of large language models (LLMs). Compressing the whole input sequence in a finite-dimensional representation enables recurrent layers to model long-range dependencies while maintaining a constant inference cost for each token and a fixed memory requirement. However, the practical deployment of LLMs in resource-limited environments often requires further model compression, such as quantization and pruning. While these techniques are well-established for attention-based models, their effects on recurrent layers remain underexplored. In this preliminary work, we focus on post-training quantization for recurrent LLMs and show that Mamba models exhibit the same pattern of outlier channels observed in attention-based LLMs. We show that the reason for the difficulty of quantizing SSMs is caused by activation outliers, similar to those observed in transformer-based LLMs. We report baseline results for post-training quantization of Mamba that do not take into account the activation outliers and suggest first steps for outlier-aware quantization.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper presents a practical approach for the optimization of topological simplification, a central pre-processing step for the analysis and visualization of scalar data. Given an input scalar field f and a set of "signal" persistence pairs to maintain, our approach produces an output field g that is close to f and which optimizes (i) the cancellation of "non-signal" pairs, while (ii) preserving the "signal" pairs. In contrast to pre-existing simplification algorithms, our approach is not restricted to persistence pairs involving extrema and can thus address a larger class of topological features, in particular saddle pairs in three-dimensional scalar data. Our approach leverages recent generic persistence optimization frameworks and extends them with tailored accelerations specific to the problem of topological simplification. Extensive experiments report substantial accelerations over these frameworks, thereby making topological simplification optimization practical for real-life datasets. Our approach enables a direct visualization and analysis of the topologically simplified data, e.g., via isosurfaces of simplified topology (fewer components and handles). We apply our approach to the extraction of prominent filament structures in three-dimensional data. Specifically, we show that our pre-simplification of the data leads to practical improvements over standard topological techniques for removing filament loops. We also show how our approach can be used to repair genus defects in surface processing. Finally, we provide a C++ implementation for reproducibility purposes.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multiple choice question answering tasks evaluate the reasoning, comprehension, and mathematical abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). While existing benchmarks employ automatic translation for multilingual evaluation, this approach is error-prone and potentially introduces culturally biased questions, especially in social sciences. We introduce the first multitask, multiple-choice Turkish QA benchmark, TurkishMMLU, to evaluate LLMs' understanding of the Turkish language. TurkishMMLU includes over 10,000 questions, covering 9 different subjects from Turkish high-school education curricula. These questions are written by curriculum experts, suitable for the high-school curricula in Turkey, covering subjects ranging from natural sciences and math questions to more culturally representative topics such as Turkish Literature and the history of the Turkish Republic. We evaluate over 20 LLMs, including multilingual open-source (e.g., Gemma, Llama, MT5), closed-source (GPT 4o, Claude, Gemini), and Turkish-adapted (e.g., Trendyol) models. We provide an extensive evaluation, including zero-shot and few-shot evaluation of LLMs, chain-of-thought reasoning, and question difficulty analysis along with model performance. We provide an in-depth analysis of the Turkish capabilities and limitations of current LLMs to provide insights for future LLMs for the Turkish language. We publicly release our code for the dataset and evaluation: this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In recent advancements in machine learning, federated learning allows a network of distributed clients to collaboratively develop a global model without needing to share their local data. This technique aims to safeguard privacy, countering the vulnerabilities of conventional centralized learning methods. Traditional federated learning approaches often rely on a central server to coordinate model training across clients, aiming to replicate the same model uniformly across all nodes. However, these methods overlook the significance of geographical and local data variances in vast networks, potentially affecting model effectiveness and applicability. Moreover, relying on a central server might become a bottleneck in large networks, such as the ones promoted by edge computing. Our paper introduces a novel, fully-distributed federated learning strategy called proximity-based self-federated learning that enables the self-organised creation of multiple federations of clients based on their geographic proximity and data distribution without exchanging raw data. Indeed, unlike traditional algorithms, our approach encourages clients to share and adjust their models with neighbouring nodes based on geographic proximity and model accuracy. This method not only addresses the limitations posed by diverse data distributions but also enhances the model's adaptability to different regional characteristics creating specialized models for each federation. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through simulations on well-known datasets, showcasing its effectiveness over the conventional centralized federated learning framework.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Power grids are critical infrastructures of paramount importance to modern society and their rapid evolution and interconnections has heightened the complexity of power systems (PS) operations. Traditional methods for grid analysis struggle with the computational demands of large-scale RES and ES integration, prompting the adoption of machine learning (ML) techniques, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). GNNs have proven effective in solving the alternating current (AC) Power Flow (PF) and Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problems, crucial for operational planning. However, existing benchmarks and datasets completely ignore safety and robustness requirements in their evaluation and never consider realistic safety-critical scenarios that most impact the operations of the power grids. We present SafePowerGraph, the first simulator-agnostic, safety-oriented framework and benchmark for GNNs in PS operations. SafePowerGraph integrates multiple PF and OPF simulators and assesses GNN performance under diverse scenarios, including energy price variations and power line outages. Our extensive experiments underscore the importance of self-supervised learning and graph attention architectures for GNN robustness. We provide at this https URL our open-source repository, a comprehensive leaderboard, a dataset and model zoo and expect our framework to standardize and advance research in the critical field of GNN for power systems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Claim verification is a task that involves assessing the truthfulness of a given claim based on multiple evidence pieces. Using large language models (LLMs) for claim verification is a promising way. However, simply feeding all the evidence pieces to an LLM and asking if the claim is factual does not yield good results. The challenge lies in the noisy nature of both the evidence and the claim: evidence passages typically contain irrelevant information, with the key facts hidden within the context, while claims often convey multiple aspects simultaneously. To navigate this "noisy crowd" of information, we propose EACon (Evidence Abstraction and Claim Deconstruction), a framework designed to find key information within evidence and verify each aspect of a claim separately. EACon first finds keywords from the claim and employs fuzzy matching to select relevant keywords for each raw evidence piece. These keywords serve as a guide to extract and summarize critical information into abstracted evidence. Subsequently, EACon deconstructs the original claim into subclaims, which are then verified against both abstracted and raw evidence individually. We evaluate EACon using two open-source LLMs on two challenging datasets. Results demonstrate that EACon consistently and substantially improve LLMs' performance in claim verification.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Semantic Textual Relatedness holds significant relevance in Natural Language Processing, finding applications across various domains. Traditionally, approaches to STR have relied on knowledge-based and statistical methods. However, with the emergence of Large Language Models, there has been a paradigm shift, ushering in new methodologies. In this paper, we delve into the investigation of sentence-level STR within Track A (Supervised) by leveraging fine-tuning techniques on the RoBERTa transformer. Our study focuses on assessing the efficacy of this approach across different languages. Notably, our findings indicate promising advancements in STR performance, particularly in Latin languages. Specifically, our results demonstrate notable improvements in English, achieving a correlation of 0.82 and securing a commendable 19th rank. Similarly, in Spanish, we achieved a correlation of 0.67, securing the 15th position. However, our approach encounters challenges in languages like Arabic, where we observed a correlation of only 0.38, resulting in a 20th rank.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the domain of anomaly detection, methods often excel in either high-level semantic or low-level industrial benchmarks, rarely achieving cross-domain proficiency. Semantic anomalies are novelties that differ in meaning from the training set, like unseen objects in self-driving cars. In contrast, industrial anomalies are subtle defects that preserve semantic meaning, such as cracks in airplane components. In this paper, we present GeneralAD, an anomaly detection framework designed to operate in semantic, near-distribution, and industrial settings with minimal per-task adjustments. In our approach, we capitalize on the inherent design of Vision Transformers, which are trained on image patches, thereby ensuring that the last hidden states retain a patch-based structure. We propose a novel self-supervised anomaly generation module that employs straightforward operations like noise addition and shuffling to patch features to construct pseudo-abnormal samples. These features are fed to an attention-based discriminator, which is trained to score every patch in the image. With this, our method can both accurately identify anomalies at the image level and also generate interpretable anomaly maps. We extensively evaluated our approach on ten datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results in six and on-par performance in the remaining for both localization and detection tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Most existing Low-light Image Enhancement (LLIE) methods either directly map Low-Light (LL) to Normal-Light (NL) images or use semantic or illumination maps as guides. However, the ill-posed nature of LLIE and the difficulty of semantic retrieval from impaired inputs limit these methods, especially in extremely low-light conditions. To address this issue, we present a new LLIE network via Generative LAtent feature based codebook REtrieval (GLARE), in which the codebook prior is derived from undegraded NL images using a Vector Quantization (VQ) strategy. More importantly, we develop a generative Invertible Latent Normalizing Flow (I-LNF) module to align the LL feature distribution to NL latent representations, guaranteeing the correct code retrieval in the codebook. In addition, a novel Adaptive Feature Transformation (AFT) module, featuring an adjustable function for users and comprising an Adaptive Mix-up Block (AMB) along with a dual-decoder architecture, is devised to further enhance fidelity while preserving the realistic details provided by codebook prior. Extensive experiments confirm the superior performance of GLARE on various benchmark datasets and real-world data. Its effectiveness as a preprocessing tool in low-light object detection tasks further validates GLARE for high-level vision applications. Code is released at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Existing 3D human object interaction (HOI) datasets and models simply align global descriptions with the long HOI sequence, while lacking a detailed understanding of intermediate states and the transitions between states. In this paper, we argue that fine-grained semantic alignment, which utilizes state-level descriptions, offers a promising paradigm for learning semantically rich HOI representations. To achieve this, we introduce Semantic-HOI, a new dataset comprising over 20K paired HOI states with fine-grained descriptions for each HOI state and the body movements that happen between two consecutive states. Leveraging the proposed dataset, we design three state-level HOI tasks to accomplish fine-grained semantic alignment within the HOI sequence. Additionally, we propose a unified model called F-HOI, designed to leverage multimodal instructions and empower the Multi-modal Large Language Model to efficiently handle diverse HOI tasks. F-HOI offers multiple advantages: (1) It employs a unified task formulation that supports the use of versatile multimodal inputs. (2) It maintains consistency in HOI across 2D, 3D, and linguistic spaces. (3) It utilizes fine-grained textual supervision for direct optimization, avoiding intricate modeling of HOI states. Extensive experiments reveal that F-HOI effectively aligns HOI states with fine-grained semantic descriptions, adeptly tackling understanding, reasoning, generation, and reconstruction tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Machine Learning (ML) is continuously permeating a growing amount of application domains. Generative AI such as Large Language Models (LLMs) also sees broad adoption to process multi-modal data such as text, images, audio, and video. While the trend is to use ever-larger datasets for training, managing this data efficiently has become a significant practical challenge in the industry-double as much data is certainly not double as good. Rather the opposite is important since getting an understanding of the inherent quality and diversity of the underlying data lakes is a growing challenge for application-specific ML as well as for fine-tuning foundation models. Furthermore, information retrieval (IR) from expanding data lakes is complicated by the temporal dimension inherent in time-series data which must be considered to determine its semantic value. This study focuses on the different semantic-aware techniques to extract embeddings from mono-modal, multi-modal, and cross-modal data to enhance IR capabilities in a growing data lake. Articles were collected to summarize information about the state-of-the-art techniques focusing on applications of embedding for three different categories of data modalities.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Despite the success of large-scale pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) especially CLIP in various open-vocabulary tasks, their application to semantic segmentation remains challenging, producing noisy segmentation maps with mis-segmented regions. In this paper, we carefully re-investigate the architecture of CLIP, and identify residual connections as the primary source of noise that degrades segmentation quality. With a comparative analysis of statistical properties in the residual connection and the attention output across different pretrained models, we discover that CLIP's image-text contrastive training paradigm emphasizes global features at the expense of local discriminability, leading to noisy segmentation results. In response, we propose ClearCLIP, a novel approach that decomposes CLIP's representations to enhance open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. We introduce three simple modifications to the final layer: removing the residual connection, implementing the self-self attention, and discarding the feed-forward network. ClearCLIP consistently generates clearer and more accurate segmentation maps and outperforms existing approaches across multiple benchmarks, affirming the significance of our discoveries.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>defense, attack, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Adversarial training (AT) has become an effective defense method against adversarial examples (AEs) and it is typically framed as a bi-level optimization problem. Among various AT methods, fast AT (FAT), which employs a single-step attack strategy to guide the training process, can achieve good robustness against adversarial attacks at a low cost. However, FAT methods suffer from the catastrophic overfitting problem, especially on complex tasks or with large-parameter models. In this work, we propose a FAT method termed FGSM-PCO, which mitigates catastrophic overfitting by averting the collapse of the inner optimization problem in the bi-level optimization process. FGSM-PCO generates current-stage AEs from the historical AEs and incorporates them into the training process using an adaptive mechanism. This mechanism determines an appropriate fusion ratio according to the performance of the AEs on the training model. Coupled with a loss function tailored to the training framework, FGSM-PCO can alleviate catastrophic overfitting and help the recovery of an overfitted model to effective training. We evaluate our algorithm across three models and three datasets to validate its effectiveness. Comparative empirical studies against other FAT algorithms demonstrate that our proposed method effectively addresses unresolved overfitting issues in existing algorithms.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In financial applications, regulations or best practices often lead to specific requirements in machine learning relating to four key pillars: fairness, privacy, interpretability and greenhouse gas emissions. These all sit in the broader context of sustainability in AI, an emerging practical AI topic. However, although these pillars have been individually addressed by past literature, none of these works have considered all the pillars. There are inherent trade-offs between each of the pillars (for example, accuracy vs fairness or accuracy vs privacy), making it even more important to consider them together. This paper outlines a new framework for Sustainable Machine Learning and proposes FPIG, a general AI pipeline that allows for these critical topics to be considered simultaneously to learn the trade-offs between the pillars better. Based on the FPIG framework, we propose a meta-learning algorithm to estimate the four key pillars given a dataset summary, model architecture, and hyperparameters before model training. This algorithm allows users to select the optimal model architecture for a given dataset and a given set of user requirements on the pillars. We illustrate the trade-offs under the FPIG model on three classical datasets and demonstrate the meta-learning approach with an example of real-world datasets and models with different interpretability, showcasing how it can aid model selection.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Limited training data and severe class imbalance pose significant challenges to developing clinically robust deep learning models. Federated learning (FL) addresses the former by enabling different medical clients to collaboratively train a deep model without sharing privacy-sensitive data. However, class imbalance worsens due to variation in inter-client class distribution. We propose federated learning with non-parametric regularization (FedNPR and FedNPR-Per, a personalized version of FedNPR) to regularize the feature extractor and enhance useful and discriminative signal in the feature space. Our extensive experiments show that FedNPR outperform the existing state-of-the art FL approaches in class imbalance skin lesion classification and intracranial hemorrhage identification. Additionally, the non-parametric regularization module consistently improves the performance of existing state-of-the-art FL approaches. We believe that NPR is a valuable tool in FL under clinical settings.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Combining offline and online reinforcement learning (RL) techniques is indeed crucial for achieving efficient and safe learning where data acquisition is expensive. Existing methods replay offline data directly in the online phase, resulting in a significant challenge of data distribution shift and subsequently causing inefficiency in online fine-tuning. To address this issue, we introduce an innovative approach, \textbf{E}nergy-guided \textbf{DI}ffusion \textbf{S}ampling (EDIS), which utilizes a diffusion model to extract prior knowledge from the offline dataset and employs energy functions to distill this knowledge for enhanced data generation in the online phase. The theoretical analysis demonstrates that EDIS exhibits reduced suboptimality compared to solely utilizing online data or directly reusing offline data. EDIS is a plug-in approach and can be combined with existing methods in offline-to-online RL setting. By implementing EDIS to off-the-shelf methods Cal-QL and IQL, we observe a notable 20% average improvement in empirical performance on MuJoCo, AntMaze, and Adroit environments.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The labor-intensive labeling for semantic segmentation has spurred the emergence of Unsupervised Semantic Segmentation. Recent studies utilize patch-wise contrastive learning based on features from image-level self-supervised pretrained models. However, relying solely on similarity-based supervision from image-level pretrained models often leads to unreliable guidance due to insufficient patch-level semantic representations. To address this, we propose a Progressive Proxy Anchor Propagation (PPAP) strategy. This method gradually identifies more trustworthy positives for each anchor by relocating its proxy to regions densely populated with semantically similar samples. Specifically, we initially establish a tight boundary to gather a few reliable positive samples around each anchor. Then, considering the distribution of positive samples, we relocate the proxy anchor towards areas with a higher concentration of positives and adjust the positiveness boundary based on the propagation degree of the proxy anchor. Moreover, to account for ambiguous regions where positive and negative samples may coexist near the positiveness boundary, we introduce an instance-wise ambiguous zone. Samples within these zones are excluded from the negative set, further enhancing the reliability of the negative set. Our state-of-the-art performances on various datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method for Unsupervised Semantic Segmentation.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present a novel approach to data preparation for developing multilingual Indic large language model. Our meticulous data acquisition spans open-source and proprietary sources, including Common Crawl, Indic books, news articles, and Wikipedia, ensuring a diverse and rich linguistic representation. For each Indic language, we design a custom preprocessing pipeline to effectively eliminate redundant and low-quality text content. Additionally, we perform deduplication on Common Crawl data to address the redundancy present in 70% of the crawled web pages. This study focuses on developing high-quality data, optimizing tokenization for our multilingual dataset for Indic large language models with 3B and 7B parameters, engineered for superior performance in Indic languages. We introduce a novel multilingual tokenizer training strategy, demonstrating our custom-trained Indic tokenizer outperforms the state-of-the-art OpenAI Tiktoken tokenizer, achieving a superior token-to-word ratio for Indic languages.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Over the past decade, the technology used by referees in football has improved substantially, enhancing the fairness and accuracy of decisions. This progress has culminated in the implementation of the Video Assistant Referee (VAR), an innovation that enables backstage referees to review incidents on the pitch from multiple points of view. However, the VAR is currently limited to professional leagues due to its expensive infrastructure and the lack of referees worldwide. In this paper, we present the semi-automated Video Assistant Referee System (VARS) that leverages the latest findings in multi-view video analysis. VARS sets a new state-of-the-art on the SoccerNet-MVFoul dataset, a multi-view video dataset of football fouls. Our VARS achieves a new state-of-the-art on the SoccerNet-MVFoul dataset by recognizing the type of foul in 50% of instances and the appropriate sanction in 46% of cases. Finally, we conducted a comparative study to investigate human performance in classifying fouls and their corresponding severity and compared these findings to our VARS. The results of our study highlight the potential of our VARS to reach human performance and support football refereeing across all levels of professional and amateur federations.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We tackle the novel class discovery in point cloud segmentation, which discovers novel classes based on the semantic knowledge of seen classes. Existing work proposes an online point-wise clustering method with a simplified equal class-size constraint on the novel classes to avoid degenerate solutions. However, the inherent imbalanced distribution of novel classes in point clouds typically violates the equal class-size constraint. Moreover, point-wise clustering ignores the rich spatial context information of objects, which results in less expressive representation for semantic segmentation. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel self-labeling strategy that adaptively generates high-quality pseudo-labels for imbalanced classes during model training. In addition, we develop a dual-level representation that incorporates regional consistency into the point-level classifier learning, reducing noise in generated segmentation. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on two widely used datasets, SemanticKITTI and SemanticPOSS, and the results show our method outperforms the state of the art by a large margin.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The linguistic capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are critical for their effective application across diverse tasks. This study aims to evaluate the performance of MLLMs on the VALSE benchmark, focusing on the efficacy of few-shot In-Context Learning (ICL), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. We conducted a comprehensive assessment of state-of-the-art MLLMs, varying in model size and pretraining datasets. The experimental results reveal that ICL and CoT prompting significantly boost model performance, particularly in tasks requiring complex reasoning and contextual understanding. Models pretrained on captioning datasets show superior zero-shot performance, while those trained on interleaved image-text data benefit from few-shot learning. Our findings provide valuable insights into optimizing MLLMs for better grounding of language in visual contexts, highlighting the importance of the composition of pretraining data and the potential of few-shot learning strategies to improve the reasoning abilities of MLLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The language used by US courtroom actors in criminal trials has long been studied for biases. However, systematic studies for bias in high-stakes court trials have been difficult, due to the nuanced nature of bias and the legal expertise required. New large language models offer the possibility to automate annotation, saving time and cost. But validating these approaches requires both high quantitative performance as well as an understanding of how automated methods fit in existing workflows, and what they really offer. In this paper we present a case study of adding an automated system to a complex and high-stakes problem: identifying gender-biased language in US capital trials for women defendants. Our team of experienced death-penalty lawyers and NLP technologists pursued a three-phase study: first annotating manually, then training and evaluating computational models, and finally comparing human annotations to model predictions. Unlike many typical NLP tasks, annotating for gender bias in months-long capital trials was a complicated task that involves with many individual judgment calls. In contrast to standard arguments for automation that are based on efficiency and scalability, legal experts found the computational models most useful in challenging their personal bias in annotation and providing opportunities to refine and build consensus on rules for annotation. This suggests that seeking to replace experts with computational models is both unrealistic and undesirable. Rather, computational models offer valuable opportunities to assist the legal experts in annotation-based studies.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Complex reasoning is an impressive ability shown by large language models (LLMs). Most LLMs are skilled in deductive reasoning, such as chain-of-thought prompting or iterative tool-using to solve challenging tasks step-by-step. In this paper, we hope to focus on evaluating and teaching LLMs to conduct inductive reasoning, that is, LLMs are supposed to infer underlying rules by observing examples or sequential transformations. However, collecting large-scale and diverse human-generated inductive data is challenging. We focus on data synthesis in the code domain and propose a \textbf{Case2Code} task by exploiting the expressiveness and correctness of programs. Specifically, we collect a diverse set of executable programs, synthesize input-output transformations for each program, and force LLMs to infer the underlying code implementations based on the synthetic I/O cases. We first evaluate representative LLMs on the synthesized Case2Code task and demonstrate that the Case-to-code induction is challenging for LLMs. Then, we synthesize large-scale Case2Code training samples to train LLMs to perform inductive reasoning. Experimental results show that such induction training benefits not only in distribution Case2Code performance but also enhances various coding abilities of trained LLMs, demonstrating the great potential of learning inductive reasoning via synthetic data.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid expansion of multimedia content has made accurately retrieving relevant videos from large collections increasingly challenging. Recent advancements in text-video retrieval have focused on cross-modal interactions, large-scale foundation model training, and probabilistic modeling, yet often neglect the crucial user perspective, leading to discrepancies between user queries and the content retrieved. To address this, we introduce MERLIN (Multimodal Embedding Refinement via LLM-based Iterative Navigation), a novel, training-free pipeline that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for iterative feedback learning. MERLIN refines query embeddings from a user perspective, enhancing alignment between queries and video content through a dynamic question answering process. Experimental results on datasets like MSR-VTT, MSVD, and ActivityNet demonstrate that MERLIN substantially improves Recall@1, outperforming existing systems and confirming the benefits of integrating LLMs into multimodal retrieval systems for more responsive and context-aware multimedia retrieval.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>It has become common practice now to use random initialization schemes, rather than the pre-trained embeddings, when training transformer based models from scratch. Indeed, we find that pre-trained word embeddings from GloVe, and some sub-word embeddings extracted from language models such as T5 and mT5 fare much worse compared to random initialization. This is counter-intuitive given the well-known representational and transfer-learning advantages of pre-training. Interestingly, we also find that BERT and mBERT embeddings fare better than random initialization, showing the advantages of pre-trained representations. In this work, we posit two potential factors that contribute to these mixed results: the model sensitivity to parameter distribution and the embedding interactions with position encodings. We observe that pre-trained GloVe, T5, and mT5 embeddings have a wider distribution of values. As argued in the initialization studies, such large value initializations can lead to poor training because of saturated outputs. Further, the larger embedding values can, in effect, absorb the smaller position encoding values when added together, thus losing position information. Standardizing the pre-trained embeddings to a narrow range (e.g. as prescribed by Xavier) leads to substantial gains for Glove, T5, and mT5 embeddings. On the other hand, BERT pre-trained embeddings, while larger, are still relatively closer to Xavier initialization range which may allow it to effectively transfer the pre-trained knowledge.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Climate downscaling, the process of generating high-resolution climate data from low-resolution simulations, is essential for understanding and adapting to climate change at regional and local scales. Deep learning approaches have proven useful in tackling this problem. However, existing studies usually focus on training models for one specific task, location and variable, which are therefore limited in their generalizability and transferability. In this paper, we evaluate the efficacy of training deep learning downscaling models on multiple diverse climate datasets to learn more robust and transferable representations. We evaluate the effectiveness of architectures zero-shot transferability using CNNs, Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs), and vision Transformers (ViTs). We assess the spatial, variable, and product transferability of downscaling models experimentally, to understand the generalizability of these different architecture types.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Gait recognition is a biometric technology that distinguishes individuals by their walking patterns. However, previous methods face challenges when accurately extracting identity features because they often become entangled with non-identity clues. To address this challenge, we propose CLTD, a causality-inspired discriminative feature learning module designed to effectively eliminate the influence of confounders in triple domains, \ie, spatial, temporal, and spectral. Specifically, we utilize the Cross Pixel-wise Attention Generator (CPAG) to generate attention distributions for factual and counterfactual features in spatial and temporal domains. Then, we introduce the Fourier Projection Head (FPH) to project spatial features into the spectral space, which preserves essential information while reducing computational costs. Additionally, we employ an optimization method with contrastive learning to enforce semantic consistency constraints across sequences from the same subject. Our approach has demonstrated significant performance improvements on challenging datasets, proving its effectiveness. Moreover, it can be seamlessly integrated into existing gait recognition methods.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Structured data, rich in logical and relational information, has the potential to enhance the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Still, its integration poses a challenge due to the risk of overwhelming LLMs with excessive tokens and irrelevant context information. To address this, we propose Struct-X, a novel framework that operates through five key phases: ``read-model-fill-reflect-reason'' efficiently enabling LLMs to utilize structured data. It begins by encoding structured data into a topological space using graph embeddings, followed by filling in missing entity information with knowledge retrieval modules, and filtering out irrelevant tokens via a self-supervised module. The final phase involves constructing a topological network with selected tokens to further reduce the total token length for more effective LLM inference. Additionally, Struct-X includes an Auxiliary Module trained to generate prompts, aiding LLMs in analyzing structured data. Extensive experiments on benchmarks, including the knowledge graph question-answer task and the long document reading comprehension task, show that Struct-X notably improves LLM reasoning, demonstrating the effectiveness of structured data augmentation in improving LLM inference with complex input context.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, extraction, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Query rewriting aims to generate a new query that can complement the original query to improve the information retrieval system. Recent studies on query rewriting, such as query2doc (Q2D), query2expand (Q2E) and querey2cot (Q2C), rely on the internal knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate a relevant passage to add information to the query. Nevertheless, the efficacy of these methodologies may markedly decline in instances where the requisite knowledge is not encapsulated within the model's intrinsic parameters. In this paper, we propose a novel structured query rewriting method called Crafting the Path tailored for retrieval systems. Crafting the Path involves a three-step process that crafts query-related information necessary for finding the passages to be searched in each step. Specifically, the Crafting the Path begins with Query Concept Comprehension, proceeds to Query Type Identification, and finally conducts Expected Answer Extraction. Experimental results show that our method outperforms previous rewriting methods, especially in less familiar domains for LLMs. We demonstrate that our method is less dependent on the internal parameter knowledge of the model and generates queries with fewer factual inaccuracies. Furthermore, we observe that Crafting the Path has less latency compared to the baselines.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Effective collaboration in multi-agent systems requires communicating goals and intentions between agents. Current agent frameworks often suffer from dependencies on single-agent execution and lack robust inter-module communication, frequently leading to suboptimal multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) policies and inadequate task coordination. To address these challenges, we present a framework for training large language models (LLMs) as collaborative agents to enable coordinated behaviors in cooperative MARL. Each agent maintains a private intention consisting of its current goal and associated sub-tasks. Agents broadcast their intentions periodically, allowing other agents to infer coordination tasks. A propagation network transforms broadcast intentions into teammate-specific communication messages, sharing relevant goals with designated teammates. The architecture of our framework is structured into planning, grounding, and execution modules. During execution, multiple agents interact in a downstream environment and communicate intentions to enable coordinated behaviors. The grounding module dynamically adapts comprehension strategies based on emerging coordination patterns, while feedback from execution agents influnces the planning module, enabling the dynamic re-planning of sub-tasks. Results in collaborative environment simulation demonstrate intention propagation reduces miscoordination errors by aligning sub-task dependencies between agents. Agents learn when to communicate intentions and which teammates require task details, resulting in emergent coordinated behaviors. This demonstrates the efficacy of intention sharing for cooperative multi-agent RL based on LLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The paper presents a step forward in the design and implementation of a Transport Layer Security (TLS) handshake protocol that enables the use of Verifiable Credential (VC) while maintaining full compliance with RFC-8446 and preserving all the security features of TLS 1.3. The improvement over our previous work lies in the handshake design, which now only uses messages already defined for TLS 1.3. The design has an incredibly positive impact on the implementation, as we made minimal changes to the OpenSSL library and relied mostly on a novel external provider to handle VC and Decentralized IDentifier related operations. The experimental results prove the feasibility of the design and show comparable performance to the original solution based on PKI and X.509 certificates. These results pave the way for the adoption of Self-Sovereign Identity in large-scale IoT systems, with a clear benefit in terms of reducing the cost of identity management.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper presents a novel high-speed hardware algorithm for the modulus operation for FPGA implementation. The proposed algorithm use only addition, subtraction, logical, and bit shift operations, avoiding the complexities and hardware costs associated with multiplication and division. It demonstrates consistent performance across operand sizes ranging from 32-bit to 2048-bit, addressing scalability challenges in cryptographic applications. Implemented in Verilog HDL and tested on a Xilinx Zynq-7000 family FPGA, the algorithm shows a predictable linear scaling of cycle count with bit length difference (BLD), described by the equation $y=2x+2$, where $y$ represents the cycle count and $x$ represents the BLD. The application of this algorithm in prime number calculation up to 500,000 shows its practical utility and performance advantages. Comprehensive evaluations reveal efficient resource utilization, robust timing performance, and effective power management, making it suitable for high-performance and resource-constrained platforms. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm significantly improves the efficiency of modular arithmetic operations, with potential implications for cryptographic protocols and secure computing.</li>

          The Fabrication of Reality and Fantasy: Scene Generation with LLM-Assisted Prompt Interpretation(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In spite of recent advancements in text-to-image generation, limitations persist in handling complex and imaginative prompts due to the restricted diversity and complexity of training data. This work explores how diffusion models can generate images from prompts requiring artistic creativity or specialized knowledge. We introduce the Realistic-Fantasy Benchmark (RFBench), a novel evaluation framework blending realistic and fantastical scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose the Realistic-Fantasy Network (RFNet), a training-free approach integrating diffusion models with LLMs. Extensive human evaluations and GPT-based compositional assessments demonstrate our approach's superiority over state-of-the-art methods.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promising advancements in general visual and language understanding. However, the representation of multimodal information using MLLMs remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce a new framework, E5-V, designed to adapt MLLMs for achieving universal multimodal embeddings. Our findings highlight the significant potential of MLLMs in representing multimodal inputs compared to previous approaches. By leveraging MLLMs with prompts, E5-V effectively bridges the modality gap between different types of inputs, demonstrating strong performance in multimodal embeddings even without fine-tuning. We propose a single modality training approach for E5-V, where the model is trained exclusively on text pairs. This method demonstrates significant improvements over traditional multimodal training on image-text pairs, while reducing training costs by approximately 95%. Additionally, this approach eliminates the need for costly multimodal training data collection. Extensive experiments across four types of tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of E5-V. As a universal multimodal model, E5-V not only achieves but often surpasses state-of-the-art performance in each task, despite being trained on a single modality.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>defense</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Video generation models (VGMs) have demonstrated the capability to synthesize high-quality output. It is important to understand their potential to produce unsafe content, such as violent or terrifying videos. In this work, we provide a comprehensive understanding of unsafe video generation. First, to confirm the possibility that these models could indeed generate unsafe videos, we choose unsafe content generation prompts collected from 4chan and Lexica, and three open-source SOTA VGMs to generate unsafe videos. After filtering out duplicates and poorly generated content, we created an initial set of 2112 unsafe videos from an original pool of 5607 videos. Through clustering and thematic coding analysis of these generated videos, we identify 5 unsafe video categories: Distorted/Weird, Terrifying, Pornographic, Violent/Bloody, and Political. With IRB approval, we then recruit online participants to help label the generated videos. Based on the annotations submitted by 403 participants, we identified 937 unsafe videos from the initial video set. With the labeled information and the corresponding prompts, we created the first dataset of unsafe videos generated by VGMs. We then study possible defense mechanisms to prevent the generation of unsafe videos. Existing defense methods in image generation focus on filtering either input prompt or output results. We propose a new approach called Latent Variable Defense (LVD), which works within the model's internal sampling process. LVD can achieve 0.90 defense accuracy while reducing time and computing resources by 10x when sampling a large number of unsafe prompts.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In frame-based vision, object detection faces substantial performance degradation under challenging conditions due to the limited sensing capability of conventional cameras. Event cameras output sparse and asynchronous events, providing a potential solution to solve these problems. However, effectively fusing two heterogeneous modalities remains an open issue. In this work, we propose a novel hierarchical feature refinement network for event-frame fusion. The core concept is the design of the coarse-to-fine fusion module, denoted as the cross-modality adaptive feature refinement (CAFR) module. In the initial phase, the bidirectional cross-modality interaction (BCI) part facilitates information bridging from two distinct sources. Subsequently, the features are further refined by aligning the channel-level mean and variance in the two-fold adaptive feature refinement (TAFR) part. We conducted extensive experiments on two benchmarks: the low-resolution PKU-DDD17-Car dataset and the high-resolution DSEC dataset. Experimental results show that our method surpasses the state-of-the-art by an impressive margin of $\textbf{8.0}\%$ on the DSEC dataset. Besides, our method exhibits significantly better robustness (\textbf{69.5}\% versus \textbf{38.7}\%) when introducing 15 different corruption types to the frame images.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large-scale vision models have become integral in many applications due to their unprecedented performance and versatility across downstream tasks. However, the robustness of these foundation models has primarily been explored for a single task, namely image classification. The vulnerability of other common vision tasks, such as semantic segmentation and depth estimation, remains largely unknown. We present a comprehensive empirical evaluation of the adversarial robustness of self-supervised vision encoders across multiple downstream tasks. Our attacks operate in the encoder embedding space and at the downstream task output level. In both cases, current state-of-the-art adversarial fine-tuning techniques tested only for classification significantly degrade clean and robust performance on other tasks. Since the purpose of a foundation model is to cater to multiple applications at once, our findings reveal the need to enhance encoder robustness more broadly. %We discuss potential strategies for more robust foundation vision models across diverse downstream tasks.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Re-Identification systems (Re-ID) are crucial for public safety but face the challenge of having to adapt to environments that differ from their training distribution. Furthermore, rigorous privacy protocols in public places are being enforced as apprehensions regarding individual freedom rise, adding layers of complexity to the deployment of accurate Re-ID systems in new environments. For example, in the European Union, the principles of ``Data Minimization'' and ``Purpose Limitation'' restrict the retention and processing of images to what is strictly necessary. These regulations pose a challenge to the conventional Re-ID training schemes that rely on centralizing data on servers. In this work, we present a novel setting for privacy-preserving Distributed Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for person Re-ID (DUDA-Rid) to address the problem of domain shift without requiring any image transfer outside the camera devices. To address this setting, we introduce Fed-Protoid, a novel solution that adapts person Re-ID models directly within the edge devices. Our proposed solution employs prototypes derived from the source domain to align feature statistics within edge devices. Those source prototypes are distributed across the edge devices to minimize a distributed Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) loss tailored for the DUDA-Rid setting. Our experiments provide compelling evidence that Fed-Protoid outperforms all evaluated methods in terms of both accuracy and communication efficiency, all while maintaining data privacy.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the context of global climate change and frequent extreme weather events, forecasting future geospatial vegetation states under these conditions is of significant importance. The vegetation change process is influenced by the complex interplay between dynamic meteorological variables and static environmental variables, leading to high levels of uncertainty. Existing deterministic methods are inadequate in addressing this uncertainty and fail to accurately model the impact of these variables on vegetation, resulting in blurry and inaccurate forecasting results. To address these issues, we propose VegeDiff for the geospatial vegetation forecasting task. To our best knowledge, VegeDiff is the first to employ a diffusion model to probabilistically capture the uncertainties in vegetation change processes, enabling the generation of clear and accurate future vegetation states. VegeDiff also separately models the global impact of dynamic meteorological variables and the local effects of static environmental variables, thus accurately modeling the impact of these variables. Extensive experiments on geospatial vegetation forecasting tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of VegeDiff. By capturing the uncertainties in vegetation changes and modeling the complex influence of relevant variables, VegeDiff outperforms existing deterministic methods, providing clear and accurate forecasting results of future vegetation states. Interestingly, we demonstrate the potential of VegeDiff in applications of forecasting future vegetation states from multiple aspects and exploring the impact of meteorological variables on vegetation dynamics.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Sign language is one of the most effective communication tools for people with hearing difficulties. Most existing works focus on improving the performance of sign language tasks on RGB videos, which may suffer from degraded recording conditions, such as fast movement of hands with motion blur and textured signer's appearance. The bio-inspired event camera, which asynchronously captures brightness change with high speed, could naturally perceive dynamic hand movements, providing rich manual clues for sign language tasks. In this work, we aim at exploring the potential of event camera in continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) and sign language translation (SLT). To promote the research, we first collect an event-based benchmark EvSign for those tasks with both gloss and spoken language annotations. EvSign dataset offers a substantial amount of high-quality event streams and an extensive vocabulary of glosses and words, thereby facilitating the development of sign language tasks. In addition, we propose an efficient transformer-based framework for event-based SLR and SLT tasks, which fully leverages the advantages of streaming events. The sparse backbone is employed to extract visual features from sparse events. Then, the temporal coherence is effectively utilized through the proposed local token fusion and gloss-aware temporal aggregation modules. Extensive experimental results are reported on both simulated (PHOENIX14T) and EvSign datasets. Our method performs favorably against existing state-of-the-art approaches with only 0.34% computational cost (0.84G FLOPS per video) and 44.2% network parameters.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Semantic segmentation is a fundamental computer vision task with a vast number of applications. State of the art methods increasingly rely on deep learning models, known to incorrectly estimate uncertainty and being overconfident in predictions, especially in data not seen during training. This is particularly problematic in semantic segmentation due to inherent class imbalance. Popular uncertainty quantification approaches are task-agnostic and fail to leverage spatial pixel correlations in uncertainty estimates, crucial in this task. In this work, a novel training methodology specifically designed for semantic segmentation is presented. Training samples are weighted by instance-wise uncertainty masks computed by an ensemble. This is shown to increase performance on minority classes, boost model generalization and robustness to domain-shift when compared to using the inverse of class proportions or no class weights at all. This method addresses the challenges of class imbalance and uncertainty estimation in semantic segmentation, potentially enhancing model performance and reliability across various applications.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The task of labeling multiple organs for segmentation is a complex and time-consuming process, resulting in a scarcity of comprehensively labeled multi-organ datasets while the emergence of numerous partially labeled datasets. Current methods are inadequate in effectively utilizing the supervised information available from these datasets, thereby impeding the progress in improving the segmentation accuracy. This paper proposes a two-stage multi-organ segmentation method based on mutual learning, aiming to improve multi-organ segmentation performance by complementing information among partially labeled datasets. In the first stage, each partial-organ segmentation model utilizes the non-overlapping organ labels from different datasets and the distinct organ features extracted by different models, introducing additional mutual difference learning to generate higher quality pseudo labels for unlabeled organs. In the second stage, each full-organ segmentation model is supervised by fully labeled datasets with pseudo labels and leverages true labels from other datasets, while dynamically sharing accurate features across different models, introducing additional mutual similarity learning to enhance multi-organ segmentation performance. Extensive experiments were conducted on nine datasets that included the head and neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis. The results indicate that our method has achieved SOTA performance in segmentation tasks that rely on partial labels, and the ablation studies have thoroughly confirmed the efficacy of the mutual learning mechanism.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multimodal learning typically relies on the assumption that all modalities are fully available during both the training and inference phases. However, in real-world scenarios, consistently acquiring complete multimodal data presents significant challenges due to various factors. This often leads to the issue of missing modalities, where data for certain modalities are absent, posing considerable obstacles not only for the availability of multimodal pretrained models but also for their fine-tuning and the preservation of robustness in downstream tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework integrating parameter-efficient fine-tuning of unimodal pretrained models with a self-supervised joint-embedding learning method. This framework enables the model to predict the embedding of a missing modality in the representation space during inference. Our method effectively predicts the missing embedding through prompt tuning, leveraging information from available modalities. We evaluate our approach on several multimodal benchmark datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness and robustness across various scenarios of missing modalities.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>It is well-known that functions over finite fields play a crucial role in designing substitution boxes (S-boxes) in modern block ciphers. In order to analyze the security of an S-box, recently, three new tables have been introduced: the Extended Boomerang Connectivity Table (EBCT), the Lower Boomerang Connectivity Table (LBCT), and the Upper Boomerang Connectivity Table (UBCT). In fact, these tables offer improved methods over the usual Boomerang Connectivity Table (BCT) for analyzing the security of S-boxes against boomerang-style attacks. Here, we put in context these new EBCT, LBCT, and UBCT concepts by connecting them to the DDT for a differentially $\delta$-uniform function and also determine the EBCT, LBCT, and UBCT entries of three classes of differentially $4$-uniform power permutations, namely, Gold, Kasami and Bracken-Leander. We also determine the Double Boomerang Connectivity Table (DBCT) entries of the Gold function. As byproducts of our approach, we obtain some previously published results quite easily.</li>

We start by discussing the decreasing diversity of languages in the world and how working with Indigenous languages poses unique ethical challenges for AI and NLP. To address those challenges, we propose an alternative development AI cycle based on community engagement and usage. Then, we report encouraging results in the development of high-quality machine learning translators for Indigenous languages by fine-tuning state-of-the-art (SOTA) translators with tiny amounts of data and discuss how to avoid some common pitfalls in the process. We also present prototypes we have built in projects done in 2023 and 2024 with Indigenous communities in Brazil, aimed at facilitating writing, and discuss the development of Indigenous Language Models (ILMs) as a replicable and scalable way to create spell-checkers, next-word predictors, and similar tools. Finally, we discuss how we envision a future for language documentation where dying languages are preserved as interactive language models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Semi-supervised semantic segmentation methods leverage unlabeled data by pseudo-labeling them. Thus the success of these methods hinges on the reliablility of the pseudo-labels. Existing methods mostly choose high-confidence pixels in an effort to avoid erroneous pseudo-labels. However, high confidence does not guarantee correct pseudo-labels especially in the initial training iterations. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to reliably learn from pseudo-labels. First, we unify the predictions from a trained object detector and a semantic segmentation model to identify reliable pseudo-label pixels. Second, we assign different learning weights to pseudo-labeled pixels to avoid noisy training signals. To determine these weights, we first use the reliable pseudo-label pixels identified from the first step and labeled pixels to construct a prototype for each class. Then, the per-pixel weight is the structural similarity between the pixel and the prototype measured via rank-statistics similarity. This metric is robust to noise, making it better suited for comparing features from unlabeled images, particularly in the initial training phases where wrong pseudo labels are prone to occur. We show that our method can be easily integrated into four semi-supervised semantic segmentation frameworks, and improves them in both Cityscapes and Pascal VOC datasets.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text-guided image editing and generation methods have diverse real-world applications. However, text-guided infinite image synthesis faces several challenges. First, there is a lack of text-image paired datasets with high-resolution and contextual diversity. Second, expanding images based on text requires global coherence and rich local context understanding. Previous studies have mainly focused on limited categories, such as natural landscapes, and also required to train on high-resolution images with paired text. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) for both global coherence and local context understanding, without any high-resolution text-image paired training dataset. We train the diffusion model to expand an image conditioned on global and local captions generated from the LLM and visual feature. At the inference stage, given an image and a global caption, we use the LLM to generate a next local caption to expand the input image. Then, we expand the image using the global caption, generated local caption and the visual feature to consider global consistency and spatial local context. In experiments, our model outperforms the baselines both quantitatively and qualitatively. Furthermore, our model demonstrates the capability of text-guided arbitrary-sized image generation in zero-shot manner with LLM guidance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable progress in language understanding and generation, their training efficiency has become a critical concern. Traditionally, LLMs are trained to predict the next token in a sequence. Despite the success of token-level training, it suffers from considerable computational costs due to the need to process an extensive number of tokens. To mitigate this issue, this paper introduces patch-level training for LLMs, which reduces the sequence length by compressing multiple tokens into a single patch. During patch-level training, we feed the language model shorter sequences of patches and train it to predict the next patch, thereby processing the majority of the training data at a significantly reduced computational cost. Following this, the model continues token-level training on the remaining training data to align with the inference mode. Experiments on a diverse range of models (370M-2.7B parameters) demonstrate that patch-level training can reduce overall computational costs to 0.5$\times$, without compromising the model performance compared to token-level training.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>3D surface reconstruction from images is essential for numerous applications. Recently, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have emerged as a promising framework for 3D modeling. However, NeRFs require accurate camera poses as input, and existing methods struggle to handle significantly noisy pose estimates (i.e., outliers), which are commonly encountered in real-world scenarios. To tackle this challenge, we present a novel approach that optimizes radiance fields with scene graphs to mitigate the influence of outlier poses. Our method incorporates an adaptive inlier-outlier confidence estimation scheme based on scene graphs, emphasizing images of high compatibility with the neighborhood and consistency in the rendering quality. We also introduce an effective intersection-over-union (IoU) loss to optimize the camera pose and surface geometry, together with a coarse-to-fine strategy to facilitate the training. Furthermore, we propose a new dataset containing typical outlier poses for a detailed evaluation. Experimental results on various datasets consistently demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method over existing approaches, showcasing its robustness in handling outliers and producing high-quality 3D reconstructions.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep learning holds immense promise for aiding radiologists in breast cancer detection. However, achieving optimal model performance is hampered by limitations in availability and sharing of data commonly associated to patient privacy concerns. Such concerns are further exacerbated, as traditional deep learning models can inadvertently leak sensitive training information. This work addresses these challenges exploring and quantifying the utility of privacy-preserving deep learning techniques, concretely, (i) differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) and (ii) fully synthetic training data generated by our proposed malignancy-conditioned generative adversarial network. We assess these methods via downstream malignancy classification of mammography masses using a transformer model. Our experimental results depict that synthetic data augmentation can improve privacy-utility tradeoffs in differentially private model training. Further, model pretraining on synthetic data achieves remarkable performance, which can be further increased with DP-SGD fine-tuning across all privacy guarantees. With this first in-depth exploration of privacy-preserving deep learning in breast imaging, we address current and emerging clinical privacy requirements and pave the way towards the adoption of private high-utility deep diagnostic models.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models have been demonstrated as strong priors for solving general inverse problems. Most existing Diffusion model-based Inverse Problem Solvers (DIS) employ a plug-and-play approach to guide the sampling trajectory with either projections or gradients. Though effective, these methods generally necessitate hundreds of sampling steps, posing a dilemma between inference time and reconstruction quality. In this work, we try to push the boundary of inference steps to 1-2 NFEs while still maintaining high reconstruction quality. To achieve this, we propose to leverage a pretrained distillation of diffusion model, namely consistency model, as the data prior. The key to achieving few-step guidance is to enforce two types of constraints during the sampling process of the consistency model: soft measurement constraint with ControlNet and hard measurement constraint via optimization. Supporting both single-step reconstruction and multistep refinement, the proposed framework further provides a way to trade image quality with additional computational cost. Within comparable NFEs, our method achieves new state-of-the-art in diffusion-based inverse problem solving, showcasing the significant potential of employing prior-based inverse problem solvers for real-world applications.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) process can incur defects due to melt pool instabilities, spattering, temperature increase, and powder spread anomalies. Identifying defects through in-situ monitoring typically requires collecting, storing, and analyzing large amounts of data generated. The first goal of this work is to propose a new approach to accurately map in-situ data to a three-dimensional (3D) geometry, aiming to reduce the amount of storage. The second goal of this work is to introduce several new IR features for defect detection or process model calibration, which include laser scan order, local preheat temperature, maximum pre-laser scanning temperature, and number of spatters generated locally and their landing locations. For completeness, processing of other common IR features, such as interpass temperature, heat intensity, cooling rates, and melt pool area, are also presented with the underlying algorithm and Python implementation. A number of different parts are printed, monitored, and characterized to provide evidence of process defects and anomalies that different IR features are capable of detecting.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Due to the fascinating generative performance of text-to-image diffusion models, growing text-to-3D generation works explore distilling the 2D generative priors into 3D, using the score distillation sampling (SDS) loss, to bypass the data scarcity problem. The existing text-to-3D methods have achieved promising results in realism and 3D consistency, but text-to-4D generation still faces challenges, including lack of realism and insufficient dynamic motions. In this paper, we propose a novel method for text-to-4D generation, which ensures the dynamic amplitude and authenticity through direct supervision provided by a video prior. Specifically, we adopt a text-to-video diffusion model to generate a reference video and divide 4D generation into two stages: static generation and dynamic generation. The static 3D generation is achieved under the guidance of the input text and the first frame of the reference video, while in the dynamic generation stage, we introduce a customized SDS loss to ensure multi-view consistency, a video-based SDS loss to improve temporal consistency, and most importantly, direct priors from the reference video to ensure the quality of geometry and texture. Moreover, we design a prior-switching training strategy to avoid conflicts between different priors and fully leverage the benefits of each prior. In addition, to enrich the generated motion, we further introduce a dynamic modeling representation composed of a deformation network and a topology network, which ensures dynamic continuity while modeling topological changes. Our method not only supports text-to-4D generation but also enables 4D generation from monocular videos. The comparison experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to existing methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The medium-density parity-check (MDPC) code-based McEliece cryptosystem remains a finalist of the post-quantum cryptography standard. The Min-sum decoding algorithm achieves better performance-complexity tradeoff than other algorithms for MDPC codes. However, the prior Min-sum MDPC decoder requires large memories, whose complexity dominates the overall complexity. Besides, its actual achievable parallelism is limited. This paper has four contributions: For the first time, the row-layered scheduling scheme is exploited to substantially reduce the memory requirement of MDPC decoders; A low-complexity scheme is developed to mitigate the performance loss caused by finite precision representation of the messages and high column weights of MDPC codes in row-layered decoding; Constraints are added to the parity check matrix construction to enable effective parallel processing with negligible impacts on the decoder performance and resilience towards attacks; A novel parity check matrix division scheme for highly efficient parallel processing is proposed and the corresponding parallel row-layered decoder architecture is designed. The number of clock cycles for each decoding iteration is reduced by a factor of L using the proposed L-parallel decoder with very small memory overhead. For an example 2-parallel decoder, the proposed design leads to 26% less memory requirement and 70% latency reduction compared to the prior decoder.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>High resolution micro-ultrasound has demonstrated promise in real-time prostate cancer detection, with deep learning becoming a prominent tool for learning complex tissue properties reflected on ultrasound. However, a significant roadblock to real-world deployment remains, which prior works often overlook: model performance suffers when applied to data from different clinical centers due to variations in data distribution. This distribution shift significantly impacts the model's robustness, posing major challenge to clinical deployment. Domain adaptation and specifically its test-time adaption (TTA) variant offer a promising solution to address this challenge. In a setting designed to reflect real-world conditions, we compare existing methods to state-of-the-art TTA approaches adopted for cancer detection, demonstrating the lack of robustness to distribution shifts in the former. We then propose Diverse Ensemble Entropy Minimization (DEnEM), questioning the effectiveness of current TTA methods on ultrasound data. We show that these methods, although outperforming baselines, are suboptimal due to relying on neural networks output probabilities, which could be uncalibrated, or relying on data augmentation, which is not straightforward to define on ultrasound data. Our results show a significant improvement of $5\%$ to $7\%$ in AUROC over the existing methods and $3\%$ to $5\%$ over TTA methods, demonstrating the advantage of DEnEM in addressing distribution shift. \keywords{Ultrasound Imaging \and Prostate Cancer \and Computer-aided Diagnosis \and Distribution Shift Robustness \and Test-time Adaptation.}</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Montgomery modular multiplication is widely-used in public key cryptosystems (PKC) and affects the efficiency of upper systems directly. However, modulus is getting larger due to the increasing demand of security, which results in a heavy computing cost. High-performance implementation of Montgomery modular multiplication is urgently required to ensure the highly-efficient operations in PKC. However, existing high-speed implementations still need a large amount redundant computing to simplify the intermediate result. Supports to the redundant representation is extremely limited on Montgomery modular multiplication. In this paper, we propose an efficient parallel variant of iterative Montgomery modular multiplication, called DRMMM, that allows the quotient can be computed in multiple iterations. In this variant, terms in intermediate result and the quotient in each iteration are computed in different radix such that computation of the quotient can be pipelined. Based on proposed variant, we also design high-performance hardware implementation architecture for faster operation. In the architecture, intermediate result in every iteration is denoted as three parts to free from redundant computations. Finally, to support FPGA-based systems, we design operators based on FPGA underlying architecture for better area-time performance. The result of implementation and experiment shows that our method reduces the output latency by 38.3\% than the fastest design on FPGA.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Latest advances have achieved realistic virtual try-on (VTON) through localized garment inpainting using latent diffusion models, significantly enhancing consumers' online shopping experience. However, existing VTON technologies neglect the need for merchants to showcase garments comprehensively, including flexible control over garments, optional faces, poses, and scenes. To address this issue, we define a virtual dressing (VD) task focused on generating freely editable human images with fixed garments and optional conditions. Meanwhile, we design a comprehensive affinity metric index (CAMI) to evaluate the consistency between generated images and reference garments. Then, we propose IMAGDressing-v1, which incorporates a garment UNet that captures semantic features from CLIP and texture features from VAE. We present a hybrid attention module, including a frozen self-attention and a trainable cross-attention, to integrate garment features from the garment UNet into a frozen denoising UNet, ensuring users can control different scenes through text. IMAGDressing-v1 can be combined with other extension plugins, such as ControlNet and IP-Adapter, to enhance the diversity and controllability of generated images. Furthermore, to address the lack of data, we release the interactive garment pairing (IGPair) dataset, containing over 300,000 pairs of clothing and dressed images, and establish a standard pipeline for data assembly. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our IMAGDressing-v1 achieves state-of-the-art human image synthesis performance under various controlled conditions.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across various vision-language tasks. However, a generalist MLLM typically underperforms compared with a specialist MLLM on most VL tasks, which can be attributed to task interference. In this paper, we propose a mixture of multimodal experts (MoME) to mitigate task interference and obtain a generalist MLLM. Our MoME is composed of two key components, a mixture of vision experts (MoVE) and a mixture of language experts (MoLE). MoVE can adaptively modulate the features transformed from various vision encoders, and has a strong compatibility in transformation architecture. MoLE incorporates sparsely gated experts into LLMs to achieve painless improvements with roughly unchanged inference costs. In response to task interference, our MoME specializes in both vision and language modality to adapt to task discrepancies. Extensive experiments show that MoME significantly improves the performance of generalist MLLMs across various VL tasks. The source code is released at this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Learn-to-Defer is a paradigm that enables learning algorithms to work not in isolation but as a team with human experts. In this paradigm, we permit the system to defer a subset of its tasks to the expert. Although there are currently systems that follow this paradigm and are designed to optimize the accuracy of the final human-AI team, the general methodology for developing such systems under a set of constraints (e.g., algorithmic fairness, expert intervention budget, defer of anomaly, etc.) remains largely unexplored. In this paper, using a $d$-dimensional generalization to the fundamental lemma of Neyman and Pearson (d-GNP), we obtain the Bayes optimal solution for learn-to-defer systems under various constraints. Furthermore, we design a generalizable algorithm to estimate that solution and apply this algorithm to the COMPAS and ACSIncome datasets. Our algorithm shows improvements in terms of constraint violation over a set of baselines.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models excel in high-quality generation but suffer from slow inference due to iterative sampling. While recent methods have successfully transformed diffusion models into one-step generators, they neglect model size reduction, limiting their applicability in compute-constrained scenarios. This paper aims to develop small, efficient one-step diffusion models based on the powerful rectified flow framework, by exploring joint compression of inference steps and model size. The rectified flow framework trains one-step generative models using two operations, reflow and distillation. Compared with the original framework, squeezing the model size brings two new challenges: (1) the initialization mismatch between large teachers and small students during reflow; (2) the underperformance of naive distillation on small student models. To overcome these issues, we propose Annealing Reflow and Flow-Guided Distillation, which together comprise our SlimFlow framework. With our novel framework, we train a one-step diffusion model with an FID of 5.02 and 15.7M parameters, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art one-step diffusion model (FID=6.47, 19.4M parameters) on CIFAR10. On ImageNet 64$\times$64 and FFHQ 64$\times$64, our method yields small one-step diffusion models that are comparable to larger models, showcasing the effectiveness of our method in creating compact, efficient one-step diffusion models.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep learning-based semiconductor defect inspection has gained traction in recent years, offering a powerful and versatile approach that provides high accuracy, adaptability, and efficiency in detecting and classifying nano-scale defects. However, semiconductor manufacturing processes are continually evolving, leading to the emergence of new types of defects over time. This presents a significant challenge for conventional supervised defect detectors, as they may suffer from catastrophic forgetting when trained on new defect datasets, potentially compromising performance on previously learned tasks. An alternative approach involves the constant storage of previously trained datasets alongside pre-trained model versions, which can be utilized for (re-)training from scratch or fine-tuning whenever encountering a new defect dataset. However, adhering to such a storage template is impractical in terms of size, particularly when considering High-Volume Manufacturing (HVM). Additionally, semiconductor defect datasets, especially those encompassing stochastic defects, are often limited and expensive to obtain, thus lacking sufficient representation of the entire universal set of defectivity. This work introduces a task-agnostic, meta-learning approach aimed at addressing this challenge, which enables the incremental addition of new defect classes and scales to create a more robust and generalized model for semiconductor defect inspection. We have benchmarked our approach using real resist-wafer SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) datasets for two process steps, ADI and AEI, demonstrating its superior performance compared to conventional supervised training methods.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Elaborating a series of intermediate reasoning steps significantly improves the ability of large language models (LLMs) to solve complex problems, as such steps would evoke LLMs to think sequentially. However, human sarcasm understanding is often considered an intuitive and holistic cognitive process, in which various linguistic, contextual, and emotional cues are integrated to form a comprehensive understanding of the speaker's true intention, which is argued not be limited to a step-by-step reasoning process. To verify this argument, we introduce a new prompting framework called SarcasmCue, which contains four prompting strategies, $viz.$ chain of contradiction (CoC), graph of cues (GoC), bagging of cues (BoC) and tensor of cues (ToC), which elicits LLMs to detect human sarcasm by considering sequential and non-sequential prompting methods. Through a comprehensive empirical comparison on four benchmarking datasets, we show that the proposed four prompting methods outperforms standard IO prompting, CoT and ToT with a considerable margin, and non-sequential prompting generally outperforms sequential prompting.</li>

          NL2Contact: Natural Language Guided 3D Hand-Object Contact Modeling with Diffusion Model(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Modeling the physical contacts between the hand and object is standard for refining inaccurate hand poses and generating novel human grasp in 3D hand-object reconstruction. However, existing methods rely on geometric constraints that cannot be specified or controlled. This paper introduces a novel task of controllable 3D hand-object contact modeling with natural language descriptions. Challenges include i) the complexity of cross-modal modeling from language to contact, and ii) a lack of descriptive text for contact patterns. To address these issues, we propose NL2Contact, a model that generates controllable contacts by leveraging staged diffusion models. Given a language description of the hand and contact, NL2Contact generates realistic and faithful 3D hand-object contacts. To train the model, we build \textit{ContactDescribe}, the first dataset with hand-centered contact descriptions. It contains multi-level and diverse descriptions generated by large language models based on carefully designed prompts (e.g., grasp action, grasp type, contact location, free finger status). We show applications of our model to grasp pose optimization and novel human grasp generation, both based on a textual contact description.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (KVQA) tasks require answering questions about images using extensive background knowledge. Despite significant advancements, generative models often struggle with these tasks due to the limited integration of external knowledge. In this paper, we introduce EchoSight, a novel multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that enables large language models (LLMs) to answer visual questions requiring fine-grained encyclopedic knowledge. To strive for high-performing retrieval, EchoSight first searches wiki articles by using visual-only information, subsequently, these candidate articles are further reranked according to their relevance to the combined text-image query. This approach significantly improves the integration of multimodal knowledge, leading to enhanced retrieval outcomes and more accurate VQA responses. Our experimental results on the Encyclopedic VQA and InfoSeek datasets demonstrate that EchoSight establishes new state-of-the-art results in knowledge-based VQA, achieving an accuracy of 41.8% on Encyclopedic VQA and 31.3% on InfoSeek.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vision Transformers (ViTs) represent a groundbreaking shift in machine learning approaches to computer vision. Unlike traditional approaches, ViTs employ the self-attention mechanism, which has been widely used in natural language processing, to analyze image patches. Despite their advantages in modeling visual tasks, deploying ViTs on hardware platforms, notably Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), introduces considerable challenges. These challenges stem primarily from the non-linear calculations and high computational and memory demands of ViTs. This paper introduces CHOSEN, a software-hardware co-design framework to address these challenges and offer an automated framework for ViT deployment on the FPGAs in order to maximize performance. Our framework is built upon three fundamental contributions: multi-kernel design to maximize the bandwidth, mainly targeting benefits of multi DDR memory banks, approximate non-linear functions that exhibit minimal accuracy degradation, and efficient use of available logic blocks on the FPGA, and efficient compiler to maximize the performance and memory-efficiency of the computing kernels by presenting a novel algorithm for design space exploration to find optimal hardware configuration that achieves optimal throughput and latency. Compared to the state-of-the-art ViT accelerators, CHOSEN achieves a 1.5x and 1.42x improvement in the throughput on the DeiT-S and DeiT-B models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose GroundUp, the first sketch-based ideation tool for 3D city massing of urban areas. We focus on early-stage urban design, where sketching is a common tool and the design starts from balancing building volumes (masses) and open spaces. With Human-Centered AI in mind, we aim to help architects quickly revise their ideas by easily switching between 2D sketches and 3D models, allowing for smoother iteration and sharing of ideas. Inspired by feedback from architects and existing workflows, our system takes as a first input a user sketch of multiple buildings in a top-down view. The user then draws a perspective sketch of the envisioned site. Our method is designed to exploit the complementarity of information in the two sketches and allows users to quickly preview and adjust the inferred 3D shapes. Our model has two main components. First, we propose a novel sketch-to-depth prediction network for perspective sketches that exploits top-down sketch shapes. Second, we use depth cues derived from the perspective sketch as a condition to our diffusion model, which ultimately completes the geometry in a top-down view. Thus, our final 3D geometry is represented as a heightfield, allowing users to construct the city `from the ground up'.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Predicting hospital length of stay (LOS) reliably is an essential need for efficient resource allocation at hospitals. Traditional predictive modeling tools frequently have difficulty acquiring sufficient and diverse data because healthcare institutions have privacy rules in place. In our study, we modeled this problem as an empirical graph where nodes are the hospitals. This modeling approach facilitates collaborative model training by modeling decentralized data sources from different hospitals without extracting sensitive data outside of hospitals. A local model is trained on a node (hospital) by aiming the generalized total variation minimization (GTVMin). Moreover, we implemented and compared two different federated learning optimization algorithms named federated stochastic gradient descent (FedSGD) and federated averaging (FedAVG). Our results show that federated learning enables accurate prediction of hospital LOS while addressing privacy concerns without extracting data outside healthcare institutions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vision Transformers (ViT) have emerged as the de-facto choice for numerous industry grade vision solutions. But their inference cost can be prohibitive for many settings, as they compute self-attention in each layer which suffers from quadratic computational complexity in the number of tokens. On the other hand, spatial information in images and spatio-temporal information in videos is usually sparse and redundant. In this work, we introduce LookupViT, that aims to exploit this information sparsity to reduce ViT inference cost. LookupViT provides a novel general purpose vision transformer block that operates by compressing information from higher resolution tokens to a fixed number of tokens. These few compressed tokens undergo meticulous processing, while the higher-resolution tokens are passed through computationally cheaper layers. Information sharing between these two token sets is enabled through a bidirectional cross-attention mechanism. The approach offers multiple advantages - (a) easy to implement on standard ML accelerators (GPUs/TPUs) via standard high-level operators, (b) applicable to standard ViT and its variants, thus generalizes to various tasks, (c) can handle different tokenization and attention approaches. LookupViT also offers flexibility for the compressed tokens, enabling performance-computation trade-offs in a single trained model. We show LookupViT's effectiveness on multiple domains - (a) for image-classification (ImageNet-1K and ImageNet-21K), (b) video classification (Kinetics400 and Something-Something V2), (c) image captioning (COCO-Captions) with a frozen encoder. LookupViT provides $2\times$ reduction in FLOPs while upholding or improving accuracy across these domains. In addition, LookupViT also demonstrates out-of-the-box robustness and generalization on image classification (ImageNet-C,R,A,O), improving by up to $4\%$ over ViT.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Unsupervised visible infrared person re-identification (USVI-ReID) is a challenging retrieval task that aims to retrieve cross-modality pedestrian images without using any label information. In this task, the large cross-modality variance makes it difficult to generate reliable cross-modality labels, and the lack of annotations also provides additional difficulties for learning modality-invariant features. In this paper, we first deduce an optimization objective for unsupervised VI-ReID based on the mutual information between the model's cross-modality input and output. With equivalent derivation, three learning principles, i.e., "Sharpness" (entropy minimization), "Fairness" (uniform label distribution), and "Fitness" (reliable cross-modality matching) are obtained. Under their guidance, we design a loop iterative training strategy alternating between model training and cross-modality matching. In the matching stage, a uniform prior guided optimal transport assignment ("Fitness", "Fairness") is proposed to select matched visible and infrared prototypes. In the training stage, we utilize this matching information to introduce prototype-based contrastive learning for minimizing the intra- and cross-modality entropy ("Sharpness"). Extensive experimental results on benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, e.g., 60.6% and 90.3% of Rank-1 accuracy on SYSU-MM01 and RegDB without any annotations.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The interpretability of random forest (RF) models is a research topic of growing interest in the machine learning (ML) community. In the state of the art, RF is considered a powerful learning ensemble given its predictive performance, flexibility, and ease of use. Furthermore, the inner process of the RF model is understandable because it uses an intuitive and intelligible approach for building the RF decision tree ensemble. However, the RF resulting model is regarded as a "black box" because of its numerous deep decision trees. Gaining visibility over the entire process that induces the final decisions by exploring each decision tree is complicated, if not impossible. This complexity limits the acceptance and implementation of RF models in several fields of application. Several papers have tackled the interpretation of RF models. This paper aims to provide an extensive review of methods used in the literature to interpret RF resulting models. We have analyzed these methods and classified them based on different axes. Although this review is not exhaustive, it provides a taxonomy of various techniques that should guide users in choosing the most appropriate tools for interpreting RF models, depending on the interpretability aspects sought. It should also be valuable for researchers who aim to focus their work on the interpretability of RF or ML black boxes in general.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated learning has recently garnered significant attention, especially within the domain of supervised learning. However, despite the abundance of unlabeled data on end-users, unsupervised learning problems such as clustering in the federated setting remain underexplored. In this paper, we investigate the federated clustering problem, with a focus on federated k-means. We outline the challenge posed by its non-convex objective and data heterogeneity in the federated framework. To tackle these challenges, we adopt a new perspective by studying the structures of local solutions in k-means and propose a one-shot algorithm called FeCA (Federated Centroid Aggregation). FeCA adaptively refines local solutions on clients, then aggregates these refined solutions to recover the global solution of the entire dataset in a single round. We empirically demonstrate the robustness of FeCA under various federated scenarios on both synthetic and real-world data. Additionally, we extend FeCA to representation learning and present DeepFeCA, which combines DeepCluster and FeCA for unsupervised feature learning in the federated setting.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Modern text-to-video synthesis models demonstrate coherent, photorealistic generation of complex videos from a text description. However, most existing models lack fine-grained control over camera movement, which is critical for downstream applications related to content creation, visual effects, and 3D vision. Recently, new methods demonstrate the ability to generate videos with controllable camera poses these techniques leverage pre-trained U-Net-based diffusion models that explicitly disentangle spatial and temporal generation. Still, no existing approach enables camera control for new, transformer-based video diffusion models that process spatial and temporal information jointly. Here, we propose to tame video transformers for 3D camera control using a ControlNet-like conditioning mechanism that incorporates spatiotemporal camera embeddings based on Plucker coordinates. The approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance for controllable video generation after fine-tuning on the RealEstate10K dataset. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to enable camera control for transformer-based video diffusion models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Domain adversarial training has shown its effective capability for finding domain invariant feature representations and been successfully adopted for various domain adaptation tasks. However, recent advances of large models (e.g., vision transformers) and emerging of complex adaptation scenarios (e.g., DomainNet) make adversarial training being easily biased towards source domain and hardly adapted to target domain. The reason is twofold: relying on large amount of labelled data from source domain for large model training and lacking of labelled data from target domain for fine-tuning. Existing approaches widely focused on either enhancing discriminator or improving the training stability for the backbone networks. Due to unbalanced competition between the feature extractor and the discriminator during the adversarial training, existing solutions fail to function well on complex datasets. To address this issue, we proposed a novel contrastive adversarial training (CAT) approach that leverages the labeled source domain samples to reinforce and regulate the feature generation for target domain. Typically, the regulation forces the target feature distribution being similar to the source feature distribution. CAT addressed three major challenges in adversarial learning: 1) ensure the feature distributions from two domains as indistinguishable as possible for the discriminator, resulting in a more robust domain-invariant feature generation; 2) encourage target samples moving closer to the source in the feature space, reducing the requirement for generalizing classifier trained on the labeled source domain to unlabeled target domain; 3) avoid directly aligning unpaired source and target samples within mini-batch. CAT can be easily plugged into existing models and exhibits significant performance improvements.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce a novel Stylized Motion Diffusion model, dubbed SMooDi, to generate stylized motion driven by content texts and style motion sequences. Unlike existing methods that either generate motion of various content or transfer style from one sequence to another, SMooDi can rapidly generate motion across a broad range of content and diverse styles. To this end, we tailor a pre-trained text-to-motion model for stylization. Specifically, we propose style guidance to ensure that the generated motion closely matches the reference style, alongside a lightweight style adaptor that directs the motion towards the desired style while ensuring realism. Experiments across various applications demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms existing methods in stylized motion generation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, steal</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>LLM agents have demonstrated remarkable performance across various applications, primarily due to their advanced capabilities in reasoning, utilizing external knowledge and tools, calling APIs, and executing actions to interact with environments. Current agents typically utilize a memory module or a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mechanism, retrieving past knowledge and instances with similar embeddings from knowledge bases to inform task planning and execution. However, the reliance on unverified knowledge bases raises significant concerns about their safety and trustworthiness. To uncover such vulnerabilities, we propose a novel red teaming approach AgentPoison, the first backdoor attack targeting generic and RAG-based LLM agents by poisoning their long-term memory or RAG knowledge base. In particular, we form the trigger generation process as a constrained optimization to optimize backdoor triggers by mapping the triggered instances to a unique embedding space, so as to ensure that whenever a user instruction contains the optimized backdoor trigger, the malicious demonstrations are retrieved from the poisoned memory or knowledge base with high probability. In the meantime, benign instructions without the trigger will still maintain normal performance. Unlike conventional backdoor attacks, AgentPoison requires no additional model training or fine-tuning, and the optimized backdoor trigger exhibits superior transferability, in-context coherence, and stealthiness. Extensive experiments demonstrate AgentPoison's effectiveness in attacking three types of real-world LLM agents: RAG-based autonomous driving agent, knowledge-intensive QA agent, and healthcare EHRAgent. On each agent, AgentPoison achieves an average attack success rate higher than 80% with minimal impact on benign performance (less than 1%) with a poison rate less than 0.1%.</li>
