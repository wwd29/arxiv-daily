<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Neural architecture search (NAS) traditionally requires significant human expertise or automated trial-and-error to design deep learning models. We present NN-Caption, an LLM-guided neural architecture search pipeline that generates runnable image-captioning models by composing CNN encoders from LEMUR's classification backbones with sequence decoders (LSTM/GRU/Transformer) under a strict Net API. Using DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B as the primary generator, we present the prompt template and examples of generated architectures. We evaluate on MS COCO with BLEU-4. The LLM generated dozens of captioning models, with over half successfully trained and producing meaningful captions. We analyse the outcomes of using different numbers of input model snippets (5 vs. 10) in the prompt, finding a slight drop in success rate when providing more candidate components. We also report training dynamics (caption accuracy vs. epochs) and the highest BLEU-4 attained. Our results highlight the promise of LLM-guided NAS: the LLM not only proposes architectures but also suggests hyperparameters and training practices. We identify the challenges encountered (e.g., code hallucinations or API compliance issues) and detail how prompt rules and iterative code fixes addressed them. This work presents a pipeline that integrates prompt-based code generation with automatic evaluation, and adds dozens of novel captioning models to the open LEMUR dataset to facilitate reproducible benchmarking and downstream AutoML research.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Remotely detecting and classifying underwater acoustic targets is critical for environmental monitoring and defence. However, the complex nature of ship-radiated and environmental underwater noise poses significant challenges to accurate signal processing. While recent advancements in machine learning have improved classification accuracy, issues such as limited dataset availability and a lack of standardised experimentation hinder generalisation and robustness. This paper introduces GSE ResNeXt, a deep learning architecture integrating learnable Gabor convolutional layers with a ResNeXt backbone enhanced by squeeze-and-excitation attention mechanisms. The Gabor filters serve as two-dimensional adaptive band-pass filters, extending the feature channel representation. Its combination with channel attention improves training stability and convergence while enhancing the model's ability to extract discriminative features. The model is evaluated on three classification tasks of increasing complexity. In particular, the impact of temporal differences between the training and testing data is explored, revealing that the distance between the vessel and sensor significantly affects performance. Results show that, GSE ResNeXt consistently outperforms baseline models like Xception, ResNet, and MobileNetV2, in terms of classification performance. Regarding stability and convergence, the addition of Gabor convolutions in the initial layers of the model represents a 28% reduction in training time. These results emphasise the importance of signal processing strategies in improving the reliability and generalisation of models under different environmental conditions, especially in data-limited underwater acoustic classification scenarios. Future developments should focus on mitigating the impact of environmental factors on input signals.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>defense, robust, transformer, generative, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Hard-to-detect hardware bit flips, from either malicious circuitry or bugs, have already been shown to make transformers vulnerable in non-generative tasks. This work, for the first time, investigates how low-level, bitwise perturbations (fault injection) to the weights of a large language model (LLM) used for image captioning can influence the semantic meaning of its generated descriptions while preserving grammatical structure. While prior fault analysis methods have shown that flipping a few bits can crash classifiers or degrade accuracy, these approaches overlook the semantic and linguistic dimensions of generative systems. In image captioning models, a single flipped bit might subtly alter how visual features map to words, shifting the entire narrative an AI tells about the world. We hypothesize that such semantic drifts are not random but differentiably estimable. That is, the model's own gradients can predict which bits, if perturbed, will most strongly influence meaning while leaving syntax and fluency intact. We design a differentiable fault analysis framework, BLADE (Bit-level Fault Analysis via Differentiable Estimation), that uses gradient-based sensitivity estimation to locate semantically critical bits and then refines their selection through a caption-level semantic-fluency objective. Our goal is not merely to corrupt captions, but to understand how meaning itself is encoded, distributed, and alterable at the bit level, revealing that even imperceptible low-level changes can steer the high-level semantics of generative vision-language models. It also opens pathways for robustness testing, adversarial defense, and explainable AI, by exposing how structured bit-level faults can reshape a model's semantic output.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid adoption of large language models in financial services necessitates rigorous evaluation frameworks to assess their performance, efficiency, and practical applicability. This paper conducts a comprehensive evaluation of the GPT-OSS model family alongside contemporary LLMs across ten diverse financial NLP tasks. Through extensive experimentation on 120B and 20B parameter variants of GPT-OSS, we reveal a counterintuitive finding: the smaller GPT-OSS-20B model achieves comparable accuracy (65.1% vs 66.5%) while demonstrating superior computational efficiency with 198.4 Token Efficiency Score and 159.80 tokens per second processing speed [1]. Our evaluation encompasses sentiment analysis, question answering, and entity recognition tasks using real-world financial datasets including Financial PhraseBank, FiQA-SA, and FLARE FINERORD. We introduce novel efficiency metrics that capture the trade-off between model performance and resource utilization, providing critical insights for deployment decisions in production environments. The benchmark reveals that GPT-OSS models consistently outperform larger competitors including Qwen3-235B, challenging the prevailing assumption that model scale directly correlates with task performance [2]. Our findings demonstrate that architectural innovations and training strategies in GPT-OSS enable smaller models to achieve competitive performance with significantly reduced computational overhead, offering a pathway toward sustainable and cost-effective deployment of LLMs in financial applications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, extraction, interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Small language models (SLMs) are widely used in tasks that require low latency and lightweight deployment, particularly classification. As interpretability and robustness gain increasing importance, explanation-guided learning has emerged as an effective framework by introducing attribution-based supervision during training; however, deriving general and reliable attribution priors remains a significant challenge. Through an analysis of representative attribution methods in classification settings, we find that although these methods can reliably highlight class-relevant tokens, they often focus on common keywords shared by semantically similar classes. Because such classes are already difficult to distinguish under standard training, these attributions provide insufficient discriminative cues, limiting their ability to improve model differentiation. To overcome this limitation, we propose Class-Aware Attribution Prior (CAP), a novel attribution prior extraction framework that guides language models toward capturing fine-grained class distinctions and producing more salient, discriminative attribution priors. Building on this idea, we further introduce CAP Hybrid, which combines priors from CAP with those from existing attribution techniques to form a more comprehensive and balanced supervisory signal. By aligning a model's self-attribution with these enriched priors, our approach encourages the learning of diverse, decision-relevant features. Extensive experiments in full-data, few-shot, and adversarial scenarios demonstrate that our method consistently enhances both interpretability and robustness.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, protect, extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The generation of synthetic data is a promising technology to make medical data available for secondary use in a privacy-compliant manner. A popular method for creating realistic patient data is the rule-based Synthea data generator. Synthea generates data based on rules describing the lifetime of a synthetic patient. These rules typically express the probability of a condition occurring, such as a disease, depending on factors like age. Since they only contain statistical information, rules usually have no specific data protection requirements. However, creating meaningful rules can be a very complex process that requires expert knowledge and realistic sample data. In this paper, we introduce and evaluate an approach to automatically generate Synthea rules based on statistics from tabular data, which we extracted from cancer reports. As an example use case, we created a Synthea module for glioblastoma from a real-world dataset and used it to generate a synthetic dataset. Compared to the original dataset, the synthetic data reproduced known disease courses and mostly retained the statistical properties. Overall, synthetic patient data holds great potential for privacy-preserving research. The data can be used to formulate hypotheses and to develop prototypes, but medical interpretation should consider the specific limitations as with any currently available approach.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>At NeurIPS 2024, Kera et al. introduced the use of transformers for computing Groebner bases, a central object in computer algebra with numerous practical applications. In this paper, we improve this approach by applying Hierarchical Attention Transformers (HATs) to solve systems of multivariate polynomial equations via Groebner bases computation. The HAT architecture incorporates a tree-structured inductive bias that enables the modeling of hierarchical relationships present in the data and thus achieves significant computational savings compared to conventional flat attention models. We generalize to arbitrary depths and include a detailed computational cost analysis. Combined with curriculum learning, our method solves instances that are much larger than those in Kera et al.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Urban wind flow modeling and simulation play an important role in air quality assessment and sustainable city planning. A key challenge for modeling and simulation is handling the complex geometries of the urban landscape. Low order models are limited in capturing the effects of geometry, while high-fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are prohibitively expensive, especially across multiple geometries or wind conditions. Here, we propose a generative diffusion framework for synthesizing steady-state urban wind fields over unstructured meshes that requires only geometry information. The framework combines a hierarchical graph neural network with score-based diffusion modeling to generate accurate and diverse velocity fields without requiring temporal rollouts or dense measurements. Trained across multiple mesh slices and wind angles, the model generalizes to unseen geometries, recovers key flow structures such as wakes and recirculation zones, and offers uncertainty-aware predictions. Ablation studies confirm robustness to mesh variation and performance under different inference regimes. This work develops is the first step towards foundation models for the built environment that can help urban planners rapidly evaluate design decisions under densification and climate uncertainty.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Offline reinforcement learning enables policy learning from pre-collected datasets without environment interaction, but existing Decision Transformer (DT) architectures struggle with long-horizon credit assignment and complex state-action dependencies. We introduce the Quantum Decision Transformer (QDT), a novel architecture incorporating quantum-inspired computational mechanisms to address these challenges. Our approach integrates two core components: Quantum-Inspired Attention with entanglement operations that capture non-local feature correlations, and Quantum Feedforward Networks with multi-path processing and learnable interference for adaptive computation. Through comprehensive experiments on continuous control tasks, we demonstrate over 2,000\% performance improvement compared to standard DTs, with superior generalization across varying data qualities. Critically, our ablation studies reveal strong synergistic effects between quantum-inspired components: neither alone achieves competitive performance, yet their combination produces dramatic improvements far exceeding individual contributions. This synergy demonstrates that effective quantum-inspired architecture design requires holistic co-design of interdependent mechanisms rather than modular component adoption. Our analysis identifies three key computational advantages: enhanced credit assignment through non-local correlations, implicit ensemble behavior via parallel processing, and adaptive resource allocation through learnable interference. These findings establish quantum-inspired design principles as a promising direction for advancing transformer architectures in sequential decision-making, with implications extending beyond reinforcement learning to neural architecture design more broadly.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Refined trajectory inference of urban rail transit is of great significance to the operation organization. In this paper, we develop a fully data-driven approach to inferring individual travel trajectories in urban rail transit systems. It utilizes data from the Automatic Fare Collection (AFC) and Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) systems to infer key trajectory elements, such as selected train, access/egress time, and transfer time. The approach includes establishing train alternative sets based on spatio-temporal constraints, data-driven adaptive trajectory inference, and trave l trajectory construction. To realize data-driven adaptive trajectory inference, a data-driven parameter estimation method based on KL divergence combined with EM algorithm (KLEM) was proposed. This method eliminates the reliance on external or survey data for parameter fitting, enhancing the robustness and applicability of the model. Furthermore, to overcome the limitations of using synthetic data to validate the result, this paper employs real individual travel trajectory data for verification. The results show that the approach developed in this paper can achieve high-precision passenger trajectory inference, with an accuracy rate of over 90% in urban rail transit travel trajectory inference during peak hours.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Incidental findings in CT scans, though often benign, can have significant clinical implications and should be reported following established guidelines. Traditional manual inspection by radiologists is time-consuming and variable. This paper proposes a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) and foundational vision-language models (VLMs) in a plan-and-execute agentic approach to improve the efficiency and precision of incidental findings detection, classification, and reporting for abdominal CT scans. Given medical guidelines for abdominal organs, the process of managing incidental findings is automated through a planner-executor framework. The planner, based on LLM, generates Python scripts using predefined base functions, while the executor runs these scripts to perform the necessary checks and detections, via VLMs, segmentation models, and image processing subroutines. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on a CT abdominal benchmark for three organs, in a fully automatic end-to-end manner. Our results show that the proposed framework outperforms existing pure VLM-based approaches in terms of accuracy and efficiency.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, privacy, protect</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Existing agent communication frameworks face critical limitations in providing verifiable audit trails without compromising the privacy and confidentiality of agent interactions. The protection of agent communication privacy while ensuring auditability emerges as a fundamental challenge for applications requiring accurate billing, compliance verification, and accountability in regulated environments. We introduce a framework for auditing agent communications that keeps messages private while still checking they follow expected rules. It pairs zero-knowledge proofs with the existing Model Context Protocol (MCP) so messages can be verified without revealing their contents. The approach runs in lightweight networks, stays compatible with standard MCP exchanges, and adds asynchronous audit verification to confirm format and general message types without exposing specifics. The framework enables mutual audits between agents: one side can check communication content and quality while the other verifies usage metrics, all without revealing sensitive information. We formalize security goals and show that zk-MCP provides data authenticity and communication privacy, achieving efficient verification with negligible latency overhead. We fully implement the framework, including Circom-based zero-knowledge proof generation and an audit protocol integrated with MCP's bidirectional channel, and, to our knowledge, this is the first privacy-preserving audit system for agent communications that offers verifiable mutual auditing without exposing message content or compromising agent privacy.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>defense, attack, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Backdoor attacks embed malicious behaviors into Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling adversaries to trigger harmful outputs or bypass safety controls. However, the persistence of the implanted backdoors under user-driven post-deployment continual fine-tuning has been rarely examined. Most prior works evaluate the effectiveness and generalization of implanted backdoors only at releasing and empirical evidence shows that naively injected backdoor persistence degrades after updates. In this work, we study whether and how implanted backdoors persist through a multi-stage post-deployment fine-tuning. We propose P-Trojan, a trigger-based attack algorithm that explicitly optimizes for backdoor persistence across repeated updates. By aligning poisoned gradients with those of clean tasks on token embeddings, the implanted backdoor mapping is less likely to be suppressed or forgotten during subsequent updates. Theoretical analysis shows the feasibility of such persistent backdoor attacks after continual fine-tuning. And experiments conducted on the Qwen2.5 and LLaMA3 families of LLMs, as well as diverse task sequences, demonstrate that P-Trojan achieves over 99% persistence while preserving clean-task accuracy. Our findings highlight the need for persistence-aware evaluation and stronger defenses in realistic model adaptation pipelines.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, defense, attack, robust, interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) enhance modularity and telemetry granularity but also widen the cybersecurity attack surface across disaggregated control, user and management planes. We propose a hierarchical defense framework with three coordinated layers-anomaly detection, intrusion confirmation, and multiattack classification-each aligned with O-RAN's telemetry stack. Our approach integrates hybrid quantum computing and machine learning, leveraging amplitude- and entanglement-based feature encodings with deep and ensemble classifiers. We conduct extensive benchmarking across synthetic and real-world telemetry, evaluating encoding depth, architectural variants, and diagnostic fidelity. The framework consistently achieves near-perfect accuracy, high recall, and strong class separability. Multi-faceted evaluation across decision boundaries, probabilistic margins, and latent space geometry confirms its interpretability, robustness, and readiness for slice-aware diagnostics and scalable deployment in near-RT and non-RT RIC domains.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Camera-equipped mobile devices, such as phones, smart glasses, and AR headsets, pose a privacy challenge for bystanders, who currently lack effective real-time mechanisms to control the capture of their picture, video, including their face. We present BlindSpot, an on-device system that enables bystanders to manage their own privacy by signaling their privacy preferences in real-time without previously sharing any sensitive information. Our main contribution is the design and comparative evaluation of three distinct signaling modalities: a hand gesture mechanism, a significantly improved visible light communication (VLC) protocol, and a novel ultra-wideband (UWB) communication protocol. For all these modalities, we also design a validation mechanism that uses geometric consistency checks to verify the origin of a signal relative to the sending bystander, and defend against impersonation attacks. We implement the complete system (BlindSpot) on a commodity smartphone and conduct a comprehensive evaluation of each modality's accuracy and latency across various distances, lighting conditions, and user movements. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of these novel bystander signaling techniques and their trade-offs in terms of system performance and convenience.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Safety and security are critical to the reliable operation of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). While existing research has identified correlations between the two domains, a theoretical framework to analyze their interaction mechanisms and guide co-design remains lacking. To address this gap, this paper proposes a copula-based joint safety-security analysis method to quantify their coupling effects. First, we formulate time-varying cyberattacks using dynamic risk functions derived from survival analysis, while modeling random hardware failures with the Weibull distribution, as per the automotive industry standard ISO 26262. Second, to capture the dependence between functional safety failures and cyber threats, we introduce a joint failure model based on copula theory, employing both elliptical (e.g., Gaussian) and Archimedean (e.g., Frank) copula families to construct a system-level failure function. Furthermore, we provide formal theoretical analysis of the dependence structure in the safety-security coupling, yielding three key insights: (1) a monotonic relationship between joint failure probability and dependence parameters, (2) the mechanisms of defensive response mechanisms (such as patch deployment) in mitigating joint failures, and (3) quantifying the dynamic coupling strength between safety and security under dependence structures. Through comprehensive simulations, we evaluate the sensitivity of the joint failure behavior to three critical factors: copula dependence parameters, security patch deployment timing, and Weibull distribution parameters. Our dynamic failure model further illustrates how cyberattacks affect safety failures and, conversely, how functional faults affect security failures under dependencies structures. This study provides a quantifiable theoretical foundation for the co-design of safety and security in CAVs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, attack, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Finetuning pretrained large language models (LLMs) has become the standard paradigm for developing downstream applications. However, its security implications remain unclear, particularly regarding whether finetuned LLMs inherit jailbreak vulnerabilities from their pretrained sources. We investigate this question in a realistic pretrain-to-finetune threat model, where the attacker has white-box access to the pretrained LLM and only black-box access to its finetuned derivatives. Empirical analysis shows that adversarial prompts optimized on the pretrained model transfer most effectively to its finetuned variants, revealing inherited vulnerabilities from pretrained to finetuned LLMs. To further examine this inheritance, we conduct representation-level probing, which shows that transferable prompts are linearly separable within the pretrained hidden states, suggesting that universal transferability is encoded in pretrained representations. Building on this insight, we propose the Probe-Guided Projection (PGP) attack, which steers optimization toward transferability-relevant directions. Experiments across multiple LLM families and diverse finetuned tasks confirm PGP's strong transfer success, underscoring the security risks inherent in the pretrain-to-finetune paradigm.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large-scale optical music recognition (OMR) research has focused mainly on Western staff notation, leaving Chinese Jianpu (numbered notation) and its rich lyric resources underexplored. We present a modular expert-system pipeline that converts printed Jianpu scores with lyrics into machine-readable MusicXML and MIDI, without requiring massive annotated training data. Our approach adopts a top-down expert-system design, leveraging traditional computer-vision techniques (e.g., phrase correlation, skeleton analysis) to capitalize on prior knowledge, while integrating unsupervised deep-learning modules for image feature embeddings. This hybrid strategy strikes a balance between interpretability and accuracy. Evaluated on The Anthology of Chinese Folk Songs, our system massively digitizes (i) a melody-only collection of more than 5,000 songs (> 300,000 notes) and (ii) a curated subset with lyrics comprising over 1,400 songs (> 100,000 notes). The system achieves high-precision recognition on both melody (note-wise F1 = 0.951) and aligned lyrics (character-wise F1 = 0.931).</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Underwater images are severely degraded by wavelength-dependent light absorption and scattering, resulting in color distortion, low contrast, and loss of fine details that hinder vision-based underwater applications. To address these challenges, we propose AquaDiff, a diffusion-based underwater image enhancement framework designed to correct chromatic distortions while preserving structural and perceptual fidelity. AquaDiff integrates a chromatic prior-guided color compensation strategy with a conditional diffusion process, where cross-attention dynamically fuses degraded inputs and noisy latent states at each denoising step. An enhanced denoising backbone with residual dense blocks and multi-resolution attention captures both global color context and local details. Furthermore, a novel cross-domain consistency loss jointly enforces pixel-level accuracy, perceptual similarity, structural integrity, and frequency-domain fidelity. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging underwater benchmarks demonstrate that AquaDiff provides good results as compared to the state-of-the-art traditional, CNN-, GAN-, and diffusion-based methods, achieving superior color correction and competitive overall image quality across diverse underwater conditions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, privacy, federate, fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging machine learning paradigm that enables multiple parties to collaboratively train models without sharing raw data, ensuring data privacy. In Vertical FL (VFL), where each party holds different features for the same users, a key challenge is to evaluate the feature contribution of each party before any model is trained, particularly in the early stages when no model exists. To address this, the Shapley-CMI method was recently proposed as a model-free, information-theoretic approach to feature valuation using Conditional Mutual Information (CMI). However, its original formulation did not provide a practical implementation capable of computing the required permutations and intersections securely. This paper presents a novel privacy-preserving implementation of Shapley-CMI for VFL. Our system introduces a private set intersection (PSI) server that performs all necessary feature permutations and computes encrypted intersection sizes across discretized and encrypted ID groups, without the need for raw data exchange. Each party then uses these intersection results to compute Shapley-CMI values, computing the marginal utility of their features. Initial experiments confirm the correctness and privacy of the proposed system, demonstrating its viability for secure and efficient feature contribution estimation in VFL. This approach ensures data confidentiality, scales across multiple parties, and enables fair data valuation without requiring the sharing of raw data or training models.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This study investigates the key skills and competencies needed by new cybersecurity graduates in the Philippines for entry-level positions. Using a descriptive cross-sectional research design, it combines analysis of job listings from Philippine online platforms with surveys of students, teachers, and professionals. The aim is to identify required skills and areas needing improvement, highlighting the balance between technical skills and other competencies like ethical conduct, suggesting a shift away from traditional cybersecurity skills towards a more diverse skillset. Furthermore, the results revealed common agreement on the importance of communication, critical thinking, problem-solving, and adaptability skills, albeit with slight variations in their prioritization. It recommends that aspiring cybersecurity professionals develop an inclusive skill set encompassing technical knowledge, soft skills, and personal competencies, with a focus on adaptability, continuous learning, and ethics. Skills such as business acumen are considered less vital for entry-level roles, proposing a preparation strategy that aligns with the changing demands of the cybersecurity industry.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, generative, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>OpenAI has recently argued that hallucinations in large language models result primarily from misaligned evaluation incentives that reward confident guessing rather than epistemic humility. On this view, hallucination is a contingent behavioral artifact, remediable through improved benchmarks and reward structures. In this paper, we challenge that interpretation. Drawing on previous work on structural hallucination and empirical experiments using a Licensing Oracle, we argue that hallucination is not an optimization failure but an architectural inevitability of the transformer model. Transformers do not represent the world; they model statistical associations among tokens. Their embedding spaces form a pseudo-ontology derived from linguistic co-occurrence rather than world-referential structure. At ontological boundary conditions - regions where training data is sparse or incoherent - the model necessarily interpolates fictional continuations in order to preserve coherence. No incentive mechanism can modify this structural dependence on pattern completion. Our empirical results demonstrate that hallucination can only be eliminated through external truth-validation and abstention modules, not through changes to incentives, prompting, or fine-tuning. The Licensing Oracle achieves perfect abstention precision across domains precisely because it supplies grounding that the transformer lacks. We conclude that hallucination is a structural property of generative architectures and that reliable AI requires hybrid systems that distinguish linguistic fluency from epistemic responsibility.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, security, defense, attack, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Traditional, centralized security tools often miss adaptive, multi-vector attacks. We present the Multi-Agent LLM Cyber Defense Framework (MALCDF), a practical setup where four large language model (LLM) agents-Detection, Intelligence, Response, and Analysis-work together in real time. Agents communicate over a Secure Communication Layer (SCL) with encrypted, ontology-aligned messages, and produce audit-friendly outputs (e.g., MITRE ATT&CK mappings). For evaluation, we keep the test simple and consistent: all reported metrics come from the same 50-record live stream derived from the CICIDS2017 feature schema. CICIDS2017 is used for configuration (fields/schema) and to train a practical ML baseline. The ML-IDS baseline is a Lightweight Random Forest IDS (LRF-IDS) trained on a subset of CICIDS2017 and tested on the 50-record stream, with no overlap between training and test records. In experiments, MALCDF reaches 90.0% detection accuracy, 85.7% F1-score, and 9.1% false-positive rate, with 6.8s average per-event latency. It outperforms the lightweight ML-IDS baseline and a single-LLM setup on accuracy while keeping end-to-end outputs consistent. Overall, this hands-on build suggests that coordinating simple LLM agents with secure, ontology-aligned messaging can improve practical, real-time cyber defense.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Agentic AI introduces security vulnerabilities that traditional LLM safeguards fail to address. Although recent work by Unit 42 at Palo Alto Networks demonstrated that ChatGPT-4o successfully executes attacks as an agent that it refuses in chat mode, there is no comparative analysis in multiple models and frameworks. We conducted the first systematic penetration testing and comparative evaluation of agentic AI systems, testing five prominent models (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash, GPT-4o, Grok 2, and Nova Pro) across two agentic AI frameworks (AutoGen and CrewAI) using a seven-agent architecture that mimics the functionality of a university information management system and 13 distinct attack scenarios that span prompt injection, Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF), SQL injection, and tool misuse. Our 130 total test cases reveal significant security disparities: AutoGen demonstrates a 52.3% refusal rate versus CrewAI's 30.8%, while model performance ranges from Nova Pro's 46.2% to Claude and Grok 2's 38.5%. Most critically, Grok 2 on CrewAI rejected only 2 of 13 attacks (15.4% refusal rate), and the overall refusal rate of 41.5% across all configurations indicates that more than half of malicious prompts succeeded despite enterprise-grade safety mechanisms. We identify six distinct defensive behavior patterns including a novel "hallucinated compliance" strategy where models fabricate outputs rather than executing or refusing attacks, and provide actionable recommendations for secure agent deployment. Complete attack prompts are also included in the Appendix to enable reproducibility.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) are rapidly improving, yet current Video Question Answering (VideoQA) benchmarks often allow questions to be answered from a single salient cue, under-testing reasoning that must aggregate multiple, temporally separated visual evidence. We present HERBench, a VideoQA benchmark purpose-built to assess multi-evidence integration across time. Each question requires aggregating at least three non-overlapping evidential cues across distinct video segments, so neither language priors nor a single snapshot can suffice. HERBench comprises 26K five-way multiple-choice questions organized into twelve compositional tasks that probe identity binding, cross-entity relations, temporal ordering, co-occurrence verification, and counting. To make evidential demand measurable, we introduce the Minimum Required Frame-Set (MRFS), the smallest number of frames a model must fuse to answer correctly, and show that HERBench imposes substantially higher demand than prior datasets (mean MRFS 5.5 vs. 2.6-4.2). Evaluating 13 state-of-the-art Video-LLMs on HERBench reveals pervasive failures: accuracies of 31-42% are only slightly above the 20% random-guess baseline. We disentangle this failure into two critical bottlenecks: (1) a retrieval deficit, where frame selectors overlook key evidence, and (2) a fusion deficit, where models fail to integrate information even when all necessary evidence is provided. By making cross-time evidence both unavoidable and quantifiable, HERBench establishes a principled target for advancing robust, compositional video understanding.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>biometric</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Fourier Analysis Network (FAN) was recently proposed as a simple way to improve neural network performance by replacing part of ReLU activations with sine and cosine functions. Although several studies have reported small but consistent gains across tasks, the underlying mechanism behind these improvements has remained unclear. In this work, we show that only the sine activation contributes positively to performance, whereas the cosine activation tends to be detrimental. Our analysis reveals that the improvement is not a consequence of the sine function's periodic nature; instead, it stems from the function's local behavior near x = 0, where its non-zero derivative mitigates the vanishing-gradient problem. We further show that FAN primarily alleviates the dying-ReLU problem, in which a neuron consistently receives negative inputs, produces zero gradients, and stops learning. Although modern ReLU-like activations, such as Leaky ReLU, GELU, and Swish, reduce ReLU's zero-gradient region, they still contain input domains where gradients remain significantly diminished, contributing to slower optimization and hindering rapid convergence. FAN addresses this limitation by introducing a more stable gradient pathway. This analysis shifts the understanding of FAN's benefits from a spectral interpretation to a concrete analysis of training dynamics, leading to the development of the Dual-Activation Layer (DAL), a more efficient convergence accelerator. We evaluate DAL on three tasks: classification of noisy sinusoidal signals versus pure noise, MNIST digit classification, and ECG-based biometric recognition. In all cases, DAL models converge faster and achieve equal or higher validation accuracy compared to models with conventional activations.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, transformer, large language model, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The recent surge in large language models has automated translations of spoken and written languages. However, these advances remain largely inaccessible to American Sign Language (ASL) users, whose language relies on complex visual cues. Isolated sign language recognition (ISLR) - the task of classifying videos of individual signs - can help bridge this gap but is currently limited by scarce per-sign data, high signer variability, and substantial computational costs. We propose a model for ISLR that reduces computational requirements while maintaining robustness to signer variation. Our approach integrates (i) a pose estimation pipeline to extract hand and face joint coordinates, (ii) a segmentation module that isolates relevant information, and (iii) a ResNet-Transformer backbone to jointly model spatial and temporal dependencies.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>biometric, explainability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Biologists have long combined visuals with textual field notes to re-identify (Re-ID) animals. Contemporary AI tools automate this for species with distinctive morphological features but remain largely image-based. Here, we extend Re-ID methodologies by incorporating precise dermatoglyphic textual descriptors-an approach used in forensics but new to ecology. We demonstrate that these specialist semantics abstract and encode animal coat topology using human-interpretable language tags. Drawing on 84,264 manually labelled minutiae across 3,355 images of 185 tigers (Panthera tigris), we evaluate this visual-textual methodology, revealing novel capabilities for cross-modal identity retrieval. To optimise performance, we developed a text-image co-synthesis pipeline to generate 'virtual individuals', each comprising dozens of life-like visuals paired with dermatoglyphic text. Benchmarking against real-world scenarios shows this augmentation significantly boosts AI accuracy in cross-modal retrieval while alleviating data scarcity. We conclude that dermatoglyphic language-guided biometrics can overcome vision-only limitations, enabling textual-to-visual identity recovery underpinned by human-verifiable matchings. This represents a significant advance towards explainability in Re-ID and a language-driven unification of descriptive modalities in ecological monitoring.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Results in interpretability suggest that large vision and language models learn implicit linear encodings when models are biased by in-context prompting. However, the existence of similar linear representations in more general adaptation regimes has not yet been demonstrated. In this work, we develop the concept of a task matrix, a linear transformation from a base to finetuned embedding state. We demonstrate that for vision and text models and ten different datasets, a base model augmented with a task matrix achieves results surpassing linear probes, sometimes approaching finetuned levels. Our results validate the existence of cross-layer linear encodings between pretrained and finetuned architectures. Moreover, we show that a data-based approximation for such encodings is both efficient and generalizable to multiple domains. We make our implementation publicly available.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>News sources play a central role in democratic societies by shaping political and social discourse through specific topics, viewpoints and voices. Understanding these dynamics is essential for assessing whether the media landscape offers a balanced and fair account of public debate. In earlier work, we introduced a pipeline that, given a news corpus, i) uses a hybrid human-machine approach to identify the range of viewpoints expressed about a given topic, and ii) classifies relevant claims with respect to the identified viewpoints, defined as sets of semantically and ideologically congruent claims (e.g., positions arguing that immigration positively impacts the UK economy). In this paper, we improve this pipeline by i) fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for viewpoint classification and ii) enriching claim representations with semantic descriptions of relevant actors drawn from Wikidata. We evaluate our approach against alternative solutions on a benchmark centred on the UK immigration debate. Results show that while both mechanisms independently improve classification performance, their integration yields the best results, particularly when using LLMs capable of processing long inputs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Objectives: To evaluate large language model (LLM) performance on pharmacy licensure-style question-answering (QA) tasks and develop an external knowledge integration method to improve their accuracy. Methods: We benchmarked eleven existing LLMs with varying parameter sizes (8 billion to 70+ billion) using a 141-question pharmacy dataset. We measured baseline accuracy for each model without modification. We then developed a three-step retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline, DrugRAG, that retrieves structured drug knowledge from validated sources and augments model prompts with evidence-based context. This pipeline operates externally to the models, requiring no changes to model architecture or parameters. Results: Baseline accuracy ranged from 46% to 92%, with GPT-5 (92%) and o3 (89%) achieving the highest scores. Models with fewer than 8 billion parameters scored below 50%. DrugRAG improved accuracy across all tested models, with gains ranging from 7 to 21 percentage points (e.g., Gemma 3 27B: 61% to 71%, Llama 3.1 8B: 46% to 67%) on the 141-item benchmark. Conclusion: We demonstrate that external structured drug knowledge integration through DrugRAG measurably improves LLM accuracy on pharmacy tasks without modifying the underlying models. This approach provides a practical pipeline for enhancing pharmacy-focused AI applications with evidence-based information.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Artificial intelligence foundation models are increasingly deployed for prostate cancer Gleason grading, where GP3/GP4 distinction directly impacts treatment decisions. However, these models may achieve high validation accuracy by learning specimen-specific artifacts rather than generalizable biological features, limiting real-world clinical utility. We introduce PANDA-PLUS-Bench, a curated benchmark dataset derived from expert-annotated prostate biopsies designed specifically to quantify this failure mode. The benchmark comprises nine carefully selected whole slide images from nine unique patients containing diverse Gleason patterns, with non-overlapping tissue patches extracted at both 512x512 and 224x224 pixel resolutions across eight augmentation conditions. Using this benchmark, we evaluate seven foundation models on their ability to separate biological signal from slide-level confounders. Our results reveal substantial variation in robustness across models: Virchow2 achieved the lowest slide-level encoding among large-scale models (81.0%) yet exhibited the second-lowest cross-slide accuracy (47.2%). HistoEncoder, trained specifically on prostate tissue, demonstrated the highest cross-slide accuracy (59.7%) and the strongest slide-level encoding (90.3%), suggesting tissue-specific training may enhance both biological feature capture and slide-specific signatures. All models exhibited measurable within-slide vs. cross-slide accuracy gaps, though the magnitude varied from 19.9 percentage points to 26.9 percentage points. We provide an open-source Google Colab notebook enabling researchers to evaluate additional foundation models against our benchmark using standardized metrics. PANDA-PLUS-Bench addresses a critical gap in foundation model evaluation by providing a purpose-built resource for robustness assessment in the clinically important context of Gleason grading.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The quadratic computational complexity of MultiHead SelfAttention (MHSA) remains a fundamental bottleneck in scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) for longcontext tasks. While sparse and linearized attention mechanisms attempt to mitigate this, they often compromise the representation of global dependencies or fail to capture multiscale semantic granularity effectively. In this paper, we propose Multiscale Aggregated Hierarchical Attention (MAHA), a novel architectural framework that reformulates the attention mechanism through hierarchical decomposition and mathematically rigorous aggregation. Unlike conventional approaches that treat token interactions at a single resolution, MAHA dynamically partitions the input sequence into hierarchical scales via learnable downsampling operators. The core innovation lies in its aggregation strategy: we model the fusion of scalespecific attention matrices as a resource allocation problem, solved via a convex optimization framework or a Nash equilibriumbased gametheoretic approach. This ensures a theoretically optimal balance between local nuance and global context fidelity. Implemented within a hybrid dilatedconvolutional transformer backbone, MAHA utilizes differentiable optimization layers to enable endtoend training. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that MAHA achieves superior scalability; empirical FLOPs analysis confirms an 81% reduction in computational cost at a sequence length of 4096 compared to standard attention. This work bridges the gap between optimization theory and sequence modeling, offering a scalable solution for nextgeneration LLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Focusing on low-resource languages is an essential step toward democratizing generative AI. In this work, we contribute to reducing the multimodal NLP resource gap for Romanian. We translate the widely known Flickr30k dataset into Romanian and further extend it for visual question answering by leveraging open-source LLMs. We demonstrate the usefulness of our datasets by fine-tuning open-source VLMs on Romanian visual question answering. We select VLMs from three widely used model families: LLaMA 3.2, LLaVA 1.6, and Qwen2. For fine-tuning, we employ the parameter-efficient LoRA method. Our models show improved Romanian capabilities in visual QA, as well as on tasks they were not trained on, such as Romanian image description generation. The seven-billion-parameter Qwen2-VL-RoVQA obtains top scores on both tasks, with improvements of +6.05% and +2.61% in BERTScore F1 over its original version. Finally, the models show substantial reductions in grammatical errors compared to their original forms, indicating improvements not only in language understanding but also in Romanian fluency.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Cloud Security Operations Center (SOC) enable cloud governance, risk and compliance by providing insights visibility and control. Cloud SOC triages high-volume, heterogeneous telemetry from elastic, short-lived resources while staying within tight budgets. In this research, we implement an AI-Augmented Security Operations Center (AISOC) on AWS that combines cloud-native instrumentation with ML-based detection. The architecture uses three Amazon EC2 instances: Attacker, Defender, and Monitoring. We simulate a reverse-shell intrusion with Metasploit, and Filebeat forwards Defender logs to an Elasticsearch and Kibana stack for analysis. We train two classifiers, a malware detector built on a public dataset and a log-anomaly detector trained on synthetically augmented logs that include adversarial variants. We calibrate and fuse the scores to produce multi-modal threat intelligence and triage activity into NORMAL, SUSPICIOUS, and HIGH\_CONFIDENCE\_ATTACK. On held-out tests the fusion achieves strong macro-F1 (up to 1.00) under controlled conditions, though performance will vary in noisier and more diverse environments. These results indicate that simple, calibrated fusion can enhance cloud SOC capabilities in constrained, cost-sensitive setups.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Gliomas are the most common malignant brain tumors in adults and are among the most lethal. Despite aggressive treatment, the median survival rate is less than 15 months. Accurate multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) tumor segmentation is critical for surgical planning, radiotherapy, and disease monitoring. While deep learning models have improved the accuracy of automated segmentation, large-scale pre-trained models generalize poorly and often underperform, producing systematic errors such as false positives, label swaps, and slice discontinuities in slices. These limitations are further compounded by unequal access to GPU resources and the growing environmental cost of large-scale model training. In this work, we propose adaptive post-processing techniques to refine the quality of glioma segmentations produced by large-scale pretrained models developed for various types of tumors. We demonstrated the techniques in multiple BraTS 2025 segmentation challenge tasks, with the ranking metric improving by 14.9 % for the sub-Saharan Africa challenge and 0.9% for the adult glioma challenge. This approach promotes a shift in brain tumor segmentation research from increasingly complex model architectures to efficient, clinically aligned post-processing strategies that are precise, computationally fair, and sustainable.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce TalkVerse, a large-scale, open corpus for single-person, audio-driven talking video generation designed to enable fair, reproducible comparison across methods. While current state-of-the-art systems rely on closed data or compute-heavy models, TalkVerse offers 2.3 million high-resolution (720p/1080p) audio-video synchronized clips totaling 6.3k hours. These are curated from over 60k hours of video via a transparent pipeline that includes scene-cut detection, aesthetic assessment, strict audio-visual synchronization checks, and comprehensive annotations including 2D skeletons and structured visual/audio-style captions. Leveraging TalkVerse, we present a reproducible 5B DiT baseline built on Wan2.2-5B. By utilizing a video VAE with a high downsampling ratio and a sliding window mechanism with motion-frame context, our model achieves minute-long generation with low drift. It delivers comparable lip-sync and visual quality to the 14B Wan-S2V model but with 10$\times$ lower inference cost. To enhance storytelling in long videos, we integrate an MLLM director to rewrite prompts based on audio and visual cues. Furthermore, our model supports zero-shot video dubbing via controlled latent noise injection. We open-source the dataset, training recipes, and 5B checkpoints to lower barriers for research in audio-driven human video generation. Project Page: this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has evolved modern transportation through enhanced connectivity and intelligent systems. However, this increased connectivity introduces critical vulnerabilities, making vehicles susceptible to cyber-attacks such Denial-ofService (DoS) and message spoofing. This project aims to develop a machine learning-based intrusion detection system to classify malicious Controller Area network (CAN) bus traffic using the CiCIoV2024 benchmark dataset. We analyzed various attack patterns including DoS and spoofing attacks targeting critical vehicle parameters such as Spoofing-GAS - gas pedal position, Spoofing-RPM, Spoofing-Speed, and Spoofing-Steering\_Wheel. Our initial findings confirm a multi-class classification problem with a clear structural difference between attack types and benign data, providing a strong foundation for machine learning models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Person recognition systems often rely on audio, visual, or behavioral cues, but real-world conditions frequently result in missing or degraded modalities. To address this challenge, we propose a Trimodal person identification framework that integrates voice, face, and gesture modalities, while remaining robust to modality loss. Our approach leverages multi-task learning to process each modality independently, followed by a cross-attention and gated fusion mechanisms to facilitate interaction across modalities. Moreover, a confidence-weighted fusion strategy dynamically adapts to missing and low-quality data, ensuring optimal classification even in Unimodal or Bimodal scenarios. We evaluate our method on CANDOR, a newly introduced interview-based multimodal dataset, which we benchmark for the first time. Our results demonstrate that the proposed Trimodal system achieves 99.18% Top-1 accuracy on person identification tasks, outperforming conventional Unimodal and late-fusion approaches. In addition, we evaluate our model on the VoxCeleb1 dataset as a benchmark and reach 99.92% accuracy in Bimodal mode. Moreover, we show that our system maintains high accuracy even when one or two modalities are unavailable, making it a robust solution for real-world person recognition applications. The code and data for this work are publicly available.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models struggle to produce samples that respect constraints, a common requirement in scientific applications. Recent approaches have introduced regularization terms in the loss or guidance methods during sampling to enforce such constraints, but they bias the generative model away from the true data distribution. This is a problem, especially when the constraint is misspecified, a common issue when formulating constraints on scientific data. In this paper, instead of changing the loss or the sampling loop, we integrate a guidance-inspired adjustment into the denoiser itself, giving it a soft inductive bias towards constraint-compliant samples. We show that these softly constrained denoisers exploit constraint knowledge to improve compliance over standard denoisers, and maintain enough flexibility to deviate from it when there is misspecification with observed data.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multimodal scientific reasoning remains a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs), particularly in chemistry, where problem-solving relies on symbolic diagrams, molecular structures, and structured visual data. Here, we systematically evaluate 40 proprietary and open-source multimodal LLMs, including GPT-5, o3, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Qwen2.5-VL, on a curated benchmark of Olympiad-style chemistry questions drawn from over two decades of U.S. National Chemistry Olympiad (USNCO) exams. These questions require integrated visual and textual reasoning across diverse modalities. We find that many models struggle with modality fusion, where in some cases, removing the image even improves accuracy, indicating misalignment in vision-language integration. Chain-of-Thought prompting consistently enhances both accuracy and visual grounding, as demonstrated through ablation studies and occlusion-based interpretability. Our results reveal critical limitations in the scientific reasoning abilities of current MLLMs, providing actionable strategies for developing more robust and interpretable multimodal systems in chemistry. This work provides a timely benchmark for measuring progress in domain-specific multimodal AI and underscores the need for further advances at the intersection of artificial intelligence and scientific reasoning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We study reinforcement learning for controlled diffusion processes with unbounded continuous state spaces, bounded continuous actions, and polynomially growing rewards: settings that arise naturally in finance, economics, and operations research. To overcome the challenges of continuous and high-dimensional domains, we introduce a model-based algorithm that adaptively partitions the joint state-action space. The algorithm maintains estimators of drift, volatility, and rewards within each partition, refining the discretization whenever estimation bias exceeds statistical confidence. This adaptive scheme balances exploration and approximation, enabling efficient learning in unbounded domains. Our analysis establishes regret bounds that depend on the problem horizon, state dimension, reward growth order, and a newly defined notion of zooming dimension tailored to unbounded diffusion processes. The bounds recover existing results for bounded settings as a special case, while extending theoretical guarantees to a broader class of diffusion-type problems. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our approach through numerical experiments, including applications to high-dimensional problems such as multi-asset mean-variance portfolio selection.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>protect, robust, interpretability, watermark, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in generative AI have enabled the creation of highly realistic digital content, raising concerns around authenticity, ownership, and misuse. While watermarking has become an increasingly important mechanism to trace and protect digital media, most existing image watermarking schemes operate as black boxes, producing global detection scores without offering any insight into how or where the watermark is present. This lack of transparency impacts user trust and makes it difficult to interpret the impact of tampering. In this paper, we present a post-hoc image watermarking method that combines localised embedding with region-level interpretability. Our approach embeds watermark signals in the discrete wavelet transform domain using a statistical block-wise strategy. This allows us to generate detection maps that reveal which regions of an image are likely watermarked or altered. We show that our method achieves strong robustness against common image transformations while remaining sensitive to semantic manipulations. At the same time, the watermark remains highly imperceptible. Compared to prior post-hoc methods, our approach offers more interpretable detection while retaining competitive robustness. For example, our watermarks are robust to cropping up to half the image.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Precision livestock farming requires objective assessment of social behavior to support herd welfare monitoring, yet most existing approaches infer interactions using static proximity thresholds that cannot distinguish affiliative from agonistic behaviors in complex barn environments. This limitation constrains the interpretability of automated social network analysis in commercial settings. We present a pose-based computational framework for interaction classification that moves beyond proximity heuristics by modeling the spatiotemporal geometry of anatomical keypoints. Rather than relying on pixel-level appearance or simple distance measures, the proposed method encodes interaction-specific motion signatures from keypoint trajectories, enabling differentiation of social interaction valence. The framework is implemented as an end-to-end computer vision pipeline integrating YOLOv11 for object detection (mAP@0.50: 96.24%), supervised individual identification (98.24% accuracy), ByteTrack for multi-object tracking (81.96% accuracy), ZebraPose for 27-point anatomical keypoint estimation, and a support vector machine classifier trained on pose-derived distance dynamics. On annotated interaction clips collected from a commercial dairy barn, the classifier achieved 77.51% accuracy in distinguishing affiliative and agonistic behaviors using pose information alone. Comparative evaluation against a proximity-only baseline shows substantial gains in behavioral discrimination, particularly for affiliative interactions. The results establish a proof-of-concept for automated, vision-based inference of social interactions suitable for constructing interaction-aware social networks, with near-real-time performance on commodity hardware.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Process Reward Models (PRMs) have become essential for improving Large Language Models (LLMs) via test-time scaling, yet their effectiveness in coding remains limited due to the lack of meaningful step decompositions in code and the noise of Monte-Carlo-generated partial labels. We propose DreamPRM-Code, a coding-focused PRM that treats functions as reasoning steps using a Chain-of-Function prompting strategy to induce modular code generation, enabling PRM training and application analogous to mathematical reasoning tasks. To address label noise, DreamPRM-Code introduces a meta-learning-based correction mechanism that leverages clean final-solution unit-test labels and performs bi-level optimization to refine intermediate labels. Applying on test-time scaling, DreamPRM-Code achieved state-of-the-art performance on LiveCodeBench with 80.9 pass@1 rate, surpassing OpenAI o4-mini.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, transformer, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Monitoring issue tracker submissions is a crucial software maintenance activity. A key goal is the prioritization of high risk, security-related bugs. If such bugs can be recognized early, the risk of propagation to dependent products and endangerment of stakeholder benefits can be mitigated. To assist triage engineers with this task, several automatic detection techniques, from Machine Learning (ML) models to prompting Large Language Models (LLMs), have been proposed. Although promising to some extent, prior techniques often memorize lexical cues as decision shortcuts, yielding low detection rate specifically for more complex submissions. As such, these classifiers do not yet reach the practical expectations of a real-time detector of security-related issues. To address these limitations, we propose SEBERTIS, a framework to train Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) as classifiers independent of lexical cues, so that they can confidently detect fully unseen security-related issues. SEBERTIS capitalizes on fine-tuning bidirectional transformer architectures as Masked Language Models (MLMs) on a series of semantically equivalent vocabulary to prediction labels (which we call Semantic Surrogates) when they have been replaced with a mask. Our SEBERTIS-trained classifier achieves a 0.9880 F1-score in detecting security-related issues of a curated corpus of 10,000 GitHub issue reports, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art issue classifiers, with 14.44%-96.98%, 15.40%-93.07%, and 14.90%-94.72% higher detection precision, recall, and F1-score over ML-based baselines. Our classifier also substantially surpasses LLM baselines, with an improvement of 23.20%-63.71%, 36.68%-85.63%, and 39.49%-74.53% for precision, recall, and F1-score.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, interpretability, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Understanding how prices evolve over time often requires peeling back the layers of market noise to identify clear, structural behavior. Many of the tools commonly used for this purpose technical indicators, chart heuristics, or even sophisticated predictive models leave important questions unanswered. Technical indicators depend on platform-specific rules, and predictive systems typically offer little in terms of explanation. In settings that demand transparency or auditability, this poses a significant challenge. We introduce the Stock Pattern Assistant (SPA), a deterministic framework designed to extract monotonic price runs, attach relevant public events through a symmetric correlation window, and generate explanations that are factual, historical, and guardrailed. SPA relies only on daily OHLCV data and a normalized event stream, making the pipeline straight-forward to audit and easy to reproduce. To illustrate SPA's behavior in practice, we evaluate it across four equities-AAPL, NVDA, SCHW, and PGR-chosen to span a range of volatility regimes and sector characteristics. Although the evaluation period is modest, the results demonstrate how SPA consistently produces stable structural decompositions and contextual narratives. Ablation experiments further show how deterministic segmentation, event alignment, and constrained explanation each contribute to interpretability. SPA is not a forecasting system, nor is it intended to produce trading signals. Its value lies in offering a transparent, reproducible view of historical price structure that can complement analyst workflows, risk reviews, and broader explainable-AI pipelines.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Preference optimization offers a scalable supervision paradigm based on relative preference signals, yet prior attempts in medical image segmentation remain model-specific and rely on low-diversity prediction sampling. In this paper, we propose MAPO (Model-Agnostic Preference Optimization), a training framework that utilizes Dropout-driven stochastic segmentation hypotheses to construct preference-consistent gradients without direct ground-truth supervision. MAPO is fully architecture- and dimensionality-agnostic, supporting 2D/3D CNN and Transformer-based segmentation pipelines. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse medical datasets reveal that MAPO consistently enhances boundary adherence, reduces overfitting, and yields more stable optimization dynamics compared to conventional supervised training.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The web3 applications have recently been growing, especially on the Ethereum platform, starting to become the target of scammers. The web3 scams, imitating the services provided by legitimate platforms, mimic regular activity to deceive users. However, previous studies have primarily concentrated on de-anonymization and phishing nodes, neglecting the distinctive features of web3 scams. Moreover, the current phishing account detection tools utilize graph learning or sampling algorithms to obtain graph features. However, large-scale transaction networks with temporal attributes conform to a power-law distribution, posing challenges in detecting web3 scams. To overcome these challenges, we present ScamSweeper, a novel framework that emphasizes the dynamic evolution of transaction graphs, to identify web3 scams on Ethereum. ScamSweeper samples the network with a structure temporal random walk, which is an optimized sample walking method that considers both temporal attributes and structural information. Then, the directed graph encoder generates the features of each subgraph during different temporal intervals, sorting as a sequence. Moreover, a variational Transformer is utilized to extract the dynamic evolution in the subgraph sequence. Furthermore, we collect a large-scale transaction dataset consisting of web3 scams, phishing, and normal accounts, which are from the first 18 million block heights on Ethereum. Subsequently, we comprehensively analyze the distinctions in various attributes, including nodes, edges, and degree distribution. Our experiments indicate that ScamSweeper outperforms SIEGE, Ethident, and PDTGA in detecting web3 scams, achieving a weighted F1-score improvement of at least 17.29% with the base value of 0.59. In addition, ScamSweeper in phishing node detection achieves at least a 17.5% improvement over DGTSG and BERT4ETH in F1-score from 0.80.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Dialogue Topic Segmentation (DTS) is crucial for understanding task-oriented public-channel communications, such as maritime VHF dialogues, which feature informal speech and implicit transitions. To address the limitations of traditional methods, we propose DASH-DTS, a novel LLM-based framework. Its core contributions are: (1) topic shift detection via dialogue handshake recognition; (2) contextual enhancement through similarity-guided example selection; and (3) the generation of selective positive and negative samples to improve model discrimination and robustness. Additionally, we release VHF-Dial, the first public dataset of real-world maritime VHF communications, to advance research in this domain. DASH-DTS provides interpretable reasoning and confidence scores for each segment. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves several sota segmentation trusted accuracy on both VHF-Dial and standard benchmarks, establishing a strong foundation for stable monitoring and decision support in operational dialogues.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>defense, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Disclaimer: Samples in this paper may be harmful and cause discomfort. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable multimodal generation but inherit toxic, biased, and NSFW signals from weakly curated pretraining corpora, causing safety risks, especially under adversarial triggers that late, opaque training-free detoxification methods struggle to handle. We propose SGM, a white-box neuron-level multimodal intervention that acts like safety glasses for toxic neurons: it selectively recalibrates a small set of toxic expert neurons via expertise-weighted soft suppression, neutralizing harmful cross-modal activations without any parameter updates. We establish MM-TOXIC-QA, a multimodal toxicity evaluation framework, and compare SGM with existing detoxification techniques. Experiments on open-source MLLMs show that SGM mitigates toxicity in standard and adversarial conditions, cutting harmful rates from 48.2\% to 2.5\% while preserving fluency and multimodal reasoning. SGM is extensible, and its combined defenses, denoted as SGM*, integrate with existing detoxification methods for stronger safety performance, providing an interpretable, low-cost solution for toxicity-controlled multimodal generation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The transition of Large Language Models (LLMs) from stochastic chat interfaces to reliable software components necessitates a fundamental re-engineering of interaction paradigms. Current methodologies, predominantly heuristic-based "prompt engineering," fail to provide the deterministic guarantees required for mission-critical applications. We introduce the Meta-Prompting Protocol, a rigorous theoretical framework that formalizes the orchestration of LLMs as a programmable, self-optimizing system. Central to this protocol is the Adversarial Trinity, a tripartite topology comprising a Generator (P), an Auditor (A), and an Optimizer (O). By treating natural language instructions as differentiable variables within a semantic computation graph and utilizing textual critiques as gradients, this architecture mitigates hallucination and prevents model collapse. We demonstrate the theoretical viability of this approach using declarative programming paradigms (DSPy) and automatic textual differentiation (TextGrad), establishing a foundation for "Observable Software Engineering" in the era of probabilistic computing.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large-scale structures suffer high-frequency deformations due to complex loads. However, harsh lighting conditions and high equipment costs limit measurement methods based on traditional high-speed cameras. This paper proposes a method to measure high-frequency deformations by exploiting an event camera and LED markers. Firstly, observation noise is filtered based on the characteristics of the event stream generated by LED markers blinking and spatiotemporal correlation. Then, LED markers are extracted from the event stream after differentiating between motion-induced events and events from LED blinking, which enables the extraction of high-speed moving LED markers. Ultimately, high-frequency planar deformations are measured by a monocular event camera. Experimental results confirm the accuracy of our method in measuring high-frequency planar deformations.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Medical ultrasound videos are widely used for medical inspections, disease diagnosis and surgical planning. High-fidelity lesion area and target organ segmentation constitutes a key component of the computer-assisted surgery workflow. The low contrast levels and noisy backgrounds of ultrasound videos cause missegmentation of organ boundary, which may lead to small object losses and increase boundary segmentation errors. Object tracking in long videos also remains a significant research challenge. To overcome these challenges, we propose a memory bank-based wavelet filtering and fusion network, which adopts an encoder-decoder structure to effectively extract fine-grained detailed spatial features and integrate high-frequency (HF) information. Specifically, memory-based wavelet convolution is presented to simultaneously capture category, detailed information and utilize adjacent information in the encoder. Cascaded wavelet compression is used to fuse multiscale frequency-domain features and expand the receptive field within each convolutional layer. A long short-term memory bank using cross-attention and memory compression mechanisms is designed to track objects in long video. To fully utilize the boundary-sensitive HF details of feature maps, an HF-aware feature fusion module is designed via adaptive wavelet filters in the decoder. In extensive benchmark tests conducted on four ultrasound video datasets (two thyroid nodule, the thyroid gland, the heart datasets) compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our method demonstrates marked improvements in segmentation metrics. In particular, our method can more accurately segment small thyroid nodules, demonstrating its effectiveness for cases involving small ultrasound objects in long video.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid growth in wireless infrastructure has increased the need to accurately estimate and forecast electromagnetic field (EMF) levels to ensure ongoing compliance, assess potential health impacts, and support efficient network planning. While existing studies rely on univariate forecasting of wideband aggregate EMF data, frequency-selective multivariate forecasting is needed to capture the inter-operator and inter-frequency variations essential for proactive network planning. To this end, this paper introduces EMFusion, a conditional multivariate diffusion-based probabilistic forecasting framework that integrates diverse contextual factors (e.g., time of day, season, and holidays) while providing explicit uncertainty estimates. The proposed architecture features a residual U-Net backbone enhanced by a cross-attention mechanism that dynamically integrates external conditions to guide the generation process. Furthermore, EMFusion integrates an imputation-based sampling strategy that treats forecasting as a structural inpainting task, ensuring temporal coherence even with irregular measurements. Unlike standard point forecasters, EMFusion generates calibrated probabilistic prediction intervals directly from the learned conditional distribution, providing explicit uncertainty quantification essential for trustworthy decision-making. Numerical experiments conducted on frequency-selective EMF datasets demonstrate that EMFusion with the contextual information of working hours outperforms the baseline models with or without conditions. The EMFusion outperforms the best baseline by 23.85% in continuous ranked probability score (CRPS), 13.93% in normalized root mean square error, and reduces prediction CRPS error by 22.47%.</li>

Current methods often suffer from occlusions, garment style drift, and pose misalignment. We propose Pose-guided Multi-view Multimodal Diffusion (PMMD), a diffusion framework that synthesizes photorealistic person images conditioned on multi-view references, pose maps, and text prompts. A multimodal encoder jointly models visual views, pose features, and semantic descriptions, which reduces cross modal discrepancy and improves identity fidelity. We further design a ResCVA module to enhance local detail while preserving global structure, and a cross modal fusion module that integrates image semantics with text throughout the denoising pipeline. Experiments on the DeepFashion MultiModal dataset show that PMMD outperforms representative baselines in consistency, detail preservation, and controllability.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, defense, attack, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Although large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in security-critical workflows, practitioners lack quantitative guidance on which safeguards are worth deploying. This paper introduces a decision-oriented framework and reproducible methodology that together quantify residual risk, convert adversarial probe outcomes into financial risk estimates and return-on-control (RoC) metrics, and enable monetary comparison of layered defenses for LLM-based systems. A retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) service is instantiated using the DeepSeek-R1 model over a corpus containing synthetic personally identifiable information (PII), and subjected to automated attacks with Garak across five vulnerability classes: PII leakage, latent context injection, prompt injection, adversarial attack generation, and divergence. For each (vulnerability, control) pair, attack success probabilities are estimated via Laplace's Rule of Succession and combined with loss triangle distributions, calibrated from public breach-cost data, in 10,000-run Monte Carlo simulations to produce loss exceedance curves and expected losses. Three widely used mitigations, attribute-based access control (ABAC); named entity recognition (NER) redaction using Microsoft Presidio; and NeMo Guardrails, are then compared to a baseline RAG configuration. The baseline system exhibits very high attack success rates (>= 0.98 for PII, latent injection, and prompt injection), yielding a total simulated expected loss of $313k per attack scenario. ABAC collapses success probabilities for PII and prompt-related attacks to near zero and reduces the total expected loss by ~94%, achieving an RoC of 9.83. NER redaction likewise eliminates PII leakage and attains an RoC of 5.97, while NeMo Guardrails provides only marginal benefit (RoC of 0.05).</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Existing feature engineering methods based on large language models (LLMs) have not yet been applied to multi-label learning tasks. They lack the ability to model complex label dependencies and are not specifically adapted to the characteristics of multi-label tasks. To address the above issues, we propose Feature Engineering Automation for Multi-Label Learning (FEAML), an automated feature engineering method for multi-label classification which leverages the code generation capabilities of LLMs. By utilizing metadata and label co-occurrence matrices, LLMs are guided to understand the relationships between data features and task objectives, based on which high-quality features are generated. The newly generated features are evaluated in terms of model accuracy to assess their effectiveness, while Pearson correlation coefficients are used to detect redundancy. FEAML further incorporates the evaluation results as feedback to drive LLMs to continuously optimize code generation in subsequent iterations. By integrating LLMs with a feedback mechanism, FEAML realizes an efficient, interpretable and self-improving feature engineering paradigm. Empirical results on various multi-label datasets demonstrate that our FEAML outperforms other feature engineering methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Learning-based methods have made significant progress in physics simulation, typically approximating dynamics with a monolithic end-to-end optimized neural network. Although these models offer an effective way to simulation, they may lose essential features compared to traditional numerical simulators, such as physical interpretability and reliability. Drawing inspiration from classical simulators that operate in a modular fashion, this paper presents Neural Modular Physics (NMP) for elastic simulation, which combines the approximation capacity of neural networks with the physical reliability of traditional simulators. Beyond the previous monolithic learning paradigm, NMP enables direct supervision of intermediate quantities and physical constraints by decomposing elastic dynamics into physically meaningful neural modules connected through intermediate physical quantities. With a specialized architecture and training strategy, our method transforms the numerical computation flow into a modular neural simulator, achieving improved physical consistency and generalizability. Experimentally, NMP demonstrates superior generalization to unseen initial conditions and resolutions, stable long-horizon simulation, better preservation of physical properties compared to other neural simulators, and greater feasibility in scenarios with unknown underlying dynamics than traditional simulators.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Operator learning has become a powerful tool for accelerating the solution of parameterized partial differential equations (PDEs), enabling rapid prediction of full spatiotemporal fields for new initial conditions or forcing functions. Existing architectures such as DeepONet and the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) show strong empirical performance but often require large training datasets, lack explicit physical structure, and may suffer from instability in their trunk-network features, where mode imbalance or collapse can hinder accurate operator approximation. Motivated by the stability and locality of classical partition-of-unity (PoU) methods, we investigate PoU-based regularization techniques for operator learning and develop a revised formulation of the existing POU--PI--DeepONet framework. The resulting \emph{P}hysics-\emph{i}nformed \emph{P}artition \emph{P}enalty Deep Operator Network (PIP$^{2}$ Net) introduces a simplified and more principled partition penalty that improved the coordinated trunk outputs that leads to more expressiveness without sacrificing the flexibility of DeepONet. We evaluate PIP$^{2}$ Net on three nonlinear PDEs: the viscous Burgers equation, the Allen--Cahn equation, and a diffusion--reaction system. The results show that it consistently outperforms DeepONet, PI-DeepONet, and POU-DeepONet in prediction accuracy and robustness.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) driven by fractional Brownian motion (fBm) are increasingly used to model systems with rough dynamics and long-range dependence, such as those arising in quantitative finance and reliability engineering. However, these processes are non-Markovian and lack a semimartingale structure, rendering many classical parameter estimation techniques inapplicable or computationally intractable beyond very specific cases. This work investigates two central questions: (i) whether integrating path signatures into deep learning architectures can improve the trade-off between estimation accuracy and model complexity, and (ii) what constitutes an effective architecture for leveraging signatures as feature maps. We introduce SigMA (Signature Multi-head Attention), a neural architecture that integrates path signatures with multi-head self-attention, supported by a convolutional preprocessing layer and a multilayer perceptron for effective feature encoding. SigMA learns model parameters from synthetically generated paths of fBm-driven SDEs, including fractional Brownian motion, fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, and rough Heston models, with a particular focus on estimating the Hurst parameter and on joint multi-parameter inference, and it generalizes robustly to unseen trajectories. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and two real-world datasets (i.e., equity-index realized volatility and Li-ion battery degradation) show that SigMA consistently outperforms CNN, LSTM, vanilla Transformer, and Deep Signature baselines in accuracy, robustness, and model compactness. These results demonstrate that combining signature transforms with attention-based architectures provides an effective and scalable framework for parameter inference in stochastic systems with rough or persistent temporal structure.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This technical report introduces Uni-Parser, an industrial-grade document parsing engine tailored for scientific literature and patents, delivering high throughput, robust accuracy, and cost efficiency. Unlike pipeline-based document parsing methods, Uni-Parser employs a modular, loosely coupled multi-expert architecture that preserves fine-grained cross-modal alignments across text, equations, tables, figures, and chemical structures, while remaining easily extensible to emerging modalities. The system incorporates adaptive GPU load balancing, distributed inference, dynamic module orchestration, and configurable modes that support either holistic or modality-specific parsing. Optimized for large-scale cloud deployment, Uni-Parser achieves a processing rate of up to 20 PDF pages per second on 8 x NVIDIA RTX 4090D GPUs, enabling cost-efficient inference across billions of pages. This level of scalability facilitates a broad spectrum of downstream applications, ranging from literature retrieval and summarization to the extraction of chemical structures, reaction schemes, and bioactivity data, as well as the curation of large-scale corpora for training next-generation large language models and AI4Science models.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid evolution of text-to-image generation models has revolutionized visual content creation. While commercial products like Nano Banana Pro have garnered significant attention, their potential as generalist solvers for traditional low-level vision challenges remains largely underexplored. In this study, we investigate the critical question: Is Nano Banana Pro a Low-Level Vision All-Rounder? We conducted a comprehensive zero-shot evaluation across 14 distinct low-level tasks spanning 40 diverse datasets. By utilizing simple textual prompts without fine-tuning, we benchmarked Nano Banana Pro against state-of-the-art specialist models. Our extensive analysis reveals a distinct performance dichotomy: while \textbf{Nano Banana Pro demonstrates superior subjective visual quality}, often hallucinating plausible high-frequency details that surpass specialist models, it lags behind in traditional reference-based quantitative metrics. We attribute this discrepancy to the inherent stochasticity of generative models, which struggle to maintain the strict pixel-level consistency required by conventional metrics. This report identifies Nano Banana Pro as a capable zero-shot contender for low-level vision tasks, while highlighting that achieving the high fidelity of domain specialists remains a significant hurdle.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Sequence modeling has produced diverse architectures -- from classical recurrent neural networks to modern Transformers and state space models (SSMs) -- yet a unified theoretical understanding of expressivity and trainability trade-offs remains limited. We introduce a unified framework that represents a broad class of sequence maps via an input-dependent effective interaction operator $W_{ij}(X)$, making explicit two recurring construction patterns: (i) the Unified Factorized Framework (Explicit) (attention-style mixing), in which $W_{ij}(X)$ varies through scalar coefficients applied to shared value maps, and (ii) Structured Dynamics (Implicit) (state-space recurrences), in which $W_{ij}$ is induced by a latent dynamical system. Using this framework, we derive three theoretical results. First, we establish the Interaction Rank Gap: models in the Unified Factorized Framework, such as single-head attention, are constrained to a low-dimensional operator span and cannot represent certain structured dynamical maps. Second, we prove an Equivalence (Head-Count) Theorem showing that, within our multi-head factorized class, representing a linear SSM whose lag operators span a $k$-dimensional subspace on length-$n$ sequences requires and is achievable with $H=k$ heads. Third, we prove a Gradient Highway Result, showing that attention layers admit inputs with distance-independent gradient paths, whereas stable linear dynamics exhibit distance-dependent gradient attenuation. Together, these results formalize a fundamental trade-off between algebraic expressivity (interaction/operator span) and long-range gradient propagation, providing theoretical grounding for modern sequence architecture design.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multivariate time series imputation is fundamental in applications such as healthcare, traffic forecasting, and biological modeling, where sensor failures and irregular sampling lead to pervasive missing values. However, existing Transformer- and diffusion-based models lack explicit inductive biases and frequency awareness, limiting their generalization under structured missing patterns and distribution shifts. We propose FADTI, a diffusion-based framework that injects frequency-informed feature modulation via a learnable Fourier Bias Projection (FBP) module and combines it with temporal modeling through self-attention and gated convolution. FBP supports multiple spectral bases, enabling adaptive encoding of both stationary and non-stationary patterns. This design injects frequency-domain inductive bias into the generative imputation process. Experiments on multiple benchmarks, including a newly introduced biological time series dataset, show that FADTI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly under high missing rates.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, defense, robust, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep learning models deployed on edge devices are increasingly used in safety-critical applications. However, their vulnerability to adversarial perturbations poses significant risks, especially in Federated Learning (FL) settings where identical models are distributed across thousands of clients. While adversarial training is a strong defense, it is difficult to apply in FL due to strict client-data privacy constraints and the limited compute available on edge devices. In this work, we introduce TrajSyn, a privacy-preserving framework that enables effective server-side adversarial training by synthesizing a proxy dataset from the trajectories of client model updates, without accessing raw client data. We show that TrajSyn consistently improves adversarial robustness on image classification benchmarks with no extra compute burden on the client device.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>3D animation is central to modern visual media, yet traditional production pipelines remain labor-intensive, expertise-demanding, and computationally expensive. Recent AIGC-based approaches partially automate asset creation and rigging, but they either inherit the heavy costs of full 3D pipelines or rely on video-synthesis paradigms that sacrifice 3D controllability and interactivity. We focus on single-image 3D animation generation and argue that progress is fundamentally constrained by a trade-off between rendering quality and 3D control. To address this limitation, we propose a lightweight 3D animation framework that decouples geometric control from appearance synthesis. The core idea is a 2D-3D aligned proxy representation that uses a coarse 3D estimate as a structural carrier, while delegating high-fidelity appearance and view synthesis to learned image-space generative priors. This proxy formulation enables 3D-aware motion control and interaction comparable to classical pipelines, without requiring accurate geometry or expensive optimization, and naturally extends to coherent background animation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves efficient animation generation on low-power platforms and outperforms video-based 3D animation generation in identity preservation, geometric and textural consistency, and the level of precise, interactive control it offers to users.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>A central goal of interpretability is to recover representations of causally relevant concepts from the activations of neural networks. The quality of these concept representations is typically evaluated in isolation, and under implicit independence assumptions that may not hold in practice. Thus, it is unclear whether common featurization methods - including sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and sparse probes - recover disentangled representations of these concepts. This study proposes a multi-concept evaluation setting where we control the correlations between textual concepts, such as sentiment, domain, and tense, and analyze performance under increasing correlations between them. We first evaluate the extent to which featurizers can learn disentangled representations of each concept under increasing correlational strengths. We observe a one-to-many relationship from concepts to features: features correspond to no more than one concept, but concepts are distributed across many features. Then, we perform steering experiments, measuring whether each concept is independently manipulable. Even when trained on uniform distributions of concepts, SAE features generally affect many concepts when steered, indicating that they are neither selective nor independent; nonetheless, features affect disjoint subspaces. These results suggest that correlational metrics for measuring disentanglement are generally not sufficient for establishing independence when steering, and that affecting disjoint subspaces is not sufficient for concept selectivity. These results underscore the importance of compositional evaluations in interpretability research.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Reference-guided instance editing is fundamentally limited by semantic entanglement, where a reference's intrinsic appearance is intertwined with its extrinsic attributes. The key challenge lies in disentangling what information should be borrowed from the reference, and determining how to apply it appropriately to the target. To tackle this challenge, we propose GENIE, a Generalizable Instance Editing framework capable of achieving explicit disentanglement. GENIE first corrects spatial misalignments with a Spatial Alignment Module (SAM). Then, an Adaptive Residual Scaling Module (ARSM) learns what to borrow by amplifying salient intrinsic cues while suppressing extrinsic attributes, while a Progressive Attention Fusion (PAF) mechanism learns how to render this appearance onto the target, preserving its structure. Extensive experiments on the challenging AnyInsertion dataset demonstrate that GENIE achieves state-of-the-art fidelity and robustness, setting a new standard for disentanglement-based instance editing.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, interpretability, explainability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This study examines the generalization performance and interpretability of machine learning (ML) models used for predicting crop yield and yield anomalies in Germany's NUTS-3 regions. Using a high-quality, long-term dataset, the study systematically compares the evaluation and temporal validation behavior of ensemble tree-based models (XGBoost, Random Forest) and deep learning approaches (LSTM, TCN). While all models perform well on spatially split, conventional test sets, their performance degrades substantially on temporally independent validation years, revealing persistent limitations in generalization. Notably, models with strong test-set accuracy, but weak temporal validation performance can still produce seemingly credible SHAP feature importance values. This exposes a critical vulnerability in post hoc explainability methods: interpretability may appear reliable even when the underlying model fails to generalize. These findings underscore the need for validation-aware interpretation of ML predictions in agricultural and environmental systems. Feature importance should not be accepted at face value unless models are explicitly shown to generalize to unseen temporal and spatial conditions. The study advocates for domain-aware validation, hybrid modeling strategies, and more rigorous scrutiny of explainability methods in data-driven agriculture.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated Learning is a machine learning setting that reduces direct data exposure, improving the privacy guarantees of machine learning models. Yet, the exchange of model updates between the participants and the aggregator can still leak sensitive information. In this work, we present a new gradient-based membership inference attack for federated learning scenarios that exploits the temporal evolution of last-layer gradients across multiple federated rounds. Our method uses the shadow technique to learn round-wise gradient patterns of the training records, requiring no access to the private dataset, and is designed to consider both semi-honest and malicious adversaries (aggregators or data owners). Beyond membership inference, we also provide a natural extension of the proposed attack to discrete attribute inference by contrasting gradient responses under alternative attribute hypotheses. The proposed attacks are model-agnostic, and therefore applicable to any gradient-based model and can be applied to both classification and regression settings. We evaluate the attack on CIFAR-100 and Purchase100 datasets for membership inference and on Breast Cancer Wisconsin for attribute inference. Our findings reveal strong attack performance and comparable computational and memory overhead in membership inference when compared to another attack from the literature. The obtained results emphasize that multi-round federated learning can increase the vulnerability to inference attacks, that aggregators pose a more substantial threat than data owners, and that attack performance is strongly influenced by the nature of the training dataset, with richer, high-dimensional data leading to stronger leakage than simpler tabular data.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Test-time reinforcement learning mitigates the reliance on annotated data by using majority voting results as pseudo-labels, emerging as a complementary direction to reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) for improving reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs). However, this voting strategy often induces confirmation bias and suffers from sparse rewards, limiting the overall performance. In this work, we propose subgroup-specific step-wise confidence-weighted pseudo-label estimation (SCOPE), a framework integrating model confidence and dynamic subgroup partitioning to address these issues. Specifically, SCOPE integrates the proposed step-wise confidence into pseudo label deduction, prioritizing high-quality reasoning paths over simple frequency count. Furthermore, it dynamically partitions the candidate outputs pool into independent subgroups by balancing reasoning quality against exploration diversity. By deriving local consensus via repeat sampling for each sub group, SCOPE provides diverse supervision targets to encourage broader exploration. We conduct experiments across various models and benchmarks, experimental results show that SCOPE consistently outperforms recent baselines. Notably, SCOPE achieving relative improvements of 13.1\% on challenging AIME 2025 and 8.1\% on AMC. The code is released at \href{this https URL}{this https URL}.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>defense, attack, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Threat analysts routinely rely on natural-language reports that describe attacker actions without enumerating the full kill chain or the dependencies between phases, making automated reconstruction of ATT&CK consistent intrusion paths a difficult open problem. We propose a reasoning framework that infers complete seven-phase kill chains by coupling phase-conditioned semantic priors from Transformer models with a symbolic Markov Decision Process and an AlphaZero-style Monte Carlo Tree Search guided by a Policy-Value Network. The framework enforces semantic relevance, phase cohesion, and transition plausibility through a multi-objective reward function while allowing search to explore alternative interpretations of the CTI narrative. Applied to three real intrusions FIN6, APT24, and UNC1549 the approach yields kill chains that surpass Transformer baselines in semantic fidelity and operational coherence, and frequently align with expert-selected TTPs. Our results demonstrate that combining contextual embeddings with search-based decision-making offers a practical path toward automated, interpretable kill-chain reconstruction for cyber defense.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>explainability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Evaluating whether human action is standard or not and providing reasonable feedback to improve action standardization is very crucial but challenging in real-world scenarios. However, current video understanding methods are mainly concerned with what and where the action is, which is unable to meet the requirements. Meanwhile, most of the existing datasets lack the labels indicating the degree of action standardization, and the action quality assessment datasets lack explainability and detailed feedback. Therefore, we define a new Human Action Form Assessment (AFA) task, and introduce a new diverse dataset CoT-AFA, which contains a large scale of fitness and martial arts videos with multi-level annotations for comprehensive video analysis. We enrich the CoT-AFA dataset with a novel Chain-of-Thought explanation paradigm. Instead of offering isolated feedback, our explanations provide a complete reasoning process--from identifying an action step to analyzing its outcome and proposing a concrete solution. Furthermore, we propose a framework named Explainable Fitness Assessor, which can not only judge an action but also explain why and provide a solution. This framework employs two parallel processing streams and a dynamic gating mechanism to fuse visual and semantic information, thereby boosting its analytical capabilities. The experimental results demonstrate that our method has achieved improvements in explanation generation (e.g., +16.0% in CIDEr), action classification (+2.7% in accuracy) and quality assessment (+2.1% in accuracy), revealing great potential of CoT-AFA for future studies.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>defense, attack, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) are evolving into agentic systems that reason, plan, and operate external tools. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a key enabler of this transition, offering a standardized interface for connecting LLMs with heterogeneous tools and services. Yet MCP's openness and multi-server workflows introduce new safety risks that existing benchmarks fail to capture, as they focus on isolated attacks or lack real-world coverage. We present MCP-SafetyBench, a comprehensive benchmark built on real MCP servers that supports realistic multi-turn evaluation across five domains: browser automation, financial analysis, location navigation, repository management, and web search. It incorporates a unified taxonomy of 20 MCP attack types spanning server, host, and user sides, and includes tasks requiring multi-step reasoning and cross-server coordination under uncertainty. Using MCP-SafetyBench, we systematically evaluate leading open- and closed-source LLMs, revealing large disparities in safety performance and escalating vulnerabilities as task horizons and server interactions grow. Our results highlight the urgent need for stronger defenses and establish MCP-SafetyBench as a foundation for diagnosing and mitigating safety risks in real-world MCP deployments.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Efficiency, as a critical practical challenge for LLM-driven agentic and reasoning systems, is increasingly constrained by the inherent latency of autoregressive (AR) decoding. Speculative decoding mitigates this cost through a draft-verify scheme, yet existing approaches rely on AR draft models (a.k.a., drafters), which introduce two fundamental issues: (1) step-wise uncertainty accumulation leads to a progressive collapse of trust between the target model and the drafter, and (2) inherently sequential decoding of AR drafters. Together, these factors cause limited speedups. In this paper, we show that a diffusion large language model (dLLM) drafters can naturally overcome these issues through its fundamentally different probabilistic modeling and efficient parallel decoding strategy. Building on this insight, we introduce DEER, an efficient speculative decoding framework that drafts with diffusion and verifies with AR models. To enable high-quality drafting, DEER employs a two-stage training pipeline to align the dLLM-based drafters with the target AR model, and further adopts single-step decoding to generate long draft segments. Experiments show DEER reaches draft acceptance lengths of up to 32 tokens, far surpassing the 10 tokens achieved by EAGLE-3. Moreover, on HumanEval with Qwen3-30B-A3B, DEER attains a 5.54x speedup, while EAGLE-3 achieves only 2.41x. Code, model, demo, etc, will be available at this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As the Ethereum platform continues to mature and gain widespread usage, it is crucial to maintain high standards of smart contract writing practices. While bad practices in smart contracts may not directly lead to security issues, they elevate the risk of encountering problems. Therefore, to understand and avoid these bad practices, this paper introduces the first systematic study of bad practices in smart contracts, delving into over 47 specific issues. Specifically, we propose SCALM, an LLM-powered framework featuring two methodological innovations: (1) A hybrid architecture that combines context-aware function-level slicing with knowledge-enhanced semantic reasoning via extensible vectorized pattern matching. (2) A multi-layer reasoning verification system connects low-level code patterns with high-level security principles through syntax, design patterns, and architecture analysis. Our extensive experiments using multiple LLMs and datasets have shown that SCALM outperforms existing tools in detecting bad practices in smart contracts.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative models can synthesize highly realistic content, so-called deepfakes, that are already being misused at scale to undermine digital media authenticity. Current deepfake detection methods are unreliable for two reasons: (i) distinguishing inauthentic content post-hoc is often impossible (e.g., with memorized samples), leading to an unbounded false positive rate (FPR); and (ii) detection lacks robustness, as adversaries can adapt to known detectors with near-perfect accuracy using minimal computational resources. To address these limitations, we propose a resynthesis framework to determine if a sample is authentic or if its authenticity can be plausibly denied. We make two key contributions focusing on the high-precision, low-recall setting against efficient (i.e., compute-restricted) adversaries. First, we demonstrate that our calibrated resynthesis method is the most reliable approach for verifying authentic samples while maintaining controllable, low FPRs. Second, we show that our method achieves adversarial robustness against efficient adversaries, whereas prior methods are easily evaded under identical compute budgets. Our approach supports multiple modalities and leverages state-of-the-art inversion techniques.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, data-free</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In real-world IoT applications, sensor data is usually collected under diverse and dynamic contextual conditions where factors such as sensor placements or ambient environments can significantly affect data patterns and downstream performance. Traditional domain adaptation or generalization methods often ignore such context information or use simplistic integration strategies, making them ineffective in handling unseen context shifts after deployment. In this paper, we propose Chorus, a context-aware, data-free model customization approach that adapts models to unseen deployment conditions without requiring target-domain data. The key idea is to learn effective context representations that capture their influence on sensor data patterns and to adaptively integrate them based on the degree of context shift. Specifically, Chorus first performs unsupervised cross-modal reconstruction between unlabeled sensor data and language-based context embeddings, while regularizing the context embedding space to learn robust, generalizable context representations. Then, it trains a lightweight gated head on limited labeled samples to dynamically balance sensor and context contributions-favoring context when sensor evidence is ambiguous and vice versa. To further reduce inference latency, Chorus employs a context-caching mechanism that reuses cached context representations and updates only upon detected context shifts. Experiments on IMU, speech, and WiFi sensing tasks under diverse context shifts show that Chorus outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 11.3% in unseen contexts, while maintaining comparable latency on smartphone and edge devices.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) often generate hallucinations in knowledge-intensive QA due to parametric knowledge limitations. While existing methods like KG-CoT improve reliability by integrating knowledge graph (KG) paths, they suffer from rigid hop-count selection (solely question-driven) and underutilization of reasoning paths (lack of guidance). To address this, we propose RFKG-CoT: First, it replaces the rigid hop-count selector with a relation-driven adaptive hop-count selector that dynamically adjusts reasoning steps by activating KG relations (e.g., 1-hop for direct "brother" relations, 2-hop for indirect "father-son" chains), formalized via a relation mask. Second, it introduces a few-shot in-context learning path guidance mechanism with CoT (think) that constructs examples in a "question-paths-answer" format to enhance LLMs' ability to understand reasoning paths. Experiments on four KGQA benchmarks show RFKG-CoT improves accuracy by up to 14.7 pp (Llama2-7B on WebQSP) over KG-CoT. Ablations confirm the hop-count selector and the path prompt are complementary, jointly transforming KG evidence into more faithful answers.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Lens flare is a common nighttime artifact caused by strong light sources scattering within camera lenses, leading to hazy streaks, halos, and glare that degrade visual quality. However, existing methods usually fail to effectively address nonuniform scattered flares, which severely reduces their applicability to complex real-world scenarios with diverse lighting conditions. To address this issue, we propose SLCFormer, a novel spectral-local context transformer framework for effective nighttime lens flare removal. SLCFormer integrates two key modules: the Frequency Fourier and Excitation Module (FFEM), which captures efficient global contextual representations in the frequency domain to model flare characteristics, and the Directionally-Enhanced Spatial Module (DESM) for local structural enhancement and directional features in the spatial domain for precise flare removal. Furthermore, we introduce a ZernikeVAE-based scatter flare generation pipeline to synthesize physically realistic scatter flares with spatially varying PSFs, bridging optical physics and data-driven training. Extensive experiments on the Flare7K++ dataset demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing approaches in both quantitative metrics and perceptual visual quality, and generalizing robustly to real nighttime scenes with complex flare artifacts.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The adsorption energy serves as a crucial descriptor for the large-scale screening of catalysts. Nevertheless, the limited distribution of training data for the extensively utilised machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP), predominantly sourced from near-equilibrium structures, results in unreliable adsorption structures and consequent adsorption energy predictions. In this context, we present DBCata, a deep generative model that integrates a periodic Brownian-bridge framework with an equivariant graph neural network to establish a low-dimensional transition manifold between unrelaxed and DFT-relaxed structures, without requiring explicit energy or force information. Upon training, DBCata effectively generates high-fidelity adsorption geometries, achieving an interatomic distance mean absolute error (DMAE) of 0.035 \textÅ on the Catalysis-Hub dataset, which is nearly three times superior to that of the current state-of-the-art machine learning potential models. Moreover, the corresponding DFT accuracy can be improved within 0.1 eV in 94\% of instances by identifying and refining anomalous predictions through a hybrid chemical-heuristic and self-supervised outlier detection approach. We demonstrate that the remarkable performance of DBCata facilitates accelerated high-throughput computational screening for efficient alloy catalysts in the oxygen reduction reaction, highlighting the potential of DBCata as a powerful tool for catalyst design and optimisation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>LLMs trained on web-scale data raise concerns about privacy and the right to be forgotten. To address these issues, Machine Unlearning provides techniques to remove specific information from trained models without retraining from scratch. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating unlearning in LLMs face two major limitations: they focus only on English and support only entity-level forgetting (removing all information about a person). We introduce FAME (Fictional Actors for Multilingual Erasure), a synthetic benchmark for evaluating Machine Unlearning across five languages: English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish. FAME contains 1,000 fictional actor biographies and 20,000 question-answer pairs. Each biography includes information on 20 topics organized into structured categories (biography, career, achievements, personal information). This design enables both entity-level unlearning (i.e., forgetting entire identities) and instance-level unlearning (i.e., forgetting specific facts while retaining others). We provide two dataset splits to support these two different unlearning scenarios and enable systematic comparison of unlearning techniques across languages. Since FAME uses entirely fictional data, it ensures that the information was never encountered during model pretraining, allowing for a controlled evaluation of unlearning methods.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Moralizations - arguments that invoke moral values to justify demands or positions - are a yet underexplored form of persuasive communication. We present the Moralization Corpus, a novel multi-genre dataset designed to analyze how moral values are strategically used in argumentative discourse. Moralizations are pragmatically complex and often implicit, posing significant challenges for both human annotators and NLP systems. We develop a frame-based annotation scheme that captures the constitutive elements of moralizations - moral values, demands, and discourse protagonists - and apply it to a diverse set of German texts, including political debates, news articles, and online discussions. The corpus enables fine-grained analysis of moralizing language across communicative formats and domains. We further evaluate several large language models (LLMs) under varied prompting conditions for the task of moralization detection and moralization component extraction and compare it to human annotations in order to investigate the challenges of automatic and manual analysis of moralizations. Results show that detailed prompt instructions has a greater effect than few-shot or explanation-based prompting, and that moralization remains a highly subjective and context-sensitive task. We release all data, annotation guidelines, and code to foster future interdisciplinary research on moral discourse and moral reasoning in NLP.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Medical artificial intelligence (AI) systems, particularly multimodal vision-language models (VLM), often exhibit intersectional biases where models are systematically less confident in diagnosing marginalised patient subgroups. Such bias can lead to higher rates of inaccurate and missed diagnoses due to demographically skewed data and divergent distributions of diagnostic certainty. Current fairness interventions frequently fail to address these gaps or compromise overall diagnostic performance to achieve statistical parity among the subgroups. In this study, we developed Cross-Modal Alignment Consistency (CMAC-MMD), a training framework that standardises diagnostic certainty across intersectional patient subgroups. Unlike traditional debiasing methods, this approach equalises the model's decision confidence without requiring sensitive demographic data during clinical inference. We evaluated this approach using 10,015 skin lesion images (HAM10000) with external validation on 12,000 images (BCN20000), and 10,000 fundus images for glaucoma detection (Harvard-FairVLMed), stratifying performance by intersectional age, gender, and race attributes. In the dermatology cohort, the proposed method reduced the overall intersectional missed diagnosis gap (difference in True Positive Rate, $\Delta$TPR) from 0.50 to 0.26 while improving the overall Area Under the Curve (AUC) from 0.94 to 0.97 compared to standard training. Similarly, for glaucoma screening, the method reduced $\Delta$TPR from 0.41 to 0.31, achieving a better AUC of 0.72 (vs. 0.71 baseline). This establishes a scalable framework for developing high-stakes clinical decision support systems that are both accurate and can perform equitably across diverse patient subgroups, ensuring reliable performance without increasing privacy risks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, protect, extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce SynGP500, a clinician-curated collection of 500 synthetic Australian general practice medical notes. The dataset integrates curriculum-based clinical breadth (RACGP 2022 Curriculum), epidemiologically-calibrated prevalence (BEACH study), and diverse consultation contexts. This approach systematically includes both common presentations and less-common curriculum-specified conditions that GPs must recognize but appear infrequently in single practice populations, potentially supporting more generalizable model training than datasets constrained by naturally occurring case distributions. SynGP500 is messy by design, reflecting the authentic complexity of healthcare delivery: telegraphic documentation, typos, patient non-adherence, socioeconomic barriers, and clinician-patient disagreements, unlike sanitized synthetic datasets that obscure clinical realities. Multi-faceted validation demonstrates dataset quality through epidemiological alignment with real Australian GP consultation patterns (BEACH study), stylometric analysis confirming high linguistic variation, semantic diversity analysis demonstrating broad coverage, and exploratory downstream evaluation using self-supervised medical concept extraction, showing F1 improvements. SynGP500 addresses a critical national gap, providing researchers and educators with a resource for developing and evaluating clinical NLP methods for Australian general practice while inherently protecting patient privacy.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Pan-sharpening aims to generate high-resolution multispectral (HRMS) images by integrating a high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) image with its corresponding low-resolution multispectral (MS) image. To achieve effective fusion, it is crucial to fully exploit the complementary information between the two modalities. Traditional CNN-based methods typically rely on channel-wise concatenation with fixed convolutional operators, which limits their adaptability to diverse spatial and spectral variations. While cross-attention mechanisms enable global interactions, they are computationally inefficient and may dilute fine-grained correspondences, making it difficult to capture complex semantic relationships. Recent advances in the Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT) architecture have demonstrated impressive success in image generation and editing tasks. Unlike cross-attention, MMDiT employs in-context conditioning to facilitate more direct and efficient cross-modal information exchange. In this paper, we propose MMMamba, a cross-modal in-context fusion framework for pan-sharpening, with the flexibility to support image super-resolution in a zero-shot manner. Built upon the Mamba architecture, our design ensures linear computational complexity while maintaining strong cross-modal interaction capacity. Furthermore, we introduce a novel multimodal interleaved (MI) scanning mechanism that facilitates effective information exchange between the PAN and MS modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques across multiple tasks and benchmarks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) significantly enhances the reasoning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs). Current RLVR approaches typically conduct training across all generated tokens, but neglect to explore which tokens (e.g., prefix tokens) actually contribute to reasoning. This uniform training strategy spends substantial effort on optimizing low-return tokens, which in turn impedes the potential improvement from high-return tokens and reduces overall training effectiveness. To address this issue, we propose a novel RLVR approach called Progressive Prefix-token Policy Optimization (PPPO), which highlights the significance of the prefix segment of generated outputs. Specifically, inspired by the well-established human thinking theory of Path Dependence, where early-stage thoughts substantially constrain subsequent thinking trajectory, we identify an analogous phenomenon in LLM reasoning termed Beginning Lock-in Effect (BLE). PPPO leverages this finding by focusing its optimization objective on the prefix reasoning process of LLMs. This targeted optimization strategy can positively influence subsequent reasoning processes, and ultimately improve final results. To improve the learning effectiveness of LLMs on how to start reasoning with high quality, PPPO introduces two training strategies: (a) Progressive Prefix Retention, which shapes a progressive learning process by increasing the proportion of retained prefix tokens during training; (b) Continuation Accumulated Reward, which mitigates reward bias by sampling multiple continuations for one prefix token sequence, and accumulating their scores as the reward signal. Extensive experimental results on various reasoning tasks demonstrate that our proposed PPPO outperforms representative RLVR methods, with the accuracy improvements of 18.02% on only 26.17% training tokens.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, attack, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Adversary emulation is an essential procedure for cybersecurity assessments such as evaluating an organization's security posture or facilitating structured training and research in dedicated environments. To allow for systematic and time-efficient assessments, several approaches from academia and industry have worked towards the automation of adversarial actions. However, they exhibit significant limitations regarding autonomy, tactics coverage, and real-world applicability. Consequently, adversary emulation remains a predominantly manual task requiring substantial human effort and security expertise - even amidst the rise of Large Language Models. In this paper, we present Bounty Hunter, an automated adversary emulation method, designed and implemented as an open-source plugin for the popular adversary emulation platform Caldera, that enables autonomous emulation of adversaries with multi-faceted behavior while providing a wide coverage of tactics. To this end, it realizes diverse adversarial behavior, such as different levels of detectability and varying attack paths across repeated emulations. By autonomously compromising a simulated enterprise network, Bounty Hunter showcases its ability to achieve given objectives without prior knowledge of its target, including pre-compromise, initial compromise, and post-compromise attack tactics. Overall, Bounty Hunter facilitates autonomous, comprehensive, and multi-faceted adversary emulation to help researchers and practitioners in performing realistic and time-efficient security assessments, training exercises, and intrusion detection research.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The increasing number of cyber threats and rapidly evolving tactics, as well as the high volume of data in recent years, have caused classical machine learning, rules, and signature-based defence strategies to fail, rendering them unable to keep up. An alternative, Quantum Machine Learning (QML), has recently emerged, making use of computations based on quantum mechanics. It offers better encoding and processing of high-dimensional structures for certain problems. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of QML techniques relevant to the domain of security, such as Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs), Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVMs), Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs), and Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (QGANs), and discusses the contributions of this paper in relation to existing research in the field and how it improves over them. It also maps these methods across supervised, unsupervised, and generative learning paradigms, and to core cybersecurity tasks, including intrusion and anomaly detection, malware and botnet classification, and encrypted-traffic analytics. It also discusses their application in the domain of cloud computing security, where QML can enhance secure and scalable operations. Many limitations of QML in the domain of cybersecurity have also been discussed, along with the directions for addressing them.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in interactive systems necessitates a deep alignment with the nuanced and dynamic preferences of individual users. Current alignment techniques predominantly address universal human values or static, single-turn preferences, thereby failing to address the critical needs of long-term personalization and the initial user cold-start problem. To bridge this gap, we propose PersonalAgent, a novel user-centric lifelong agent designed to continuously infer and adapt to user preferences. PersonalAgent constructs and dynamically refines a unified user profile by decomposing dialogues into single-turn interactions, framing preference inference as a sequential decision-making task. Experiments show that PersonalAgent achieves superior performance over strong prompt-based and policy optimization baselines, not only in idealized but also in noisy conversational contexts, while preserving cross-session preference consistency. Furthermore, human evaluation confirms that PersonalAgent excels at capturing user preferences naturally and coherently. Our findings underscore the importance of lifelong personalization for developing more inclusive and adaptive conversational agents. Our code is available here.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative, large language model, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) with image level labels aims to produce pixel level predictions without requiring dense annotations. While recent approaches have leveraged generative models to augment existing data, they remain dependent on real world training samples. In this paper, we introduce a novel direction, Zero Shot Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (ZSWSSS), and propose SynthSeg Agents, a multi agent framework driven by Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate synthetic training data entirely without real images. SynthSeg Agents comprises two key modules, a Self Refine Prompt Agent and an Image Generation Agent. The Self Refine Prompt Agent autonomously crafts diverse and semantically rich image prompts via iterative refinement, memory mechanisms, and prompt space exploration, guided by CLIP based similarity and nearest neighbor diversity filtering. These prompts are then passed to the Image Generation Agent, which leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) to synthesize candidate images. A frozen CLIP scoring model is employed to select high quality samples, and a ViT based classifier is further trained to relabel the entire synthetic dataset with improved semantic precision. Our framework produces high quality training data without any real image supervision. Experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 and COCO 2014 show that SynthSeg Agents achieves competitive performance without using real training images. This highlights the potential of LLM driven agents in enabling cost efficient and scalable semantic segmentation.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present the first cross-modality distillation framework specifically tailored for single-panoramic-camera Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) segmentation. Our approach leverages a novel LiDAR image representation fused from range, intensity and ambient channels, together with a voxel-aligned view transformer that preserves spatial fidelity while enabling efficient BEV processing. During training, a high-capacity LiDAR and camera fusion Teacher network extracts both rich spatial and semantic features for cross-modality knowledge distillation into a lightweight Student network that relies solely on a single 360-degree panoramic camera image. Extensive experiments on the Dur360BEV dataset demonstrate that our teacher model significantly outperforms existing camera-based BEV segmentation methods, achieving a 25.6\% IoU improvement. Meanwhile, the distilled Student network attains competitive performance with an 8.5\% IoU gain and state-of-the-art inference speed of 31.2 FPS. Moreover, evaluations on KITTI-360 (two fisheye cameras) confirm that our distillation framework generalises to diverse camera setups, underscoring its feasibility and robustness. This approach reduces sensor complexity and deployment costs while providing a practical solution for efficient, low-cost BEV segmentation in real-world autonomous driving.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Extracting structured information from zeolite synthesis experimental procedures is critical for materials discovery, yet existing methods have not systematically evaluated Large Language Models (LLMs) for this domain-specific task. This work addresses a fundamental question: what is the efficacy of different prompting strategies when applying LLMs to scientific information extraction? We focus on four key subtasks: event type classification (identifying synthesis steps), trigger text identification (locating event mentions), argument role extraction (recognizing parameter types), and argument text extraction (extracting parameter values). We evaluate four prompting strategies - zero-shot, few-shot, event-specific, and reflection-based - across six state-of-the-art LLMs (Gemma-3-12b-it, GPT-5-mini, O4-mini, Claude-Haiku-3.5, DeepSeek reasoning and non-reasoning) using the ZSEE dataset of 1,530 annotated sentences. Results demonstrate strong performance on event type classification (80-90\% F1) but modest performance on fine-grained extraction tasks, particularly argument role and argument text extraction (50-65\% F1). GPT-5-mini exhibits extreme prompt sensitivity with 11-79\% F1 variation. Notably, advanced prompting strategies provide minimal improvements over zero-shot approaches, revealing fundamental architectural limitations. Error analysis identifies systematic hallucination, over-generalization, and inability to capture synthesis-specific nuances. Our findings demonstrate that while LLMs achieve high-level understanding, precise extraction of experimental parameters requires domain-adapted models, providing quantitative benchmarks for scientific information extraction.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Motion artifacts degrade MRI image quality and increase patient recalls. Existing automated quality assessment methods are largely limited to binary decisions and provide little interpretability. We introduce AutoMAC-MRI, an explainable framework for grading motion artifacts across heterogeneous MR contrasts and orientations. The approach uses supervised contrastive learning to learn a discriminative representation of motion severity. Within this feature space, we compute grade-specific affinity scores that quantify an image's proximity to each motion grade, thereby making grade assignments transparent and interpretable. We evaluate AutoMAC-MRI on more than 5000 expert-annotated brain MRI slices spanning multiple contrasts and views. Experiments assessing affinity scores against expert labels show that the scores align well with expert judgment, supporting their use as an interpretable measure of motion severity. By coupling accurate grade detection with per-grade affinity scoring, AutoMAC-MRI enables inline MRI quality control, with the potential to reduce unnecessary rescans and improve workflow efficiency.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Few-shot anomaly detection (FSAD) denotes the identification of anomalies within a target category with a limited number of normal samples. Existing FSAD methods largely rely on pre-trained feature representations to detect anomalies, but the inherent domain gap between pre-trained representations and target FSAD scenarios is often overlooked. This study proposes a Prototypical Learning Guided Context-Aware Segmentation Network (PCSNet) to address the domain gap, thereby improving feature descriptiveness in target scenarios and enhancing FSAD performance. In particular, PCSNet comprises a prototypical feature adaption (PFA) sub-network and a context-aware segmentation (CAS) sub-network. PFA extracts prototypical features as guidance to ensure better feature compactness for normal data while distinct separation from anomalies. A pixel-level disparity classification loss is also designed to make subtle anomalies more distinguishable. Then a CAS sub-network is introduced for pixel-level anomaly localization, where pseudo anomalies are exploited to facilitate the training process. Experimental results on MVTec and MPDD demonstrate the superior FSAD performance of PCSNet, with 94.9% and 80.2% image-level AUROC in an 8-shot scenario, respectively. Real-world applications on automotive plastic part inspection further demonstrate that PCSNet can achieve promising results with limited training samples. Code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Capabilities and the number of vision-based models are increasing rapidly. And these vision models are now able to do more tasks like object detection, image classification, instance segmentation etc. with great accuracy. But models which can take accurate quantitative measurements form an image, as a human can do by just looking at it, are rare. For a robot to work with complete autonomy in a Laboratory environment, it needs to have some basic skills like navigation, handling objects, preparing samples etc. to match human-like capabilities in an unstructured environment. Another important capability is to read measurements from instruments and apparatus. Here, we tried to mimic a human inspired approach to read measurements from a linear scale. As a test case we have picked reading level from a syringe and a measuring cylinder. For a randomly oriented syringe we carry out transformations to correct the orientation. To make the system efficient and robust, the area of interest is reduced to just the linear scale containing part of the image. After that, a series of features were extracted like the major makers, the corresponding digits, and the level indicator location, from which the final reading was calculated. Readings obtained using this system were also compared against human read values of the same instances and an accurate correspondence was observed.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This study applies Brookes' Measure of Categorical Dispersion ({\Delta}) to analyze the thematic structure of contemporary Arabic Applied Linguistics research. Using a comprehensive, real-world dataset of 1,564 publications from 2019 to 2025, classified into eight core sub-disciplines, we calculate a dispersion index of {\Delta} = 0.194. This remarkably low value indicates extreme thematic dispersion, revealing that the field is characterized by pronounced heterogeneity rather than concentration. The analysis identifies Computational Linguistics as a dominant but non-hegemonic force, coexisting with robust research in Sociolinguistics, Language Teaching, and other subfields. This study clarifies the correct application of Brookes' original formula, demonstrates its utility for field characterization, and provides a replicable bibliometric methodology for assessing disciplinary structure across domains.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, protect, attack, membership infer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep neural networks are widely deployed with quantization techniques to reduce memory and computational costs by lowering the numerical precision of their parameters. While quantization alters model parameters and their outputs, existing privacy analyses primarily focus on full-precision models, leaving a gap in understanding how bit-width reduction can affect privacy leakage. We present the first systematic study of the privacy-utility relationship in post-training quantization (PTQ), a versatile family of methods that can be applied to pretrained models without further training. Using membership inference attacks as our evaluation framework, we analyze three popular PTQ algorithms-AdaRound, BRECQ, and OBC-across multiple precision levels (4-bit, 2-bit, and 1.58-bit) on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet datasets. Our findings consistently show that low-precision PTQs can reduce privacy leakage. In particular, lower-precision models demonstrate up to an order of magnitude reduction in membership inference vulnerability compared to their full-precision counterparts, albeit at the cost of decreased utility. Additional ablation studies on the 1.58-bit quantization level show that quantizing only the last layer at higher precision enables fine-grained control over the privacy-utility trade-off. These results offer actionable insights for practitioners to balance efficiency, utility, and privacy protection in real-world deployments.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Human conversation involves continuous exchanges of speech and nonverbal cues such as head nods, gaze shifts, and facial expressions that convey attention and emotion. Modeling these bidirectional dynamics in 3D is essential for building expressive avatars and interactive robots. However, existing frameworks often treat talking and listening as independent processes or rely on non-causal full-sequence modeling, hindering temporal coherence across turns. We present TIMAR (Turn-level Interleaved Masked AutoRegression), a causal framework for 3D conversational head generation that models dialogue as interleaved audio-visual contexts. It fuses multimodal information within each turn and applies turn-level causal attention to accumulate conversational history, while a lightweight diffusion head predicts continuous 3D head dynamics that captures both coordination and expressive variability. Experiments on the DualTalk benchmark show that TIMAR reduces Fréchet Distance and MSE by 15-30% on the test set, and achieves similar gains on out-of-distribution data.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Predictive maintenance of rotating machinery increasingly relies on vibration signals, yet most learning-based approaches either discard phase during spectral feature extraction or use raw time-waveforms without explicitly leveraging phase information. This paper introduces two phase-aware preprocessing strategies to address random phase variations in multi-axis vibration data: (1) three-axis independent phase adjustment that aligns each axis individually to zero phase (2) single-axis reference phase adjustment that preserves inter-axis relationships by applying uniform time shifts. Using a newly constructed rotor dataset acquired with a synchronized three-axis sensor, we evaluate six deep learning architectures under a two-stage learning framework. Results demonstrate architecture-independent improvements: the three-axis independent method achieves consistent gains (+2.7\% for Transformer), while the single-axis reference approach delivers superior performance with up to 96.2\% accuracy (+5.4\%) by preserving spatial phase relationships. These findings establish both phase alignment strategies as practical and scalable enhancements for predictive maintenance systems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is a powerful technique for aligning generative models, but its effectiveness is bottlenecked by the conflict between large group sizes and prohibitive computational costs. In this work, we investigate the trade-off through empirical studies, yielding two key observations. First, we discover the reward clustering phenomenon in which many trajectories collapse toward the group-mean reward, offering limited optimization value. Second, we design a heuristic strategy named Optimal Variance Filtering (OVF), and verify that a high-variance subset of trajectories, selected by OVF can outperform the larger, unfiltered group. However, this static, post-sampling OVF approach still necessitates critical computational overhead, as it performs unnecessary sampling for trajectories that are ultimately discarded. To resolve this, we propose Pro-GRPO (Proactive GRPO), a novel dynamic framework that integrates latent feature-based trajectory pruning into the sampling process. Through the early termination of reward-clustered trajectories, Pro-GRPO reduces computational overhead. Leveraging its efficiency, Pro-GRPO employs an "Expand-and-Prune" strategy. This strategy first expands the size of initial sampling group to maximize trajectory diversity, then it applies multi-step OVF to the latents, avoiding prohibitive computational costs. Extensive experiments on both diffusion-based and flow-based models demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of our Pro-GRPO framework.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent evidence shows that the versification of prompts constitutes a highly effective adversarial mechanism against aligned LLMs. The study 'Adversarial poetry as a universal single-turn jailbreak mechanism in large language models' demonstrates that instructions routinely refused in prose become executable when rewritten as verse, producing up to 18 x more safety failures in benchmarks derived from MLCommons AILuminate. Manually written poems reach approximately 62% ASR, and automated versions 43%, with some models surpassing 90% success in single-turn interactions. The effect is structural: systems trained with RLHF, constitutional AI, and hybrid pipelines exhibit consistent degradation under minimal semiotic formal variation. Versification displaces the prompt into sparsely supervised latent regions, revealing guardrails that are excessively dependent on surface patterns. This dissociation between apparent robustness and real vulnerability exposes deep limitations in current alignment regimes. The absence of evaluations in Portuguese, a language with high morphosyntactic complexity, a rich metric-prosodic tradition, and over 250 million speakers, constitutes a critical gap. Experimental protocols must parameterise scansion, metre, and prosodic variation to test vulnerabilities specific to Lusophone patterns, which are currently ignored.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in complex reasoning tasks. However, current approaches employ uniform language density for both intermediate reasoning and final answers, leading to computational inefficiency. Our observation found that reasoning process serves a computational function for the model itself, while answering serves a communicative function for human understanding. This distinction enables the use of compressed, symbol-rich language for intermediate computations while maintaining human-readable final explanations. To address this inefficiency, we present Denser: \underline{D}ual-d\underline{ens}ity inf\underline{er}ence, a novel framework that optimizes information density separately for reasoning and answering phases. Our framework implements this through three components: a query processing module that analyzes input problems, a high-density compressed reasoning mechanism for efficient intermediate computations, and an answer generation component that translates compressed reasoning into human-readable solutions. Experimental evaluation across multiple reasoning question answering benchmarks demonstrates that Denser reduces token consumption by up to 62\% compared to standard Chain-of-Thought methods while preserving or improving accuracy. These efficiency gains are particularly significant for complex multi-step reasoning problems where traditional methods generate extensive explanations.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose a novel dataset that has been specifically designed for 3D semantic segmentation of bridges and the domain gap analysis caused by varying sensors. This addresses a critical need in the field of infrastructure inspection and maintenance, which is essential for modern society. The dataset comprises high-resolution 3D scans of a diverse range of bridge structures from various countries, with detailed semantic labels provided for each. Our initial objective is to facilitate accurate and automated segmentation of bridge components, thereby advancing the structural health monitoring practice. To evaluate the effectiveness of existing 3D deep learning models on this novel dataset, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of three distinct state-of-the-art architectures. Furthermore, we present data acquired through diverse sensors to quantify the domain gap resulting from sensor variations. Our findings indicate that all architectures demonstrate robust performance on the specified task. However, the domain gap can potentially lead to a decline in the performance of up to 11.4% mIoU.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>protect, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The growing penetration of renewable and distributed generation is transforming power systems and challenging conventional protection schemes that rely on fixed settings and local measurements. Machine learning (ML) offers a data-driven alternative for centralized fault classification (FC) and fault localization (FL), enabling faster and more adaptive decision-making. However, practical deployment critically depends on robustness. Protection algorithms must remain reliable even when confronted with missing, noisy, or degraded sensor data. This work introduces a unified framework for systematically evaluating the robustness of ML models in power system protection. High-fidelity EMT simulations are used to model realistic degradation scenarios, including sensor outages, reduced sampling rates, and transient communication losses. The framework provides a consistent methodology for benchmarking models, quantifying the impact of limited observability, and identifying critical measurement channels required for resilient operation. Results show that FC remains highly stable under most degradation types but drops by about 13% under single-phase loss, while FL is more sensitive overall, with voltage loss increasing localization error by over 150%. These findings offer actionable guidance for robustness-aware design of future ML-assisted protection systems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Intelligent electronics are deeply embedded in critical infrastructures and must remain reliable, particularly against deliberate attacks. To minimize risks and impede remote compromise, sensitive systems can be physically isolated from external networks, forming an airgap. Yet, airgaps can still be infiltrated by capable adversaries gaining code execution. Prior research has shown that attackers can then attempt to wirelessly exfiltrate data across the airgap by exploiting unintended radio emissions. In this work, we demonstrate reversal of this link: malicious code execution on embedded devices can enable wireless infiltration of airgapped systems without any hardware modification. In contrast to previous infiltration methods that depend on dedicated sensors (e.g., microphones, LEDs, or temperature sensors) or require strict line-of-sight, we show that unmodified, sensor-less embedded devices can inadvertently act as radio receivers. This phenomenon stems from parasitic RF sensitivity in PCB traces and on-chip analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), allowing external transmissions to be received and decoded entirely in software. Across twelve commercially available embedded devices and two custom prototypes, we observe repeatable reception in the 300-1000 MHz range, with detectable signal power as low as 1 mW. To this end, we propose a systematic methodology to identify device configurations that foster such radio sensitivities and comprehensively evaluate their feasibility for wireless data reception. Exploiting these sensitivities, we demonstrate successful data reception over tens of meters, even in non-line-of-sight conditions and show that the reception sensitivities accommodate data rates of up to 100 kbps. Our findings reveal a previously unexplored command-and-control vector for air-gapped systems while challenging assumptions about their inherent isolation. [shortened]</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Detecting packed executables is a critical step in malware analysis, as packing obscures the original code and complicates static inspection. This study evaluates both classical feature-based methods and deep learning approaches that transform binary executables into visual representations, specifically, grayscale byte plots, and employ convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for automated classification of packed and non-packed binaries. A diverse dataset of benign and malicious Portable Executable (PE) files, packed using various commercial and open-source packers, was curated to capture a broad spectrum of packing transformations and obfuscation techniques. Classical models using handcrafted Gabor jet features achieved intense discrimination at moderate computational cost. In contrast, CNNs based on VGG16 and DenseNet121 significantly outperformed them, achieving high detection performance with well-balanced precision, recall, and F1-scores. DenseNet121 demonstrated slightly higher precision and lower false positive rates, whereas VGG16 achieved marginally higher recall, indicating complementary strengths for practical deployment. Evaluation against unknown packers confirmed robust generalization, demonstrating that grayscale byte-plot representations combined with deep learning provide a useful and reliable approach for early detection of packed malware, enhancing malware analysis pipelines and supporting automated antivirus inspection.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Monocular depth foundation models achieve remarkable generalization by learning large-scale semantic priors, but this creates a critical vulnerability: they hallucinate illusory 3D structures from geometrically planar but perceptually ambiguous inputs. We term this failure the 3D Mirage. This paper introduces the first end-to-end framework to probe, quantify, and tame this unquantified safety risk. To probe, we present 3D-Mirage, the first benchmark of real-world illusions (e.g., street art) with precise planar-region annotations and context-restricted crops. To quantify, we propose a Laplacian-based evaluation framework with two metrics: the Deviation Composite Score (DCS) for spurious non-planarity and the Confusion Composite Score (CCS) for contextual instability. To tame this failure, we introduce Grounded Self-Distillation, a parameter-efficient strategy that surgically enforces planarity on illusion ROIs while using a frozen teacher to preserve background knowledge, thus avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Our work provides the essential tools to diagnose and mitigate this phenomenon, urging a necessary shift in MDE evaluation from pixel-wise accuracy to structural and contextual robustness. Our code and benchmark will be publicly available to foster this exciting research direction.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in multimodal large language models unlock unprecedented opportunities for GUI automation. However, a fundamental challenge remains: how to efficiently acquire high-quality training data while maintaining annotation reliability? We introduce a self-evolving training pipeline powered by the Calibrated Step Reward System, which converts model-generated trajectories into reliable training signals through trajectory-level calibration, achieving >90% annotation accuracy with 10-100x lower cost. Leveraging this pipeline, we introduce Step-GUI, a family of models (4B/8B) that achieves state-of-the-art GUI performance (8B: 80.2% AndroidWorld, 48.5% OSWorld, 62.6% ScreenShot-Pro) while maintaining robust general capabilities. As GUI agent capabilities improve, practical deployment demands standardized interfaces across heterogeneous devices while protecting user privacy. To this end, we propose GUI-MCP, the first Model Context Protocol for GUI automation with hierarchical architecture that combines low-level atomic operations and high-level task delegation to local specialist models, enabling high-privacy execution where sensitive data stays on-device. Finally, to assess whether agents can handle authentic everyday usage, we introduce AndroidDaily, a benchmark grounded in real-world mobile usage patterns with 3146 static actions and 235 end-to-end tasks across high-frequency daily scenarios (8B: static 89.91%, end-to-end 52.50%). Our work advances the development of practical GUI agents and demonstrates strong potential for real-world deployment in everyday digital interactions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Face recognition systems store face templates for efficient matching. Once leaked, these templates pose a threat: inverting them can yield photorealistic surrogates that compromise privacy and enable impersonation. Although existing research has achieved relatively realistic face template inversion, the reconstructed facial images exhibit over-smoothed facial-part attributes (eyes, nose, mouth) and limited transferability. To address this problem, we present CLIP-FTI, a CLIP-driven fine-grained attribute conditioning framework for face template inversion. Our core idea is to use the CLIP model to obtain the semantic embeddings of facial features, in order to realize the reconstruction of specific facial feature attributes. Specifically, facial feature attribute embeddings extracted from CLIP are fused with the leaked template via a cross-modal feature interaction network and projected into the intermediate latent space of a pretrained StyleGAN. The StyleGAN generator then synthesizes face images with the same identity as the templates but with more fine-grained facial feature attributes. Experiments across multiple face recognition backbones and datasets show that our reconstructions (i) achieve higher identification accuracy and attribute similarity, (ii) recover sharper component-level attribute semantics, and (iii) improve cross-model attack transferability compared to prior reconstruction attacks. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first method to use additional information besides the face template attack to realize face template inversion and obtains SOTA results.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Automated extraction of individual plant branches from time-series imagery is essential for high-throughput phenotyping, yet it remains computationally challenging due to non-rigid growth dynamics and severe identity fragmentation within entangled canopies. To overcome these stage-dependent ambiguities, we propose ST-DETrack, a spatiotemporal-fusion dual-decoder network designed to preserve branch identity from budding to flowering. Our architecture integrates a spatial decoder, which leverages geometric priors such as position and angle for early-stage tracking, with a temporal decoder that exploits motion consistency to resolve late-stage occlusions. Crucially, an adaptive gating mechanism dynamically shifts reliance between these spatial and temporal cues, while a biological constraint based on negative gravitropism mitigates vertical growth ambiguities. Validated on a Brassica napus dataset, ST-DETrack achieves a Branch Matching Accuracy (BMA) of 93.6%, significantly outperforming spatial and temporal baselines by 28.9 and 3.3 percentage points, respectively. These results demonstrate the method's robustness in maintaining long-term identity consistency amidst complex, dynamic plant architectures.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Background: Motivational interviewing (MI) is an effective counseling approach for promoting health behavior change, but its impact is constrained by the need for highly trained human counselors. Objective: This study aimed to explore a scalable alternative by developing and evaluating Large Language Models for Motivational Interviewing (MI-LLMs). Methods: We first curated five Chinese psychological counseling corpora and, using GPT-4 with an MI-informed prompt, transcribed multi-turn dialogues from the two highest-quality datasets (CPsyCounD and PsyDTCorpus) into 2,040 MI-style counseling conversations, of which 2,000 were used for training and 40 for testing. Three Chinese-capable open-source LLMs (Baichuan2-7B-Chat, ChatGLM-4-9B-Chat and Llama-3-8B-Chinese-Chat-v2) were fine-tuned on this corpus and were named as MI-LLMs. We evaluated MI-LLMs using round-based automatic metrics and expert manual coding with the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI) Coding Manual 4.2.1. Results: Across all three models, fine-tuning substantially improved BLEU-4 and ROUGE scores compared with the base models, and manual coding showed that MI-LLMs achieved technical and relational global scores, and MI-adherent ratios that approached those of real MI dialogues, although complex reflections and reflection-to-question ratios remained less frequent. Conclusions: These findings provide initial evidence that MI-oriented fine-tuning can endow general-purpose LLMs with core MI-consistent counseling behaviors, suggesting a scalable pathway toward AI-assisted health behavior change support while underscoring the need for further work on data scale, complex MI skills and real-world intervention trials.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, defense, attack, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Data Reconstruction Attacks (DRA) pose a significant threat to Federated Learning (FL) systems by enabling adversaries to infer sensitive training data from local clients. Despite extensive research, the question of how to characterize and assess the risk of DRAs in FL systems remains unresolved due to the lack of a theoretically-grounded risk quantification framework. In this work, we address this gap by introducing Invertibility Loss (InvLoss) to quantify the maximum achievable effectiveness of DRAs for a given data instance and FL model. We derive a tight and computable upper bound for InvLoss and explore its implications from three perspectives. First, we show that DRA risk is governed by the spectral properties of the Jacobian matrix of exchanged model updates or feature embeddings, providing a unified explanation for the effectiveness of defense methods. Second, we develop InvRE, an InvLoss-based DRA risk estimator that offers attack method-agnostic, comprehensive risk evaluation across data instances and model architectures. Third, we propose two adaptive noise perturbation defenses that enhance FL privacy without harming classification accuracy. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate our framework, demonstrating its potential for systematic DRA risk evaluation and mitigation in FL systems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As machine learning models are increasingly deployed in high-stakes settings, e.g. as decision support systems in various societal sectors or in critical infrastructure, designers and auditors are facing the need to ensure that models satisfy a wider variety of requirements (e.g. compliance with regulations, fairness, computational constraints) beyond performance. Although most of them are the subject of ongoing studies, typical approaches face critical challenges: post-processing methods tend to compromise performance, which is often counteracted by fine-tuning or, worse, training from scratch, an often time-consuming or even unavailable strategy. This raises the following question: "Can we efficiently edit models to satisfy requirements, without sacrificing their utility?" In this work, we approach this with a unifying framework, in a data-driven manner, i.e. we learn to edit neural networks (NNs), where the editor is an NN itself - a graph metanetwork - and editing amounts to a single inference step. In particular, the metanetwork is trained on NN populations to minimise an objective consisting of two terms: the requirement to be enforced and the preservation of the NN's utility. We experiment with diverse tasks (the data minimisation principle, bias mitigation and weight pruning) improving the trade-offs between performance, requirement satisfaction and time efficiency compared to popular post-processing or re-training alternatives.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>protect, extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Wildlife object detection plays a vital role in biodiversity conservation, ecological monitoring, and habitat protection. However, this task is often challenged by environmental variability, visual similarities among species, and intra-class diversity. This study investigates the effectiveness of two individual deep learning architectures ResNet-101 and Inception v3 for wildlife object detection under such complex conditions. The models were trained and evaluated on a wildlife image dataset using a standardized preprocessing approach, which included resizing images to a maximum dimension of 800 pixels, converting them to RGB format, and transforming them into PyTorch tensors. A ratio of 70:30 training and validation split was used for model development. The ResNet-101 model achieved a classification accuracy of 94% and a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.91, showing strong performance in extracting deep hierarchical features. The Inception v3 model performed slightly better, attaining a classification accuracy of 95% and a mAP of 0.92, attributed to its efficient multi-scale feature extraction through parallel convolutions. Despite the strong results, both models exhibited challenges when detecting species with similar visual characteristics or those captured under poor lighting and occlusion. Nonetheless, the findings confirm that both ResNet-101 and Inception v3 are effective models for wildlife object detection tasks and provide a reliable foundation for conservation-focused computer vision applications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Estimating 3D human poses from 2D images remains challenging due to occlusions and projective ambiguity. Multi-view learning-based approaches mitigate these issues but often fail to generalize to real-world scenarios, as large-scale multi-view datasets with 3D ground truth are scarce and captured under constrained conditions. To overcome this limitation, recent methods rely on 2D pose estimation combined with 2D-to-3D pose lifting trained on synthetic data. Building on our previous MPL framework, we propose RUMPL, a transformer-based 3D pose lifter that introduces a 3D ray-based representation of 2D keypoints. This formulation makes the model independent of camera calibration and the number of views, enabling universal deployment across arbitrary multi-view configurations without retraining or fine-tuning. A new View Fusion Transformer leverages learned fused-ray tokens to aggregate information along rays, further improving multi-view consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RUMPL reduces MPJPE by up to 53% compared to triangulation and over 60% compared to transformer-based image-representation baselines. Results on new benchmarks, including in-the-wild multi-view and multi-person datasets, confirm its robustness and scalability. The framework's source code is available at this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We consider two conceptually different approaches for assessing the reliability of the individual predictions of a classifier: Robustness Quantification (RQ) and Uncertainty Quantification (UQ). We compare both approaches on a number of benchmark datasets and show that there is no clear winner between the two, but that they are complementary and can be combined to obtain a hybrid approach that outperforms both RQ and UQ. As a byproduct of our approach, for each dataset, we also obtain an assessment of the relative importance of uncertainty and robustness as sources of unreliability.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Equivariance is a powerful prior for learning physical dynamics, yet exact group equivariance can degrade performance if the symmetries are broken. We propose object-centric world models built with geometric algebra neural networks, providing a soft geometric inductive bias. Our models are evaluated using simulated environments of 2d rigid body dynamics with static obstacles, where we train for next-step predictions autoregressively. For long-horizon rollouts we show that the soft inductive bias of our models results in better performance in terms of physical fidelity compared to non-equivariant baseline models. The approach complements recent soft-equivariance ideas and aligns with the view that simple, well-chosen priors can yield robust generalization. These results suggest that geometric algebra offers an effective middle ground between hand-crafted physics and unstructured deep nets, delivering sample-efficient dynamics models for multi-object scenes.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, security, attack, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vehicular platooning promises transformative improvements in transportation efficiency and safety through the coordination of multi-vehicle formations enabled by Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication. However, the distributed nature of platoon coordination creates security vulnerabilities, allowing authenticated vehicles to inject falsified kinematic data, compromise operational stability, and pose a threat to passenger safety. Traditional misbehaviour detection approaches, which rely on plausibility checks and statistical methods, suffer from high False Positive (FP) rates and cannot capture the complex temporal dependencies inherent in multi-vehicle coordination dynamics. We present Attention In Motion (AIMformer), a transformer-based framework specifically tailored for real-time misbehaviour detection in vehicular platoons with edge deployment capabilities. AIMformer leverages multi-head self-attention mechanisms to simultaneously capture intra-vehicle temporal dynamics and inter-vehicle spatial correlations. It incorporates global positional encoding with vehicle-specific temporal offsets to handle join/exit maneuvers. We propose a Precision-Focused (BCE) loss function that penalizes FPs to meet the requirements of safety-critical vehicular systems. Extensive evaluation across 4 platoon controllers, multiple attack vectors, and diverse mobility scenarios demonstrates superior performance ($\geq$ 0.93) compared to state-of-the-art baseline architectures. A comprehensive deployment analysis utilizing TensorFlow Lite (TFLite), Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX), and TensorRT achieves sub-millisecond inference latency, making it suitable for real-time operation on resource-constrained edge platforms. Hence, validating AIMformer is viable for both in-vehicle and roadside infrastructure deployment.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>I2P (Invisible Internet Project) is a popular anonymous communication network. While existing de-anonymization methods for I2P focus on identifying potential traffic patterns of target hidden services among extensive network traffic, they often fail to scale effectively across the large and diverse I2P network, which consists of numerous routers. In this paper, we introduce I2PERCEPTION a low-cost approach revealing the IP addresses of I2P hidden services. In I2PERCEPTION, attackers deploy floodfill routers to passively monitor I2P routers and collect their RouterInfo. We analyze the router information publication mechanism to accurately identify routers' join (i.e. on) and leave (i.e. off) behaviors, enabling fine-grained live behavior inference across the I2P network. Active probing is used to obtain the live behavior (i.e., on-off patterns) of a target hidden service hosted on one of the I2P routers. By correlating the live behaviors of the target hidden service and I2P routers over time, we narrow down the set of routers matching the hidden service's behavior, revealing the hidden service's true network identity for de-anonymization. Through the deployment of only 15 floodfill routers over the course of eight months, we validate the precision and effectiveness of our approach with extensive real-world experiments. Our results show that I2PERCEPTION successfully de-anonymizes all controlled hidden services.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>explainability, transformer, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in AI-driven image generation have introduced new challenges for verifying the authenticity of digital evidence in forensic investigations. Modern generative models can produce visually consistent forgeries that evade traditional detectors based on pixel or compression artefacts. Most existing approaches also lack an explicit measure of anomaly intensity, which limits their ability to quantify the severity of manipulation. This paper introduces Vision-Attention Anomaly Scoring (VAAS), a novel dual-module framework that integrates global attention-based anomaly estimation using Vision Transformers (ViT) with patch-level self-consistency scoring derived from SegFormer embeddings. The hybrid formulation provides a continuous and interpretable anomaly score that reflects both the location and degree of manipulation. Evaluations on the DF2023 and CASIA v2.0 datasets demonstrate that VAAS achieves competitive F1 and IoU performance, while enhancing visual explainability through attention-guided anomaly maps. The framework bridges quantitative detection with human-understandable reasoning, supporting transparent and reliable image integrity assessment. The source code for all experiments and corresponding materials for reproducing the results are available open source.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Portrait animation from a single source image and a driving video is a long-standing problem. Recent approaches tend to adopt diffusion-based image/video generation models for realistic and expressive animation. However, none of these diffusion models realizes high-fidelity disentangled control between the head pose and facial expression, hindering applications like expression-only or pose-only editing and animation. To address this, we propose DeX-Portrait, a novel approach capable of generating expressive portrait animation driven by disentangled pose and expression signals. Specifically, we represent the pose as an explicit global transformation and the expression as an implicit latent code. First, we design a powerful motion trainer to learn both pose and expression encoders for extracting precise and decomposed driving signals. Then we propose to inject the pose transformation into the diffusion model through a dual-branch conditioning mechanism, and the expression latent through cross attention. Finally, we design a progressive hybrid classifier-free guidance for more faithful identity consistency. Experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on both animation quality and disentangled controllability.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Visual Emotion Comprehension (VEC) aims to infer sentiment polarities or emotion categories from affective cues embedded in images. In recent years, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have established a popular paradigm in VEC, leveraging their generalizability to unify VEC tasks defined under diverse emotion taxonomies. While this paradigm achieves notable success, it typically formulates VEC as a deterministic task, requiring the model to output a single, definitive emotion label for each image. Such a formulation insufficiently accounts for the inherent subjectivity of emotion perception, overlooking alternative interpretations that may be equally plausible to different viewers. To address this limitation, we propose equipping MLLMs with capabilities to verbalize their confidence in emotion predictions. This additional signal provides users with an estimate of both the plausibility of alternative interpretations and the MLLMs' self-assessed competence, thereby enhancing reliability in practice. Building on this insight, we introduce a three-stage training framework that progressively endows with structured reasoning, teaches to verbalize confidence, and calibrates confidence expression, culminating in EmoCaliber, a confidence-aware MLLM for VEC. Through fair and comprehensive evaluations on the unified benchmark VECBench, EmoCaliber demonstrates overall superiority against existing methods in both emotion prediction and confidence estimation. These results validate the effectiveness of our approach and mark a feasible step toward more reliable VEC systems. Project page: this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The remote sensing community has recently seen the emergence of methods based on Large Vision and Language Models (LVLMs) that can address multiple tasks at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing. To fully exploit the potential of such models, a significant focus has been given to the collection of large amounts of training data that cover multiple remote sensing-specific tasks, such as image captioning or visual question answering. However, the cost of using and training LVLMs is high, due to the large number of parameters. While multiple parameter-efficient adaptation techniques have been explored, the computational costs of training and inference with these models can remain prohibitive for most institutions. In this work, we explore the use of encoder-only architectures and propose a model that can effectively address multi-task learning while remaining compact in terms of the number of parameters. In particular, our model tackles combinations of tasks that are not typically explored in a unified model: the generation of text from remote sensing images and cross-modal retrieval. The results of our GeoMELT model - named from Multi-task Efficient Learning Transformer - in established benchmarks confirm the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed approach.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Understanding the temporal evolution of sets of vectors is a fundamental challenge across various domains, including ecology, crime analysis, and linguistics. For instance, ecosystem structures evolve due to interactions among plants, herbivores, and carnivores; the spatial distribution of crimes shifts in response to societal changes; and word embedding vectors reflect cultural and semantic trends over time. However, analyzing such time-varying sets of vectors is challenging due to their complicated structures, which also evolve over time. In this work, we propose a novel method for modeling the distribution underlying each set of vectors using infinite-dimensional Gaussian processes. By approximating the latent function in the Gaussian process with Random Fourier Features, we obtain compact and comparable vector representations over time. This enables us to track and visualize temporal transitions of vector sets in a low-dimensional space. We apply our method to both sociological data (crime distributions) and linguistic data (word embeddings), demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing temporal dynamics. Our results show that the proposed approach provides interpretable and robust representations, offering a powerful framework for analyzing structural changes in temporally indexed vector sets across diverse domains.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Ensuring the ethical use of video data involving human subjects, particularly infants, requires robust anonymization methods. We propose BLANKET (Baby-face Landmark-preserving ANonymization with Keypoint dEtection consisTency), a novel approach designed to anonymize infant faces in video recordings while preserving essential facial attributes. Our method comprises two stages. First, a new random face, compatible with the original identity, is generated via inpainting using a diffusion model. Second, the new identity is seamlessly incorporated into each video frame through temporally consistent face swapping with authentic expression transfer. The method is evaluated on a dataset of short video recordings of babies and is compared to the popular anonymization method, DeepPrivacy2. Key metrics assessed include the level of de-identification, preservation of facial attributes, impact on human pose estimation (as an example of a downstream task), and presence of artifacts. Both methods alter the identity, and our method outperforms DeepPrivacy2 in all other respects. The code is available as an easy-to-use anonymization demo at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Sentiment analysis, an emerging research area within natural language processing (NLP), has primarily been explored in contexts like elections and social media trends, but there remains a significant gap in understanding emotional dynamics during civil unrest, particularly in the Bangla language. Our study pioneers sentiment analysis in Bangla during a national crisis by examining public emotions amid Bangladesh's 2024 mass uprising. We curated a unique dataset of 2,028 annotated news headlines from major Facebook news portals, classifying them into Outrage, Hope, and Despair. Through Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), we identified prevalent themes like political corruption and public protests, and analyzed how events such as internet blackouts shaped sentiment patterns. It outperformed multilingual transformers (mBERT: 67%, XLM-RoBERTa: 71%) and traditional machine learning methods (SVM and Logistic Regression: both 70%). These results highlight the effectiveness of language-specific models and offer valuable insights into public sentiment during political turmoil.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in long-context scenarios such as multi-turn conversations. However, long contexts pose significant challenges for inference efficiency, including high memory overhead from Key-Value (KV) cache and increased latency due to excessive memory accesses. Recent methods for dynamic KV selection struggle with trade-offs: block-level indexing degrades accuracy by retrieving irrelevant KV entries, while token-level indexing incurs high latency from inefficient retrieval mechanisms. In this paper, we propose CTKVR, a novel centroid-then-token KV retrieval scheme that addresses these limitations. CTKVR leverages a key observation: query vectors adjacent in position exhibit high similarity after Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) and share most of their top-k KV cache entries. Based on this insight, CTKVR employs a two-stage retrieval strategy: lightweight centroids are precomputed during prefilling for centroid-grained indexing, followed by token-level refinement for precise KV retrieval. This approach balances retrieval efficiency and accuracy. To further enhance performance, we implement an optimized system for indexing construction and search using CPU-GPU co-execution. Experimentally, CTKVR achieves superior performance across multiple benchmarks with less than 1% accuracy degradation. Meanwhile, CTKVR delivers 3 times and 4 times throughput speedups on Llama-3-8B and Yi-9B at 96K context length across diverse GPU hardware.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, diffusion, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The text encoder is a critical component of text-to-image and text-to-video diffusion models, fundamentally determining the semantic fidelity of the generated content. However, its development has been hindered by two major challenges: the lack of an efficient evaluation framework that reliably predicts downstream generation performance, and the difficulty of effectively adapting pretrained language models for visual synthesis. To address these issues, we introduce GRAN-TED, a paradigm to Generate Robust, Aligned, and Nuanced Text Embeddings for Diffusion models. Our contribution is twofold. First, we propose TED-6K, a novel text-only benchmark that enables efficient and robust assessment of an encoder's representational quality without requiring costly end-to-end model training. We demonstrate that performance on TED-6K, standardized via a lightweight, unified adapter, strongly correlates with an encoder's effectiveness in downstream generation tasks. Second, guided by this validated framework, we develop a superior text encoder using a novel two-stage training paradigm. This process involves an initial fine-tuning stage on a Multimodal Large Language Model for better visual representation, followed by a layer-wise weighting method to extract more nuanced and potent text features. Our experiments show that the resulting GRAN-TED encoder not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on TED-6K but also leads to demonstrable performance gains in text-to-image and text-to-video generation.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Remote sensing (RS) image segmentation is constrained by the limited availability of annotated data and a gap between overhead imagery and natural images used to train foundational models. This motivates effective adaptation under limited supervision. SAM3 concept-driven framework generates masks from textual prompts without requiring task-specific modifications, which may enable this adaptation. We evaluate SAM3 for RS imagery across four target types, comparing textual, geometric, and hybrid prompting strategies, under lightweight fine-tuning scales with increasing supervision, alongside zero-shot inference. Results show that combining semantic and geometric cues yields the highest performance across targets and metrics. Text-only prompting exhibits the lowest performance, with marked score gaps for irregularly shaped targets, reflecting limited semantic alignment between SAM3 textual representations and their overhead appearances. Nevertheless, textual prompting with light fine-tuning offers a practical performance-effort trade-off for geometrically regular and visually salient targets. Across targets, performance improves between zero-shot inference and fine-tuning, followed by diminishing returns as the supervision scale increases. Namely, a modest geometric annotation effort is sufficient for effective adaptation. A persistent gap between Precision and IoU further indicates that under-segmentation and boundary inaccuracies remain prevalent error patterns in RS tasks, particularly for irregular and less prevalent targets.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we focus on online zero-shot monocular 3D instance segmentation, a novel practical setting where existing approaches fail to perform because they rely on posed RGB-D sequences. To overcome this limitation, we leverage CUT3R, a recent Reconstructive Foundation Model (RFM), to provide reliable geometric priors from a single RGB stream. We propose MoonSeg3R, which introduces three key components: (1) a self-supervised query refinement module with spatial-semantic distillation that transforms segmentation masks from 2D visual foundation models (VFMs) into discriminative 3D queries; (2) a 3D query index memory that provides temporal consistency by retrieving contextual queries; and (3) a state-distribution token from CUT3R that acts as a mask identity descriptor to strengthen cross-frame fusion. Experiments on ScanNet200 and SceneNN show that MoonSeg3R is the first method to enable online monocular 3D segmentation and achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art RGB-D-based systems.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion language models are structurally well-suited for iterative error correction, as their non-causal denoising dynamics allow arbitrary positions in a sequence to be revised. However, standard masked diffusion language model (MDLM) training fails to reliably induce this behavior, as models often cannot identify unreliable tokens in a complete input, rendering confidence-guided refinement ineffective. We study corrective behavior in diffusion language models, defined as the ability to assign lower confidence to incorrect tokens and iteratively refine them while preserving correct content. We show that this capability is not induced by conventional masked diffusion objectives and propose a correction-oriented post-training principle that explicitly supervises visible incorrect tokens, enabling error-aware confidence and targeted refinement. To evaluate corrective behavior, we introduce the Code Revision Benchmark (CRB), a controllable and executable benchmark for assessing error localization and in-place correction. Experiments on code revision tasks and controlled settings demonstrate that models trained with our approach substantially outperform standard MDLMs in correction scenarios, while also improving pure completion performance.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce FlexAvatar, a method for creating high-quality and complete 3D head avatars from a single image. A core challenge lies in the limited availability of multi-view data and the tendency of monocular training to yield incomplete 3D head reconstructions. We identify the root cause of this issue as the entanglement between driving signal and target viewpoint when learning from monocular videos. To address this, we propose a transformer-based 3D portrait animation model with learnable data source tokens, so-called bias sinks, which enables unified training across monocular and multi-view datasets. This design leverages the strengths of both data sources during inference: strong generalization from monocular data and full 3D completeness from multi-view supervision. Furthermore, our training procedure yields a smooth latent avatar space that facilitates identity interpolation and flexible fitting to an arbitrary number of input observations. In extensive evaluations on single-view, few-shot, and monocular avatar creation tasks, we verify the efficacy of FlexAvatar. Many existing methods struggle with view extrapolation while FlexAvatar generates complete 3D head avatars with realistic facial animations. Website: this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Going from pure Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to a learnable graph message-passing mechanism at each layer has been foundational to state-of-the-art results, despite the computational trade-off (e.g. GATs or Transformers). To go a step further, in this work, we introduce N-simplicial attention, going from pairwise token similarity to higher-order interactions, and adapt it for Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE). To help manage the increased complexity, we propose a cost-effective simplex selection enabling the model to focus its computation load onto the more task-sensitive interactions. Beyond these core mechanisms, we study how smoothing N-simplicial attention is by deriving a Lipschitz upper-bound and by demonstrating that by itself it also suffers from over-smoothing, despite opening the attention message-passing to higher-order interactions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>defense</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Psychological defenses are strategies, often automatic, that people use to manage distress. Rigid or overuse of defenses is negatively linked to mental health and shapes what speakers disclose and how they accept or resist help. However, defenses are complex and difficult to reliably measure, particularly in clinical dialogues. We introduce PsyDefConv, a dialogue corpus with help seeker utterances labeled for defense level, and DMRS Co-Pilot, a four-stage pipeline that provides evidence-based pre-annotations. The corpus contains 200 dialogues and 4709 utterances, including 2336 help seeker turns, with labeling and Cohen's kappa 0.639. In a counterbalanced study, the co-pilot reduced average annotation time by 22.4%. In expert review, it averaged 4.62 for evidence, 4.44 for clinical plausibility, and 4.40 for insight on a seven-point scale. Benchmarks with strong language models in zero-shot and fine-tuning settings demonstrate clear headroom, with the best macro F1-score around 30% and a tendency to overpredict mature defenses. Corpus analyses confirm that mature defenses are most common and reveal emotion-specific deviations. We will release the corpus, annotations, code, and prompts to support research on defensive functioning in language.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent visual generative models often struggle with consistency during image editing due to the entangled nature of raster images, where all visual content is fused into a single canvas. In contrast, professional design tools employ layered representations, allowing isolated edits while preserving consistency. Motivated by this, we propose \textbf{Qwen-Image-Layered}, an end-to-end diffusion model that decomposes a single RGB image into multiple semantically disentangled RGBA layers, enabling \textbf{inherent editability}, where each RGBA layer can be independently manipulated without affecting other content. To support variable-length decomposition, we introduce three key components: (1) an RGBA-VAE to unify the latent representations of RGB and RGBA images; (2) a VLD-MMDiT (Variable Layers Decomposition MMDiT) architecture capable of decomposing a variable number of image layers; and (3) a Multi-stage Training strategy to adapt a pretrained image generation model into a multilayer image decomposer. Furthermore, to address the scarcity of high-quality multilayer training images, we build a pipeline to extract and annotate multilayer images from Photoshop documents (PSD). Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly surpasses existing approaches in decomposition quality and establishes a new paradigm for consistent image editing.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Autoregressive models (ARMs) currently constitute the dominant paradigm for large language models (LLMs). Energy-based models (EBMs) represent another class of models, which have historically been less prevalent in LLM development, yet naturally characterize the optimal policy in post-training alignment. In this paper, we provide a unified view of these two model classes. Taking the chain rule of probability as a starting point, we establish an explicit bijection between ARMs and EBMs in function space, which we show to correspond to a special case of the soft Bellman equation in maximum entropy reinforcement learning. Building upon this bijection, we derive the equivalence between supervised learning of ARMs and EBMs. Furthermore, we analyze the distillation of EBMs into ARMs by providing theoretical error bounds. Our results provide insights into the ability of ARMs to plan ahead, despite being based on the next-token prediction paradigm.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Estimating camera intrinsics and extrinsics is a fundamental problem in computer vision, and while advances in structure-from-motion (SfM) have improved accuracy and robustness, open challenges remain. In this paper, we introduce a robust method for pose estimation and calibration. We consider a set of rigid cameras, each observing the scene from a different perspective, which is a typical camera setup in animal behavior studies and forensic analysis of surveillance footage. Specifically, we analyse the individual components in a structure-from-motion (SfM) pipeline, and identify design choices that improve accuracy. Our main contributions are: (1) we investigate how to best subsample the predicted correspondences from a dense matcher to leverage them in the estimation process. (2) We investigate selection criteria for how to add the views incrementally. In a rigorous quantitative evaluation, we show the effectiveness of our changes, especially for cameras with strong radial distortion (79.9% ours vs. 40.4 vanilla VGGT). Finally, we demonstrate our correspondence subsampling in a global SfM setting where we initialize the poses using VGGT. The proposed pipeline generalizes across a wide range of camera setups, and could thus become a useful tool for animal behavior and forensic analysis.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in explainable recommendations have explored the integration of language models to analyze natural language rationales for user-item interactions. Despite their potential, existing methods often rely on ID-based representations that obscure semantic meaning and impose structural constraints on language models, thereby limiting their applicability in open-ended scenarios. These challenges are intensified by the complex nature of real-world interactions, where diverse user intents are entangled and collaborative signals rarely align with linguistic semantics. To overcome these limitations, we propose BEAT, a unified and transferable framework that tokenizes user and item behaviors into discrete, interpretable sequences. We construct a behavior vocabulary via a vector-quantized autoencoding process that disentangles macro-level interests and micro-level intentions from graph-based representations. We then introduce multi-level semantic supervision to bridge the gap between behavioral signals and language space. A semantic alignment regularization mechanism is designed to embed behavior tokens directly into the input space of frozen language models. Experiments on three public datasets show that BEAT improves zero-shot recommendation performance while generating coherent and informative explanations. Further analysis demonstrates that our behavior tokens capture fine-grained semantics and offer a plug-and-play interface for integrating complex behavior patterns into large language models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>LLMs (Large Language Models) are increasingly used in text processing pipelines to intelligently respond to a variety of inputs and generation tasks. This raises the possibility of replacing human roles that bottleneck existing information flows, either due to insufficient staff or process complexity. However, LLMs make mistakes and some processing roles are safety critical. For example, triaging post-operative care to patients based on hospital referral letters, or updating site access schedules in nuclear facilities for work crews. If we want to introduce LLMs into critical information flows that were previously performed by humans, how can we make them safe and reliable? Rather than make performative claims about augmented generation frameworks or graph-based techniques, this paper argues that the safety argument should focus on the type of evidence we get from evaluation points in LLM processes, particularly in frameworks that employ LLM-as-Judges (LaJ) evaluators. This paper argues that although we cannot get deterministic evaluations from many natural language processing tasks, by adopting a basket of weighted metrics it may be possible to lower the risk of errors within an evaluation, use context sensitivity to define error severity and design confidence thresholds that trigger human review of critical LaJ judgments when concordance across evaluators is low.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the rapidly growing population of resident space objects (RSOs) in the near-Earth space environment, detailed information about their condition and capabilities is needed to provide Space Domain Awareness (SDA). Space-based sensing will enable inspection of RSOs at shorter ranges, independent of atmospheric effects, and from all aspects. The use of a sub-THz inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imaging and sensing system for SDA has been proposed in previous work, demonstrating the achievement of sub-cm image resolution at ranges of up to 100 km. This work focuses on recognition of external structures by use of sequential feature detection and tracking throughout the aligned ISAR images of the satellites. The Hough transform is employed to detect linear features, which are tracked throughout the sequence. ISAR imagery is generated via a metaheuristic simulator capable of modelling encounters for a variety of deployment scenarios. Initial frame-to-frame alignment is achieved through a series of affine transformations to facilitate later association between image features. A gradient-by-ratio method is used for edge detection within individual ISAR images, and edge magnitude and direction are subsequently used to inform a double-weighted Hough transform to detect features with high accuracy. Feature evolution during sequences of frames is analysed. It is shown that the use of feature tracking within sequences with the proposed approach will increase confidence in feature detection and classification, and an example use-case of robust detection of shadowing as a feature is presented.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Autonomous driving requires a persistent understanding of 3D scenes that is robust to temporal disturbances and accounts for potential future actions. We introduce a new concept of 4D Occupancy Spatio-Temporal Persistence (OccSTeP), which aims to address two tasks: (1) reactive forecasting: ''what will happen next'' and (2) proactive forecasting: "what would happen given a specific future action". For the first time, we create a new OccSTeP benchmark with challenging scenarios (e.g., erroneous semantic labels and dropped frames). To address this task, we propose OccSTeP-WM, a tokenizer-free world model that maintains a dense voxel-based scene state and incrementally fuses spatio-temporal context over time. OccSTeP-WM leverages a linear-complexity attention backbone and a recurrent state-space module to capture long-range spatial dependencies while continually updating the scene memory with ego-motion compensation. This design enables online inference and robust performance even when historical sensor input is missing or noisy. Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of the OccSTeP concept and our OccSTeP-WM, yielding an average semantic mIoU of 23.70% (+6.56% gain) and occupancy IoU of 35.89% (+9.26% gain).

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models are increasingly adapted to downstream tasks through fine-tuning. Full supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), are two dominant approaches. While PEFT methods are widely used for their computational efficiency, the implications of their configurations (e.g., rank) remain under-explored in downstream Q&A tasks and generalisation. In this work, we perform a comprehensive evaluation across multiple reasoning and recall datasets, conducting a rank sweep to quantify the trade-off between SFT and PEFT. We also compare the accuracy of PEFT and SFT models across in-domain and out-of-domain adaptation, highlighting distinct generalisation behaviour and task-specific forgetting. We demonstrate that LoRA achieves competitive and in some cases superior performance compared to SFT, particularly on reasoning tasks at specific rank values. Additionally, we analyze the internal representations via spectral features and layer-wise attention structures, offering insights into representational drift and structural changes in attention patterns.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose \textbf{IC-Effect}, an instruction-guided, DiT-based framework for few-shot video VFX editing that synthesizes complex effects (\eg flames, particles and cartoon characters) while strictly preserving spatial and temporal consistency. Video VFX editing is highly challenging because injected effects must blend seamlessly with the background, the background must remain entirely unchanged, and effect patterns must be learned efficiently from limited paired data. However, existing video editing models fail to satisfy these requirements. IC-Effect leverages the source video as clean contextual conditions, exploiting the contextual learning capability of DiT models to achieve precise background preservation and natural effect injection. A two-stage training strategy, consisting of general editing adaptation followed by effect-specific learning via Effect-LoRA, ensures strong instruction following and robust effect modeling. To further improve efficiency, we introduce spatiotemporal sparse tokenization, enabling high fidelity with substantially reduced computation. We also release a paired VFX editing dataset spanning $15$ high-quality visual styles. Extensive experiments show that IC-Effect delivers high-quality, controllable, and temporally consistent VFX editing, opening new possibilities for video creation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>protect, attack, robust, watermark</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid advancement of deep learning has turned models into highly valuable assets due to their reliance on massive data and costly training processes. However, these models are increasingly vulnerable to leakage and theft, highlighting the critical need for robust intellectual property protection. Model watermarking has emerged as an effective solution, with black-box watermarking gaining significant attention for its practicality and flexibility. Nonetheless, existing black-box methods often fail to better balance covertness (hiding the watermark to prevent detection and forgery) and robustness (ensuring the watermark resists removal)-two essential properties for real-world copyright verification. In this paper, we propose ComMark, a novel black-box model watermarking framework that leverages frequency-domain transformations to generate compressed, covert, and attack-resistant watermark samples by filtering out high-frequency information. To further enhance watermark robustness, our method incorporates simulated attack scenarios and a similarity loss during training. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse datasets and architectures demonstrate that ComMark achieves state-of-the-art performance in both covertness and robustness. Furthermore, we extend its applicability beyond image recognition to tasks including speech recognition, sentiment analysis, image generation, image captioning, and video recognition, underscoring its versatility and broad applicability.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Foreground-conditioned inpainting, which aims at generating a harmonious background for a given foreground subject based on the text prompt, is an important subfield in controllable image generation. A common challenge in current methods, however, is the occurrence of Spatial Relationship Hallucinations between the foreground subject and the generated background, including inappropriate scale, positional relationships, and viewpoints. Critically, the subjective nature of spatial rationality makes it challenging to quantify, hindering the use of traditional reward-based RLHF methods. To address this issue, we propose InpaintDPO, the first Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) based framework dedicated to spatial rationality in foreground-conditioned inpainting, ensuring plausible spatial relationships between foreground and background elements. To resolve the gradient conflicts in standard DPO caused by identical foreground in win-lose pairs, we propose MaskDPO, which confines preference optimization exclusively to the background to enhance background spatial relationships, while retaining the inpainting loss in the foreground region for robust foreground preservation. To enhance coherence at the foreground-background boundary, we propose Conditional Asymmetric Preference Optimization, which samples pairs with differentiated cropping operations and applies global preference optimization to promote contextual awareness and enhance boundary coherence. Finally, based on the observation that winning samples share a commonality in plausible spatial relationships, we propose Shared Commonality Preference Optimization to enhance the model's understanding of spatial commonality across high-quality winning samples, further promoting shared spatial rationality.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>State space models (SSMs) are a promising alternative to transformers for language modeling because they use fixed memory during inference. However, this fixed memory usage requires some information loss in the hidden state when processing long sequences. While prior work has studied the sequence length at which this information loss occurs, it does not characterize the types of information SSM language models (LMs) tend to forget. In this paper, we address this knowledge gap by identifying the types of tokens (e.g., parts of speech, named entities) and sequences (e.g., code, math problems) that are more frequently forgotten by SSM LMs. We achieve this by training an auto-encoder to reconstruct sequences from the SSM's hidden state, and measure information loss by comparing inputs with their reconstructions. We perform experiments using the Mamba family of SSM LMs (130M--1.4B) on sequences ranging from 4--256 tokens. Our results show significantly higher rates of information loss on math-related tokens (e.g., numbers, variables), mentions of organization entities, and alternative dialects to Standard American English. We then examine the frequency that these tokens appear in Mamba's pretraining data and find that less prevalent tokens tend to be the ones Mamba is most likely to forget. By identifying these patterns, our work provides clear direction for future research to develop methods that better control Mamba's ability to retain important information.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The multi-step denoising process in diffusion and Flow Matching models causes major efficiency issues, which motivates research on few-step generation. We present Solution Flow Models (SoFlow), a framework for one-step generation from scratch. By analyzing the relationship between the velocity function and the solution function of the velocity ordinary differential equation (ODE), we propose a Flow Matching loss and a solution consistency loss to train our models. The Flow Matching loss allows our models to provide estimated velocity fields for Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) during training, which improves generation performance. Notably, our consistency loss does not require the calculation of the Jacobian-vector product (JVP), a common requirement in recent works that is not well-optimized in deep learning frameworks like PyTorch. Experimental results indicate that, when trained from scratch using the same Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture and an equal number of training epochs, our models achieve better FID-50K scores than MeanFlow models on the ImageNet 256x256 dataset.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Continual learning remains a fundamental challenge in machine learning, requiring models to learn from a stream of tasks without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. A major obstacle in this setting is catastrophic forgetting, where performance on earlier tasks degrades as new tasks are learned. In this paper, we introduce PPSEBM, a novel framework that integrates an Energy-Based Model (EBM) with Progressive Parameter Selection (PPS) to effectively address catastrophic forgetting in continual learning for natural language processing tasks. In PPSEBM, progressive parameter selection allocates distinct, task-specific parameters for each new task, while the EBM generates representative pseudo-samples from prior tasks. These generated samples actively inform and guide the parameter selection process, enhancing the model's ability to retain past knowledge while adapting to new tasks. Experimental results on diverse NLP benchmarks demonstrate that PPSEBM outperforms state-of-the-art continual learning methods, offering a promising and robust solution to mitigate catastrophic forgetting.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language model (LLM) activations are notoriously difficult to understand, with most existing techniques using complex, specialized methods for interpreting them. Recent work has proposed a simpler approach known as LatentQA: training LLMs to directly accept LLM activations as inputs and answer arbitrary questions about them in natural language. However, prior work has focused on narrow task settings for both training and evaluation. In this paper, we instead take a generalist perspective. We evaluate LatentQA-trained models, which we call Activation Oracles (AOs), in far out-of-distribution settings and examine how performance scales with training data diversity. We find that AOs can recover information fine-tuned into a model (e.g., biographical knowledge or malign propensities) that does not appear in the input text, despite never being trained with activations from a fine-tuned model. Our main evaluations are four downstream tasks where we can compare to prior white- and black-box techniques. We find that even narrowly-trained LatentQA models can generalize well, and that adding additional training datasets (such as classification tasks and a self-supervised context prediction task) yields consistent further improvements. Overall, our best AOs match or exceed prior white-box baselines on all four tasks and are the best method on 3 out of 4. These results suggest that diversified training to answer natural-language queries imparts a general capability to verbalize information about LLM activations.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper proposes a training data augmentation pipeline that combines synthetic image data with neural style transfer in order to address the vulnerability of deep vision models to common corruptions. We show that although applying style transfer on synthetic images degrades their quality with respect to the common FID metric, these images are surprisingly beneficial for model training. We conduct a systematic empirical analysis of the effects of both augmentations and their key hyperparameters on the performance of image classifiers. Our results demonstrate that stylization and synthetic data complement each other well and can be combined with popular rule-based data augmentation techniques such as TrivialAugment, while not working with others. Our method achieves state-of-the-art corruption robustness on several small-scale image classification benchmarks, reaching 93.54%, 74.9% and 50.86% robust accuracy on CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-100-C and TinyImageNet-C, respectively</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper presents a unified framework, for the detection, classification, and preliminary localization of anomalies in water distribution networks using multivariate statistical analysis. The approach, termed SICAMS (Statistical Identification and Classification of Anomalies in Mahalanobis Space), processes heterogeneous pressure and flow sensor data through a whitening transformation to eliminate spatial correlations among measurements. Based on the transformed data, the Hotelling's $T^2$ statistic is constructed, enabling the formulation of anomaly detection as a statistical hypothesis test of network conformity to normal operating conditions. It is shown that Hotelling's $T^2$ statistic can serve as an integral indicator of the overall "health" of the system, exhibiting correlation with total leakage volume, and thereby enabling approximate estimation of water losses via a regression model. A heuristic algorithm is developed to analyze the $T^2$ time series and classify detected anomalies into abrupt leaks, incipient leaks, and sensor malfunctions. Furthermore, a coarse leak localization method is proposed, which ranks sensors according to their statistical contribution and employs Laplacian interpolation to approximate the affected region within the network. Application of the proposed framework to the BattLeDIM L-Town benchmark dataset demonstrates high sensitivity and reliability in leak detection, maintaining robust performance even under multiple leaks. These capabilities make the method applicable to real-world operational environments without the need for a calibrated hydraulic model.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Reinforcement learning has become essential for strengthening the reasoning abilities of large language models, yet current exploration mechanisms remain fundamentally misaligned with how these models actually learn. Entropy bonuses and external semantic comparators encourage surface level variation but offer no guarantee that sampled trajectories differ in the update directions that shape optimization. We propose G2RL, a gradient guided reinforcement learning framework in which exploration is driven not by external heuristics but by the model own first order update geometry. For each response, G2RL constructs a sequence level feature from the model final layer sensitivity, obtainable at negligible cost from a standard forward pass, and measures how each trajectory would reshape the policy by comparing these features within a sampled group. Trajectories that introduce novel gradient directions receive a bounded multiplicative reward scaler, while redundant or off manifold updates are deemphasized, yielding a self referential exploration signal that is naturally aligned with PPO style stability and KL control. Across math and general reasoning benchmarks (MATH500, AMC, AIME24, AIME25, GPQA, MMLUpro) on Qwen3 base 1.7B and 4B models, G2RL consistently improves pass@1, maj@16, and pass@k over entropy based GRPO and external embedding methods. Analyzing the induced geometry, we find that G2RL expands exploration into substantially more orthogonal and often opposing gradient directions while maintaining semantic coherence, revealing that a policy own update space provides a far more faithful and effective basis for guiding exploration in large language model reinforcement learning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Future AI agents might run autonomously with elevated privileges. If these agents are misaligned, they might abuse these privileges to cause serious damage. The field of AI control develops techniques that make it harder for misaligned AIs to cause such damage, while preserving their usefulness. We introduce BashArena, a setting for studying AI control techniques in security-critical environments. BashArena contains 637 Linux system administration and infrastructure engineering tasks in complex, realistic environments, along with four sabotage objectives (execute malware, exfiltrate secrets, escalate privileges, and disable firewall) for a red team to target. We evaluate multiple frontier LLMs on their ability to complete tasks, perform sabotage undetected, and detect sabotage attempts. Claude Sonnet 4.5 successfully executes sabotage while evading monitoring by GPT-4.1 mini 26% of the time, at 4% trajectory-wise FPR. Our findings provide a baseline for designing more effective control protocols in BashArena. We release the dataset as a ControlArena setting and share our task generation pipeline.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Semantic communication aims to transmit information most relevant to a task rather than raw data, offering significant gains in communication efficiency for applications such as telepresence, augmented reality, and remote sensing. Recent transformer-based approaches have used self-attention maps to identify informative regions within images, but they often struggle in complex scenes with multiple objects, where self-attention lacks explicit task guidance. To address this, we propose a novel Multi-Modal Semantic Communication framework that integrates text-based user queries to guide the information extraction process. Our proposed system employs a cross-modal attention mechanism that fuses visual features with language embeddings to produce soft relevance scores over the visual data. Based on these scores and the instantaneous channel bandwidth, we use an algorithm to transmit image patches at adaptive resolutions using independently trained encoder-decoder pairs, with total bitrate matching the channel capacity. At the receiver, the patches are reconstructed and combined to preserve task-critical information. This flexible and goal-driven design enables efficient semantic communication in complex and bandwidth-constrained environments.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The misuse of AI-driven video generation technologies has raised serious social concerns, highlighting the urgent need for reliable AI-generated video detectors. However, most existing methods are limited to binary classification and lack the necessary explanations for human interpretation. In this paper, we present Skyra, a specialized multimodal large language model (MLLM) that identifies human-perceivable visual artifacts in AI-generated videos and leverages them as grounded evidence for both detection and explanation. To support this objective, we construct ViF-CoT-4K for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), which represents the first large-scale AI-generated video artifact dataset with fine-grained human annotations. We then develop a two-stage training strategy that systematically enhances our model's spatio-temporal artifact perception, explanation capability, and detection accuracy. To comprehensively evaluate Skyra, we introduce ViF-Bench, a benchmark comprising 3K high-quality samples generated by over ten state-of-the-art video generators. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Skyra surpasses existing methods across multiple benchmarks, while our evaluation yields valuable insights for advancing explainable AI-generated video detection.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Evaluations of image compression performance which include human preferences have generally found that naive distortion functions such as MSE are insufficiently aligned to human perception. In order to align compression models to human perception, prior work has employed differentiable perceptual losses consisting of neural networks calibrated on large-scale datasets of human psycho-visual judgments. We show that, surprisingly, state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) can replicate binary human two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) judgments zero-shot when asked to reason about the differences between pairs of images. Motivated to exploit the powerful zero-shot visual reasoning capabilities of VLMs, we propose Vision-Language Models for Image Compression (VLIC), a diffusion-based image compression system designed to be post-trained with binary VLM judgments. VLIC leverages existing techniques for diffusion model post-training with preferences, rather than distilling the VLM judgments into a separate perceptual loss network. We show that calibrating this system on VLM judgments produces competitive or state-of-the-art performance on human-aligned visual compression depending on the dataset, according to perceptual metrics and large-scale user studies. We additionally conduct an extensive analysis of the VLM-based reward design and training procedure and share important insights. More visuals are available at this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Autoregressive video diffusion models hold promise for world simulation but are vulnerable to exposure bias arising from the train-test mismatch. While recent works address this via post-training, they typically rely on a bidirectional teacher model or online discriminator. To achieve an end-to-end solution, we introduce Resampling Forcing, a teacher-free framework that enables training autoregressive video models from scratch and at scale. Central to our approach is a self-resampling scheme that simulates inference-time model errors on history frames during training. Conditioned on these degraded histories, a sparse causal mask enforces temporal causality while enabling parallel training with frame-level diffusion loss. To facilitate efficient long-horizon generation, we further introduce history routing, a parameter-free mechanism that dynamically retrieves the top-k most relevant history frames for each query. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves performance comparable to distillation-based baselines while exhibiting superior temporal consistency on longer videos owing to native-length training.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Active Speaker Detection (ASD) aims to identify who is currently speaking in each frame of a video. Most state-of-the-art approaches rely on late fusion to combine visual and audio features, but late fusion often fails to capture fine-grained cross-modal interactions, which can be critical for robust performance in unconstrained scenarios. In this paper, we introduce GateFusion, a novel architecture that combines strong pretrained unimodal encoders with a Hierarchical Gated Fusion Decoder (HiGate). HiGate enables progressive, multi-depth fusion by adaptively injecting contextual features from one modality into the other at multiple layers of the Transformer backbone, guided by learnable, bimodally-conditioned gates. To further strengthen multimodal learning, we propose two auxiliary objectives: Masked Alignment Loss (MAL) to align unimodal outputs with multimodal predictions, and Over-Positive Penalty (OPP) to suppress spurious video-only activations. GateFusion establishes new state-of-the-art results on several challenging ASD benchmarks, achieving 77.8% mAP (+9.4%), 86.1% mAP (+2.9%), and 96.1% mAP (+0.5%) on Ego4D-ASD, UniTalk, and WASD benchmarks, respectively, and delivering competitive performance on AVA-ActiveSpeaker. Out-of-domain experiments demonstrate the generalization of our model, while comprehensive ablations show the complementary benefits of each component.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Foundation models are vital tools in various Computer Vision applications. They take as input a single RGB image and output a deep feature representation that is useful for various applications. However, in case we have multiple views of the same 3D scene, they operate on each image independently and do not always produce consistent features for the same 3D point. We propose a way to convert a Foundation Model into a Multi-View Foundation Model. Such a model takes as input a set of images and outputs a feature map for each image such that the features of corresponding points are as consistent as possible. This approach bypasses the need to build a consistent 3D model of the features and allows direct manipulation in the image space. Specifically, we show how to augment Transformers-based foundation models (i.e., DINO, SAM, CLIP) with intermediate 3D-aware attention layers that help match features across different views. As leading examples, we show surface normal estimation and multi-view segmentation tasks. Quantitative experiments show that our method improves feature matching considerably compared to current foundation models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In recent multimodal research, the diffusion paradigm has emerged as a promising alternative to the autoregressive paradigm (AR), owing to its unique decoding advantages. However, due to the capability limitations of the base diffusion language model, the performance of the diffusion vision language model (dVLM) still lags significantly behind that of mainstream models. This leads to a simple yet fundamental question: Is it possible to construct dVLMs based on existing powerful AR models? In response, we propose DiffusionVL, a dVLM family that could be translated from any powerful AR models. Through simple fine-tuning, we successfully adapt AR pre-trained models into the diffusion paradigm. This approach yields two key observations: (1) The paradigm shift from AR-based multimodal models to diffusion is remarkably effective. (2) Direct conversion of an AR language model to a dVLM is also feasible, achieving performance competitive with LLaVA-style visual-instruction-tuning. Further, we introduce a block-decoding design into dVLMs that supports arbitrary-length generation and KV cache reuse, achieving a significant inference speedup. We conduct a large number of experiments. Despite training with less than 5% of the data required by prior methods, DiffusionVL achieves a comprehensive performance improvement-a 34.4% gain on the MMMU-Pro (vision) bench and 37.5% gain on the MME (Cog.) bench-alongside a 2x inference speedup.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>At the most basic level, pixels are the source of the visual information through which we perceive the world. Pixels contain information at all levels, ranging from low-level attributes to high-level concepts. Autoencoders represent a classical and long-standing paradigm for learning representations from pixels or other raw inputs. In this work, we demonstrate that autoencoder-based self-supervised learning remains competitive today and can produce strong representations for downstream tasks, while remaining simple, stable, and efficient. Our model, codenamed "Pixio", is an enhanced masked autoencoder (MAE) with more challenging pre-training tasks and more capable architectures. The model is trained on 2B web-crawled images with a self-curation strategy with minimal human curation. Pixio performs competitively across a wide range of downstream tasks in the wild, including monocular depth estimation (e.g., Depth Anything), feed-forward 3D reconstruction (i.e., MapAnything), semantic segmentation, and robot learning, outperforming or matching DINOv3 trained at similar scales. Our results suggest that pixel-space self-supervised learning can serve as a promising alternative and a complement to latent-space approaches.</li>
