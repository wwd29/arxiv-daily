<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present a generative model that amortises computation for the field around e.g. gravitational or magnetic sources. Exact numerical calculation has either computational complexity $\mathcal{O}(M\times{}N)$ in the number of sources and field evaluation points, or requires a fixed evaluation grid to exploit fast Fourier transforms. Using an architecture where a hypernetwork produces an implicit representation of the field around a source collection, our model instead performs as $\mathcal{O}(M + N)$, achieves accuracy of $\sim\!4\%-6\%$, and allows evaluation at arbitrary locations for arbitrary numbers of sources, greatly increasing the speed of e.g. physics simulations. We also examine a model relating to the physical properties of the output field and develop two-dimensional examples to demonstrate its application. The code for these models and experiments is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning presents an extension of the Class Incremental Learning problem where a model is faced with the problem of data scarcity while addressing the catastrophic forgetting problem. This problem remains an open problem because all recent works are built upon the convolutional neural networks performing sub-optimally compared to the transformer approaches. Our paper presents Robust Transformer Approach built upon the Compact Convolution Transformer. The issue of overfitting due to few samples is overcome with the notion of the stochastic classifier, where the classifier's weights are sampled from a distribution with mean and variance vectors, thus increasing the likelihood of correct classifications, and the batch-norm layer to stabilize the training process. The issue of CF is dealt with the idea of delta parameters, small task-specific trainable parameters while keeping the backbone networks frozen. A non-parametric approach is developed to infer the delta parameters for the model's predictions. The prototype rectification approach is applied to avoid biased prototype calculations due to the issue of data scarcity. The advantage of ROBUSTA is demonstrated through a series of experiments in the benchmark problems where it is capable of outperforming prior arts with big margins without any data augmentation protocols.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, extraction, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance on a wide range of tasks. However, recent studies have shown that LLMs can memorize training data and simple repeated tokens can trick the model to leak the data. In this paper, we take a step further and show that certain special characters or their combinations with English letters are stronger memory triggers, leading to more severe data leakage. The intuition is that, since LLMs are trained with massive data that contains a substantial amount of special characters (e.g. structural symbols {, } of JSON files, and @, # in emails and online posts), the model may memorize the co-occurrence between these special characters and the raw texts. This motivates us to propose a simple but effective Special Characters Attack (SCA) to induce training data leakage. Our experiments verify the high effectiveness of SCA against state-of-the-art LLMs: they can leak diverse training data, such as code corpus, web pages, and personally identifiable information, and sometimes generate non-stop outputs as a byproduct. We further show that the composition of the training data corpus can be revealed by inspecting the leaked data -- one crucial piece of information for pre-training high-performance LLMs. Our work can help understand the sensitivity of LLMs to special characters and identify potential areas for improvement.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Auction-based Federated Learning (AFL) has attracted extensive research interest due to its ability to motivate data owners (DOs) to join FL through economic means. While many existing AFL methods focus on providing decision support to model users (MUs) and the AFL auctioneer, decision support for data owners remains open. To bridge this gap, we propose a first-of-its-kind agent-oriented joint Pricing, Acceptance and Sub-delegation decision support approach for data owners in AFL (PAS-AFL). By considering a DO's current reputation, pending FL tasks, willingness to train FL models, and its trust relationships with other DOs, it provides a systematic approach for a DO to make joint decisions on AFL bid acceptance, task sub-delegation and pricing based on Lyapunov optimization to maximize its utility. It is the first to enable each DO to take on multiple FL tasks simultaneously to earn higher income for DOs and enhance the throughput of FL tasks in the AFL ecosystem. Extensive experiments based on six benchmarking datasets demonstrate significant advantages of PAS-AFL compared to six alternative strategies, beating the best baseline by 28.77% and 2.64% on average in terms of utility and test accuracy of the resulting FL models, respectively.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are extensively used in critical infrastructures ensuring efficient, reliable, and continuous operations. However, their increasing connectivity and addition of advanced features make them vulnerable to cyber threats, potentially leading to severe disruptions in essential services. In this context, honeypots play a vital role by acting as decoy targets within ICS networks, or on the Internet, helping to detect, log, analyze, and develop mitigations for ICS-specific cyber threats. Deploying ICS honeypots, however, is challenging due to the necessity of accurately replicating industrial protocols and device characteristics, a crucial requirement for effectively mimicking the unique operational behavior of different industrial systems. Moreover, this challenge is compounded by the significant manual effort required in also mimicking the control logic the PLC would execute, in order to capture attacker traffic aiming to disrupt critical infrastructure operations. In this paper, we propose LLMPot, a novel approach for designing honeypots in ICS networks harnessing the potency of Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMPot aims to automate and optimize the creation of realistic honeypots with vendor-agnostic configurations, and for any control logic, aiming to eliminate the manual effort and specialized knowledge traditionally required in this domain. We conducted extensive experiments focusing on a wide array of parameters, demonstrating that our LLM-based approach can effectively create honeypot devices implementing different industrial protocols and diverse control logic.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) are propelling us toward artificial general intelligence, thanks to their remarkable emergent abilities and reasoning capabilities. However, the substantial computational and memory requirements of LLMs limit their widespread adoption. Quan- tization, a key compression technique, offers a viable solution to mitigate these demands by compressing and accelerating LLMs, albeit with poten- tial risks to model accuracy. Numerous studies have aimed to minimize the accuracy loss associated with quantization. However, the quantization configurations in these studies vary and may not be optimized for hard- ware compatibility. In this paper, we focus on identifying the most effective practices for quantizing LLMs, with the goal of balancing performance with computational efficiency. For a fair analysis, we develop a quantization toolkit LLMC, and design four crucial principles considering the inference efficiency, quantized accuracy, calibration cost, and modularization. By benchmarking on various models and datasets with over 500 experiments, three takeaways corresponding to calibration data, quantization algorithm, and quantization schemes are derived. Finally, a best practice of LLM PTQ pipeline is constructed. All the benchmark results and the toolkit can be found at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely used in many artificial intelligence (AI) tasks. However, deploying them brings significant challenges due to the huge cost of memory, energy, and computation. To address these challenges, researchers have developed various model compression techniques such as model quantization and model pruning. Recently, there has been a surge in research of compression methods to achieve model efficiency while retaining the performance. Furthermore, more and more works focus on customizing the DNN hardware accelerators to better leverage the model compression techniques. In addition to efficiency, preserving security and privacy is critical for deploying DNNs. However, the vast and diverse body of related works can be overwhelming. This inspires us to conduct a comprehensive survey on recent research toward the goal of high-performance, cost-efficient, and safe deployment of DNNs. Our survey first covers the mainstream model compression techniques such as model quantization, model pruning, knowledge distillation, and optimizations of non-linear operations. We then introduce recent advances in designing hardware accelerators that can adapt to efficient model compression approaches. Additionally, we discuss how homomorphic encryption can be integrated to secure DNN deployment. Finally, we discuss several issues, such as hardware evaluation, generalization, and integration of various compression approaches. Overall, we aim to provide a big picture of efficient DNNs, from algorithm to hardware accelerators and security perspectives.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep Learning has become popular due to its vast applications in almost all domains. However, models trained using deep learning are prone to failure for adversarial samples and carry a considerable risk in sensitive applications. Most of these adversarial attack strategies assume that the adversary has access to the training data, the model parameters, and the input during deployment, hence, focus on perturbing the pixel level information present in the input image. Adversarial Patches were introduced to the community which helped in bringing out the vulnerability of deep learning models in a much more pragmatic manner but here the attacker has a white-box access to the model parameters. Recently, there has been an attempt to develop these adversarial attacks using black-box techniques. However, certain assumptions such as availability large training data is not valid for a real-life scenarios. In a real-life scenario, the attacker can only assume the type of model architecture used from a select list of state-of-the-art architectures while having access to only a subset of input dataset. Hence, we propose an black-box adversarial attack strategy that produces adversarial patches which can be applied anywhere in the input image to perform an adversarial attack.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Image segmentation, the process of partitioning an image into meaningful regions, plays a pivotal role in computer vision and medical imaging applications. Unsupervised segmentation, particularly in the absence of labeled data, remains a challenging task due to the inter-class similarity and variations in intensity and resolution. In this study, we extract high-level features of the input image using pretrained vision transformer. Subsequently, the proposed method leverages the underlying graph structures of the images, seeking to discover and delineate meaningful boundaries using graph neural networks and modularity based optimization criteria without relying on pre-labeled training data. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed approach, showcasing competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-art unsupervised segmentation methods. This research contributes to the broader field of unsupervised medical imaging and computer vision by presenting an innovative methodology for image segmentation that aligns with real-world challenges. The proposed method holds promise for diverse applications, including medical imaging, remote sensing, and object recognition, where labeled data may be scarce or unavailable.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Transformer-based methods have exhibited significant generalization ability when prompted with target-domain demonstrations or example solutions during inference. Although demonstrations, as a way of task specification, can capture rich information that may be hard to specify by language, it remains unclear what information is extracted from the demonstrations to help generalization. Moreover, assuming access to demonstrations of an unseen task is impractical or unreasonable in many real-world scenarios, especially in robotics applications. These questions motivate us to explore what the minimally sufficient prompt could be to elicit the same level of generalization ability as the demonstrations. We study this problem in the contextural RL setting which allows for quantitative measurement of generalization and is commonly adopted by meta-RL and multi-task RL benchmarks. In this setting, the training and test Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) only differ in certain properties, which we refer to as task parameters. We show that conditioning a decision transformer on these task parameters alone can enable zero-shot generalization on par with or better than its demonstration-conditioned counterpart. This suggests that task parameters are essential for the generalization and DT models are trying to recover it from the demonstration prompt. To extract the remaining generalizable information from the supervision, we introduce an additional learnable prompt which is demonstrated to further boost zero-shot generalization across a range of robotic control, manipulation, and navigation benchmark tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Transformer-based large language models (LLM) have been widely used in language processing applications. However, most of them restrict the context window that permits the model to attend to every token in the inputs. Previous works in recurrent models can memorize past tokens to enable unlimited context and maintain effectiveness. However, they have "flat" memory architectures, which have limitations in selecting and filtering information. Since humans are good at learning and self-adjustment, we speculate that imitating brain memory hierarchy is beneficial for model memorization. We propose the Hierarchical Memory Transformer (HMT), a novel framework that enables and improves models' long-context processing ability by imitating human memorization behavior. Leveraging memory-augmented segment-level recurrence, we organize the memory hierarchy by preserving tokens from early input token segments, passing memory embeddings along the sequence, and recalling relevant information from history. Evaluating general language modeling (Wikitext-103, PG-19) and question-answering tasks (PubMedQA), we show that HMT steadily improves the long-context processing ability of context-constrained and long-context models. With an additional 0.5% - 2% of parameters, HMT can easily plug in and augment future LLMs to handle long context effectively. Our code is open-sourced on Github: this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we study the robustness of "data-centric" approaches to finding neural network architectures (known as neural architecture search) to data distribution shifts. To audit this robustness, we present a data poisoning attack, when injected to the training data used for architecture search that can prevent the victim algorithm from finding an architecture with optimal accuracy. We first define the attack objective for crafting poisoning samples that can induce the victim to generate sub-optimal architectures. To this end, we weaponize existing search algorithms to generate adversarial architectures that serve as our objectives. We also present techniques that the attacker can use to significantly reduce the computational costs of crafting poisoning samples. In an extensive evaluation of our poisoning attack on a representative architecture search algorithm, we show its surprising robustness. Because our attack employs clean-label poisoning, we also evaluate its robustness against label noise. We find that random label-flipping is more effective in generating sub-optimal architectures than our clean-label attack. Our results suggests that care must be taken for the data this emerging approach uses, and future work is needed to develop robust algorithms.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, security</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present the first formally-verified Internet router, which is part of the SCION Internet architecture. SCION routers run a cryptographic protocol for secure packet forwarding in an adversarial environment. We verify both the protocol's network-wide security properties and low-level properties of its implementation. More precisely, we develop a series of protocol models by refinement in Isabelle/HOL and we use an automated program verifier to prove that the router's Go code satisfies memory safety, crash freedom, freedom from data races, and adheres to the protocol model. Both verification efforts are soundly linked together. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of coherently verifying a critical network component from high-level protocol models down to performance-optimized production code, developed by an independent team. In the process, we uncovered critical bugs in both the protocol and its implementation, which were confirmed by the code developers, and we strengthened the protocol's security properties. This paper explains our approach, summarizes the main results, and distills lessons for the design and implementation of verifiable systems, for the handling of continuous changes, and for the verification techniques and tools employed.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This project addresses the challenge of human motion prediction, a critical area for applications such as au- tonomous vehicle movement detection. Previous works have emphasized the need for low inference times to provide real time performance for applications like these. Our primary objective is to critically evaluate existing model ar- chitectures, identifying their advantages and opportunities for improvement by replicating the state-of-the-art (SOTA) Spatio-Temporal Transformer model as best as possible given computational con- straints. These models have surpassed the limitations of RNN-based models and have demonstrated the ability to generate plausible motion sequences over both short and long term horizons through the use of spatio-temporal rep- resentations. We also propose a novel architecture to ad- dress challenges of real time inference speed by incorpo- rating a Mixture of Experts (MoE) block within the Spatial- Temporal (ST) attention layer. The particular variation that is used is Soft MoE, a fully-differentiable sparse Transformer that has shown promising ability to enable larger model capacity at lower inference cost.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their efficacy across a broad spectrum of tasks in healthcare applications. However, often LLMs need to be fine-tuned on task-specific expert annotated data to achieve optimal performance, which can be expensive and time consuming. In this study, we fine-tune PaLM-2 with parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) using noisy labels obtained from gemini-pro 1.0 for the detection of Schedule-of-Event (SoE) tables, which specify care plan in clinical trial protocols. We introduce a filtering mechanism to select high-confidence labels for this table classification task, thereby reducing the noise in the auto-generated labels. We show that fine-tuned PaLM-2 with those labels achieves performance that exceeds the gemini-pro 1.0 and other LLMs. Furthermore, its performance is close to a PaLM-2 fine-tuned on labels obtained from non-expert annotators. Our results show that leveraging LLM-generated labels through powerful models like gemini-pro can potentially serve as a viable strategy for improving LLM performance through fine-tuning in specialized tasks, particularly in domains where expert annotations are scarce, expensive, or time-consuming to obtain.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent studies have shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to process extremely long text. Many works only evaluate LLMs' long-text processing ability on the language modeling task, with perplexity (PPL) as the evaluation metric. However, in our study, we find that there is no correlation between PPL and LLMs' long-text understanding ability. Besides, PPL may only reflect the model's ability to model local information instead of catching long-range dependency. Therefore, only using PPL to prove the model could process long text is inappropriate. The local focus feature of PPL could also explain some existing phenomena, such as the great extrapolation ability of the position method ALiBi. When evaluating a model's ability in long text, we might pay more attention to PPL's limitation and avoid overly relying on it.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We pursue the use of deep learning methods to improve state-of-the-art computations in theoretical high-energy physics. Planar N = 4 Super Yang-Mills theory is a close cousin to the theory that describes Higgs boson production at the Large Hadron Collider; its scattering amplitudes are large mathematical expressions containing integer coefficients. In this paper, we apply Transformers to predict these coefficients. The problem can be formulated in a language-like representation amenable to standard cross-entropy training objectives. We design two related experiments and show that the model achieves high accuracy (> 98%) on both tasks. Our work shows that Transformers can be applied successfully to problems in theoretical physics that require exact solutions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Event cameras, drawing inspiration from biological systems, efficiently detect changes in ambient light with low latency and high dynamic range while consuming minimal power. The most current approach to processing event data often involves converting it into frame-based representations, which is well-established in traditional vision. However, this approach neglects the sparsity of event data, loses fine-grained temporal information during the transformation process, and increases the computational burden, making it ineffective for characterizing event camera properties. In contrast, Point Cloud is a popular representation for 3D processing and is better suited to match the sparse and asynchronous nature of the event camera. Nevertheless, despite the theoretical compatibility of point-based methods with event cameras, the results show a performance gap that is not yet satisfactory compared to frame-based methods. In order to bridge the performance gap, we propose EventMamba, an efficient and effective Point Cloud framework that achieves competitive results even compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) frame-based method in both classification and regression tasks. This notable accomplishment is facilitated by our rethinking of the distinction between Event Cloud and Point Cloud, emphasizing effective temporal information extraction through optimized network structures. Specifically, EventMamba leverages temporal aggregation and State Space Model (SSM) based Mamba boasting enhanced temporal information extraction capabilities. Through a hierarchical structure, EventMamba is adept at abstracting local and global spatial features and implicit and explicit temporal features. By adhering to the lightweight design principle, EventMamba delivers impressive results with minimal computational resource utilization, demonstrating its efficiency and effectiveness.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, defense</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Machine learning is widely used for malware detection in practice. Prior behavior-based detectors most commonly rely on traces of programs executed in controlled sandboxes. However, sandbox traces are unavailable to the last line of defense offered by security vendors: malware detection at endpoints. A detector at endpoints consumes the traces of programs running on real-world hosts, as sandbox analysis might introduce intolerable delays. Despite their success in the sandboxes, research hints at potential challenges for ML methods at endpoints, e.g., highly variable malware behaviors. Nonetheless, the impact of these challenges on existing approaches and how their excellent sandbox performance translates to the endpoint scenario remain unquantified. We present the first measurement study of the performance of ML-based malware detectors at real-world endpoints. Leveraging a dataset of sandbox traces and a dataset of in-the-wild program traces; we evaluate two scenarios where the endpoint detector was trained on (i) sandbox traces (convenient and accessible); and (ii) endpoint traces (less accessible due to needing to collect telemetry data). This allows us to identify a wide gap between prior methods' sandbox-based detection performance--over 90%--and endpoint performances--below 20% and 50% in (i) and (ii), respectively. We pinpoint and characterize the challenges contributing to this gap, such as label noise, behavior variability, or sandbox evasion. To close this gap, we propose that yield a relative improvement of 5-30% over the baselines. Our evidence suggests that applying detectors trained on sandbox data to endpoint detection -- scenario (i) -- is challenging. The most promising direction is training detectors on endpoint data -- scenario (ii) -- which marks a departure from widespread practice. We implement a leaderboard for realistic detector evaluations to promote research.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Due to the rise in video content creation targeted towards children, there is a need for robust content moderation schemes for video hosting platforms. A video that is visually benign may include audio content that is inappropriate for young children while being impossible to detect with a unimodal content moderation system. Popular video hosting platforms for children such as YouTube Kids still publish videos which contain audio content that is not conducive to a child's healthy behavioral and physical development. A robust classification of malicious videos requires audio representations in addition to video features. However, recent content moderation approaches rarely employ multimodal architectures that explicitly consider non-speech audio cues. To address this, we present an efficient adaptation of CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) that can leverage contextual audio cues for enhanced content moderation. We incorporate 1) the audio modality and 2) prompt learning, while keeping the backbone modules of each modality frozen. We conduct our experiments on a multimodal version of the MOB (Malicious or Benign) dataset in supervised and few-shot settings.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>protect, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent developments in large speech foundation models like Whisper have led to their widespread use in many automatic speech recognition (ASR) applications. These systems incorporate `special tokens' in their vocabulary, such as $\texttt{<endoftext>}$, to guide their language generation process. However, we demonstrate that these tokens can be exploited by adversarial attacks to manipulate the model's behavior. We propose a simple yet effective method to learn a universal acoustic realization of Whisper's $\texttt{<endoftext>}$ token, which, when prepended to any speech signal, encourages the model to ignore the speech and only transcribe the special token, effectively `muting' the model. Our experiments demonstrate that the same, universal 0.64-second adversarial audio segment can successfully mute a target Whisper ASR model for over 97\% of speech samples. Moreover, we find that this universal adversarial audio segment often transfers to new datasets and tasks. Overall this work demonstrates the vulnerability of Whisper models to `muting' adversarial attacks, where such attacks can pose both risks and potential benefits in real-world settings: for example the attack can be used to bypass speech moderation systems, or conversely the attack can also be used to protect private speech data.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Substance use disorders (SUDs) are a growing concern globally, necessitating enhanced understanding of the problem and its trends through data-driven research. Social media are unique and important sources of information about SUDs, particularly since the data in such sources are often generated by people with lived experiences. In this paper, we introduce Reddit-Impacts, a challenging Named Entity Recognition (NER) dataset curated from subreddits dedicated to discussions on prescription and illicit opioids, as well as medications for opioid use disorder. The dataset specifically concentrates on the lesser-studied, yet critically important, aspects of substance use--its clinical and social impacts. We collected data from chosen subreddits using the publicly available Application Programming Interface for Reddit. We manually annotated text spans representing clinical and social impacts reported by people who also reported personal nonmedical use of substances including but not limited to opioids, stimulants and benzodiazepines. Our objective is to create a resource that can enable the development of systems that can automatically detect clinical and social impacts of substance use from text-based social media data. The successful development of such systems may enable us to better understand how nonmedical use of substances affects individual health and societal dynamics, aiding the development of effective public health strategies. In addition to creating the annotated data set, we applied several machine learning models to establish baseline performances. Specifically, we experimented with transformer models like BERT, and RoBERTa, one few-shot learning model DANN by leveraging the full training dataset, and GPT-3.5 by using one-shot learning, for automatic NER of clinical and social impacts. The dataset has been made available through the 2024 SMM4H shared tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Transparent objects are ubiquitous in industry, pharmaceuticals, and households. Grasping and manipulating these objects is a significant challenge for robots. Existing methods have difficulty reconstructing complete depth maps for challenging transparent objects, leaving holes in the depth reconstruction. Recent work has shown neural radiance fields (NeRFs) work well for depth perception in scenes with transparent objects, and these depth maps can be used to grasp transparent objects with high accuracy. NeRF-based depth reconstruction can still struggle with especially challenging transparent objects and lighting conditions. In this work, we propose Residual-NeRF, a method to improve depth perception and training speed for transparent objects. Robots often operate in the same area, such as a kitchen. By first learning a background NeRF of the scene without transparent objects to be manipulated, we reduce the ambiguity faced by learning the changes with the new object. We propose training two additional networks: a residual NeRF learns to infer residual RGB values and densities, and a Mixnet learns how to combine background and residual NeRFs. We contribute synthetic and real experiments that suggest Residual-NeRF improves depth perception of transparent objects. The results on synthetic data suggest Residual-NeRF outperforms the baselines with a 46.1% lower RMSE and a 29.5% lower MAE. Real-world qualitative experiments suggest Residual-NeRF leads to more robust depth maps with less noise and fewer holes. Website: this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In everyday indoor navigation, robots often needto detect non-distinctive small-change objects (e.g., stationery,lost items, and junk, etc.) to maintain domain knowledge. Thisis most relevant to ground-view change detection (GVCD), a recently emerging research area in the field of computer vision.However, these existing techniques rely on high-quality class-specific object priors to regularize a change detector modelthat cannot be applied to semantically nondistinctive smallobjects. To address ill-posedness, in this study, we explorethe concept of degree-of-ill-posedness (DoI) from the newperspective of GVCD, aiming to improve both passive and activevision. This novel DoI problem is highly domain-dependent,and manually collecting fine-grained annotated training datais expensive. To regularize this problem, we apply the conceptof self-supervised learning to achieve efficient DoI estimationscheme and investigate its generalization to diverse datasets.Specifically, we tackle the challenging issue of obtaining self-supervision cues for semantically non-distinctive unseen smallobjects and show that novel "oversegmentation cues" from openvocabulary semantic segmentation can be effectively exploited.When applied to diverse real datasets, the proposed DoI modelcan boost state-of-the-art change detection models, and it showsstable and consistent improvements when evaluated on real-world datasets.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Accurate polyp segmentation is crucial for the early detection and prevention of colorectal cancer. However, the existing polyp detection methods sometimes ignore multi-directional features and drastic changes in scale. To address these challenges, we design an Orthogonal Direction Enhancement and Scale Aware Network (ODC-SA Net) for polyp segmentation. The Orthogonal Direction Convolutional (ODC) block can extract multi-directional features using transposed rectangular convolution kernels through forming an orthogonal feature vector basis, which solves the issue of random feature direction changes and reduces computational load. Additionally, the Multi-scale Fusion Attention (MSFA) mechanism is proposed to emphasize scale changes in both spatial and channel dimensions, enhancing the segmentation accuracy for polyps of varying sizes. Extraction with Re-attention Module (ERA) is used to re-combinane effective features, and Structures of Shallow Reverse Attention Mechanism (SRA) is used to enhance polyp edge with low level information. A large number of experiments conducted on public datasets have demonstrated that the performance of this model is superior to state-of-the-art methods.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Foundation Vision-Language Models (VLMs) trained using large-scale open-domain images and text pairs have recently been adapted to develop Vision-Language Segmentation Models (VLSMs) that allow providing text prompts during inference to guide image segmentation. If robust and powerful VLSMs can be built for medical images, it could aid medical professionals in many clinical tasks where they must spend substantial time delineating the target structure of interest. VLSMs for medical images resort to fine-tuning base VLM or VLSM pretrained on open-domain natural image datasets due to fewer annotated medical image datasets; this fine-tuning is resource-consuming and expensive as it usually requires updating all or a significant fraction of the pretrained parameters. Recently, lightweight blocks called adapters have been proposed in VLMs that keep the pretrained model frozen and only train adapters during fine-tuning, substantially reducing the computing resources required. We introduce a novel adapter, VLSM-Adapter, that can fine-tune pretrained vision-language segmentation models using transformer encoders. Our experiments in widely used CLIP-based segmentation models show that with only 3 million trainable parameters, the VLSM-Adapter outperforms state-of-the-art and is comparable to the upper bound end-to-end fine-tuning.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large unlabeled data and difficult-to-identify anomalies are the urgent issues need to overcome in most industrial scene. In order to address this issue, a new meth-odology for detecting surface defects in in-dustrial settings is introduced, referred to as Memory Augmentation and Pseudo-Labeling(MAPL). The methodology first in-troduces an anomaly simulation strategy, which significantly improves the model's ability to recognize rare or unknown anom-aly types by generating simulated anomaly samples. To cope with the problem of the lack of labeling of anomalous simulated samples, a pseudo-labeler method based on a one-classifier ensemble was employed in this study, which enhances the robustness of the model in the case of limited labeling data by automatically selecting key pseudo-labeling hyperparameters. Meanwhile, a memory-enhanced learning mechanism is introduced to effectively predict abnormal regions by analyzing the difference be-tween the input samples and the normal samples in the memory pool. An end-to-end learning framework is employed by MAPL to identify the abnormal regions directly from the input data, which optimizes the ef-ficiency and real-time performance of de-tection. By conducting extensive trials on the recently developed BHAD dataset (in-cluding MVTec AD [1], Visa [2], and MDPP [3]), MAPL achieves an average im-age-level AUROC score of 86.2%, demon-strating a 5.1% enhancement compared to the original MemSeg [4] model.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) has been widely applied to measure heart rate from face videos. To increase the generalizability of the algorithms, domain generalization (DG) attracted increasing attention in rPPG. However, when rPPG is extended to simultaneously measure more vital signs (e.g., respiration and blood oxygen saturation), achieving generalizability brings new challenges. Although partial features shared among different physiological signals can benefit multi-task learning, the sparse and imbalanced target label space brings the seesaw effect over task-specific feature learning. To resolve this problem, we designed an end-to-end Mixture of Low-rank Experts for multi-task remote Physiological measurement (PhysMLE), which is based on multiple low-rank experts with a novel router mechanism, thereby enabling the model to adeptly handle both specifications and correlations within tasks. Additionally, we introduced prior knowledge from physiology among tasks to overcome the imbalance of label space under real-world multi-task physiological measurement. For fair and comprehensive evaluations, this paper proposed a large-scale multi-task generalization benchmark, named Multi-Source Synsemantic Domain Generalization (MSSDG) protocol. Extensive experiments with MSSDG and intra-dataset have shown the effectiveness and efficiency of PhysMLE. In addition, a new dataset was collected and made publicly available to meet the needs of the MSSDG.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning method that enables participants to collaboratively train a model without sharing their private data. Despite its privacy and scalability benefits, FL is susceptible to backdoor attacks, where adversaries poison the local training data of a subset of clients using a backdoor trigger, aiming to make the aggregated model produce malicious results when the same backdoor condition is met by an inference-time input. Existing backdoor attacks in FL suffer from common deficiencies: fixed trigger patterns and reliance on the assistance of model poisoning. State-of-the-art defenses based on Byzantine-robust aggregation exhibit a good defense performance on these attacks because of the significant divergence between malicious and benign model updates. To effectively conceal malicious model updates among benign ones, we propose DPOT, a backdoor attack strategy in FL that dynamically constructs backdoor objectives by optimizing a backdoor trigger, making backdoor data have minimal effect on model updates. We provide theoretical justifications for DPOT's attacking principle and display experimental results showing that DPOT, via only a data-poisoning attack, effectively undermines state-of-the-art defenses and outperforms existing backdoor attack techniques on various datasets.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As one of the most advanced techniques in AI, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques can offer reliable and up-to-date external knowledge, providing huge convenience for numerous tasks. Particularly in the era of AI-generated content (AIGC), the powerful capacity of retrieval in RAG in providing additional knowledge enables retrieval-augmented generation to assist existing generative AI in producing high-quality outputs. Recently, large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated revolutionary abilities in language understanding and generation, while still facing inherent limitations, such as hallucinations and out-of-date internal knowledge. Given the powerful abilities of RAG in providing the latest and helpful auxiliary information, retrieval-augmented large language models have emerged to harness external and authoritative knowledge bases, rather than solely relying on the model's internal knowledge, to augment the generation quality of LLMs. In this survey, we comprehensively review existing research studies in retrieval-augmented large language models (RA-LLMs), covering three primary technical perspectives: architectures, training strategies, and applications. As the preliminary knowledge, we briefly introduce the foundations and recent advances of LLMs. Then, to illustrate the practical significance of RAG for LLMs, we categorize mainstream relevant work by application areas, detailing specifically the challenges of each and the corresponding capabilities of RA-LLMs. Finally, to deliver deeper insights, we discuss current limitations and several promising directions for future research.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) can now handle longer sequences of tokens, enabling complex tasks like book understanding and generating lengthy novels. However, the key-value (KV) cache required for LLMs consumes substantial memory as context length increasing, becoming the bottleneck for deployment. In this paper, we present a strategy called SKVQ, which stands for sliding-window KV cache quantization, to address the issue of extremely low bitwidth KV cache quantization. To achieve this, SKVQ rearranges the channels of the KV cache in order to improve the similarity of channels in quantization groups, and applies clipped dynamic quantization at the group level. Additionally, SKVQ ensures that the most recent window tokens in the KV cache are preserved with high precision. This helps maintain the accuracy of a small but important portion of the KV cache.SKVQ achieves high compression ratios while maintaining accuracy. Our evaluation on LLMs demonstrates that SKVQ surpasses previous quantization approaches, allowing for quantization of the KV cache to 2-bit keys and 1.5-bit values with minimal loss of accuracy. With SKVQ, it is possible to process context lengths of up to 1M on an 80GB memory GPU for a 7b model and up to 7 times faster decoding.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Semantic segmentation is an important task for many applications but it is still quite challenging to achieve advanced performance with limited computational costs. In this paper, we present CGRSeg, an efficient yet competitive segmentation framework based on context-guided spatial feature reconstruction. A Rectangular Self-Calibration Module is carefully designed for spatial feature reconstruction and pyramid context extraction. It captures the global context in both horizontal and vertical directions and gets the axial global context to explicitly model rectangular key areas. A shape self-calibration function is designed to make the key areas more close to the foreground object. Besides, a lightweight Dynamic Prototype Guided head is proposed to improve the classification of foreground objects by explicit class embedding. Our CGRSeg is extensively evaluated on ADE20K, COCO-Stuff, and Pascal Context benchmarks, and achieves state-of-the-art semantic performance. Specifically, it achieves $43.6\%$ mIoU on ADE20K with only $4.0$ GFLOPs, which is $0.9\%$ and $2.5\%$ mIoU better than SeaFormer and SegNeXt but with about $38.0\%$ fewer GFLOPs.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the realm of time series analysis, accurately measuring similarity is crucial for applications such as forecasting, anomaly detection, and clustering. However, existing metrics often fail to capture the complex, multidimensional nature of time series data, limiting their effectiveness and application. This paper introduces the Structured Similarity Index Measure for Time Series (TS3IM), a novel approach inspired by the success of the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) in image analysis, tailored to address these limitations by assessing structural similarity in time series. TS3IM evaluates multiple dimensions of similarity-trend, variability, and structural integrity-offering a more nuanced and comprehensive measure. This metric represents a significant leap forward, providing a robust tool for analyzing temporal data and offering more accurate and comprehensive sequence analysis and decision support in fields such as monitoring power consumption, analyzing traffic flow, and adversarial recognition. Our extensive experimental results also show that compared with traditional methods that rely heavily on computational correlation, TS3IM is 1.87 times more similar to Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) in evaluation results and improves by more than 50% in adversarial recognition.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Model (LLM) is a significant breakthrough in artificial intelligence (AI) and holds considerable potential for application within smart grids. However, as demonstrated in previous literature, AI technologies are susceptible to various types of attacks. It is crucial to investigate and evaluate the risks associated with LLMs before deploying them in critical infrastructure like smart grids. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the vulnerabilities of LLMs and identify two major types of attacks relevant to smart grid LLM applications, along with presenting the corresponding threat models. We then validate these attacks using popular LLMs, utilizing real smart grid data. Our validation demonstrates that attackers are capable of injecting bad data and retrieving domain knowledge from LLMs employed in smart grid scenarios.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we introduce SaudiBERT, a monodialect Arabic language model pretrained exclusively on Saudi dialectal text. To demonstrate the model's effectiveness, we compared SaudiBERT with six different multidialect Arabic language models across 11 evaluation datasets, which are divided into two groups: sentiment analysis and text classification. SaudiBERT achieved average F1-scores of 86.15\% and 87.86\% in these groups respectively, significantly outperforming all other comparative models. Additionally, we present two novel Saudi dialectal corpora: the Saudi Tweets Mega Corpus (STMC), which contains over 141 million tweets in Saudi dialect, and the Saudi Forums Corpus (SFC), which includes 15.2 GB of text collected from five Saudi online forums. Both corpora are used in pretraining the proposed model, and they are the largest Saudi dialectal corpora ever reported in the literature. The results confirm the effectiveness of SaudiBERT in understanding and analyzing Arabic text expressed in Saudi dialect, achieving state-of-the-art results in most tasks and surpassing other language models included in the study.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This letter introduces a novel framework for dense Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM) based on Gaussian Splatting. Recently Gaussian Splatting-based SLAM has yielded promising results, but rely on RGB-D input and is weak in tracking. To address these limitations, we uniquely integrates advanced sparse visual odometry with a dense Gaussian Splatting scene representation for the first time, thereby eliminating the dependency on depth maps typical of Gaussian Splatting-based SLAM systems and enhancing tracking robustness. Here, the sparse visual odometry tracks camera poses in RGB stream, while Gaussian Splatting handles map reconstruction. These components are interconnected through a Multi-View Stereo (MVS) depth estimation network. And we propose a depth smooth loss to reduce the negative effect of estimated depth maps. Furthermore, the consistency in scale between the sparse visual odometry and the dense Gaussian map is preserved by Sparse-Dense Adjustment Ring (SDAR). We have evaluated our system across various synthetic and real-world datasets. The accuracy of our pose estimation surpasses existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, it outperforms previous monocular methods in terms of novel view synthesis fidelity, matching the results of neural SLAM systems that utilize RGB-D input.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In recent times, impedance side-channel analysis has emerged as a potent strategy for adversaries seeking to extract sensitive information from computing systems. It leverages variations in the intrinsic impedance of a chip's internal structure across different logic states. In this study, we conduct a comparative analysis between the newly explored impedance side channel and the well-established power side channel. Through experimental evaluation, we investigate the efficacy of these two side channels in extracting the cryptographic key from the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and analyze their performance. Our results indicate that impedance analysis demonstrates a higher potential for cryptographic key extraction compared to power side-channel analysis. Moreover, we identify scenarios where power side-channel analysis does not yield satisfactory results, whereas impedance analysis proves to be more robust and effective. This work not only underscores the significance of impedance side-channel analysis in enhancing cryptographic security but also emphasizes the necessity for a deeper understanding of its mechanisms and implications.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Feature matching determines the orientation accuracy for the High Spatial Resolution (HSR) optical satellite stereos, subsequently impacting several significant applications such as 3D reconstruction and change detection. However, the matching of off-track HSR optical satellite stereos often encounters challenging conditions including wide-baseline observation, significant radiometric differences, multi-temporal changes, varying spatial resolutions, inconsistent spectral resolution, and diverse sensors. In this study, we evaluate various advanced feature matching algorithms for HSR optical satellite stereos. Utilizing a specially constructed dataset from five satellites across six challenging scenarios, HSROSS Dataset, we conduct a comparative analysis of four algorithms: the traditional SIFT, and deep-learning based methods including SuperPoint + SuperGlue, SuperPoint + LightGlue, and LoFTR.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as potent models for graph learning. Distributing the training process across multiple computing nodes is the most promising solution to address the challenges of ever-growing real-world graphs. However, current adversarial attack methods on GNNs neglect the characteristics and applications of the distributed scenario, leading to suboptimal performance and inefficiency in attacking distributed GNN training. In this study, we introduce Disttack, the first framework of adversarial attacks for distributed GNN training that leverages the characteristics of frequent gradient updates in a distributed system. Specifically, Disttack corrupts distributed GNN training by injecting adversarial attacks into one single computing node. The attacked subgraphs are precisely perturbed to induce an abnormal gradient ascent in backpropagation, disrupting gradient synchronization between computing nodes and thus leading to a significant performance decline of the trained GNN. We evaluate Disttack on four large real-world graphs by attacking five widely adopted GNNs. Compared with the state-of-the-art attack method, experimental results demonstrate that Disttack amplifies the model accuracy degradation by 2.75$\times$ and achieves speedup by 17.33$\times$ on average while maintaining unnoticeability.</li>

The accurate detection and localization of fruits are pivotal for the successful implementation of robotic harvesting systems. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to apple detection and position estimation utilizing an object detection model, YOLOv5. Our primary objective is to develop a robust system capable of identifying apples in complex orchard environments and providing precise location information. To achieve this, we curated an autonomously labeled dataset comprising diverse apple tree images, which was utilized for both training and evaluation purposes. Through rigorous experimentation, we compared the performance of our YOLOv5-based system with other popular object detection models, including SSD. Our results demonstrate that the YOLOv5 model outperforms its counterparts, achieving an impressive apple detection accuracy of approximately 85%. We believe that our proposed system's accurate apple detection and position estimation capabilities represent a significant advancement in agricultural robotics, laying the groundwork for more efficient and sustainable fruit harvesting practices.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper considers the private release of statistics of several disjoint subsets of a datasets, under user-level $\epsilon$-differential privacy (DP). In particular, we consider the user-level differentially private release of sample means and variances of speed values in several grids in a city, in a potentially sequential manner. Traditional analysis of the privacy loss due to the sequential composition of queries necessitates a privacy loss degradation by a factor that equals the total number of grids. Our main contribution is an iterative, instance-dependent algorithm, based on clipping the number of user contributions, which seeks to reduce the overall privacy loss degradation under a canonical Laplace mechanism, while not increasing the {worst} estimation error among the different grids. We test the performance of our algorithm on synthetic datasets and demonstrate improvements in the privacy loss degradation factor via our algorithm. We also demonstrate improvements in the worst-case error using a simple extension of a pseudo-user creation-based mechanism. An important component of this analysis is our exact characterization of the sensitivities and the worst-case estimation errors of sample means and variances incurred by clipping user contributions in an arbitrary fashion, which we believe is of independent interest.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Visual Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) promises to encapsulate agent's knowledge about the underlying dynamics of the environment, enabling learning a world model as a useful planner. However, top MBRL agents such as Dreamer often struggle with visual pixel-based inputs in the presence of exogenous or irrelevant noise in the observation space, due to failure to capture task-specific features while filtering out irrelevant spatio-temporal details. To tackle this problem, we apply a spatio-temporal masking strategy, a bisimulation principle, combined with latent reconstruction, to capture endogenous task-specific aspects of the environment for world models, effectively eliminating non-essential information. Joint training of representations, dynamics, and policy often leads to instabilities. To further address this issue, we develop a Hybrid Recurrent State-Space Model (HRSSM) structure, enhancing state representation robustness for effective policy learning. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates significant performance improvements over existing methods in a range of visually complex control tasks such as Maniskill \cite{gu2023maniskill2} with exogenous distractors from the Matterport environment.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Lane detection (LD) plays a crucial role in enhancing the L2+ capabilities of autonomous driving, capturing widespread attention. The Post-Processing Quantization (PTQ) could facilitate the practical application of LD models, enabling fast speeds and limited memories without labeled data. However, prior PTQ methods do not consider the complex LD outputs that contain physical semantics, such as offsets, locations, etc., and thus cannot be directly applied to LD models. In this paper, we pioneeringly investigate semantic sensitivity to post-processing for lane detection with a novel Lane Distortion Score. Moreover, we identify two main factors impacting the LD performance after quantization, namely intra-head sensitivity and inter-head sensitivity, where a small quantization error in specific semantics can cause significant lane distortion. Thus, we propose a Selective Focus framework deployed with Semantic Guided Focus and Sensitivity Aware Selection modules, to incorporate post-processing information into PTQ reconstruction. Based on the observed intra-head sensitivity, Semantic Guided Focus is introduced to prioritize foreground-related semantics using a practical proxy. For inter-head sensitivity, we present Sensitivity Aware Selection, efficiently recognizing influential prediction heads and refining the optimization objectives at runtime. Extensive experiments have been done on a wide variety of models including keypoint-, anchor-, curve-, and segmentation-based ones. Our method produces quantized models in minutes on a single GPU and can achieve 6.4% F1 Score improvement on the CULane dataset.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into healthcare diagnostics offers a promising avenue for clinical decision-making. This study outlines the development of a novel method for zero-shot/few-shot in-context learning (ICL) by integrating medical domain knowledge using a multi-layered structured prompt. We also explore the efficacy of two communication styles between the user and LLMs: the Numerical Conversational (NC) style, which processes data incrementally, and the Natural Language Single-Turn (NL-ST) style, which employs long narrative prompts. Our study systematically evaluates the diagnostic accuracy and risk factors, including gender bias and false negative rates, using a dataset of 920 patient records in various few-shot scenarios. Results indicate that traditional clinical machine learning (ML) models generally outperform LLMs in zero-shot and few-shot settings. However, the performance gap narrows significantly when employing few-shot examples alongside effective explainable AI (XAI) methods as sources of domain knowledge. Moreover, with sufficient time and an increased number of examples, the conversational style (NC) nearly matches the performance of ML models. Most notably, LLMs demonstrate comparable or superior cost-sensitive accuracy relative to ML models. This research confirms that, with appropriate domain knowledge and tailored communication strategies, LLMs can significantly enhance diagnostic processes. The findings highlight the importance of optimizing the number of training examples and communication styles to improve accuracy and reduce biases in LLM applications.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable proficiency across a wide array of NLP tasks. However, the escalation in model size also engenders substantial deployment costs. While few efforts have explored model pruning techniques to reduce the size of LLMs, they mainly center on general or task-specific weights. This leads to suboptimal performance due to lacking specificity on the target domain or generality on different tasks when applied to domain-specific challenges. This work introduces an innovative unstructured dual-pruning methodology, D-Pruner, for domain-specific compression on LLM. It extracts a compressed, domain-specific, and task-agnostic LLM by identifying LLM weights that are pivotal for general capabilities, like linguistic capability and multi-task solving, and domain-specific knowledge. More specifically, we first assess general weight importance by quantifying the error incurred upon their removal with the help of an open-domain calibration dataset. Then, we utilize this general weight importance to refine the training loss, so that it preserves generality when fitting into a specific domain. Moreover, by efficiently approximating weight importance with the refined training loss on a domain-specific calibration dataset, we obtain a pruned model emphasizing generality and specificity. Our comprehensive experiments across various tasks in healthcare and legal domains show the effectiveness of D-Pruner in domain-specific compression. Our code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Adversarial attacks pose a significant challenge to deploying deep learning models in safety-critical applications. Maintaining model robustness while ensuring interpretability is vital for fostering trust and comprehension in these models. This study investigates the impact of Saliency-guided Training (SGT) on model robustness, a technique aimed at improving the clarity of saliency maps to deepen understanding of the model's decision-making process. Experiments were conducted on standard benchmark datasets using various deep learning architectures trained with and without SGT. Findings demonstrate that SGT enhances both model robustness and interpretability. Additionally, we propose a novel approach combining SGT with standard adversarial training to achieve even greater robustness while preserving saliency map quality. Our strategy is grounded in the assumption that preserving salient features crucial for correctly classifying adversarial examples enhances model robustness, while masking non-relevant features improves interpretability. Our technique yields significant gains, achieving a 35\% and 20\% improvement in robustness against PGD attack with noise magnitudes of $0.2$ and $0.02$ for the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, respectively, while producing high-quality saliency maps.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In weakly supervised medical image segmentation, the absence of structural priors and the discreteness of class feature distribution present a challenge, i.e., how to accurately propagate supervision signals from local to global regions without excessively spreading them to other irrelevant regions? To address this, we propose a novel weakly supervised medical image segmentation framework named PCLMix, comprising dynamic mix augmentation, pixel-level contrastive learning, and consistency regularization strategies. Specifically, PCLMix is built upon a heterogeneous dual-decoder backbone, addressing the absence of structural priors through a strategy of dynamic mix augmentation during training. To handle the discrete distribution of class features, PCLMix incorporates pixel-level contrastive learning based on prediction uncertainty, effectively enhancing the model's ability to differentiate inter-class pixel differences and intra-class consistency. Furthermore, to reinforce segmentation consistency and robustness, PCLMix employs an auxiliary decoder for dual consistency regularization. In the inference phase, the auxiliary decoder will be dropped and no computation complexity is increased. Extensive experiments on the ACDC dataset demonstrate that PCLMix appropriately propagates local supervision signals to the global scale, further narrowing the gap between weakly supervised and fully supervised segmentation methods.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep learning has been able to outperform humans in terms of classification accuracy in many tasks. However, to achieve robustness to adversarial perturbations, the best methodologies require to perform adversarial training on a much larger training set that has been typically augmented using generative models (e.g., diffusion models). Our main objective in this work, is to reduce these data requirements while achieving the same or better accuracy-robustness trade-offs. We focus on data pruning, where some training samples are removed based on the distance to the model classification boundary (i.e., margin). We find that the existing approaches that prune samples with low margin fails to increase robustness when we add a lot of synthetic data, and explain this situation with a perceptron learning task. Moreover, we find that pruning high margin samples for better accuracy increases the harmful impact of mislabeled perturbed data in adversarial training, hurting both robustness and accuracy. We thus propose PUMA, a new data pruning strategy that computes the margin using DeepFool, and prunes the training samples of highest margin without hurting performance by jointly adjusting the training attack norm on the samples of lowest margin. We show that PUMA can be used on top of the current state-of-the-art methodology in robustness, and it is able to significantly improve the model performance unlike the existing data pruning strategies. Not only PUMA achieves similar robustness with less data, but it also significantly increases the model accuracy, improving the performance trade-off.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Suppose each user $i$ holds a private value $x_i$ in some metric space $(U, \mathrm{dist})$, and an untrusted data analyst wishes to compute $\sum_i f(x_i)$ for some function $f : U \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ by asking each user to send in a privatized $f(x_i)$. This is a fundamental problem in privacy-preserving population analytics, and the local model of differential privacy (LDP) is the predominant model under which the problem has been studied. However, LDP requires any two different $x_i, x'_i$ to be $\varepsilon$-distinguishable, which can be overly strong for geometric/numerical data. On the other hand, Geo-Privacy (GP) stipulates that the level of distinguishability be proportional to $\mathrm{dist}(x_i, x_i')$, providing an attractive alternative notion of personal data privacy in a metric space. However, existing GP mechanisms for this problem, which add a uniform noise to either $x_i$ or $f(x_i)$, are not satisfactory. In this paper, we generalize the smooth sensitivity framework from Differential Privacy to Geo-Privacy, which allows us to add noise tailored to the hardness of the given instance. We provide definitions, mechanisms, and a generic procedure for computing the smooth sensitivity under GP equipped with a general metric. Then we present three applications: one-way and two-way threshold functions, and Gaussian kernel density estimation, to demonstrate the applicability and utility of our smooth sensitivity framework.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>federate, generative, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated Learning faces significant challenges in statistical and system heterogeneity, along with high energy consumption, necessitating efficient client selection strategies. Traditional approaches, including heuristic and learning-based methods, fall short of addressing these complexities holistically. In response, we propose FedGCS, a novel generative client selection framework that innovatively recasts the client selection process as a generative task. Drawing inspiration from the methodologies used in large language models, FedGCS efficiently encodes abundant decision-making knowledge within a continuous representation space, enabling efficient gradient-based optimization to search for optimal client selection that will be finally output via generation. The framework comprises four steps: (1) automatic collection of diverse "selection-score" pair data using classical client selection methods; (2) training an encoder-evaluator-decoder framework on this data to construct a continuous representation space; (3) employing gradient-based optimization in this space for optimal client selection; (4) generating the final optimal client selection via using beam search for the well-trained decoder. FedGCS outperforms traditional methods by being more comprehensive, generalizable, and efficient, simultaneously optimizing for model performance, latency, and energy consumption. The effectiveness of FedGCS is proven through extensive experimental analyses.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper proposes a general interpretable predictive system with shared information. The system is able to perform predictions in a multi-task setting where distinct tasks are not bound to have the same input/output structure. Embeddings of input and output variables in a common space are obtained, where the input embeddings are produced through attending to a set of shared embeddings, reused across tasks. All the embeddings are treated as model parameters and learned. Specific restrictions on the space of shared embedings and the sparsity of the attention mechanism are considered. Experiments show that the introduction of shared embeddings does not deteriorate the results obtained from a vanilla variable embeddings method. We run a number of further ablations. Inducing sparsity in the attention mechanism leads to both an increase in accuracy and a significant decrease in the number of training steps required. Shared embeddings provide a measure of interpretability in terms of both a qualitative assessment and the ability to map specific shared embeddings to pre-defined concepts that are not tailored to the considered model. There seems to be a trade-off between accuracy and interpretability. The basic shared embeddings method favors interpretability, whereas the sparse attention method promotes accuracy. The results lead to the conclusion that variable embedding methods may be extended with shared information to provide increased interpretability and accuracy.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper aims to enhance the transferability of adversarial samples in targeted attacks, where attack success rates remain comparatively low. To achieve this objective, we propose two distinct techniques for improving the targeted transferability from the loss and feature aspects. First, in previous approaches, logit calibrations used in targeted attacks primarily focus on the logit margin between the targeted class and the untargeted classes among samples, neglecting the standard deviation of the logit. In contrast, we introduce a new normalized logit calibration method that jointly considers the logit margin and the standard deviation of logits. This approach effectively calibrates the logits, enhancing the targeted transferability. Second, previous studies have demonstrated that mixing the features of clean samples during optimization can significantly increase transferability. Building upon this, we further investigate a truncated feature mixing method to reduce the impact of the source training model, resulting in additional improvements. The truncated feature is determined by removing the Rank-1 feature associated with the largest singular value decomposed from the high-level convolutional layers of the clean sample. Extensive experiments conducted on the ImageNet-Compatible and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate the individual and mutual benefits of our proposed two components, which outperform the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin in black-box targeted attacks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper focuses on the task of quality enhancement for compressed videos. Although deep network-based video restorers achieve impressive progress, most of the existing methods lack a structured design to optimally leverage the priors within compression codecs. Since the quality degradation of the video is primarily induced by the compression algorithm, a new paradigm is urgently needed for a more "conscious" process of quality enhancement. As a result, we propose the Compression-Realize Deep Structural Network (CRDS), introducing three inductive biases aligned with the three primary processes in the classic compression codec, merging the strengths of classical encoder architecture with deep network capabilities. Inspired by the residual extraction and domain transformation process in the codec, a pre-trained Latent Degradation Residual Auto-Encoder is proposed to transform video frames into a latent feature space, and the mutual neighborhood attention mechanism is integrated for precise motion estimation and residual extraction. Furthermore, drawing inspiration from the quantization noise distribution of the codec, CRDS proposes a novel Progressive Denoising framework with intermediate supervision that decomposes the quality enhancement into a series of simpler denoising sub-tasks. Experimental results on datasets like LDV 2.0 and MFQE 2.0 indicate our approach surpasses state-of-the-art models.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have dominated the majority of computer vision tasks. However, CNNs' vulnerability to adversarial attacks has raised concerns about deploying these models to safety-critical applications. In contrast, the Human Visual System (HVS), which utilizes spatial frequency channels to process visual signals, is immune to adversarial attacks. As such, this paper presents an empirical study exploring the vulnerability of CNN models in the frequency domain. Specifically, we utilize the discrete cosine transform (DCT) to construct the Spatial-Frequency (SF) layer to produce a block-wise frequency spectrum of an input image and formulate Spatial Frequency CNNs (SF-CNNs) by replacing the initial feature extraction layers of widely-used CNN backbones with the SF layer. Through extensive experiments, we observe that SF-CNN models are more robust than their CNN counterparts under both white-box and black-box attacks. To further explain the robustness of SF-CNNs, we compare the SF layer with a trainable convolutional layer with identical kernel sizes using two mixing strategies to show that the lower frequency components contribute the most to the adversarial robustness of SF-CNNs. We believe our observations can guide the future design of robust CNN models.</li>

This study proposes a general dark web crawler designed to extract pages handling security protocols, such as captchas, efficiently. Our approach uses a combination of seed URL lists, link analysis, and scanning to discover new content. We also incorporate methods for user-agent rotation and proxy usage to maintain anonymity and avoid detection. We evaluate the effectiveness of our crawler using metrics such as coverage, performance and robustness. Our results demonstrate that our crawler effectively extracts pages handling security protocols while maintaining anonymity and avoiding detection. Our proposed dark web crawler can be used for various applications, including threat intelligence, cybersecurity, and online investigations.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Model attribution is a popular tool to explain the rationales behind model predictions. However, recent work suggests that the attributions are vulnerable to minute perturbations, which can be added to input samples to fool the attributions while maintaining the prediction outputs. Although empirical studies have shown positive performance via adversarial training, an effective certified defense method is eminently needed to understand the robustness of attributions. In this work, we propose to use uniform smoothing technique that augments the vanilla attributions by noises uniformly sampled from a certain space. It is proved that, for all perturbations within the attack region, the cosine similarity between uniformly smoothed attribution of perturbed sample and the unperturbed sample is guaranteed to be lower bounded. We also derive alternative formulations of the certification that is equivalent to the original one and provides the maximum size of perturbation or the minimum smoothing radius such that the attribution can not be perturbed. We evaluate the proposed method on three datasets and show that the proposed method can effectively protect the attributions from attacks, regardless of the architecture of networks, training schemes and the size of the datasets.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We consider the problem of learning an $\varepsilon$-optimal policy in a general class of continuous-space Markov decision processes (MDPs) having smooth Bellman operators. Given access to a generative model, we achieve rate-optimal sample complexity by performing a simple, \emph{perturbed} version of least-squares value iteration with orthogonal trigonometric polynomials as features. Key to our solution is a novel projection technique based on ideas from harmonic analysis. Our~$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2-d/(\nu+1)})$ sample complexity, where $d$ is the dimension of the state-action space and $\nu$ the order of smoothness, recovers the state-of-the-art result of discretization approaches for the special case of Lipschitz MDPs $(\nu=0)$. At the same time, for $\nu\to\infty$, it recovers and greatly generalizes the $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ rate of low-rank MDPs, which are more amenable to regression approaches. In this sense, our result bridges the gap between two popular but conflicting perspectives on continuous-space MDPs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, federate, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated learning (FL) allows clients in an Internet of Things (IoT) system to collaboratively train a global model without sharing their local data with a server. However, clients' contributions to the server can still leak sensitive information. Differential privacy (DP) addresses such leakage by providing formal privacy guarantees, with mechanisms that add randomness to the clients' contributions. The randomness makes it infeasible to train large transformer-based models, common in modern IoT systems. In this work, we empirically evaluate the practicality of fine-tuning large scale on-device transformer-based models with differential privacy in a federated learning system. We conduct comprehensive experiments on various system properties for tasks spanning a multitude of domains: speech recognition, computer vision (CV) and natural language understanding (NLU). Our results show that full fine-tuning under differentially private federated learning (DP-FL) generally leads to huge performance degradation which can be alleviated by reducing the dimensionality of contributions through parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). Our benchmarks of existing DP-PEFT methods show that DP-Low-Rank Adaptation (DP-LoRA) consistently outperforms other methods. An even more promising approach, DyLoRA, which makes the low rank variable, when naively combined with FL would straightforwardly break differential privacy. We therefore propose an adaptation method that can be combined with differential privacy and call it DP-DyLoRA. Finally, we are able to reduce the accuracy degradation and word error rate (WER) increase due to DP to less than 2% and 7% respectively with 1 million clients and a stringent privacy budget of {\epsilon}=2.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Following the recent release of AI assistants, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot, the software industry quickly utilized these tools for software development tasks, e.g., generating code or consulting AI for advice. While recent research has demonstrated that AI-generated code can contain security issues, how software professionals balance AI assistant usage and security remains unclear. This paper investigates how software professionals use AI assistants in secure software development, what security implications and considerations arise, and what impact they foresee on secure software development. We conducted 27 semi-structured interviews with software professionals, including software engineers, team leads, and security testers. We also reviewed 190 relevant Reddit posts and comments to gain insights into the current discourse surrounding AI assistants for software development. Our analysis of the interviews and Reddit posts finds that despite many security and quality concerns, participants widely use AI assistants for security-critical tasks, e.g., code generation, threat modeling, and vulnerability detection. Their overall mistrust leads to checking AI suggestions in similar ways to human code, although they expect improvements and, therefore, a heavier use for security tasks in the future. We conclude with recommendations for software professionals to critically check AI suggestions, AI creators to improve suggestion security and capabilities for ethical security tasks, and academic researchers to consider general-purpose AI in software development.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) have shown exceptional proficiency in natural language processing but often fall short of generating creative and original responses to open-ended questions. To enhance LLM creativity, our key insight is to emulate the human process of inducing collective creativity through engaging discussions with participants from diverse backgrounds and perspectives. To this end, we propose LLM Discussion, a three-phase discussion framework that facilitates vigorous and diverging idea exchanges and ensures convergence to creative answers. Moreover, we adopt a role-playing technique by assigning distinct roles to LLMs to combat the homogeneity of LLMs. We evaluate the efficacy of the proposed framework with the Alternative Uses Test, Similarities Test, Instances Test, and Scientific Creativity Test through both LLM evaluation and human study. Our proposed framework outperforms single-LLM approaches and existing multi-LLM frameworks across various creativity metrics.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Atmospheric turbulence poses a significant challenge to the performance of object detection models. Turbulence causes distortions, blurring, and noise in images by bending and scattering light rays due to variations in the refractive index of air. This results in non-rigid geometric distortions and temporal fluctuations in the electromagnetic radiation received by optical systems. This paper explores the effectiveness of turbulence image augmentation techniques in improving the accuracy and robustness of thermal-adapted and deep learning-based object detection models under atmospheric turbulence. Three distinct approximation-based turbulence simulators (geometric, Zernike-based, and P2S) are employed to generate turbulent training and test datasets. The performance of three state-of-the-art deep learning-based object detection models: RTMDet-x, DINO-4scale, and YOLOv8-x, is employed on these turbulent datasets with and without turbulence augmentation during training. The results demonstrate that utilizing turbulence-specific augmentations during model training can significantly improve detection accuracy and robustness against distorted turbulent images. Turbulence augmentation enhances performance even for a non-turbulent test set.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) is a general artificial intelligence benchmark that is currently unsolvable by any Machine Learning method, including Large Language Models (LLMs). It demands strong generalization and reasoning capabilities which are known to be weaknesses of Neural Network based systems. In this work, we propose a Program Synthesis system that uses Inductive Logic Programming (ILP), a branch of Symbolic AI, to solve ARC. We have manually defined a simple Domain Specific Language (DSL) that corresponds to a small set of object-centric abstractions relevant to ARC. This is the Background Knowledge used by ILP to create Logic Programs that provide reasoning capabilities to our system. The full system is capable of generalize to unseen tasks, since ILP can create Logic Program(s) from few examples, in the case of ARC: pairs of Input-Output grids examples for each task. These Logic Programs are able to generate Objects present in the Output grid and the combination of these can form a complete program that transforms an Input grid into an Output grid. We randomly chose some tasks from ARC that dont require more than the small number of the Object primitives we implemented and show that given only these, our system can solve tasks that require each, such different reasoning.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) play a crucial role in capturing structured semantics to enhance language understanding, improve interpretability, and reduce bias. Nevertheless, an ongoing controversy exists over the extent to which LLMs can grasp structured semantics. To assess this, we propose using Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) as a fundamental task to explore LLMs' ability to extract structured semantics. In our assessment, we employ the prompting approach, which leads to the creation of our few-shot SRL parser, called PromptSRL. PromptSRL enables LLMs to map natural languages to explicit semantic structures, which provides an interpretable window into the properties of LLMs. We find interesting potential: LLMs can indeed capture semantic structures, and scaling-up doesn't always mirror potential. Additionally, limitations of LLMs are observed in C-arguments, etc. Lastly, we are surprised to discover that significant overlap in the errors is made by both LLMs and untrained humans, accounting for almost 30% of all errors.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) often contain an automated feedback component, which provides a predefined feedback message to students when they detect a predefined error. To such a feedback component, we often resort to template-based approaches. These approaches require significant effort from human experts to detect a limited number of possible student errors and provide corresponding feedback. This limitation is exemplified in open-ended math questions, where there can be a large number of different incorrect errors. In our work, we examine the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to generate feedback for open-ended math questions, similar to that of an established ITS that uses a template-based approach. We fine-tune both open-source and proprietary LLMs on real student responses and corresponding ITS-provided feedback. We measure the quality of the generated feedback using text similarity metrics. We find that open-source and proprietary models both show promise in replicating the feedback they see during training, but do not generalize well to previously unseen student errors. These results suggest that despite being able to learn the formatting of feedback, LLMs are not able to fully understand mathematical errors made by students.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In real-world scenarios, time series forecasting often demands timeliness, making research on model backbones a perennially hot topic. To meet these performance demands, we propose a novel backbone from the perspective of information fusion. Introducing the Basic Probability Assignment (BPA) Module and the Time Evidence Fusion Network (TEFN), based on evidence theory, allows us to achieve superior performance. On the other hand, the perspective of multi-source information fusion effectively improves the accuracy of forecasting. Due to the fact that BPA is generated by fuzzy theory, TEFN also has considerable interpretability. In real data experiments, the TEFN partially achieved state-of-the-art, with low errors comparable to PatchTST, and operating efficiency surpass performance models such as Dlinear. Meanwhile, TEFN has high robustness and small error fluctuations in the random hyperparameter selection. TEFN is not a model that achieves the ultimate in single aspect, but a model that balances performance, accuracy, stability, and interpretability.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Assessing response quality to instructions in language models is vital but challenging due to the complexity of human language across different contexts. This complexity often results in ambiguous or inconsistent interpretations, making accurate assessment difficult. To address this issue, we propose a novel Uncertainty-aware Reward Model (URM) that introduces a robust uncertainty estimation for the quality of paired responses based on Bayesian approximation. Trained with preference datasets, our uncertainty-enabled proxy not only scores rewards for responses but also evaluates their inherent uncertainty. Empirical results demonstrate significant benefits of incorporating the proposed proxy into language model training. Our method boosts the instruction following capability of language models by refining data curation for training and improving policy optimization objectives, thereby surpassing existing methods by a large margin on benchmarks such as Vicuna and MT-bench. These findings highlight that our proposed approach substantially advances language model training and paves a new way of harnessing uncertainty within language models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>To ensure unbiased and ethical automated predictions, fairness must be a core principle in machine learning applications. Fairness in machine learning aims to mitigate biases present in the training data and model imperfections that could lead to discriminatory outcomes. This is achieved by preventing the model from making decisions based on sensitive characteristics like ethnicity or sexual orientation. A fundamental assumption in machine learning is the independence of observations. However, this assumption often does not hold true for data describing social phenomena, where data points are often clustered based. Hence, if the machine learning models do not account for the cluster correlations, the results may be biased. Especially high is the bias in cases where the cluster assignment is correlated to the variable of interest. We present a fair mixed effects support vector machine algorithm that can handle both problems simultaneously. With a reproducible simulation study we demonstrate the impact of clustered data on the quality of fair machine learning predictions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Transformers are vital assets for the reliable and efficient operation of power and energy systems. They support the integration of renewables to the grid through improved grid stability and operation efficiency. Monitoring the health of transformers is essential to ensure grid reliability and efficiency. Thermal insulation ageing is a key transformer failure mode, which is generally tracked by monitoring the hotspot temperature (HST). However, HST measurement is complex and expensive and often estimated from indirect measurements. Existing computationally-efficient HST models focus on space-agnostic thermal models, providing worst-case HST estimates. This article introduces an efficient spatio-temporal model for transformer winding temperature and ageing estimation, which leverages physics-based partial differential equations (PDEs) with data-driven Neural Networks (NN) in a Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) configuration to improve prediction accuracy and acquire spatio-temporal resolution. The computational efficiency of the PINN model is improved through the implementation of the Residual-Based Attention scheme that accelerates the PINN model convergence. PINN based oil temperature predictions are used to estimate spatio-temporal transformer winding temperature values, which are validated through PDE resolution models and fiber optic sensor measurements, respectively. Furthermore, the spatio-temporal transformer ageing model is inferred, aiding transformer health management decision-making and providing insights into localized thermal ageing phenomena in the transformer insulation. Results are validated with a distribution transformer operated on a floating photovoltaic power plant.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative approaches have significantly influenced Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA), garnering considerable attention. However, existing studies often predict target text components monolithically, neglecting the benefits of utilizing single elements for tuple prediction. In this paper, we introduce Element to Tuple Prompting (E2TP), employing a two-step architecture. The former step focuses on predicting single elements, while the latter step completes the process by mapping these predicted elements to their corresponding tuples. E2TP is inspired by human problem-solving, breaking down tasks into manageable parts, using the first step's output as a guide in the second step. Within this strategy, three types of paradigms, namely E2TP($diet$), E2TP($f_1$), and E2TP($f_2$), are designed to facilitate the training process. Beyond in-domain task-specific experiments, our paper addresses cross-domain scenarios, demonstrating the effectiveness and generalizability of the approach. By conducting a comprehensive analysis on various benchmarks, we show that E2TP achieves new state-of-the-art results in nearly all cases.</li>

We identify a crucial limitation: previous studies often employed implicit teacher-forcing during evaluation, artificially inflating performance metrics. Additionally, they lacked a critical benchmark - comparing model performance on pure noise inputs. We propose a methodology to differentiate between models that truly learn from EEG signals and those that simply memorize training data. Our analysis reveals that model performance on noise data can be comparable to that on EEG data. These findings highlight the need for stricter evaluation practices in EEG-to-Text research, emphasizing transparent reporting and rigorous benchmarking with noise inputs. This approach will lead to more reliable assessments of model capabilities and pave the way for robust EEG-to-Text communication systems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Verifiable Delay Function (VDF) is a cryptographic concept that ensures a minimum delay before output through sequential processing, which is resistant to parallel computing. Among the two well-known VDF protocols, Wesolowski and Pietrzak VDF, we focus on the Pietrzak VDF due to its computational efficiency and suitability for blockchain environments. Pietrzak's approach uses a recursive proof verification with the halving protocol, offering a practical alternative despite the longer proof length than Wesolowski's approach. Given the scarcity of research on practical VDF verification implementation, especially within smart contracts, this paper aims to implement cost-effective verification for the Pietrzak VDF in an Ethereum-based environment without compromising the VDF verification's integrity and reliability. Firstly, we propose generalized proof generation and verification algorithms for potential efficiency improvement. Secondly, we categorize and measure the gas cost of each part in a transaction for VDF verification. Thirdly, based on the analysis, we theoretically predict the optimized proof construction. Finally, we demonstrate the theoretical prediction matches the implementation results. Furthermore, our research shows that the proof length of the Pietrzak VDF is generated under 8 KB with the security level of 2048 bits, much smaller than the previous expectation. This implies that the Pietrzak VDF can be practically used for cryptographic applications on blockchains.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multi-target unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to learn a unified model to address the domain shift between multiple target domains. Due to the difficulty of obtaining annotations for dense predictions, it has recently been introduced into cross-domain semantic segmentation. However, most existing solutions require labeled data from the source domain and unlabeled data from multiple target domains concurrently during training. Collectively, we refer to this data as "external". When faced with new unlabeled data from an unseen target domain, these solutions either do not generalize well or require retraining from scratch on all data. To address these challenges, we introduce a new strategy called "multi-target UDA without external data" for semantic segmentation. Specifically, the segmentation model is initially trained on the external data. Then, it is adapted to a new unseen target domain without accessing any external data. This approach is thus more scalable than existing solutions and remains applicable when external data is inaccessible. We demonstrate this strategy using a simple method that incorporates self-distillation and adversarial learning, where knowledge acquired from the external data is preserved during adaptation through "one-way" adversarial learning. Extensive experiments in several synthetic-to-real and real-to-real adaptation settings on four benchmark urban driving datasets show that our method significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art solutions, even in the absence of external data.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Although Large Language Models (LLMs) are effective in performing various NLP tasks, they still struggle to handle tasks that require extensive, real-world knowledge, especially when dealing with long-tail facts (facts related to long-tail entities). This limitation highlights the need to supplement LLMs with non-parametric knowledge. To address this issue, we analysed the effects of different types of non-parametric knowledge, including textual passage and knowledge graphs (KGs). Since LLMs have probably seen the majority of factual question-answering datasets already, to facilitate our analysis, we proposed a fully automatic pipeline for creating a benchmark that requires knowledge of long-tail facts for answering the involved questions. Using this pipeline, we introduce the LTGen benchmark. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs in different knowledge settings using the proposed benchmark. Our experiments show that LLMs alone struggle with answering these questions, especially when the long-tail level is high or rich knowledge is required. Nonetheless, the performance of the same models improved significantly when they were prompted with non-parametric knowledge. We observed that, in most cases, prompting LLMs with KG triples surpasses passage-based prompting using a state-of-the-art retriever. In addition, while prompting LLMs with both KG triples and documents does not consistently improve knowledge coverage, it can dramatically reduce hallucinations in the generated content.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vanilla pixel-level classifiers for semantic segmentation are based on a certain paradigm, involving the inner product of fixed prototypes obtained from the training set and pixel features in the test image. This approach, however, encounters significant limitations, i.e., feature deviation in the semantic domain and information loss in the spatial domain. The former struggles with large intra-class variance among pixel features from different images, while the latter fails to utilize the structured information of semantic objects effectively. This leads to blurred mask boundaries as well as a deficiency of fine-grained recognition capability. In this paper, we propose a novel Semantic and Spatial Adaptive (SSA) classifier to address the above challenges. Specifically, we employ the coarse masks obtained from the fixed prototypes as a guide to adjust the fixed prototype towards the center of the semantic and spatial domains in the test image. The adapted prototypes in semantic and spatial domains are then simultaneously considered to accomplish classification decisions. In addition, we propose an online multi-domain distillation learning strategy to improve the adaption process. Experimental results on three publicly available benchmarks show that the proposed SSA significantly improves the segmentation performance of the baseline models with only a minimal increase in computational cost.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Compositional image generation requires models to generalise well in situations where two or more input concepts do not necessarily appear together in training (compositional generalisation). Despite recent progress in compositional image generation via composing continuous sampling processes such as diffusion and energy-based models, composing discrete generative processes has remained an open challenge, with the promise of providing improvements in efficiency, interpretability and simplicity. To this end, we propose a formulation for controllable conditional generation of images via composing the log-probability outputs of discrete generative models of the latent space. Our approach, when applied alongside VQ-VAE and VQ-GAN, achieves state-of-the-art generation accuracy in three distinct settings (FFHQ, Positional CLEVR and Relational CLEVR) while attaining competitive Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID) scores. Our method attains an average generation accuracy of $80.71\%$ across the studied settings. Our method also outperforms the next-best approach (ranked by accuracy) in terms of FID in seven out of nine experiments, with an average FID of $24.23$ (an average improvement of $-9.58$). Furthermore, our method offers a $2.3\times$ to $12\times$ speedup over comparable continuous compositional methods on our hardware. We find that our method can generalise to combinations of input conditions that lie outside the training data (e.g. more objects per image) in addition to offering an interpretable dimension of controllability via concept weighting. We further demonstrate that our approach can be readily applied to an open pre-trained discrete text-to-image model without any fine-tuning, allowing for fine-grained control of text-to-image generation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Mesh denoising, aimed at removing noise from input meshes while preserving their feature structures, is a practical yet challenging task. Despite the remarkable progress in learning-based mesh denoising methodologies in recent years, their network designs often encounter two principal drawbacks: a dependence on single-modal geometric representations, which fall short in capturing the multifaceted attributes of meshes, and a lack of effective global feature aggregation, hindering their ability to fully understand the mesh's comprehensive structure. To tackle these issues, we propose SurfaceFormer, a pioneering Transformer-based mesh denoising framework. Our first contribution is the development of a new representation known as Local Surface Descriptor, which is crafted by establishing polar systems on each mesh face, followed by sampling points from adjacent surfaces using geodesics. The normals of these points are organized into 2D patches, mimicking images to capture local geometric intricacies, whereas the poles and vertex coordinates are consolidated into a point cloud to embody spatial information. This advancement surmounts the hurdles posed by the irregular and non-Euclidean characteristics of mesh data, facilitating a smooth integration with Transformer architecture. Next, we propose a dual-stream structure consisting of a Geometric Encoder branch and a Spatial Encoder branch, which jointly encode local geometry details and spatial information to fully explore multimodal information for mesh denoising. A subsequent Denoising Transformer module receives the multimodal information and achieves efficient global feature aggregation through self-attention operators. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that this novel approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both objective and subjective assessments, marking a significant leap forward in mesh denoising.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various domains, although their susceptibility to hallucination poses significant challenges for their deployment in critical areas such as healthcare. To address this issue, retrieving relevant facts from knowledge graphs (KGs) is considered a promising method. Existing KG-augmented approaches tend to be resource-intensive, requiring multiple rounds of retrieval and verification for each factoid, which impedes their application in real-world scenarios. In this study, we propose Self-Refinement-Enhanced Knowledge Graph Retrieval (Re-KGR) to augment the factuality of LLMs' responses with less retrieval efforts in the medical field. Our approach leverages the attribution of next-token predictive probability distributions across different tokens, and various model layers to primarily identify tokens with a high potential for hallucination, reducing verification rounds by refining knowledge triples associated with these tokens. Moreover, we rectify inaccurate content using retrieved knowledge in the post-processing stage, which improves the truthfulness of generated responses. Experimental results on a medical dataset demonstrate that our approach can enhance the factual capability of LLMs across various foundational models as evidenced by the highest scores on truthfulness.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>One image to editable dynamic 3D model and video generation is novel direction and change in the research area of single image to 3D representation or 3D reconstruction of image. Gaussian Splatting has demonstrated its advantages in implicit 3D reconstruction, compared with the original Neural Radiance Fields. As the rapid development of technologies and principles, people tried to used the Stable Diffusion models to generate targeted models with text instructions. However, using the normal implicit machine learning methods is hard to gain the precise motions and actions control, further more, it is difficult to generate a long content and semantic continuous 3D video. To address this issue, we propose the OneTo3D, a method and theory to used one single image to generate the editable 3D model and generate the targeted semantic continuous time-unlimited 3D video. We used a normal basic Gaussian Splatting model to generate the 3D model from a single image, which requires less volume of video memory and computer calculation ability. Subsequently, we designed an automatic generation and self-adaptive binding mechanism for the object armature. Combined with the re-editable motions and actions analyzing and controlling algorithm we proposed, we can achieve a better performance than the SOTA projects in the area of building the 3D model precise motions and actions control, and generating a stable semantic continuous time-unlimited 3D video with the input text instructions. Here we will analyze the detailed implementation methods and theories analyses. Relative comparisons and conclusions will be presented. The project code is open source.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper aims to enrich the capabilities of existing deep learning-based automated valuation models through an efficient graph representation of peer dependencies, thus capturing intricate spatial relationships. In particular, we develop two novel graph neural network models that effectively identify sequences of neighboring houses with similar features, employing different message passing algorithms. The first strategy consider standard spatial graph convolutions, while the second one utilizes transformer graph convolutions. This approach confers scalability to the modeling process. The experimental evaluation is conducted using a proprietary dataset comprising approximately 200,000 houses located in Santiago, Chile. We show that employing tailored graph neural networks significantly improves the accuracy of house price prediction, especially when utilizing transformer convolutional message passing layers.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The number of scientific articles produced every year is growing rapidly. Providing quality control over them is crucial for scientists and, ultimately, for the public good. In modern science, this process is largely delegated to peer review -- a distributed procedure in which each submission is evaluated by several independent experts in the field. Peer review is widely used, yet it is hard, time-consuming, and prone to error. Since the artifacts involved in peer review -- manuscripts, reviews, discussions -- are largely text-based, Natural Language Processing has great potential to improve reviewing. As the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has enabled NLP assistance for many new tasks, the discussion on machine-assisted peer review is picking up the pace. Yet, where exactly is help needed, where can NLP help, and where should it stand aside? The goal of our paper is to provide a foundation for the future efforts in NLP for peer-reviewing assistance. We discuss peer review as a general process, exemplified by reviewing at AI conferences. We detail each step of the process from manuscript submission to camera-ready revision, and discuss the associated challenges and opportunities for NLP assistance, illustrated by existing work. We then turn to the big challenges in NLP for peer review as a whole, including data acquisition and licensing, operationalization and experimentation, and ethical issues. To help consolidate community efforts, we create a companion repository that aggregates key datasets pertaining to peer review. Finally, we issue a detailed call for action for the scientific community, NLP and AI researchers, policymakers, and funding bodies to help bring the research in NLP for peer review forward. We hope that our work will help set the agenda for research in machine-assisted scientific quality control in the age of AI, within the NLP community and beyond.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this work, we develop and analyze a Gradient Descent (GD) based solution, called Alternating GD and Minimization (AltGDmin), for efficiently solving the low rank matrix completion (LRMC) in a federated setting. LRMC involves recovering an $n \times q$ rank-$r$ matrix $\Xstar$ from a subset of its entries when $r \ll \min(n,q)$. Our theoretical guarantees (iteration and sample complexity bounds) imply that AltGDmin is the most communication-efficient solution in a federated setting, is one of the fastest, and has the second best sample complexity among all iterative solutions to LRMC. In addition, we also prove two important corollaries. (a) We provide a guarantee for AltGDmin for solving the noisy LRMC problem. (b) We show how our lemmas can be used to provide an improved sample complexity guarantee for AltMin, which is the fastest centralized solution.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Collective action in Machine Learning is the study of the control that a coordinated group can have over machine learning algorithms. While previous research has concentrated on assessing the impact of collectives against Bayes optimal classifiers, this perspective is limited, given that in reality, classifiers seldom achieve Bayes optimality and are influenced by the choice of learning algorithms along with their inherent inductive biases. In this work, we initiate the study of how the choice of the learning algorithm plays a role in the success of a collective in practical settings. Specifically, we focus on distributionally robust algorithms (DRO), popular for improving a worst group error, and on the popular stochastic gradient descent (SGD), due to its inductive bias for "simpler" functions. Our empirical results, supported by a theoretical foundation, show that the effective size and success of the collective are highly dependent on properties of the learning algorithm. This highlights the necessity of taking the learning algorithm into account when studying the impact of collective action in Machine learning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Semantic segmentation is a core computer vision problem, but the high costs of data annotation have hindered its wide application. Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) offers a cost-efficient workaround to extensive labeling in comparison to fully-supervised methods by using partial or incomplete labels. Existing WSSS methods have difficulties in learning the boundaries of objects leading to poor segmentation results. We propose a novel and effective framework that addresses these issues by leveraging visual foundation models inside the bounding box. Adopting a two-stage WSSS framework, our proposed network consists of a pseudo-label generation module and a segmentation module. The first stage leverages Segment Anything Model (SAM) to generate high-quality pseudo-labels. To alleviate the problem of delineating precise boundaries, we adopt SAM inside the bounding box with the help of another pre-trained foundation model (e.g., Grounding-DINO). Furthermore, we eliminate the necessity of using the supervision of image labels, by employing CLIP in classification. Then in the second stage, the generated high-quality pseudo-labels are used to train an off-the-shelf segmenter that achieves the state-of-the-art performance on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Remote sensing image change captioning (RSICC) aims to automatically generate sentences that describe content differences in remote sensing bitemporal images. Recently, attention-based transformers have become a prevalent idea for capturing the features of global change. However, existing transformer-based RSICC methods face challenges, e.g., high parameters and high computational complexity caused by the self-attention operation in the transformer encoder component. To alleviate these issues, this paper proposes a Sparse Focus Transformer (SFT) for the RSICC task. Specifically, the SFT network consists of three main components, i.e. a high-level features extractor based on a convolutional neural network (CNN), a sparse focus attention mechanism-based transformer encoder network designed to locate and capture changing regions in dual-temporal images, and a description decoder that embeds images and words to generate sentences for captioning differences. The proposed SFT network can reduce the parameter number and computational complexity by incorporating a sparse attention mechanism within the transformer encoder network. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate that even with a reduction of over 90\% in parameters and computational complexity for the transformer encoder, our proposed network can still obtain competitive performance compared to other state-of-the-art RSICC methods.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Low-light scenes are prevalent in real-world applications (e.g. autonomous driving and surveillance at night). Recently, multi-object tracking in various practical use cases have received much attention, but multi-object tracking in dark scenes is rarely considered. In this paper, we focus on multi-object tracking in dark scenes. To address the lack of datasets, we first build a Low-light Multi-Object Tracking (LMOT) dataset. LMOT provides well-aligned low-light video pairs captured by our dual-camera system, and high-quality multi-object tracking annotations for all videos. Then, we propose a low-light multi-object tracking method, termed as LTrack. We introduce the adaptive low-pass downsample module to enhance low-frequency components of images outside the sensor noises. The degradation suppression learning strategy enables the model to learn invariant information under noise disturbance and image quality degradation. These components improve the robustness of multi-object tracking in dark scenes. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of our LMOT dataset and proposed LTrack. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method and its competitiveness in real night low-light scenes. Dataset and Code: https: //github.com/ying-fu/LMOT</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As Transformers have become state-of-the-art models for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, the need to understand and explain their predictions is increasingly apparent. Especially in unsupervised applications, such as information retrieval tasks, similarity models built on top of foundation model representations have been widely applied. However, their inner prediction mechanisms have mostly remained opaque. Recent advances in explainable AI have made it possible to mitigate these limitations by leveraging improved explanations for Transformers through layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP). Using BiLRP, an extension developed for computing second-order explanations in bilinear similarity models, we investigate which feature interactions drive similarity in NLP models. We validate the resulting explanations and demonstrate their utility in three corpus-level use cases, analyzing grammatical interactions, multilingual semantics, and biomedical text retrieval. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of different semantic similarity tasks and models, highlighting how novel explainable AI methods enable in-depth analyses and corpus-level insights.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) have emerged and presented their general problem-solving capabilities with one model. However, the model size has increased dramatically with billions of parameters to enable such broad problem-solving capabilities. In addition, due to the dominance of matrix-matrix and matrix-vector multiplications in LLMs, the compute-to-model size ratio is significantly lower than that of CNNs. This shift pushes LLMs from a computation-bound regime to a memory-bound regime. Therefore, optimizing the memory footprint and traffic is an important optimization direction for LLMs today. Model compression methods such as quantization and parameter pruning have been actively explored for achieving the memory footprint and traffic optimization. However, the accuracy-efficiency trade-off of rank pruning for LLMs is not well-understood yet. Therefore, we characterize the accuracy-efficiency trade-off of a low-rank decomposition method, specifically Tucker decomposition, on recent language models, including an open-source LLM, Llama 2. We formalize the low-rank decomposition design space and show that the decomposition design space is enormous (e.g., O($2^{37}$) for Llama2-7B). To navigate such a vast design space, we formulate the design space and perform thorough case studies of accuracy-efficiency trade-offs using six widely used LLM benchmarks on BERT and Llama 2 models. Our results show that we can achieve a 9\% model size reduction with minimal accuracy drops, which range from 4\%p to 10\%p, depending on the difficulty of the benchmark, without any retraining to recover accuracy after decomposition. The results show that low-rank decomposition can be a promising direction for LLM-based applications that require real-time service in scale (e.g., AI agent assist and real-time coding assistant), where the latency is as important as the model accuracy.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>An important handicap of document analysis research is that documents tend to be copyrighted or contain private information, which prohibits their open publication and the creation of centralised, large-scale document datasets. Instead, documents are scattered in private data silos, making extensive training over heterogeneous data a tedious task. In this work, we explore the use of a federated learning (FL) scheme as a way to train a shared model on decentralised private document data. We focus on the problem of Document VQA, a task particularly suited to this approach, as the type of reasoning capabilities required from the model can be quite different in diverse domains. Enabling training over heterogeneous document datasets can thus substantially enrich DocVQA models. We assemble existing DocVQA datasets from diverse domains to reflect the data heterogeneity in real-world applications. We explore the self-pretraining technique in this multi-modal setting, where the same data is used for both pretraining and finetuning, making it relevant for privacy preservation. We further propose combining self-pretraining with a Federated DocVQA training method using centralized adaptive optimization that outperforms the FedAvg baseline. With extensive experiments, we also present a multi-faceted analysis on training DocVQA models with FL, which provides insights for future research on this task. We show that our pretraining strategies can effectively learn and scale up under federated training with diverse DocVQA datasets and tuning hyperparameters is essential for practical document tasks under federation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) to cater to different human preferences, learning new skills, and unlearning harmful behavior is an important problem. Search-based methods, such as Best-of-N or Monte-Carlo Tree Search, are performant, but impractical for LLM adaptation due to their high inference cost. On the other hand, using Reinforcement Learning (RL) for adaptation is computationally efficient, but performs worse due to the optimization challenges in co-training the value function and the policy. We present a new framework for reward optimization, Value Augmented Sampling (VAS), that can maximize different reward functions using data sampled from only the initial, frozen LLM. VAS solves for the optimal reward-maximizing policy without co-training the policy and the value function, making the optimization stable, outperforming established baselines, such as PPO and DPO, on standard benchmarks, and achieving comparable results to Best-of-128 with lower inference cost. Unlike existing RL methods that require changing the weights of the LLM, VAS does not require access to the weights of the pre-trained LLM. Thus, it can even adapt LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT), which are available only as APIs. In addition, our algorithm unlocks the new capability of composing several rewards and controlling the extent of each one during deployment time, paving the road ahead for the future of aligned, personalized LLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Linear transformers have emerged as a subquadratic-time alternative to softmax attention and have garnered significant interest due to their fixed-size recurrent state that lowers inference cost. However, their original formulation suffers from poor scaling and underperforms compute-matched transformers. Recent linear models such as RWKV and Mamba have attempted to address these shortcomings by proposing novel time-mixing and gating architectures, but pre-training large language models requires significant data and compute investments. Thus, the search for subquadratic architectures is limited by the availability of compute and quality pre-training datasets. As a cost-effective alternative to pre-training linear transformers, we propose Scalable UPtraining for Recurrent Attention (SUPRA). We present a method to uptrain existing large pre-trained transformers into Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with a modest compute budget. This allows us to leverage the strong pre-training data and performance of existing transformer LLMs, while requiring 5% of the training cost. We find that our linearization technique leads to competitive performance on standard benchmarks, but we identify persistent in-context learning and long-context modeling shortfalls for even the largest linear models.
