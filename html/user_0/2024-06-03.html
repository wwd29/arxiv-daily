<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Typically, traditional Imitation Learning (IL) methods first shape a reward or Q function and then use this shaped function within a reinforcement learning (RL) framework to optimize the empirical policy. However, if the shaped reward/Q function does not adequately represent the ground truth reward/Q function, updating the policy within a multi-step RL framework may result in cumulative bias, further impacting policy learning. Although utilizing behavior cloning (BC) to learn a policy by directly mimicking a few demonstrations in a single-step updating manner can avoid cumulative bias, BC tends to greedily imitate demonstrated actions, limiting its capacity to generalize to unseen state action pairs. To address these challenges, we propose ADR-BC, which aims to enhance behavior cloning through augmented density-based action support, optimizing the policy with this augmented support. Specifically, the objective of ADR-BC shares the similar physical meanings that matching expert distribution while diverging the sub-optimal distribution. Therefore, ADR-BC can achieve more robust expert distribution matching. Meanwhile, as a one-step behavior cloning framework, ADR-BC avoids the cumulative bias associated with multi-step RL frameworks. To validate the performance of ADR-BC, we conduct extensive experiments. Specifically, ADR-BC showcases a 10.5% improvement over the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) generalized IL baseline, CEIL, across all tasks in the Gym-Mujoco domain. Additionally, it achieves an 89.5% improvement over Implicit Q Learning (IQL) using real rewards across all tasks in the Adroit and Kitchen domains. On the other hand, we conduct extensive ablations to further demonstrate the effectiveness of ADR-BC.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Legal practice has witnessed a sharp rise in products incorporating artificial intelligence (AI). Such tools are designed to assist with a wide range of core legal tasks, from search and summarization of caselaw to document drafting. But the large language models used in these tools are prone to "hallucinate," or make up false information, making their use risky in high-stakes domains. Recently, certain legal research providers have touted methods such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) as "eliminating" (Casetext, 2023) or "avoid[ing]" hallucinations (Thomson Reuters, 2023), or guaranteeing "hallucination-free" legal citations (LexisNexis, 2023). Because of the closed nature of these systems, systematically assessing these claims is challenging. In this article, we design and report on the first preregistered empirical evaluation of AI-driven legal research tools. We demonstrate that the providers' claims are overstated. While hallucinations are reduced relative to general-purpose chatbots (GPT-4), we find that the AI research tools made by LexisNexis (Lexis+ AI) and Thomson Reuters (Westlaw AI-Assisted Research and Ask Practical Law AI) each hallucinate between 17% and 33% of the time. We also document substantial differences between systems in responsiveness and accuracy. Our article makes four key contributions. It is the first to assess and report the performance of RAG-based proprietary legal AI tools. Second, it introduces a comprehensive, preregistered dataset for identifying and understanding vulnerabilities in these systems. Third, it proposes a clear typology for differentiating between hallucinations and accurate legal responses. Last, it provides evidence to inform the responsibilities of legal professionals in supervising and verifying AI outputs, which remains a central open question for the responsible integration of AI into law.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Image geolocation is a critical task in various image-understanding applications. However, existing methods often fail when analyzing challenging, in-the-wild images. Inspired by the exceptional background knowledge of multimodal language models, we systematically evaluate their geolocation capabilities using a novel image dataset and a comprehensive evaluation framework. We first collect images from various countries via Google Street View. Then, we conduct training-free and training-based evaluations on closed-source and open-source multi-modal language models. we conduct both training-free and training-based evaluations on closed-source and open-source multimodal language models. Our findings indicate that closed-source models demonstrate superior geolocation abilities, while open-source models can achieve comparable performance through fine-tuning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, explainability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The increasing popularity of machine learning (ML) in catalysis has spurred interest in leveraging these techniques to enhance catalyst design. Our study aims to bridge the gap between physics-based studies and data-driven methodologies by integrating ML techniques with eXplainable AI (XAI). Specifically, we employ two XAI techniques: Post-hoc XAI analysis and Symbolic Regression. These techniques help us unravel the correlation between adsorption energy and the properties of the adsorbate-catalyst system. Leveraging a large dataset such as the Open Catalyst Dataset (OC20), we employ a combination of shallow ML techniques and XAI methodologies. Our investigation involves utilizing multiple shallow machine learning techniques to predict adsorption energy, followed by post-hoc analysis for feature importance, inter-feature correlations, and the influence of various feature values on the prediction of adsorption energy. The post-hoc analysis reveals that adsorbate properties exert a greater influence than catalyst properties in our dataset. The top five features based on higher Shapley values are adsorbate electronegativity, the number of adsorbate atoms, catalyst electronegativity, effective coordination number, and the sum of atomic numbers of the adsorbate molecule. There is a positive correlation between catalyst and adsorbate electronegativity with the prediction of adsorption energy. Additionally, symbolic regression yields results consistent with SHAP analysis. It deduces a mathematical relationship indicating that the square of the catalyst electronegativity is directly proportional to the adsorption energy. These consistent correlations resemble those derived from physics-based equations in previous research. Our work establishes a robust framework that integrates ML techniques with XAI, leveraging large datasets like OC20 to enhance catalyst design through model explainability.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performances in complex text generation tasks. However, the contribution of the input prompt to the generated content still remains obscure to humans, underscoring the necessity of elucidating and explaining the causality between input and output pairs. Existing works for providing prompt-specific explanation often confine model output to be classification or next-word prediction. Few initial attempts aiming to explain the entire language generation often treat input prompt texts independently, ignoring their combinatorial effects on the follow-up generation. In this study, we introduce a counterfactual explanation framework based on joint prompt attribution, XPrompt, which aims to explain how a few prompt texts collaboratively influences the LLM's complete generation. Particularly, we formulate the task of prompt attribution for generation interpretation as a combinatorial optimization problem, and introduce a probabilistic algorithm to search for the casual input combination in the discrete space. We define and utilize multiple metrics to evaluate the produced explanations, demonstrating both faithfulness and efficiency of our framework.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>protect, attack, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically harmless but remain vulnerable to carefully crafted prompts known as ``jailbreaks'', which can bypass protective measures and induce harmful behavior. Recent advancements in LLMs have incorporated moderation guardrails that can filter outputs, which trigger processing errors for certain malicious questions. Existing red-teaming benchmarks often neglect to include questions that trigger moderation guardrails, making it difficult to evaluate jailbreak effectiveness. To address this issue, we introduce JAMBench, a harmful behavior benchmark designed to trigger and evaluate moderation guardrails. JAMBench involves 160 manually crafted instructions covering four major risk categories at multiple severity levels. Furthermore, we propose a jailbreak method, JAM (Jailbreak Against Moderation), designed to attack moderation guardrails using jailbreak prefixes to bypass input-level filters and a fine-tuned shadow model functionally equivalent to the guardrail model to generate cipher characters to bypass output-level filters. Our extensive experiments on four LLMs demonstrate that JAM achieves higher jailbreak success ($\sim$ $\times$ 19.88) and lower filtered-out rates ($\sim$ $\times$ 1/6) than baselines.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is recognized as a global healthcare crisis, undermining the efficacy of life-saving antibiotics. This crisis is driven by the improper and overuse of antibiotics, which escalates bacterial resistance. In response, this study explores the use of clinical decision support systems, enhanced through the integration of electronic health records (EHRs), to improve antibiotic stewardship. However, EHR systems present numerous data-level challenges, complicating the effective synthesis and utilization of data. In this work, we transform EHR data into a serialized textual representation and employ pretrained foundation models to demonstrate how this enhanced feature representation can aid in antibiotic susceptibility predictions. Our results suggest that this text representation, combined with foundation models, provides a valuable tool to increase interpretability and support antibiotic stewardship efforts.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the evolving landscape of deep learning, selecting the best pre-trained models from a growing number of choices is a challenge. Transferability scorers propose alleviating this scenario, but their recent proliferation, ironically, poses the challenge of their own assessment. In this work, we propose both robust benchmark guidelines for transferability scorers, and a well-founded technique to combine multiple scorers, which we show consistently improves their results. We extensively evaluate 13 scorers from literature across 11 datasets, comprising generalist, fine-grained, and medical imaging datasets. We show that few scorers match the predictive performance of the simple raw metric of models on ImageNet, and that all predictors suffer on medical datasets. Our results highlight the potential of combining different information sources for reliably predicting transferability across varied domains.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, robust, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The increased availability of medical data has significantly impacted healthcare by enabling the application of machine / deep learning approaches in various instances. However, medical datasets are usually small and scattered across multiple providers, suffer from high class-imbalance, and are subject to stringent data privacy constraints. In this paper, the application of a data regularization algorithm, suitable for learning under high class-imbalance, in a federated learning setting is proposed. Specifically, the goal of the proposed method is to enhance model performance for cardiovascular disease prediction by tackling the class-imbalance that typically characterizes datasets used for this purpose, as well as by leveraging patient data available in different nodes of a federated ecosystem without compromising their privacy and enabling more resource sensitive allocation. The method is evaluated across four datasets for cardiovascular disease prediction, which are scattered across different clients, achieving improved performance. Meanwhile, its robustness under various hyperparameter settings, as well as its ability to adapt to different resource allocation scenarios, is verified.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated Learning (FL) is a promising paradigm that offers significant advancements in privacy-preserving, decentralized machine learning by enabling collaborative training of models across distributed devices without centralizing data. However, the practical deployment of FL systems faces a significant bottleneck: the communication overhead caused by frequently exchanging large model updates between numerous devices and a central server. This communication inefficiency can hinder training speed, model performance, and the overall feasibility of real-world FL applications. In this survey, we investigate various strategies and advancements made in communication-efficient FL, highlighting their impact and potential to overcome the communication challenges inherent in FL systems. Specifically, we define measures for communication efficiency, analyze sources of communication inefficiency in FL systems, and provide a taxonomy and comprehensive review of state-of-the-art communication-efficient FL methods. Additionally, we discuss promising future research directions for enhancing the communication efficiency of FL systems. By addressing the communication bottleneck, FL can be effectively applied and enable scalable and practical deployment across diverse applications that require privacy-preserving, decentralized machine learning, such as IoT, healthcare, or finance.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in cybersecurity applications but have also caused lower confidence due to problems like hallucinations and a lack of truthfulness. Existing benchmarks provide general evaluations but do not sufficiently address the practical and applied aspects of LLM performance in cybersecurity-specific tasks. To address this gap, we introduce the SECURE (Security Extraction, Understanding \& Reasoning Evaluation), a benchmark designed to assess LLMs performance in realistic cybersecurity scenarios. SECURE includes six datasets focussed on the Industrial Control System sector to evaluate knowledge extraction, understanding, and reasoning based on industry-standard sources. Our study evaluates seven state-of-the-art models on these tasks, providing insights into their strengths and weaknesses in cybersecurity contexts, and offer recommendations for improving LLMs reliability as cyber advisory tools.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, transformer, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models and multi-scale features are essential components in semantic segmentation tasks that deal with remote-sensing images. They contribute to improved segmentation boundaries and offer significant contextual information. U-net-like architectures are frequently employed in diffusion models for segmentation tasks. These architectural designs include dense skip connections that may pose challenges for interpreting intermediate features. Consequently, they might not efficiently convey semantic information throughout various layers of the encoder-decoder architecture. To address these challenges, we propose a new model for semantic segmentation known as the diffusion model with parallel multi-scale branches. This model consists of Parallel Multiscale Diffusion modules (P-MSDiff) and a Cross-Bridge Linear Attention mechanism (CBLA). P-MSDiff enhances the understanding of semantic information across multiple levels of granularity and detects repetitive distribution data through the integration of recursive denoising branches. It further facilitates the amalgamation of data by connecting relevant branches to the primary framework to enable concurrent denoising. Furthermore, within the interconnected transformer architecture, the LA module has been substituted with the CBLA module. This module integrates a semidefinite matrix linked to the query into the dot product computation of keys and values. This integration enables the adaptation of queries within the LA framework. This adjustment enhances the structure for multi-head attention computation, leading to enhanced network performance and CBLA is a plug-and-play module. Our model demonstrates superior performance based on the J1 metric on both the UAVid and Vaihingen Building datasets, showing improvements of 1.60% and 1.40% over strong baseline models, respectively.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have shown great promise in natural language processing. However, their reliance on data stored in a retrieval database, which may contain proprietary or sensitive information, introduces new privacy concerns. Specifically, an attacker may be able to infer whether a certain text passage appears in the retrieval database by observing the outputs of the RAG system, an attack known as a Membership Inference Attack (MIA). Despite the significance of this threat, MIAs against RAG systems have yet remained under-explored. This study addresses this gap by introducing an efficient and easy-to-use method for conducting MIA against RAG systems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack using two benchmark datasets and multiple generative models, showing that the membership of a document in the retrieval database can be efficiently determined through the creation of an appropriate prompt in both black-box and gray-box settings. Our findings highlight the importance of implementing security countermeasures in deployed RAG systems to protect the privacy and security of retrieval databases.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep learning models can tease out information from complex inputs. The richer inputs the better these models usually perform. However, models that leverage rich inputs (e.g. multi-sensor, multi-modality, multi-view) can be difficult to deployed widely because some inputs may be missing during deployment. Current popular solutions to this problem includes marginalization, imputation, and training multiple models. Marginalization can obtain calibrated predictions but it is computationally costly and therefore is only feasible for low dimensional inputs. Imputation may result in mis-calibrated predictions because it approximates predictions using point estimates and does not work for high dimensional inputs (e.g. images). Training multiple models whereby each models take different subsets of inputs can work well but requires knowing missing input patterns in advance. Furthermore, training multiple models is costly when models are built on top of foundational models. We propose an efficient way to learn both the conditional distribution using full inputs and the marginal distributions using partial inputs simultaneously using a single model and input mask-out. Input mask-out ensures that learning the marginal distributions does not interfere with learning the conditional distribution. Our approach is general and can be applied to both low- and high-dimensional inputs. We evaluate mask-out in several simulations to show that it can help a single model efficiently learns both conditional and marginal distributions. Experiment results multiple real-world datasets in both classification and segmentation demonstrates the utility of mask-out.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present new results to model and understand the role of encoder-decoder design in machine learning (ML) from an information-theoretic angle. We use two main information concepts, information sufficiency (IS) and mutual information loss (MIL), to represent predictive structures in machine learning. Our first main result provides a functional expression that characterizes the class of probabilistic models consistent with an IS encoder-decoder latent predictive structure. This result formally justifies the encoder-decoder forward stages many modern ML architectures adopt to learn latent (compressed) representations for classification. To illustrate IS as a realistic and relevant model assumption, we revisit some known ML concepts and present some interesting new examples: invariant, robust, sparse, and digital models. Furthermore, our IS characterization allows us to tackle the fundamental question of how much performance (predictive expressiveness) could be lost, using the cross entropy risk, when a given encoder-decoder architecture is adopted in a learning setting. Here, our second main result shows that a mutual information loss quantifies the lack of expressiveness attributed to the choice of a (biased) encoder-decoder ML design. Finally, we address the problem of universal cross-entropy learning with an encoder-decoder design where necessary and sufficiency conditions are established to meet this requirement. In all these results, Shannon's information measures offer new interpretations and explanations for representation learning.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>News articles typically mention numerous entities, a large fraction of which are tangential to the story. Detecting the salience of entities in articles is thus important to applications such as news search, analysis and summarization. In this work, we explore new approaches for efficient and effective salient entity detection by fine-tuning pretrained transformer models with classification heads that use entity tags or contextualized entity representations directly. Experiments show that these straightforward techniques dramatically outperform prior work across datasets with varying sizes and salience definitions. We also study knowledge distillation techniques to effectively reduce the computational cost of these models without affecting their accuracy. Finally, we conduct extensive analyses and ablation experiments to characterize the behavior of the proposed models.</li>

In response, we introduce the ENTIRe-ID dataset, an extensive collection comprising over 4.45 million images from 37 different cameras in varied environments. This dataset is uniquely designed to tackle the challenges of domain variability and model generalization, areas where existing datasets for person re-identification have fallen short. The ENTIRe-ID dataset stands out for its coverage of a wide array of real-world scenarios, encompassing various lighting conditions, angles of view, and diverse human activities. This design ensures a realistic and robust training platform for ReID models. The ENTIRe-ID dataset is publicly available at this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>A long-standing challenge in developing machine learning approaches has been the lack of high-quality labeled data. Recently, models trained with purely synthetic data, here termed synthetic clones, generated using large-scale pre-trained diffusion models have shown promising results in overcoming this annotation bottleneck. As these synthetic clone models progress, they are likely to be deployed in challenging real-world settings, yet their suitability remains understudied. Our work addresses this gap by providing the first benchmark for three classes of synthetic clone models, namely supervised, self-supervised, and multi-modal ones, across a range of robustness measures. We show that existing synthetic self-supervised and multi-modal clones are comparable to or outperform state-of-the-art real-image baselines for a range of robustness metrics - shape bias, background bias, calibration, etc. However, we also find that synthetic clones are much more susceptible to adversarial and real-world noise than models trained with real data. To address this, we find that combining both real and synthetic data further increases the robustness, and that the choice of prompt used for generating synthetic images plays an important part in the robustness of synthetic clones.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Scientific writing is a challenging task, particularly for novice researchers who often rely on feedback from experienced peers. Recent work has primarily focused on improving surface form and style rather than manuscript content. In this paper, we propose a novel task: automated focused feedback generation for scientific writing assistance. We present SWIF$^{2}$T: a Scientific WrIting Focused Feedback Tool. It is designed to generate specific, actionable and coherent comments, which identify weaknesses in a scientific paper and/or propose revisions to it. Our approach consists of four components - planner, investigator, reviewer and controller - leveraging multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) to implement them. We compile a dataset of 300 peer reviews citing weaknesses in scientific papers and conduct human evaluation. The results demonstrate the superiority in specificity, reading comprehension, and overall helpfulness of SWIF$^{2}$T's feedback compared to other approaches. In our analysis, we also identified cases where automatically generated reviews were judged better than human ones, suggesting opportunities for integration of AI-generated feedback in scientific writing.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recommender systems are an integral part of online platforms that recommend new content to users with similar interests. However, they demand a considerable amount of user activity data where, if the data is not adequately protected, constitute a critical threat to the user privacy. Privacy-aware recommender systems enable protection of such sensitive user data while still maintaining a similar recommendation accuracy compared to the traditional non-private recommender systems. However, at present, the current privacy-aware recommender systems suffer from a significant trade-off between privacy and computational efficiency. For instance, it is well known that architectures that rely purely on cryptographic primitives offer the most robust privacy guarantees, however, they suffer from substantial computational and network overhead. Thus, it is crucial to improve this trade-off for better performance. This paper presents a novel privacy-aware recommender system that combines privacy-aware machine learning algorithms for practical scalability and efficiency with cryptographic primitives like Homomorphic Encryption and Multi-Party Computation - without assumptions like trusted-party or secure hardware - for solid privacy guarantees. Experiments on standard benchmark datasets show that our approach results in time and memory gains by three orders of magnitude compared to using cryptographic primitives in a standalone for constructing a privacy-aware recommender system. Furthermore, for the first time our method makes it feasible to compute private recommendations for datasets containing 100 million entries, even on memory-constrained low-power SOC (System on Chip) devices.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) expands the capabilities of modern large language models (LLMs) in chatbot applications, enabling developers to adapt and personalize the LLM output without expensive training or fine-tuning. RAG systems use an external knowledge database to retrieve the most relevant documents for a given query, providing this context to the LLM generator. While RAG achieves impressive utility in many applications, its adoption to enable personalized generative models introduces new security risks. In this work, we propose new attack surfaces for an adversary to compromise a victim's RAG system, by injecting a single malicious document in its knowledge database. We design Phantom, general two-step attack framework against RAG augmented LLMs. The first step involves crafting a poisoned document designed to be retrieved by the RAG system within the top-k results only when an adversarial trigger, a specific sequence of words acting as backdoor, is present in the victim's queries. In the second step, a specially crafted adversarial string within the poisoned document triggers various adversarial attacks in the LLM generator, including denial of service, reputation damage, privacy violations, and harmful behaviors. We demonstrate our attacks on multiple LLM architectures, including Gemma, Vicuna, and Llama.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models (DMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in generating realistic high-quality images, audios, and videos. They benefit significantly from extensive pre-training on large-scale datasets, including web-crawled data with paired data and conditions, such as image-text and image-class pairs. Despite rigorous filtering, these pre-training datasets often inevitably contain corrupted pairs where conditions do not accurately describe the data. This paper presents the first comprehensive study on the impact of such corruption in pre-training data of DMs. We synthetically corrupt ImageNet-1K and CC3M to pre-train and evaluate over 50 conditional DMs. Our empirical findings reveal that various types of slight corruption in pre-training can significantly enhance the quality, diversity, and fidelity of the generated images across different DMs, both during pre-training and downstream adaptation stages. Theoretically, we consider a Gaussian mixture model and prove that slight corruption in the condition leads to higher entropy and a reduced 2-Wasserstein distance to the ground truth of the data distribution generated by the corruptly trained DMs. Inspired by our analysis, we propose a simple method to improve the training of DMs on practical datasets by adding condition embedding perturbations (CEP). CEP significantly improves the performance of various DMs in both pre-training and downstream tasks. We hope that our study provides new insights into understanding the data and pre-training processes of DMs.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Online learning has demonstrated notable potential to dynamically allocate limited resources to monitor a large population of processes, effectively balancing the exploitation of processes yielding high rewards, and the exploration of uncertain processes. However, most online learning algorithms were designed under 1) a centralized setting that requires data sharing across processes to obtain an accurate prediction or 2) a homogeneity assumption that estimates a single global model from the decentralized data. To facilitate the online learning of heterogeneous processes from the decentralized data, we propose a federated collaborative online monitoring method, which captures the latent representative models inherent in the population through representation learning and designs a novel federated collaborative UCB algorithm to estimate the representative models from sequentially observed decentralized data. The efficiency of our method is illustrated through theoretical analysis, simulation studies, and decentralized cognitive degradation monitoring in Alzheimer's disease.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The wide acceptance of large language models (LLMs) has unlocked new applications and social risks. Popular countermeasures aim at detecting misinformation, usually involve domain specific models trained to recognize the relevance of any information. Instead of evaluating the validity of the information, we propose to investigate LLM generated text from the perspective of trust. In this study, we define trust as the ability to know if an input text was generated by a LLM or a human. To do so, we design SPOT, an efficient method, that classifies the source of any, standalone, text input based on originality score. This score is derived from the prediction of a given LLM to detect other LLMs. We empirically demonstrate the robustness of the method to the architecture, training data, evaluation data, task and compression of modern LLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>A new paradigm for machine translation has recently emerged: fine-tuning large language models (LLM) on parallel text has been shown to outperform dedicated translation systems trained in a supervised fashion on much larger amounts of parallel data (Xu et al., 2024a; Alves et al., 2024). However, it remains unclear whether this paradigm can enable massively multilingual machine translation or whether it requires fine-tuning dedicated models for a small number of language pairs. How does translation fine-tuning impact the MT capabilities of LLMs for zero-shot languages, zero-shot language pairs, and translation tasks that do not involve English? To address these questions, we conduct an extensive empirical evaluation of the translation quality of the TOWER family of language models (Alves et al., 2024) on 132 translation tasks from the multi-parallel FLORES-200 data. We find that translation fine-tuning improves translation quality even for zero-shot languages on average, but that the impact is uneven depending on the language pairs involved. These results call for further research to effectively enable massively multilingual translation with LLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep learning offers promising new ways to accurately model aleatoric uncertainty in robotic estimation systems, particularly when the uncertainty distributions do not conform to traditional assumptions of being fixed and Gaussian. In this study, we formulate and evaluate three fundamental deep learning approaches for conditional probability density modeling to quantify non-Gaussian aleatoric uncertainty: parametric, discretized, and generative modeling. We systematically compare the respective strengths and weaknesses of these three methods on simulated non-Gaussian densities as well as on real-world terrain-relative navigation data. Our results show that these deep learning methods can accurately capture complex uncertainty patterns, highlighting their potential for improving the reliability and robustness of estimation systems.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large earthquakes can be destructive and quickly wreak havoc on a landscape. To mitigate immediate threats, early warning systems have been developed to alert residents, emergency responders, and critical infrastructure operators seconds to a minute before seismic waves arrive. These warnings provide time to take precautions and prevent damage. The success of these systems relies on fast, accurate predictions of ground motion intensities, which is challenging due to the complex physics of earthquakes, wave propagation, and their intricate spatial and temporal interactions. To improve early warning, we propose a novel AI-enabled framework, WaveCastNet, for forecasting ground motions from large earthquakes. WaveCastNet integrates a novel convolutional Long Expressive Memory (ConvLEM) model into a sequence to sequence (seq2seq) forecasting framework to model long-term dependencies and multi-scale patterns in both space and time. WaveCastNet, which shares weights across spatial and temporal dimensions, requires fewer parameters compared to more resource-intensive models like transformers and thus, in turn, reduces inference times. Importantly, WaveCastNet also generalizes better than transformer-based models to different seismic scenarios, including to more rare and critical situations with higher magnitude earthquakes. Our results using simulated data from the San Francisco Bay Area demonstrate the capability to rapidly predict the intensity and timing of destructive ground motions. Importantly, our proposed approach does not require estimating earthquake magnitudes and epicenters, which are prone to errors using conventional approaches; nor does it require empirical ground motion models, which fail to capture strongly heterogeneous wave propagation effects.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Taking advantage of the widespread use of ontologies to organise and harmonize knowledge across several distinct domains, this paper proposes a novel approach to improve an embedding-Large Language Model (embedding-LLM) of interest by infusing the knowledge formalized by a reference ontology: ontological knowledge infusion aims at boosting the ability of the considered LLM to effectively model the knowledge domain described by the infused ontology. The linguistic information (i.e. concept synonyms and descriptions) and structural information (i.e. is-a relations) formalized by the ontology are utilized to compile a comprehensive set of concept definitions, with the assistance of a powerful generative LLM (i.e. GPT-3.5-turbo). These concept definitions are then employed to fine-tune the target embedding-LLM using a contrastive learning framework. To demonstrate and evaluate the proposed approach, we utilize the biomedical disease ontology MONDO. The results show that embedding-LLMs enhanced by ontological disease knowledge exhibit an improved capability to effectively evaluate the similarity of in-domain sentences from biomedical documents mentioning diseases, without compromising their out-of-domain performance.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Labeling errors in datasets are common, if not systematic, in practice. They naturally arise in a variety of contexts-human labeling, noisy labeling, and weak labeling (i.e., image classification), for example. This presents a persistent and pervasive stress on machine learning practice. In particular, neural network (NN) architectures can withstand minor amounts of dataset imperfection with traditional countermeasures such as regularization, data augmentation, and batch normalization. However, major dataset imperfections often prove insurmountable. We propose and study the implementation of Rockafellian Relaxation (RR), a new loss reweighting, architecture-independent methodology, for neural network training. Experiments indicate RR can enhance standard neural network methods to achieve robust performance across classification tasks in computer vision and natural language processing (sentiment analysis). We find that RR can mitigate the effects of dataset corruption due to both (heavy) labeling error and/or adversarial perturbation, demonstrating effectiveness across a variety of data domains and machine learning tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Reinforcement learning (RL) is an actively growing field that is seeing increased usage in real-world, safety-critical applications -- making it paramount to ensure the robustness of RL algorithms against adversarial attacks. In this work we explore a particularly stealthy form of training-time attacks against RL -- backdoor poisoning. Here the adversary intercepts the training of an RL agent with the goal of reliably inducing a particular action when the agent observes a pre-determined trigger at inference time. We uncover theoretical limitations of prior work by proving their inability to generalize across domains and MDPs. Motivated by this, we formulate a novel poisoning attack framework which interlinks the adversary's objectives with those of finding an optimal policy -- guaranteeing attack success in the limit. Using insights from our theoretical analysis we develop ``SleeperNets'' as a universal backdoor attack which exploits a newly proposed threat model and leverages dynamic reward poisoning techniques. We evaluate our attack in 6 environments spanning multiple domains and demonstrate significant improvements in attack success over existing methods, while preserving benign episodic return.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In offline reinforcement learning (RL), it is necessary to manage out-of-distribution actions to prevent overestimation of value functions. Policy-regularized methods address this problem by constraining the target policy to stay close to the behavior policy. Although several approaches suggest representing the behavior policy as an expressive diffusion model to boost performance, it remains unclear how to regularize the target policy given a diffusion-modeled behavior sampler. In this paper, we propose Diffusion Actor-Critic (DAC) that formulates the Kullback-Leibler (KL) constraint policy iteration as a diffusion noise regression problem, enabling direct representation of target policies as diffusion models. Our approach follows the actor-critic learning paradigm that we alternatively train a diffusion-modeled target policy and a critic network. The actor training loss includes a soft Q-guidance term from the Q-gradient. The soft Q-guidance grounds on the theoretical solution of the KL constraint policy iteration, which prevents the learned policy from taking out-of-distribution actions. For critic training, we train a Q-ensemble to stabilize the estimation of Q-gradient. Additionally, DAC employs lower confidence bound (LCB) to address the overestimation and underestimation of value targets due to function approximation error. Our approach is evaluated on the D4RL benchmarks and outperforms the state-of-the-art in almost all environments. Code is available at \href{this https URL}{\texttt{this http URL}}.</li>

Current robustness certification methods emphasize local robustness, struggling to scale and generalize. This paper presents a systematic and efficient method to evaluate and verify global robustness for deep neural networks, leveraging the PAC verification framework for solid guarantees on verification results. We utilize probabilistic programs to characterize meaningful input regions, setting a realistic standard for global robustness. Additionally, we introduce the cumulative robustness curve as a criterion in evaluating global robustness. We design a statistical method that combines multi-level splitting and regression analysis for the estimation, significantly reducing the execution time. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our verification method and its capability to find rare and diversified counterexamples for adversarial training.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In Ethereum, the practice of verifying the validity of the passed addresses is a common practice, which is a crucial step to ensure the secure execution of smart contracts. Vulnerabilities in the process of address verification can lead to great security issues, and anecdotal evidence has been reported by our community. However, this type of vulnerability has not been well studied. To fill the void, in this paper, we aim to characterize and detect this kind of emerging vulnerability. We design and implement AVVERIFIER, a lightweight taint analyzer based on static EVM opcode simulation. Its three-phase detector can progressively rule out false positives and false negatives based on the intrinsic characteristics. Upon a well-established and unbiased benchmark, AVVERIFIER can improve efficiency 2 to 5 times than the SOTA while maintaining a 94.3% precision and 100% recall. After a large-scale evaluation of over 5 million Ethereum smart contracts, we have identified 812 vulnerable smart contracts that were undisclosed by our community before this work, and 348 open source smart contracts were further verified, whose largest total value locked is over $11.2 billion. We further deploy AVVERIFIER as a real-time detector on Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain, and the results suggest that AVVERIFIER can raise timely warnings once contracts are deployed.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Primary Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a rare autoimmune disease characterised by immune-mediated destruction of peripheral blood platelets in patients leading to low platelet counts and bleeding. The diagnosis and effective management of ITP is challenging because there is no established test to confirm the disease and no biomarker with which one can predict the response to treatment and outcome. In this work we conduct a feasibility study to check if machine learning can be applied effectively for diagnosis of ITP using routine blood tests and demographic data in a non-acute outpatient setting. Various ML models, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, k-Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree and Random Forest, were applied to data from the UK Adult ITP Registry and a general hematology clinic. Two different approaches were investigated: a demographic-unaware and a demographic-aware one. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the predictive performance of these models and approaches, as well as their bias. The results revealed that Decision Tree and Random Forest models were both superior and fair, achieving nearly perfect predictive and fairness scores, with platelet count identified as the most significant variable. Models not provided with demographic information performed better in terms of predictive accuracy but showed lower fairness score, illustrating a trade-off between predictive performance and fairness.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As a form of artificial intelligence (AI) technology based on interactive learning, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been widely applied across various fields and has achieved remarkable accomplishments. However, DRL faces certain limitations, including low sample efficiency and poor generalization. Therefore, we present how to leverage generative AI (GAI) to address these issues above and enhance the performance of DRL algorithms in this paper. We first introduce several classic GAI and DRL algorithms and demonstrate the applications of GAI-enhanced DRL algorithms. Then, we discuss how to use GAI to improve DRL algorithms from the data and policy perspectives. Subsequently, we introduce a framework that demonstrates an actual and novel integration of GAI with DRL, i.e., GAI-enhanced DRL. Additionally, we provide a case study of the framework on UAV-assisted integrated near-field/far-field communication to validate the performance of the proposed framework. Moreover, we present several future directions. Finally, the related code is available at: this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In recent years, deep generative models have been successfully adopted for various molecular design tasks, particularly in the life and material sciences. A critical challenge for pre-trained generative molecular design (GMD) models is to fine-tune them to be better suited for downstream design tasks aimed at optimizing specific molecular properties. However, redesigning and training an existing effective generative model from scratch for each new design task is impractical. Furthermore, the black-box nature of typical downstream tasks$\unicode{x2013}$such as property prediction$\unicode{x2013}$makes it nontrivial to optimize the generative model in a task-specific manner. In this work, we propose a novel approach for a model uncertainty-guided fine-tuning of a pre-trained variational autoencoder (VAE)-based GMD model through performance feedback in an active learning setting. The main idea is to quantify model uncertainty in the generative model, which is made efficient by working within a low-dimensional active subspace of the high-dimensional VAE parameters explaining most of the variability in the model's output. The inclusion of model uncertainty expands the space of viable molecules through decoder diversity. We then explore the resulting model uncertainty class via black-box optimization made tractable by low-dimensionality of the active subspace. This enables us to identify and leverage a diverse set of high-performing models to generate enhanced molecules. Empirical results across six target molecular properties, using multiple VAE-based generative models, demonstrate that our uncertainty-guided fine-tuning approach consistently outperforms the original pre-trained models.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper introduces the Open Ko-LLM Leaderboard and the Ko-H5 Benchmark as vital tools for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) in Korean. Incorporating private test sets while mirroring the English Open LLM Leaderboard, we establish a robust evaluation framework that has been well integrated in the Korean LLM community. We perform data leakage analysis that shows the benefit of private test sets along with a correlation study within the Ko-H5 benchmark and temporal analyses of the Ko-H5 score. Moreover, we present empirical support for the need to expand beyond set benchmarks. We hope the Open Ko-LLM Leaderboard sets precedent for expanding LLM evaluation to foster more linguistic diversity.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Collaborative graph analysis across multiple institutions is becoming increasingly popular. Realistic examples include social network analysis across various social platforms, financial transaction analysis across multiple banks, and analyzing the transmission of infectious diseases across multiple hospitals. We define the federated graph analytics, a new problem for collaborative graph analytics under differential privacy. Although differentially private graph analysis has been widely studied, it fails to achieve a good tradeoff between utility and privacy in federated scenarios, due to the limited view of local clients and overlapping information across multiple subgraphs. Motivated by this, we first propose a federated graph analytic framework, named FEAT, which enables arbitrary downstream common graph statistics while preserving individual privacy. Furthermore, we introduce an optimized framework based on our proposed degree-based partition algorithm, called FEAT+, which improves the overall utility by leveraging the true local subgraphs. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate that our FEAT and FEAT+ significantly outperform the baseline approach by approximately one and four orders of magnitude, respectively.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In psychiatry, negative patient descriptions and stigmatizing language can contribute to healthcare disparities in two ways: (1) read by patients they can harm their trust and engagement with the medical center; (2) read by future providers they may negatively influence the future perspective of a patient. By leveraging large language models, this work aims to identify the sentiment expressed in psychiatric clinical notes based on the reader's point of view. Extracting sentences from the Mount Sinai Health System's large and diverse clinical notes, we used prompts and in-context learning to adapt three large language models (GPT-3.5, Llama 2, Mistral) to classify the sentiment conveyed by the sentences according to the provider or non-provider point of view. Results showed that GPT-3.5 aligns best to provider point of view, whereas Mistral aligns best to non-provider point of view.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, privacy, protect, attack, diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the development of diffusion-based customization methods like DreamBooth, individuals now have access to train the models that can generate their personalized images. Despite the convenience, malicious users have misused these techniques to create fake images, thereby triggering a privacy security crisis. In light of this, proactive adversarial attacks are proposed to protect users against customization. The adversarial examples are trained to distort the customization model's outputs and thus block the misuse. In this paper, we propose DisDiff (Disrupting Diffusion), a novel adversarial attack method to disrupt the diffusion model outputs. We first delve into the intrinsic image-text relationships, well-known as cross-attention, and empirically find that the subject-identifier token plays an important role in guiding image generation. Thus, we propose the Cross-Attention Erasure module to explicitly "erase" the indicated attention maps and disrupt the text guidance. Besides,we analyze the influence of the sampling process of the diffusion model on Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attack and introduce a novel Merit Sampling Scheduler to adaptively modulate the perturbation updating amplitude in a step-aware manner. Our DisDiff outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by 12.75% of FDFR scores and 7.25% of ISM scores across two facial benchmarks and two commonly used prompts on average.</li>

This paper introduces GAMedX, a Named Entity Recognition (NER) approach utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) to efficiently extract entities from medical narratives and unstructured text generated throughout various phases of the patient hospital visit. By addressing the significant challenge of processing unstructured medical text, GAMedX leverages the capabilities of generative AI and LLMs for improved data extraction. Employing a unified approach, the methodology integrates open-source LLMs for NER, utilizing chained prompts and Pydantic schemas for structured output to navigate the complexities of specialized medical jargon. The findings reveal significant ROUGE F1 score on one of the evaluation datasets with an accuracy of 98\%. This innovation enhances entity extraction, offering a scalable, cost-effective solution for automated forms filling from unstructured data. As a result, GAMedX streamlines the processing of unstructured narratives, and sets a new standard in NER applications, contributing significantly to theoretical and practical advancements beyond the medical technology sphere.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recently, while large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive results, they still suffer from hallucination, i.e., the generation of false information. Model editing is the task of fixing factual mistakes in LLMs; yet, most previous works treat it as a one-time task, paying little attention to ever-emerging mistakes generated by LLMs. We address the task of sequential model editing (SME) that aims to rectify mistakes continuously. A Dynamic Auxiliary Fusion Network (DAFNet) is designed to enhance the semantic interaction among the factual knowledge within the entire sequence, preventing catastrophic forgetting during the editing process of multiple knowledge triples. Specifically, (1) for semantic fusion within a relation triple, we aggregate the intra-editing attention flow into auto-regressive self-attention with token-level granularity in LLMs. We further leverage multi-layer diagonal inter-editing attention flow to update the weighted representations of the entire sequence-level granularity. (2) Considering that auxiliary parameters are required to store the knowledge for sequential editing, we construct a new dataset named \textbf{DAFSet}, fulfilling recent, popular, long-tail and robust properties to enhance the generality of sequential editing. Experiments show DAFNet significantly outperforms strong baselines in single-turn and sequential editing. The usage of DAFSet also consistently improves the performance of other auxiliary network-based methods in various scenarios</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated Learning (FL) stands to gain significant advantages from collaboratively training capacity-heterogeneous models, enabling the utilization of private data and computing power from low-capacity devices. However, the focus on personalizing capacity-heterogeneous models based on client-specific data has been limited, resulting in suboptimal local model utility, particularly for low-capacity clients. The heterogeneity in both data and device capacity poses two key challenges for model personalization: 1) accurately retaining necessary knowledge embedded within reduced submodels for each client, and 2) effectively sharing knowledge through aggregating size-varying parameters. To this end, we introduce Pa3dFL, a novel framework designed to enhance local model performance by decoupling and selectively sharing knowledge among capacity-heterogeneous models. First, we decompose each layer of the model into general and personal parameters. Then, we maintain uniform sizes for the general parameters across clients and aggregate them through direct averaging. Subsequently, we employ a hyper-network to generate size-varying personal parameters for clients using learnable embeddings. Finally, we facilitate the implicit aggregation of personal parameters by aggregating client embeddings through a self-attention module. We conducted extensive experiments on three datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of Pa3dFL. Our findings indicate that Pa3dFL consistently outperforms baseline methods across various heterogeneity settings. Moreover, Pa3dFL demonstrates competitive communication and computation efficiency compared to baseline approaches, highlighting its practicality and adaptability in adverse system conditions.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we introduce LInK, a novel framework that integrates contrastive learning of performance and design space with optimization techniques for solving complex inverse problems in engineering design with discrete and continuous variables. We focus on the path synthesis problem for planar linkage mechanisms. By leveraging a multi-modal and transformation-invariant contrastive learning framework, LInK learns a joint representation that captures complex physics and design representations of mechanisms, enabling rapid retrieval from a vast dataset of over 10 million mechanisms. This approach improves precision through the warm start of a hierarchical unconstrained nonlinear optimization algorithm, combining the robustness of traditional optimization with the speed and adaptability of modern deep learning methods. Our results on an existing benchmark demonstrate that LInK outperforms existing methods with 28 times less error compared to a state-of-the-art approach while taking 20 times less time on an existing benchmark. Moreover, we introduce a significantly more challenging benchmark, named LINK-ABC, which involves synthesizing linkages that trace the trajectories of English capital alphabets - an inverse design benchmark task that existing methods struggle with due to large non-linearities and tiny feasible space. Our results demonstrate that LInK not only advances the field of mechanism design but also broadens the applicability of contrastive learning and optimization to other areas of engineering.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, our goal is to generate synthetic data for heterogeneous (mixed-type) tabular datasets with high machine learning utility (MLu). Given that the MLu performance relies on accurately approximating the conditional distributions, we focus on devising a synthetic data generation method based on conditional distribution estimation. We propose a novel synthetic data generation method, MaCoDE, by redefining the multi-class classification task of Masked Language Modeling (MLM) as histogram-based non-parametric conditional density estimation. Our proposed method enables estimating conditional densities across arbitrary combinations of target and conditional variables. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our proposed method bridges the theoretical gap between distributional learning and MLM. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed model, we conduct synthetic data generation experiments on 10 real-world datasets. Given the analogy between predicting masked input tokens in MLM and missing data imputation, we also evaluate the performance of multiple imputations on incomplete datasets with various missing data mechanisms. Moreover, our proposed model offers the advantage of enabling adjustments to data privacy levels without requiring re-training.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep learning (DL) enables deep neural networks (DNNs) to automatically learn complex tasks or rules from given examples without instructions or guiding principles. As we do not engineer DNNs' functions, it is extremely difficult to diagnose their decisions, and multiple lines of studies proposed to explain principles of DNNs/DL operations. Notably, one line of studies suggests that DNNs may learn concepts, the high level features recognizable to humans. Thus, we hypothesized that DNNs develop abstract codes, not necessarily recognizable to humans, which can be used to augment DNNs' decision-making. To address this hypothesis, we combined foundation segmentation models and unsupervised learning to extract internal codes and identify potential use of abstract codes to make DL's decision-making more reliable and safer.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In semi-supervised semantic segmentation, the Mean Teacher- and co-training-based approaches are employed to mitigate confirmation bias and coupling problems. However, despite their high performance, these approaches frequently involve complex training pipelines and a substantial computational burden, limiting the scalability and compatibility of these methods. In this paper, we propose a PrevMatch framework that effectively mitigates the aforementioned limitations by maximizing the utilization of the temporal knowledge obtained during the training process. The PrevMatch framework relies on two core strategies: (1) we reconsider the use of temporal knowledge and thus directly utilize previous models obtained during training to generate additional pseudo-label guidance, referred to as previous guidance. (2) we design a highly randomized ensemble strategy to maximize the effectiveness of the previous guidance. Experimental results on four benchmark semantic segmentation datasets confirm that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing methods across various evaluation protocols. In particular, with DeepLabV3+ and ResNet-101 network settings, PrevMatch outperforms the existing state-of-the-art method, Diverse Co-training, by +1.6 mIoU on Pascal VOC with only 92 annotated images, while achieving 2.4 times faster training. Furthermore, the results indicate that PrevMatch induces stable optimization, particularly in benefiting classes that exhibit poor performance. Code is available at this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Detecting vulnerabilities within compiled binaries is challenging due to lost high-level code structures and other factors such as architectural dependencies, compilers, and optimization options. To address these obstacles, this research explores vulnerability detection by using natural language processing (NLP) embedding techniques with word2vec, BERT, and RoBERTa to learn semantics from intermediate representation (LLVM) code. Long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks were trained on embeddings from encoders created using approximately 118k LLVM functions from the Juliet dataset. This study is pioneering in its comparison of word2vec models with multiple bidirectional transformer (BERT, RoBERTa) embeddings built using LLVM code to train neural networks to detect vulnerabilities in compiled binaries. word2vec Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) models achieved 92.3% validation accuracy in detecting vulnerabilities, outperforming word2vec Skip-Gram, BERT, and RoBERTa. This suggests that complex contextual NLP embeddings may not provide advantages over simpler word2vec models for this task when a limited number (e.g. 118K) of data samples are used to train the bidirectional transformer-based models. The comparative results provide novel insights into selecting optimal embeddings for learning compiler-independent semantic code representations to advance machine learning detection of vulnerabilities in compiled binaries.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in various tasks using the in-context learning (ICL) paradigm. However, their effectiveness is often compromised by inherent bias, leading to prompt brittleness, i.e., sensitivity to design settings such as example selection, order, and prompt formatting. Previous studies have addressed LLM bias through external adjustment of model outputs, but the internal mechanisms that lead to such bias remain unexplored. Our work delves into these mechanisms, particularly investigating how feedforward neural networks (FFNs) and attention heads result in the bias of LLMs. By Interpreting the contribution of individual FFN vectors and attention heads, we identify the biased LLM components that skew LLMs' prediction toward specific labels. To mitigate these biases, we introduce UniBias, an inference-only method that effectively identifies and eliminates biased FFN vectors and attention heads. Extensive experiments across 12 NLP datasets demonstrate that UniBias significantly enhances ICL performance and alleviates prompt brittleness of LLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The current gold standard for evaluating generated chest x-ray (CXR) reports is through radiologist annotations. However, this process can be extremely time-consuming and costly, especially when evaluating large numbers of reports. In this work, we present FineRadScore, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based automated evaluation metric for generated CXR reports. Given a candidate report and a ground-truth report, FineRadScore gives the minimum number of line-by-line corrections required to go from the candidate to the ground-truth report. Additionally, FineRadScore provides an error severity rating with each correction and generates comments explaining why the correction was needed. We demonstrate that FineRadScore's corrections and error severity scores align with radiologist opinions. We also show that, when used to judge the quality of the report as a whole, FineRadScore aligns with radiologists as well as current state-of-the-art automated CXR evaluation metrics. Finally, we analyze FineRadScore's shortcomings to provide suggestions for future improvements.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the recent paradigm of Federated Learning (FL), multiple clients train a shared model while keeping their local data private. Resource constraints of clients and communication costs pose major problems for training large models in FL. On the one hand, addressing the resource limitations of the clients, sparse training has proven to be a powerful tool in the centralized setting. On the other hand, communication costs in FL can be addressed by local training, where each client takes multiple gradient steps on its local data. Recent work has shown that local training can provably achieve the optimal accelerated communication complexity [Mishchenko et al., 2022]. Hence, one would like an accelerated sparse training algorithm. In this work we show that naive integration of sparse training and acceleration at the server fails, and how to fix it by letting the clients perform these tasks appropriately. We introduce Sparse-ProxSkip, our method developed for the nonconvex setting, inspired by RandProx [Condat and Richtárik, 2022], which provably combines sparse training and acceleration in the convex setting. We demonstrate the good performance of Sparse-ProxSkip in extensive experiments.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Entity matching (EM) is a critical task in data integration, aiming to identify records across different datasets that refer to the same real-world entities. Traditional methods often rely on manually engineered features and rule-based systems, which struggle with diverse and unstructured data. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 offers transformative potential for EM, leveraging their advanced semantic understanding and contextual capabilities. This vision paper explores the application of LLMs to EM, discussing their advantages, challenges, and future research directions.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advancements in diffusion models and diffusion bridges primarily focus on finite-dimensional spaces, yet many real-world problems necessitate operations in infinite-dimensional function spaces for more natural and interpretable formulations. In this paper, we present a theory of stochastic optimal control (SOC) tailored to infinite-dimensional spaces, aiming to extend diffusion-based algorithms to function spaces. Specifically, we demonstrate how Doob's $h$-transform, the fundamental tool for constructing diffusion bridges, can be derived from the SOC perspective and expanded to infinite dimensions. This expansion presents a challenge, as infinite-dimensional spaces typically lack closed-form densities. Leveraging our theory, we establish that solving the optimal control problem with a specific objective function choice is equivalent to learning diffusion-based generative models. We propose two applications: (1) learning bridges between two infinite-dimensional distributions and (2) generative models for sampling from an infinite-dimensional distribution. Our approach proves effective for diverse problems involving continuous function space representations, such as resolution-free images, time-series data, and probability density functions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Human action recognition is a crucial task in computer vision systems. However, in real-world scenarios, human actions often fall outside the distribution of training data, requiring a model to both recognize in-distribution (ID) actions and reject out-of-distribution (OOD) ones. Despite its importance, there has been limited research on OOD detection in human actions. Existing works on OOD detection mainly focus on image data with RGB structure, and many methods are post-hoc in nature. While these methods are convenient and computationally efficient, they often lack sufficient accuracy and fail to consider the presence of OOD samples. To address these challenges, we propose a novel end-to-end skeleton-based model called Action-OOD, specifically designed for OOD human action detection. Unlike some existing approaches that may require prior knowledge of existing OOD data distribution, our model solely utilizes in-distribution (ID) data during the training stage, effectively mitigating the overconfidence issue prevalent in OOD detection. We introduce an attention-based feature fusion block, which enhances the model's capability to recognize unknown classes while preserving classification accuracy for known classes. Further, we present a novel energy-based loss function and successfully integrate it with the traditional cross-entropy loss to maximize the separation of data distributions between ID and OOD. Through extensive experiments conducted on NTU-RGB+D 60, NTU-RGB+D 120, and Kinetics-400 datasets, we demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed approach compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our findings underscore the effectiveness of classic OOD detection techniques in the context of skeleton-based action recognition tasks, offering promising avenues for future research in this field.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>defense, attack, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Query-based black-box attacks have emerged as a significant threat to machine learning systems, where adversaries can manipulate the input queries to generate adversarial examples that can cause misclassification of the model. To counter these attacks, researchers have proposed Stateful Defense Models (SDMs) for detecting adversarial query sequences and rejecting queries that are "similar" to the history queries. Existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) SDMs (e.g., BlackLight and PIHA) have shown great effectiveness in defending against these attacks. However, recent studies have shown that they are vulnerable to Oracle-guided Adaptive Rejection Sampling (OARS) attacks, which is a stronger adaptive attack strategy. It can be easily integrated with existing attack algorithms to evade the SDMs by generating queries with fine-tuned direction and step size of perturbations utilizing the leaked decision information from the SDMs. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Query Provenance Analysis (QPA), for more robust and efficient SDMs. QPA encapsulates the historical relationships among queries as the sequence feature to capture the fundamental difference between benign and adversarial query sequences. To utilize the query provenance, we propose an efficient query provenance analysis algorithm with dynamic management. We evaluate QPA compared with two baselines, BlackLight and PIHA, on four widely used datasets with six query-based black-box attack algorithms. The results show that QPA outperforms the baselines in terms of defense effectiveness and efficiency on both non-adaptive and adaptive attacks. Specifically, QPA reduces the Attack Success Rate (ASR) of OARS to 4.08%, comparing to 77.63% and 87.72% for BlackLight and PIHA, respectively. Moreover, QPA also achieves 7.67x and 2.25x higher throughput than BlackLight and PIHA.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Gaze-annotated facial data is crucial for training deep neural networks (DNNs) for gaze estimation. However, obtaining these data is labor-intensive and requires specialized equipment due to the challenge of accurately annotating the gaze direction of a subject. In this work, we present a generative framework to create annotated gaze data by leveraging the benefits of labeled and unlabeled data sources. We propose a Gaze-aware Compositional GAN that learns to generate annotated facial images from a limited labeled dataset. Then we transfer this model to an unlabeled data domain to take advantage of the diversity it provides. Experiments demonstrate our approach's effectiveness in generating within-domain image augmentations in the ETH-XGaze dataset and cross-domain augmentations in the CelebAMask-HQ dataset domain for gaze estimation DNN training. We also show additional applications of our work, which include facial image editing and gaze redirection.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Relation extraction (RE) is a fundamental task in natural language processing, aiming to identify relations between target entities in text. While many RE methods are designed for a single sentence or document, cross-document RE has emerged to address relations across multiple long documents. Given the nature of long documents in cross-document RE, extracting document embeddings is challenging due to the length constraints of pre-trained language models. Therefore, we propose REward-based Input Construction (REIC), the first learning-based sentence selector for cross-document RE. REIC extracts sentences based on relational evidence, enabling the RE module to effectively infer relations. Since supervision of evidence sentences is generally unavailable, we train REIC using reinforcement learning with RE prediction scores as rewards. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over heuristic methods for different RE structures and backbones in cross-document RE.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we propose a novel data augmentation technique called GenMix, which combines generative and mixture approaches to leverage the strengths of both methods. While generative models excel at creating new data patterns, they face challenges such as mode collapse in GANs and difficulties in training diffusion models, especially with limited medical imaging data. On the other hand, mixture models enhance class boundary regions but tend to favor the major class in scenarios with class imbalance. To address these limitations, GenMix integrates both approaches to complement each other. GenMix operates in two stages: (1) training a generative model to produce synthetic images, and (2) performing mixup between synthetic and real data. This process improves the quality and diversity of synthetic data while simultaneously benefiting from the new pattern learning of generative models and the boundary enhancement of mixture models. We validate the effectiveness of our method on the task of classifying focal liver lesions (FLLs) in CT images. Our results demonstrate that GenMix enhances the performance of various generative models, including DCGAN, StyleGAN, Textual Inversion, and Diffusion Models. Notably, the proposed method with Textual Inversion outperforms other methods without fine-tuning diffusion model on the FLL dataset.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Effective passage retrieval and reranking methods have been widely utilized to identify suitable candidates in open-domain question answering tasks, recent studies have resorted to LLMs for reranking the retrieved passages by the log-likelihood of the question conditioned on each passage. Although these methods have demonstrated promising results, the performance is notably sensitive to the human-written prompt (or hard prompt), and fine-tuning LLMs can be computationally intensive and time-consuming. Furthermore, this approach limits the leverage of question-passage relevance pairs and passage-specific knowledge to enhance the ranking capabilities of LLMs. In this paper, we propose passage-specific prompt tuning for reranking in open-domain question answering (PSPT): a parameter-efficient method that fine-tunes learnable passage-specific soft prompts, incorporating passage-specific knowledge from a limited set of question-passage relevance pairs. The method involves ranking retrieved passages based on the log-likelihood of the model generating the question conditioned on each passage and the learned soft prompt. We conducted extensive experiments utilizing the Llama-2-chat-7B model across three publicly available open-domain question answering datasets and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Prompt recovery in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for understanding how LLMs work and addressing concerns regarding privacy, copyright, etc. The trend towards inference-only APIs complicates this task by restricting access to essential outputs for recovery. To tackle this challenge, we extract prompt-related information from limited outputs and identify a strong(negative) correlation between output probability-based uncertainty and the success of prompt recovery. This finding led to the development of Deliberative PrOmpt RecoverY (DORY), our novel approach that leverages uncertainty to recover prompts accurately. DORY involves reconstructing drafts from outputs, refining these with hints, and filtering out noise based on uncertainty. Our evaluation across diverse LLMs and prompt benchmarks shows that DORY outperforms existing baselines, improving performance by approximately 10.82% and establishing a new state-of-the-art record in prompt recovery tasks. Significantly, DORY operates using a single LLM without any external resources or model, offering a cost-effective, user-friendly prompt recovery solution.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Counterfactual explanation generation is a powerful method for Explainable Artificial Intelligence. It can help users understand why machine learning models make specific decisions, and how to change those decisions. Evaluating the robustness of counterfactual explanation algorithms is therefore crucial. Previous literature has widely studied the robustness based on the perturbation of input instances. However, the robustness defined from the perspective of perturbed instances is sometimes biased, because this definition ignores the impact of learning algorithms on robustness. In this paper, we propose a more reasonable definition, Weak Robust Compatibility, based on the perspective of explanation strength. In practice, we propose WRC-Test to help us generate more robust counterfactuals. Meanwhile, we designed experiments to verify the effectiveness of WRC-Test. Theoretically, we introduce the concepts of PAC learning theory and define the concept of PAC WRC-Approximability. Based on reasonable assumptions, we establish oracle inequalities about weak robustness, which gives a sufficient condition for PAC WRC-Approximability.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Single image-to-3D generation is pivotal for crafting controllable 3D assets. Given its underconstrained nature, we leverage geometric priors from a 3D novel view generation diffusion model and appearance priors from a 2D image generation method to guide the optimization process. We note that a disparity exists between the training datasets of 2D and 3D diffusion models, leading to their outputs showing marked differences in appearance. Specifically, 2D models tend to deliver more detailed visuals, whereas 3D models produce consistent yet over-smooth results across different views. Hence, we optimize a set of 3D Gaussians using 3D priors in spatial domain to ensure geometric consistency, while exploiting 2D priors in the frequency domain through Fourier transform for higher visual quality. This 2D-3D hybrid Fourier Score Distillation objective function (dubbed hy-FSD), can be integrated into existing 3D generation methods, yielding significant performance improvements. With this technique, we further develop an image-to-3D generation pipeline to create high-quality 3D objects within one minute, named Fourier123. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Fourier123 excels in efficient generation with rapid convergence speed and visual-friendly generation results.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Even for simple arithmetic tasks like integer addition, it is challenging for Transformers to generalize to longer sequences than those encountered during training. To tackle this problem, we propose position coupling, a simple yet effective method that directly embeds the structure of the tasks into the positional encoding of a (decoder-only) Transformer. Taking a departure from the vanilla absolute position mechanism assigning unique position IDs to each of the tokens, we assign the same position IDs to two or more "relevant" tokens; for integer addition tasks, we regard digits of the same significance as in the same position. On the empirical side, we show that with the proposed position coupling, a small (1-layer) Transformer trained on 1 to 30-digit additions can generalize up to 200-digit additions (6.67x of the trained length). On the theoretical side, we prove that a 1-layer Transformer with coupled positions can solve the addition task involving exponentially many digits, whereas any 1-layer Transformer without positional information cannot entirely solve it. We also demonstrate that position coupling can be applied to other algorithmic tasks such as addition with multiple summands, Nx2 multiplication, copy/reverse, and a two-dimensional task.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This study explores the impact of adversarial perturbations on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with the aim of enhancing the understanding of their underlying mechanisms. Despite numerous defense methods proposed in the literature, there is still an incomplete understanding of this phenomenon. Instead of treating the entire model as vulnerable, we propose that specific feature maps learned during training contribute to the overall vulnerability. To investigate how the hidden representations learned by a CNN affect its vulnerability, we introduce the Adversarial Intervention framework. Experiments were conducted on models trained on three well-known computer vision datasets, subjecting them to attacks of different nature. Our focus centers on the effects that adversarial perturbations to a model's initial layer have on the overall behavior of the model. Empirical results revealed compelling insights: a) perturbing selected channel combinations in shallow layers causes significant disruptions; b) the channel combinations most responsible for the disruptions are common among different types of attacks; c) despite shared vulnerable combinations of channels, different attacks affect hidden representations with varying magnitudes; d) there exists a positive correlation between a kernel's magnitude and its vulnerability. In conclusion, this work introduces a novel framework to study the vulnerability of a CNN model to adversarial perturbations, revealing insights that contribute to a deeper understanding of the phenomenon. The identified properties pave the way for the development of efficient ad-hoc defense mechanisms in future applications.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Current 4D generation methods have achieved noteworthy efficacy with the aid of advanced diffusion generative models. However, these methods lack multi-view spatial-temporal modeling and encounter challenges in integrating diverse prior knowledge from multiple diffusion models, resulting in inconsistent temporal appearance and flickers. In this paper, we propose a novel 4D generation pipeline, namely 4Diffusion aimed at generating spatial-temporally consistent 4D content from a monocular video. We first design a unified diffusion model tailored for multi-view video generation by incorporating a learnable motion module into a frozen 3D-aware diffusion model to capture multi-view spatial-temporal correlations. After training on a curated dataset, our diffusion model acquires reasonable temporal consistency and inherently preserves the generalizability and spatial consistency of the 3D-aware diffusion model. Subsequently, we propose 4D-aware Score Distillation Sampling loss, which is based on our multi-view video diffusion model, to optimize 4D representation parameterized by dynamic NeRF. This aims to eliminate discrepancies arising from multiple diffusion models, allowing for generating spatial-temporally consistent 4D content. Moreover, we devise an anchor loss to enhance the appearance details and facilitate the learning of dynamic NeRF. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to previous methods.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have emerged as a powerful class of deep generative models, achieving remarkable performance in image synthesis tasks. However, these models face challenges in terms of widespread adoption due to their reliance on sequential denoising steps during sample generation. This dependence leads to substantial computational requirements, making them unsuitable for resource-constrained or real-time processing systems. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method that integrates denoising phases directly into the model's architecture, thereby reducing the need for resource-intensive computations. Our approach combines diffusion models with generative adversarial networks (GANs) through knowledge distillation, enabling more efficient training and evaluation. By utilizing a pre-trained diffusion model as a teacher model, we train a student model through adversarial learning, employing layerwise transformations for denoising and submodules for predicting the teacher model's output at various points in time. This integration significantly reduces the number of parameters and denoising steps required, leading to improved sampling speed at test time. We validate our method with extensive experiments, demonstrating comparable performance with reduced computational requirements compared to existing approaches. By enabling the deployment of diffusion models on resource-constrained devices, our research mitigates their computational burden and paves the way for wider accessibility and practical use across the research community and end-users.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We consider the problem of online multi-agent Nash social welfare (NSW) maximization. While previous works of Hossain et al. [2021], Jones et al. [2023] study similar problems in stochastic multi-agent multi-armed bandits and show that $\sqrt{T}$-regret is possible after $T$ rounds, their fairness measure is the product of all agents' rewards, instead of their NSW (that is, their geometric mean). Given the fundamental role of NSW in the fairness literature, it is more than natural to ask whether no-regret fair learning with NSW as the objective is possible. In this work, we provide a complete answer to this question in various settings. Specifically, in stochastic $N$-agent $K$-armed bandits, we develop an algorithm with $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(K^{\frac{2}{N}}T^{\frac{N-1}{N}}\right)$ regret and prove that the dependence on $T$ is tight, making it a sharp contrast to the $\sqrt{T}$-regret bounds of Hossain et al. [2021], Jones et al. [2023]. We then consider a more challenging version of the problem with adversarial rewards. Somewhat surprisingly, despite NSW being a concave function, we prove that no algorithm can achieve sublinear regret. To circumvent such negative results, we further consider a setting with full-information feedback and design two algorithms with $\sqrt{T}$-regret: the first one has no dependence on $N$ at all and is applicable to not just NSW but a broad class of welfare functions, while the second one has better dependence on $K$ and is preferable when $N$ is small. Finally, we also show that logarithmic regret is possible whenever there exists one agent who is indifferent about different arms.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Individuals and businesses have been significantly benefited by Large Language Models (LLMs) including PaLM, Gemini and ChatGPT in various ways. For example, LLMs enhance productivity, reduce costs, and enable us to focus on more valuable tasks. Furthermore, LLMs possess the capacity to sift through extensive datasets, uncover underlying patterns, and furnish critical insights that propel the frontiers of technology and science. However, LLMs also pose privacy concerns. Users' interactions with LLMs may expose their sensitive personal or company information. A lack of robust privacy safeguards and legal frameworks could permit the unwarranted intrusion or improper handling of individual data, thereby risking infringements of privacy and the theft of personal identities. To ensure privacy, it is essential to minimize the dependency between shared prompts and private information. Various randomization approaches have been proposed to protect prompts' privacy, but they may incur utility loss compared to unprotected LLMs prompting. Therefore, it is essential to evaluate the balance between the risk of privacy leakage and loss of utility when conducting effective protection mechanisms. The current study develops a framework for inferring privacy-protected Large Language Models (LLMs) and lays down a solid theoretical basis for examining the interplay between privacy preservation and utility. The core insight is encapsulated within a theorem that is called as the NFL (abbreviation of the word No-Free-Lunch) Theorem.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep learning algorithms have a large number of trainable parameters often with sizes of hundreds of thousands or more. Training this algorithm requires a large amount of training data and generating a sufficiently large dataset for these algorithms is costly\cite{noguchi2019image}. GANs are generative neural networks that use two deep learning networks that are competing with each other. The networks are generator and discriminator networks. The generator tries to generate realistic images which resemble the actual training dataset by approximating the training data distribution and the discriminator is trained to classify images as real or fake(generated)\cite{goodfellow2016nips}. Training these GAN algorithms also requires a large amount of training dataset\cite{noguchi2019image}. In this study, the aim is to address the question, "Given an unconditioned pretrained generator network and a pretrained classifier, is it feasible to develop a conditioned generator without relying on any training dataset?" The paper begins with a general introduction to the problem. The subsequent sections are structured as follows: Section 2 provides background information on the problem. Section 3 reviews relevant literature on the topic. Section 4 outlines the methodology employed in this study. Section 5 presents the experimental results. Section 6 discusses the findings and proposes potential future research directions. Finally, Section 7 offers concluding remarks. The implementation can be accessed \href{this https URL}{here}.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper introduces DiffPuter, an iterative method for missing data imputation that leverages the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm and Diffusion Models. By treating missing data as hidden variables that can be updated during model training, we frame the missing data imputation task as an EM problem. During the M-step, DiffPuter employs a diffusion model to learn the joint distribution of both the observed and currently estimated missing data. In the E-step, DiffPuter re-estimates the missing data based on the conditional probability given the observed data, utilizing the diffusion model learned in the M-step. Starting with an initial imputation, DiffPuter alternates between the M-step and E-step until convergence. Through this iterative process, DiffPuter progressively refines the complete data distribution, yielding increasingly accurate estimations of the missing data. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that the unconditional training and conditional sampling processes of the diffusion model align precisely with the objectives of the M-step and E-step, respectively. Empirical evaluations across 10 diverse datasets and comparisons with 16 different imputation methods highlight DiffPuter's superior performance. Notably, DiffPuter achieves an average improvement of 8.10% in MAE and 5.64% in RMSE compared to the most competitive existing method.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In-context learning is a promising approach for offline reinforcement learning (RL) to handle online tasks, which can be achieved by providing task prompts. Recent works demonstrated that in-context RL could emerge with self-improvement in a trial-and-error manner when treating RL tasks as an across-episodic sequential prediction problem. Despite the self-improvement not requiring gradient updates, current works still suffer from high computational costs when the across-episodic sequence increases with task horizons. To this end, we propose an In-context Decision Transformer (IDT) to achieve self-improvement in a high-level trial-and-error manner. Specifically, IDT is inspired by the efficient hierarchical structure of human decision-making and thus reconstructs the sequence to consist of high-level decisions instead of low-level actions that interact with environments. As one high-level decision can guide multi-step low-level actions, IDT naturally avoids excessively long sequences and solves online tasks more efficiently. Experimental results show that IDT achieves state-of-the-art in long-horizon tasks over current in-context RL methods. In particular, the online evaluation time of our IDT is \textbf{36$\times$} times faster than baselines in the D4RL benchmark and \textbf{27$\times$} times faster in the Grid World benchmark.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The widespread presence of Use-After-Free (UAF) vulnerabilities poses a serious threat to software security, with dangling pointers being considered the primary cause of these vulnerabilities. However, existing methods for defending against UAF vulnerabilities by eliminating dangling pointers need to interrupt the program's execution when encountering pointer assignment operations to look up the objects pointed to by the pointers and store the memory addresses of the pointers in a specific data structure. This makes these methods not lightweight. To overcome this drawback, we propose a novel approach called LightDE. This method does not require storing the memory addresses of pointers or locating the objects pointed to by pointers during program execution. LightDE uses our proposed structure-sensitive pointer analysis method to determine the objects pointed to by pointers and stores the pointing relationships in the program's data segment during program compilation. Since LightDE only needs to check whether the pointers identified by the pointer analysis point to the released objects when the objects are released, LightDE is very lightweight. Our experimental results show that LightDE can effectively defend against UAF vulnerabilities, and the additional performance overhead it introduces is very low.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional instruct-following ability to complete various downstream tasks. Although this impressive ability makes LLMs flexible task solvers, their performance in solving tasks also heavily relies on instructions. In this paper, we reveal that LLMs are over-sensitive to lexical variations in task instructions, even when the variations are imperceptible to humans. By providing models with neighborhood instructions, which are closely situated in the latent representation space and differ by only one semantically similar word, the performance on downstream tasks can be vastly different. Following this property, we propose a black-box Combinatorial Optimization framework for Prompt Lexical Enhancement (COPLE). COPLE performs iterative lexical optimization according to the feedback from a batch of proxy tasks, using a search strategy related to word influence. Experiments show that even widely-used human-crafted prompts for current benchmarks suffer from the lexical sensitivity of models, and COPLE recovers the declined model ability in both instruct-following and solving downstream tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) involves extracting opinions from textual data about specific entities and their corresponding aspects through various complementary subtasks. Several prior research has focused on developing ad hoc designs of varying complexities for these subtasks. In this paper, we present a generative framework extensible to any ABSA subtask. We build upon the instruction tuned model proposed by Scaria et al. (2023), who present an instruction-based model with task descriptions followed by in-context examples on ABSA subtasks. We propose PFInstruct, an extension to this instruction learning paradigm by appending an NLP-related task prefix to the task description. This simple approach leads to improved performance across all tested SemEval subtasks, surpassing previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) on the ATE subtask (Rest14) by +3.28 F1-score, and on the AOOE subtask by an average of +5.43 F1-score across SemEval datasets. Furthermore, we explore the impact of the prefix-enhanced prompt quality on the ABSA subtasks and find that even a noisy prefix enhances model performance compared to the baseline. Our method also achieves competitive results on a biomedical domain dataset (ERSA).</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Garbling schemes are vital primitives for privacy-preserving protocols and secure two-party computation. This paper presents a projective garbling scheme that assigns $2^n$ values to wires in a circuit comprising XOR and unary projection gates. A generalization of FreeXOR allows the XOR of wires with $2^n$ values to be very efficient. We then analyze the performance of our scheme by evaluating substitution-permutation ciphers. Using our proposal, we measure high-speed evaluation of the ciphers with a moderately increased cost in garbling and bandwidth. Theoretical analysis suggests that for evaluating the nine examined ciphers, one can expect a 4- to 70-fold improvement in evaluation performance with, at most, a 4-fold increase in garbling cost and, at most, an 8-fold increase in communication cost compared to the Half-Gates (Zahur, Rosulek and Evans; Eurocrypt'15) and ThreeHalves (Rosulek and Roy; Crypto'21) garbling schemes. In an offline/online setting, such as secure function evaluation as a service, the circuit garbling and communication to the evaluator can proceed in the offline phase. Thus, our scheme offers a fast online phase. Furthermore, we present efficient Boolean circuits for the S-boxes of TWINE and Midori64 ciphers. To our knowledge, our formulas give the smallest number of AND gates for the S-boxes of these two ciphers.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Successive image generation using cyclic transformations is demonstrated by extending the CycleGAN model to transform images among three different categories. Repeated application of the trained generators produces sequences of images that transition among the different categories. The generated image sequences occupy a more limited region of the image space compared with the original training dataset. Quantitative evaluation using precision and recall metrics indicates that the generated images have high quality but reduced diversity relative to the training dataset. Such successive generation processes are characterized as chaotic dynamics in terms of dynamical system theory. Positive Lyapunov exponents estimated from the generated trajectories confirm the presence of chaotic dynamics, with the Lyapunov dimension of the attractor found to be comparable to the intrinsic dimension of the training data manifold. The results suggest that chaotic dynamics in the image space defined by the deep generative model contribute to the diversity of the generated images, constituting a novel approach for multi-class image generation. This model can be interpreted as an extension of classical associative memory to perform hetero-association among image categories.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>To ensure safe urban driving for autonomous platforms, it is crucial not only to develop high-performance object detection techniques but also to establish a diverse and representative dataset that captures various urban environments and object characteristics. To address these two issues, we have constructed a multi-class 3D LiDAR dataset reflecting diverse urban environments and object characteristics, and developed a robust 3D semi-supervised object detection (SSOD) based on a multiple teachers framework. This SSOD framework categorizes similar classes and assigns specialized teachers to each category. Through collaborative supervision among these category-specialized teachers, the student network becomes increasingly proficient, leading to a highly effective object detector. We propose a simple yet effective augmentation technique, Pie-based Point Compensating Augmentation (PieAug), to enable the teacher network to generate high-quality pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments on the WOD, KITTI, and our datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed method and the quality of our dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art 3D semi-supervised object detection methods across all datasets. We plan to release our multi-class LiDAR dataset and the source code available on our Github repository in the near future.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With heightened awareness of data privacy protection, Federated Learning (FL) has attracted widespread attention as a privacy-preserving distributed machine learning method. However, the distributed nature of federated learning also provides opportunities for backdoor attacks, where attackers can guide the model to produce incorrect predictions without affecting the global model training process. This paper introduces a novel defense mechanism against backdoor attacks in federated learning, named GANcrop. This approach leverages contrastive learning to deeply explore the disparities between malicious and benign models for attack identification, followed by the utilization of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to recover backdoor triggers and implement targeted mitigation strategies. Experimental findings demonstrate that GANcrop effectively safeguards against backdoor attacks, particularly in non-IID scenarios, while maintaining satisfactory model accuracy, showcasing its remarkable defensive efficacy and practical utility.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper introduces a novel approach to learning instance segmentation using extreme points, i.e., the topmost, leftmost, bottommost, and rightmost points, of each object. These points are readily available in the modern bounding box annotation process while offering strong clues for precise segmentation, and thus allows to improve performance at the same annotation cost with box-supervised methods. Our work considers extreme points as a part of the true instance mask and propagates them to identify potential foreground and background points, which are all together used for training a pseudo label generator. Then pseudo labels given by the generator are in turn used for supervised learning of our final model. On three public benchmarks, our method significantly outperforms existing box-supervised methods, further narrowing the gap with its fully supervised counterpart. In particular, our model generates high-quality masks when a target object is separated into multiple parts, where previous box-supervised methods often fail.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the healthcare sector, a consciousness surrounding data privacy and corresponding data protection regulations, as well as heterogeneous and non-harmonized data, pose huge challenges to large-scale data analysis. Moreover, clinical data often involves partially overlapping features, as some observations may be missing due to various reasons, such as differences in procedures, diagnostic tests, or other recorded patient history information across hospitals or institutes. To address the challenges posed by partially overlapping features and incomplete data in clinical datasets, a comprehensive approach is required. Particularly in the domain of medical data, promising outcomes are achieved by federated random forests whenever features align. However, for most standard algorithms, like random forest, it is essential that all data sets have identical parameters. Therefore, in this work the concept of federated random forest is adapted to a setting with partially overlapping features. Moreover, our research assesses the effectiveness of the newly developed federated random forest models for partially overlapping clinical data. For aggregating the federated, globally optimized model, only features available locally at each site can be used. We tackled two issues in federation: (i) the quantity of involved parties, (ii) the varying overlap of features. This evaluation was conducted across three clinical datasets. The federated random forest model even in cases where only a subset of features overlaps consistently demonstrates superior performance compared to its local counterpart. This holds true across various scenarios, including datasets with imbalanced classes. Consequently, federated random forests for partially overlapped data offer a promising solution to transcend barriers in collaborative research and corporate cooperation.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Trajectory forecasting is crucial for video surveillance analytics, as it enables the anticipation of future movements for a set of agents, e.g. basketball players engaged in intricate interactions with long-term intentions. Deep generative models offer a natural learning approach for trajectory forecasting, yet they encounter difficulties in achieving an optimal balance between sampling fidelity and diversity. We address this challenge by leveraging Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs), which utilize a discrete latent space to tackle the issue of posterior collapse. Specifically, we introduce an instance-based codebook that allows tailored latent representations for each example. In a nutshell, the rows of the codebook are dynamically adjusted to reflect contextual information (i.e., past motion patterns extracted from the observed trajectories). In this way, the discretization process gains flexibility, leading to improved reconstructions. Notably, instance-level dynamics are injected into the codebook through low-rank updates, which restrict the customization of the codebook to a lower dimension space. The resulting discrete space serves as the basis of the subsequent step, which regards the training of a diffusion-based predictive model. We show that such a two-fold framework, augmented with instance-level discretization, leads to accurate and diverse forecasts, yielding state-of-the-art performance on three established benchmarks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion Models (DMs) have achieved great success in image generation and other fields. By fine sampling through the trajectory defined by the SDE/ODE solver based on a well-trained score model, DMs can generate remarkable high-quality results. However, this precise sampling often requires multiple steps and is computationally demanding. To address this problem, instance-based distillation methods have been proposed to distill a one-step generator from a DM by having a simpler student model mimic a more complex teacher model. Yet, our research reveals an inherent limitations in these methods: the teacher model, with more steps and more parameters, occupies different local minima compared to the student model, leading to suboptimal performance when the student model attempts to replicate the teacher. To avoid this problem, we introduce a novel distributional distillation method, which uses an exclusive distributional loss. This method exceeds state-of-the-art (SOTA) results while requiring significantly fewer training images. Additionally, we show that DMs' layers are activated differently at different time steps, leading to an inherent capability to generate images in a single step. Freezing most of the convolutional layers in a DM during distributional distillation leads to further performance improvements. Our method achieves the SOTA results on CIFAR-10 (FID 1.54), AFHQv2 64x64 (FID 1.23), FFHQ 64x64 (FID 0.85) and ImageNet 64x64 (FID 1.16) with great efficiency. Most of those results are obtained with only 5 million training images within 6 hours on 8 A100 GPUs. This breakthrough not only enhances the understanding of efficient image generation models but also offers a scalable framework for advancing the state of the art in various applications.</li>

Instead of relying on fine-grained linguistic analyses of prompts, human annotation, or auxiliary vision-language models to steer image generation, in this work we present a novel method that relies on an information-theoretic alignment measure. In a nutshell, our method uses self-supervised fine-tuning and relies on point-wise mutual information between prompts and images to define a synthetic training set to induce model alignment. Our comparative analysis shows that our method is on-par or superior to the state-of-the-art, yet requires nothing but a pre-trained denoising network to estimate MI and a lightweight fine-tuning strategy.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vertical federated learning (VFL) is a promising area for time series forecasting in industrial applications, such as predictive maintenance and machine control. Critical challenges to address in manufacturing include data privacy and over-fitting on small and noisy datasets during both training and inference. Additionally, to increase industry adaptability, such forecasting models must scale well with the number of parties while ensuring strong convergence and low-tuning complexity. We address those challenges and propose 'Secret-shared Time Series Forecasting with VFL' (STV), a novel framework that exhibits the following key features: i) a privacy-preserving algorithm for forecasting with SARIMAX and autoregressive trees on vertically partitioned data; ii) serverless forecasting using secret sharing and multi-party computation; iii) novel N-party algorithms for matrix multiplication and inverse operations for direct parameter optimization, giving strong convergence with minimal hyperparameter tuning complexity. We conduct evaluations on six representative datasets from public and industry-specific contexts. Our results demonstrate that STV's forecasting accuracy is comparable to those of centralized approaches. They also show that our direct optimization can outperform centralized methods, which include state-of-the-art diffusion models and long-short-term memory, by 23.81% on forecasting accuracy. We also conduct a scalability analysis by examining the communication costs of direct and iterative optimization to navigate the choice between the two.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>protect</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Access control is the enforcement of the authorization policy, which defines subjects, resources, and access rights. Graph-structured data requires advanced, flexible, and fine-grained access control due to its complex structure as sequences of alternating vertices and edges. Several research works focus on protecting property graph-structured data, enforcing fine-grained access control, and proving the feasibility and applicability of their concept. However, they differ conceptually and technically. We select works from our systematic literature review on authorization and access control for different database models in addition to recent ones. Based on defined criteria, we exclude research works with different objectives, such as no protection of graph-structured data, graph models other than the property graph, coarse-grained access control approaches, or no application in a graph datastore (i.e., no proof-of-concept implementation). The latest version of the remaining works are discussed in detail in terms of their access control approach as well as authorization policy definition and enforcement. Finally, we analyze the strengths and limitations of the selected works and provide a comparison with respect to different aspects, including the base access control model, open/closed policy, negative permission support, and datastore-independent enforcement.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative models are widely utilized to model the distribution of fused images in the field of infrared and visible image fusion. However, current generative models based fusion methods often suffer from unstable training and slow inference speed. To tackle this problem, a novel fusion method based on consistency model is proposed, termed as CoMoFusion, which can generate the high-quality images and achieve fast image inference speed. In specific, the consistency model is used to construct multi-modal joint features in the latent space with the forward and reverse process. Then, the infrared and visible features extracted by the trained consistency model are fed into fusion module to generate the final fused image. In order to enhance the texture and salient information of fused images, a novel loss based on pixel value selection is also designed. Extensive experiments on public datasets illustrate that our method obtains the SOTA fusion performance compared with the existing fusion methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We consider the problem of computing tight privacy guarantees for the composition of subsampled differentially private mechanisms. Recent algorithms can numerically compute the privacy parameters to arbitrary precision but must be carefully applied. Our main contribution is to address two common points of confusion. First, some privacy accountants assume that the privacy guarantees for the composition of a subsampled mechanism are determined by self-composing the worst-case datasets for the uncomposed mechanism. We show that this is not true in general. Second, Poisson subsampling is sometimes assumed to have similar privacy guarantees compared to sampling without replacement. We show that the privacy guarantees may in fact differ significantly between the two sampling schemes. In particular, we give an example of hyperparameters that result in $\varepsilon \approx 1$ for Poisson subsampling and $\varepsilon > 10$ for sampling without replacement. This occurs for some parameters that could realistically be chosen for DP-SGD.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, defense, attack, robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Over the past two years, the use of large language models (LLMs) has advanced rapidly. While these LLMs offer considerable convenience, they also raise security concerns, as LLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks by some well-designed textual perturbations. In this paper, we introduce a novel defense technique named Large LAnguage MOdel Sentinel (LLAMOS), which is designed to enhance the adversarial robustness of LLMs by purifying the adversarial textual examples before feeding them into the target LLM. Our method comprises two main components: a) Agent instruction, which can simulate a new agent for adversarial defense, altering minimal characters to maintain the original meaning of the sentence while defending against attacks; b) Defense guidance, which provides strategies for modifying clean or adversarial examples to ensure effective defense and accurate outputs from the target LLMs. Remarkably, the defense agent demonstrates robust defensive capabilities even without learning from adversarial examples. Additionally, we conduct an intriguing adversarial experiment where we develop two agents, one for defense and one for defense, and engage them in mutual confrontation. During the adversarial interactions, neither agent completely beat the other. Extensive experiments on both open-source and closed-source LLMs demonstrate that our method effectively defends against adversarial attacks, thereby enhancing adversarial robustness.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Identifying whether an artwork was used to train a diffusion model is an important research topic, given the rising popularity of AI-generated art and the associated copyright concerns. The work approaches this problem from the membership inference attack (MIA) perspective. We first identify the limitations of applying existing MIA methods for copyright protection: the required access of internal U-nets and the choice of non-member datasets for evaluation. To address the above problems, we introduce a novel black-box membership inference attack method that operates without needing access to the model's internal U-net. We then construct a DALL-E generated dataset for a more comprehensive evaluation. We validate our method across various setups, and our experimental results outperform previous works.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the advent and widespread deployment of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), ensuring their safety has become increasingly critical. To achieve this objective, it requires us to proactively discover the vulnerability of MLLMs by exploring the attack methods. Thus, structure-based jailbreak attacks, where harmful semantic content is embedded within images, have been proposed to mislead the models. However, previous structure-based jailbreak methods mainly focus on transforming the format of malicious queries, such as converting harmful content into images through typography, which lacks sufficient jailbreak effectiveness and generalizability. To address these limitations, we first introduce the concept of "Role-play" into MLLM jailbreak attacks and propose a novel and effective method called Visual Role-play (VRP). Specifically, VRP leverages Large Language Models to generate detailed descriptions of high-risk characters and create corresponding images based on the descriptions. When paired with benign role-play instruction texts, these high-risk character images effectively mislead MLLMs into generating malicious responses by enacting characters with negative attributes. We further extend our VRP method into a universal setup to demonstrate its generalizability. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks show that VRP outperforms the strongest baseline, Query relevant and FigStep, by an average Attack Success Rate (ASR) margin of 14.3% across all models.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in decision-making tasks when fine-tuned on specific applications, leveraging their inherent common sense and reasoning abilities learned from vast amounts of data. However, these systems are exposed to substantial safety and security risks during the fine-tuning phase. In this work, we propose the first comprehensive framework for Backdoor Attacks against LLM-enabled Decision-making systems (BALD), systematically exploring how such attacks can be introduced during the fine-tuning phase across various channels. Specifically, we propose three attack mechanisms and corresponding backdoor optimization methods to attack different components in the LLM-based decision-making pipeline: word injection, scenario manipulation, and knowledge injection. Word injection embeds trigger words directly into the query prompt. Scenario manipulation occurs in the physical environment, where a high-level backdoor semantic scenario triggers the attack. Knowledge injection conducts backdoor attacks on retrieval augmented generation (RAG)-based LLM systems, strategically injecting word triggers into poisoned knowledge while ensuring the information remains factually accurate for stealthiness. We conduct extensive experiments with three popular LLMs (GPT-3.5, LLaMA2, PaLM2), using two datasets (HighwayEnv, nuScenes), and demonstrate the effectiveness and stealthiness of our backdoor triggers and mechanisms. Finally, we critically assess the strengths and weaknesses of our proposed approaches, highlight the inherent vulnerabilities of LLMs in decision-making tasks, and evaluate potential defenses to safeguard LLM-based decision making systems.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Security concerns related to Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively explored, yet the safety implications for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), particularly in medical contexts (MedMLLMs), remain insufficiently studied. This paper delves into the underexplored security vulnerabilities of MedMLLMs, especially when deployed in clinical environments where the accuracy and relevance of question-and-answer interactions are critically tested against complex medical challenges. By combining existing clinical medical data with atypical natural phenomena, we redefine two types of attacks: mismatched malicious attack (2M-attack) and optimized mismatched malicious attack (O2M-attack). Using our own constructed voluminous 3MAD dataset, which covers a wide range of medical image modalities and harmful medical scenarios, we conduct a comprehensive analysis and propose the MCM optimization method, which significantly enhances the attack success rate on MedMLLMs. Evaluations with this dataset and novel attack methods, including white-box attacks on LLaVA-Med and transfer attacks on four other state-of-the-art models, indicate that even MedMLLMs designed with enhanced security features are vulnerable to security breaches. Our work underscores the urgent need for a concerted effort to implement robust security measures and enhance the safety and efficacy of open-source MedMLLMs, particularly given the potential severity of jailbreak attacks and other malicious or clinically significant exploits in medical settings.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the growing need to comply with privacy regulations and respond to user data deletion requests, integrating machine unlearning into IoT-based federated learning has become imperative. Traditional unlearning methods, however, often lack verifiable mechanisms, leading to challenges in establishing trust. This paper delves into the innovative integration of blockchain technology with federated learning to surmount these obstacles. Blockchain fortifies the unlearning process through its inherent qualities of immutability, transparency, and robust security. It facilitates verifiable certification, harmonizes security with privacy, and sustains system efficiency. We introduce a framework that melds blockchain with federated learning, thereby ensuring an immutable record of unlearning requests and actions. This strategy not only bolsters the trustworthiness and integrity of the federated learning model but also adeptly addresses efficiency and security challenges typical in IoT environments. Our key contributions encompass a certification mechanism for the unlearning process, the enhancement of data security and privacy, and the optimization of data management to ensure system responsiveness in IoT scenarios.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Watermarking has emerged as a promising way to detect LLM-generated text. To apply a watermark an LLM provider, given a secret key, augments generations with a signal that is later detectable by any party with the same key. Recent work has proposed three main families of watermarking schemes, two of which focus on the property of preserving the LLM distribution. This is motivated by it being a tractable proxy for maintaining LLM capabilities, but also by the idea that concealing a watermark deployment makes it harder for malicious actors to hide misuse by avoiding a certain LLM or attacking its watermark. Yet, despite much discourse around detectability, no prior work has investigated if any of these scheme families are detectable in a realistic black-box setting. We tackle this for the first time, developing rigorous statistical tests to detect the presence of all three most popular watermarking scheme families using only a limited number of black-box queries. We experimentally confirm the effectiveness of our methods on a range of schemes and a diverse set of open-source models. Our findings indicate that current watermarking schemes are more detectable than previously believed, and that obscuring the fact that a watermark was deployed may not be a viable way for providers to protect against adversaries. We further apply our methods to test for watermark presence behind the most popular public APIs: GPT4, Claude 3, Gemini 1.0 Pro, finding no strong evidence of a watermark at this point in time.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Despite numerous efforts to ensure large language models (LLMs) adhere to safety standards and produce harmless content, some successes have been achieved in bypassing these restrictions, known as jailbreak attacks against LLMs. Adversarial prompts generated using gradient-based methods exhibit outstanding performance in performing jailbreak attacks automatically. Nevertheless, due to the discrete nature of texts, the input gradient of LLMs struggles to precisely reflect the magnitude of loss change that results from token replacements in the prompt, leading to limited attack success rates against safety-aligned LLMs, even in the white-box setting. In this paper, we explore a new perspective on this problem, suggesting that it can be alleviated by leveraging innovations inspired in transfer-based attacks that were originally proposed for attacking black-box image classification models. For the first time, we appropriate the ideologies of effective methods among these transfer-based attacks, i.e., Skip Gradient Method and Intermediate Level Attack, for improving the effectiveness of automatically generated adversarial examples against white-box LLMs. With appropriate adaptations, we inject these ideologies into gradient-based adversarial prompt generation processes and achieve significant performance gains without introducing obvious computational cost. Meanwhile, by discussing mechanisms behind the gains, new insights are drawn, and proper combinations of these methods are also developed. Our empirical results show that the developed combination achieves >30% absolute increase in attack success rates compared with GCG for attacking the Llama-2-7B-Chat model on AdvBench.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, protect</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the contemporary data landscape characterized by multi-source data collection and third-party sharing, ensuring individual privacy stands as a critical concern. While various anonymization methods exist, their utility preservation and privacy guarantees remain challenging to quantify. In this work, we address this gap by studying the utility and privacy of the spectral anonymization (SA) algorithm, particularly in an asymptotic framework. Unlike conventional anonymization methods that directly modify the original data, SA operates by perturbing the data in a spectral basis and subsequently reverting them to their original basis. Alongside the original version $\mathcal{P}$-SA, employing random permutation transformation, we introduce two novel SA variants: $\mathcal{J}$-spectral anonymization and $\mathcal{O}$-spectral anonymization, which employ sign-change and orthogonal matrix transformations, respectively. We show how well, under some practical assumptions, these SA algorithms preserve the first and second moments of the original data. Our results reveal, in particular, that the asymptotic efficiency of all three SA algorithms in covariance estimation is exactly 50% when compared to the original data. To assess the applicability of these asymptotic results in practice, we conduct a simulation study with finite data and also evaluate the privacy protection offered by these algorithms using distance-based record linkage. Our research reveals that while no method exhibits clear superiority in finite-sample utility, $\mathcal{O}$-SA distinguishes itself for its exceptional privacy preservation, never producing identical records, albeit with increased computational complexity. Conversely, $\mathcal{P}$-SA emerges as a computationally efficient alternative, demonstrating unmatched efficiency in mean estimation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>To reduce the communication cost of differential privacy mechanisms, we introduce a novel construction, called Poisson private representation (PPR), designed to compress and simulate any local randomizer while ensuring local differential privacy. Unlike previous simulation-based local differential privacy mechanisms, PPR exactly preserves the joint distribution of the data and the output of the original local randomizer. Hence, the PPR-compressed privacy mechanism retains all desirable statistical properties of the original privacy mechanism such as unbiasedness and Gaussianity. Moreover, PPR achieves a compression size within a logarithmic gap from the theoretical lower bound. Using the PPR, we give a new order-wise trade-off between communication, accuracy, central and local differential privacy for distributed mean estimation. Experiment results on distributed mean estimation show that PPR consistently gives a better trade-off between communication, accuracy and central differential privacy compared to the coordinate subsampled Gaussian mechanism, while also providing local differential privacy.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Extending knowledge by identifying and investigating valuable research questions and problems is a core function of research. Research publications often suggest avenues for future work to extend and build upon their results. Considering these suggestions can contribute to developing research ideas that build upon previous work and produce results that tie into existing knowledge. Usable security and privacy researchers commonly add future work statements to their publications. However, our community lacks an in-depth understanding of their prevalence, quality, and impact on future research. Our work aims to address this gap in the research literature. We reviewed all 27 papers from the 2019 SOUPS proceedings and analyzed their future work statements. Additionally, we analyzed 978 publications that cite any paper from SOUPS 2019 proceedings to assess their future work statements' impact. We find that most papers from the SOUPS 2019 proceedings include future work statements. However, they are often unspecific or ambiguous, and not always easy to find. Therefore, the citing publications often matched the future work statements' content thematically, but rarely explicitly acknowledged them, indicating a limited impact. We conclude with recommendations for the usable security and privacy community to improve the utility of future work statements by making them more tangible and actionable, and avenues for future work.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Estimating 3D full-body avatars from AR/VR devices is essential for creating immersive experiences in AR/VR applications. This task is challenging due to the limited input from Head Mounted Devices, which capture only sparse observations from the head and hands. Predicting the full-body avatars, particularly the lower body, from these sparse observations presents significant difficulties. In this paper, we are inspired by the inherent property of the kinematic tree defined in the Skinned Multi-Person Linear (SMPL) model, where the upper body and lower body share only one common ancestor node, bringing the potential of decoupled reconstruction. We propose a stratified approach to decouple the conventional full-body avatar reconstruction pipeline into two stages, with the reconstruction of the upper body first and a subsequent reconstruction of the lower body conditioned on the previous stage. To implement this straightforward idea, we leverage the latent diffusion model as a powerful probabilistic generator, and train it to follow the latent distribution of decoupled motions explored by a VQ-VAE encoder-decoder model. Extensive experiments on AMASS mocap dataset demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance in the reconstruction of full-body motions.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Relation Extraction (RE) aims at recognizing the relation between pairs of entities mentioned in a text. Advances in LLMs have had a tremendous impact on NLP. In this work, we propose a textual data augmentation framework called PGA for improving the performance of models for RE in the scientific domain. The framework introduces two ways of data augmentation, utilizing a LLM to obtain pseudo-samples with the same sentence meaning but with different representations and forms by paraphrasing the original training set samples. As well as instructing LLM to generate sentences that implicitly contain information about the corresponding labels based on the relation and entity of the original training set samples. These two kinds of pseudo-samples participate in the training of the RE model together with the original dataset, respectively. The PGA framework in the experiment improves the F1 scores of the three mainstream models for RE within the scientific domain. Also, using a LLM to obtain samples can effectively reduce the cost of manually labeling data.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>AI systems have been shown to produce unfair results for certain subgroups of population, highlighting the need to understand bias on certain sensitive attributes. Current research often falls short, primarily focusing on the subgroups characterized by a single sensitive attribute, while neglecting the nature of intersectional fairness of multiple sensitive attributes. This paper focuses on its one fundamental aspect by discovering diverse high-bias subgroups under intersectional sensitive attributes. Specifically, we propose a Bias-Guided Generative Network (BGGN). By treating each bias value as a reward, BGGN efficiently generates high-bias intersectional sensitive attributes. Experiments on real-world text and image datasets demonstrate a diverse and efficient discovery of BGGN. To further evaluate the generated unseen but possible unfair intersectional sensitive attributes, we formulate them as prompts and use modern generative AI to produce new texts and images. The results of frequently generating biased data provides new insights of discovering potential unfairness in popular modern generative AI systems.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Explainable AI (XAI) has a counterpart in analytical modeling which we refer to as model explainability. We tackle the issue of model explainability in the context of prediction models. We analyze a dataset of loans from a credit card company and apply three stages: execute and compare four different prediction methods, apply the best known explainability techniques in the current literature to the model training sets to identify feature importance (FI) (static case), and finally to cross-check whether the FI set holds up under what if prediction scenarios for continuous and categorical variables (dynamic case). We found inconsistency in FI identification between the static and dynamic cases. We summarize the state of the art in model explainability and suggest further research to advance the field.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) typically integrate a pre-trained LLM with another pre-trained vision transformer through a connector, such as an MLP, endowing the LLM with visual capabilities. However, the misalignment between two embedding strategies in MLLMs -- the structural textual embeddings based on an embedding look-up table and the continuous embeddings generated directly by the vision encoder -- makes challenges for a more seamless fusion of visual and textual information. We propose Ovis, a novel MLLM architecture designed to structurally align visual and textual embeddings. Ovis integrates an additional learnable visual embedding table into the visual encoder's process. To capture rich visual semantics, each image patch indexes the visual embedding table multiple times, resulting in a final visual embedding that is a probabilistic combination of the indexed embeddings. This structural approach mirrors the method used for generating textual embeddings. Empirical evaluations on various multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that Ovis outperforms open-source MLLMs of similar parameter scales and even surpasses the proprietary model Qwen-VL-Plus overall. These results highlight the potential of Ovis' structured visual representation for advancing MLLM architectural design and promoting more effective multimodal learning. Both the source code and the training dataset of Ovis will be made publicly available.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text style transfer (TST) involves altering the linguistic style of a text while preserving its core content. This paper focuses on sentiment transfer, a vital TST subtask (Mukherjee et al., 2022a), across a spectrum of Indian languages: Hindi, Magahi, Malayalam, Marathi, Punjabi, Odia, Telugu, and Urdu, expanding upon previous work on English-Bangla sentiment transfer (Mukherjee et al., 2023). We introduce dedicated datasets of 1,000 positive and 1,000 negative style-parallel sentences for each of these eight languages. We then evaluate the performance of various benchmark models categorized into parallel, non-parallel, cross-lingual, and shared learning approaches, including the Llama2 and GPT-3.5 large language models (LLMs). Our experiments highlight the significance of parallel data in TST and demonstrate the effectiveness of the Masked Style Filling (MSF) approach (Mukherjee et al., 2023) in non-parallel techniques. Moreover, cross-lingual and joint multilingual learning methods show promise, offering insights into selecting optimal models tailored to the specific language and task requirements. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first comprehensive exploration of the TST task as sentiment transfer across a diverse set of languages.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multi-change captioning aims to describe complex and coupled changes within an image pair in natural language. Compared with single-change captioning, this task requires the model to have higher-level cognition ability to reason an arbitrary number of changes. In this paper, we propose a novel context-aware difference distilling (CARD) network to capture all genuine changes for yielding sentences. Given an image pair, CARD first decouples context features that aggregate all similar/dissimilar semantics, termed common/difference context features. Then, the consistency and independence constraints are designed to guarantee the alignment/discrepancy of common/difference context features. Further, the common context features guide the model to mine locally unchanged features, which are subtracted from the pair to distill locally difference features. Next, the difference context features augment the locally difference features to ensure that all changes are distilled. In this way, we obtain an omni-representation of all changes, which is translated into linguistic sentences by a transformer decoder. Extensive experiments on three public datasets show CARD performs favourably against state-of-the-art methods.The code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>federate, fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In traditional federated learning, a single global model cannot perform equally well for all clients. Therefore, the need to achieve the client-level fairness in federated system has been emphasized, which can be realized by modifying the static aggregation scheme for updating the global model to an adaptive one, in response to the local signals of the participating clients. Our work reveals that existing fairness-aware aggregation strategies can be unified into an online convex optimization framework, in other words, a central server's sequential decision making process. To enhance the decision making capability, we propose simple and intuitive improvements for suboptimal designs within existing methods, presenting AAggFF. Considering practical requirements, we further subdivide our method tailored for the cross-device and the cross-silo settings, respectively. Theoretical analyses guarantee sublinear regret upper bounds for both settings: $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T \log{K}})$ for the cross-device setting, and $\mathcal{O}(K \log{T})$ for the cross-silo setting, with $K$ clients and $T$ federation rounds. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the federated system equipped with AAggFF achieves better degree of client-level fairness than existing methods in both practical settings.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We consider the classic problem of online convex optimisation. Whereas the notion of static regret is relevant for stationary problems, the notion of switching regret is more appropriate for non-stationary problems. A switching regret is defined relative to any segmentation of the trial sequence, and is equal to the sum of the static regrets of each segment. In this paper we show that, perhaps surprisingly, we can achieve the asymptotically optimal switching regret on every possible segmentation simultaneously. Our algorithm for doing so is very efficient: having a space and per-trial time complexity that is logarithmic in the time-horizon. Our algorithm also obtains novel bounds on its dynamic regret: being adaptive to variations in the rate of change of the comparator sequence.</li>

This paper investigates the impact of UID principles on syntactic reduction, specifically focusing on the optional omission of the connector "that" in English subordinate clauses. Building upon previous research, we extend our investigation to a larger corpus of written English, utilize contemporary large language models (LLMs) and extend the information-uniformity principles by the notion of entropy, to estimate the UID manifestations in the usecase of syntactic reduction choices.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models equipped with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) represent a burgeoning field aimed at enhancing answering capabilities by leveraging external knowledge bases. Although the application of RAG with language-only models has been extensively explored, its adaptation into multimodal vision-language models remains nascent. Going beyond mere answer generation, the primary goal of multimodal RAG is to cultivate the models' ability to reason in response to relevant queries. To this end, we introduce a novel multimodal RAG framework named RMR (Retrieval Meets Reasoning). The RMR framework employs a bi-modal retrieval module to identify the most relevant question-answer pairs, which then serve as scaffolds for the multimodal reasoning process. This training-free approach not only encourages the model to engage deeply with the reasoning processes inherent in the retrieved content but also facilitates the generation of answers that are precise and richly interpretable. Surprisingly, utilizing solely the ScienceQA dataset, collected from elementary and high school science curricula, RMR significantly boosts the performance of various vision-language models across a spectrum of benchmark datasets, including A-OKVQA, MMBench, and SEED. These outcomes highlight the substantial potential of our multimodal retrieval and reasoning mechanism to improve the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) enhances the efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) by enabling faster operation and compatibility with more accessible hardware through reduced memory usage, at the cost of small performance drops. We explore the role of calibration sets in PTQ, specifically their effect on hidden activations in various notable open-source LLMs. Calibration sets are crucial for evaluating activation magnitudes and identifying outliers, which can distort the quantization range and negatively impact performance. Our analysis reveals a marked contrast in quantization effectiveness across models. The older OPT model, which much of the quantization literature is based on, shows significant performance deterioration and high susceptibility to outliers with varying calibration sets. In contrast, newer models like Llama-2 7B, Llama-3 8B, Command-R 35B, and Mistral 7B demonstrate strong robustness, with Mistral 7B showing near-immunity to outliers and stable activations. These findings suggest a shift in PTQ strategies might be needed. As advancements in pre-training methods reduce the relevance of outliers, there is an emerging need to reassess the fundamentals of current quantization literature. The emphasis should pivot towards optimizing inference speed, rather than primarily focusing on outlier preservation, to align with the evolving characteristics of state-of-the-art LLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Neural architecture search (NAS) finds high performing networks for a given task. Yet the results of NAS are fairly prosaic; they did not e.g. create a shift from convolutional structures to transformers. This is not least because the search spaces in NAS often aren't diverse enough to include such transformations a priori. Instead, for NAS to provide greater potential for fundamental design shifts, we need a novel expressive search space design which is built from more fundamental operations. To this end, we introduce einspace, a search space based on a parameterised probabilistic context-free grammar. Our space is versatile, supporting architectures of various sizes and complexities, while also containing diverse network operations which allow it to model convolutions, attention components and more. It contains many existing competitive architectures, and provides flexibility for discovering new ones. Using this search space, we perform experiments to find novel architectures as well as improvements on existing ones on the diverse Unseen NAS datasets. We show that competitive architectures can be obtained by searching from scratch, and we consistently find large improvements when initialising the search with strong baselines. We believe that this work is an important advancement towards a transformative NAS paradigm where search space expressivity and strategic search initialisation play key roles.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Reward models (RM) play a critical role in aligning language models through the process of reinforcement learning from human feedback. RMs are trained to predict a score reflecting human preference, which requires significant time and cost for human annotation. Additionally, RMs tend to quickly overfit on superficial features in the training set, hindering their generalization performance on unseen distributions. We propose a novel approach using synthetic natural language critiques generated by large language models to provide additional feedback, evaluating aspects such as instruction following, correctness, and style. This offers richer signals and more robust features for RMs to assess and score on. We demonstrate that high-quality critiques improve the performance and data efficiency of RMs initialized from different pretrained models. Conversely, we also show that low-quality critiques negatively impact performance. Furthermore, incorporating critiques enhances the interpretability and robustness of RM training.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Despite raw driving videos contain richer information on facial expressions than intermediate representations such as landmarks in the field of portrait animation, they are seldom the subject of research. This is due to two challenges inherent in portrait animation driven with raw videos: 1) significant identity leakage; 2) Irrelevant background and facial details such as wrinkles degrade performance. To harnesses the power of the raw videos for vivid portrait animation, we proposed a pioneering conditional diffusion model named as MegActor. First, we introduced a synthetic data generation framework for creating videos with consistent motion and expressions but inconsistent IDs to mitigate the issue of ID leakage. Second, we segmented the foreground and background of the reference image and employed CLIP to encode the background details. This encoded information is then integrated into the network via a text embedding module, thereby ensuring the stability of the background. Finally, we further style transfer the appearance of the reference image to the driving video to eliminate the influence of facial details in the driving videos. Our final model was trained solely on public datasets, achieving results comparable to commercial models. We hope this will help the open-source community.The code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Spoken language understanding (SLU) is a core task in task-oriented dialogue systems, which aims at understanding the user's current goal through constructing semantic frames. SLU usually consists of two subtasks, including intent detection and slot filling. Although there are some SLU frameworks joint modeling the two subtasks and achieving high performance, most of them still overlook the inherent relationships between intents and slots and fail to achieve mutual guidance between the two subtasks. To solve the problem, we propose a multi-level multi-grained SLU framework MMCL to apply contrastive learning at three levels, including utterance level, slot level, and word level to enable intent and slot to mutually guide each other. For the utterance level, our framework implements coarse granularity contrastive learning and fine granularity contrastive learning simultaneously. Besides, we also apply the self-distillation method to improve the robustness of the model. Experimental results and further analysis demonstrate that our proposed model achieves new state-of-the-art results on two public multi-intent SLU datasets, obtaining a 2.6 overall accuracy improvement on the MixATIS dataset compared to previous best models.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The polygon mesh representation of 3D data exhibits great flexibility, fast rendering speed, and storage efficiency, which is widely preferred in various applications. However, given its unstructured graph representation, the direct generation of high-fidelity 3D meshes is challenging. Fortunately, with a pre-defined ordering strategy, 3D meshes can be represented as sequences, and the generation process can be seamlessly treated as an auto-regressive problem. In this paper, we validate the Neural Coordinate Field (NeurCF), an explicit coordinate representation with implicit neural embeddings, is a simple-yet-effective representation for large-scale sequential mesh modeling. After that, we present MeshXL, a family of generative pre-trained auto-regressive models, which addresses the process of 3D mesh generation with modern large language model approaches. Extensive experiments show that MeshXL is able to generate high-quality 3D meshes, and can also serve as foundation models for various down-stream applications.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>It has been established in recent work that Large Language Models (LLMs) can be prompted to "self-play" conversational games that probe certain capabilities (general instruction following, strategic goal orientation, language understanding abilities), where the resulting interactive game play can be automatically scored. In this paper, we take one of the proposed frameworks for setting up such game-play environments, and further test its usefulness as an evaluation instrument, along a number of dimensions: We show that it can easily keep up with new developments while avoiding data contamination, we show that the tests implemented within it are not yet saturated (human performance is substantially higher than that of even the best models), and we show that it lends itself to investigating additional questions, such as the impact of the prompting language on performance. We believe that the approach forms a good basis for making decisions on model choice for building applied interactive systems, and perhaps ultimately setting up a closed-loop development environment of system and simulated evaluator.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>defense, attack, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In a federated learning (FL) system, decentralized data owners (clients) could upload their locally trained models to a central server, to jointly train a global model. Malicious clients may plant backdoors into the global model through uploading poisoned local models, causing misclassification to a target class when encountering attacker-defined triggers. Existing backdoor defenses show inconsistent performance under different system and adversarial settings, especially when the malicious updates are made statistically close to the benign ones. In this paper, we first reveal the fact that planting subsequent backdoors with the same target label could significantly help to maintain the accuracy of previously planted backdoors, and then propose a novel proactive backdoor detection mechanism for FL named BackdoorIndicator, which has the server inject indicator tasks into the global model leveraging out-of-distribution (OOD) data, and then utilizing the fact that any backdoor samples are OOD samples with respect to benign samples, the server, who is completely agnostic of the potential backdoor types and target labels, can accurately detect the presence of backdoors in uploaded models, via evaluating the indicator tasks. We perform systematic and extensive empirical studies to demonstrate the consistently superior performance and practicality of BackdoorIndicator over baseline defenses, across a wide range of system and adversarial settings.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Despite the strong performance of Transformers, their quadratic computation complexity presents challenges in applying them to vision tasks. Automatic pruning is one of effective methods for reducing computation complexity without heuristic approaches. However, directly applying it to multi-head attention is not straightforward due to channel misalignment. In this paper, we propose an automatic channel pruning method to take into account the multi-head attention mechanism. First, we incorporate channel similarity-based weights into the pruning indicator to preserve more informative channels in each head. Then, we adjust pruning indicator to enforce removal of channels in equal proportions across all heads, preventing the channel misalignment. We also add a reweight module to compensate for information loss resulting from channel removal, and an effective initialization step for pruning indicator based on difference of attention between original structure and each channel. Our proposed method can be used to not only original attention, but also linear attention, which is more efficient as linear complexity with respect to the number of tokens. On ImageNet-1K, applying our pruning method to the FLattenTransformer, which includes both attention mechanisms, shows outperformed accuracy for several MACs compared with previous state-of-the-art efficient models and pruned methods. Code will be available soon.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The convergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and Earth observation (EO) technologies has brought geoscience and remote sensing into an era of unparalleled capabilities. AI's transformative impact on data analysis, particularly derived from EO platforms, holds great promise in addressing global challenges such as environmental monitoring, disaster response and climate change analysis. However, the rapid integration of AI necessitates a careful examination of the responsible dimensions inherent in its application within these domains. In this paper, we represent a pioneering effort to systematically define the intersection of AI and EO, with a central focus on responsible AI practices. Specifically, we identify several critical components guiding this exploration from both academia and industry perspectives within the EO field: AI and EO for social good, mitigating unfair biases, AI security in EO, geo-privacy and privacy-preserving measures, as well as maintaining scientific excellence, open data, and guiding AI usage based on ethical principles. Furthermore, the paper explores potential opportunities and emerging trends, providing valuable insights for future research endeavors.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many computer vision tasks. However, high computational and storage demands hinder their deployment into resource-constrained environments, such as embedded devices. Model pruning helps to meet these restrictions by reducing the model size, while maintaining superior performance. Meanwhile, safety-critical applications pose more than just resource and performance constraints. In particular, predictions must not be overly confident, i.e., provide properly calibrated uncertainty estimations (proper uncertainty calibration), and CNNs must be robust against corruptions like naturally occurring input perturbations (natural corruption robustness). This work investigates the important trade-off between uncertainty calibration, natural corruption robustness, and performance for current state-of-research post-hoc CNN pruning techniques in the context of image classification tasks. Our study reveals that post-hoc pruning substantially improves the model's uncertainty calibration, performance, and natural corruption robustness, sparking hope for safe and robust embedded CNNs.Furthermore, uncertainty calibration and natural corruption robustness are not mutually exclusive targets under pruning, as evidenced by the improved safety aspects obtained by post-hoc unstructured pruning with increasing compression.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Flow matching (FM) has gained significant attention as a simulation-free generative model. Unlike diffusion models, which are based on stochastic differential equations, FM employs a simpler approach by solving an ordinary differential equation with an initial condition from a normal distribution, thus streamlining the sample generation process. This paper discusses the convergence properties of FM in terms of the $p$-Wasserstein distance, a measure of distributional discrepancy. We establish that FM can achieve the minmax optimal convergence rate for $1 \leq p \leq 2$, presenting the first theoretical evidence that FM can reach convergence rates comparable to those of diffusion models. Our analysis extends existing frameworks by examining a broader class of mean and variance functions for the vector fields and identifies specific conditions necessary to attain these optimal rates.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Graph hypernetworks (GHNs), constructed by combining graph neural networks (GNNs) with hypernetworks (HNs), leverage relational data across various domains such as neural architecture search, molecular property prediction and federated learning. Despite GNNs and HNs being individually successful, we show that GHNs present problems compromising their performance, such as over-smoothing and heterophily. Moreover, we cannot apply GHNs directly to personalized federated learning (PFL) scenarios, where a priori client relation graph may be absent, private, or inaccessible. To mitigate these limitations in the context of PFL, we propose a novel class of HNs, sheaf hypernetworks (SHNs), which combine cellular sheaf theory with HNs to improve parameter sharing for PFL. We thoroughly evaluate SHNs across diverse PFL tasks, including multi-class classification, traffic and weather forecasting. Additionally, we provide a methodology for constructing client relation graphs in scenarios where such graphs are unavailable. We show that SHNs consistently outperform existing PFL solutions in complex non-IID scenarios. While the baselines' performance fluctuates depending on the task, SHNs show improvements of up to 2.7% in accuracy and 5.3% in lower mean squared error over the best-performing baseline.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Online action detection (OAD) aims to identify ongoing actions from streaming video in real-time, without access to future frames. Since these actions manifest at varying scales of granularity, ranging from coarse to fine, projecting an entire set of action frames to a single latent encoding may result in a lack of local information, necessitating the acquisition of action features across multiple scales. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale action learning transformer (MALT), which includes a novel recurrent decoder (used for feature fusion) that includes fewer parameters and can be trained more efficiently. A hierarchical encoder with multiple encoding branches is further proposed to capture multi-scale action features. The output from the preceding branch is then incrementally input to the subsequent branch as part of a cross-attention calculation. In this way, output features transition from coarse to fine as the branches deepen. We also introduce an explicit frame scoring mechanism employing sparse attention, which filters irrelevant frames more efficiently, without requiring an additional network. The proposed method achieved state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets (THUMOS'14 and TVSeries), outperforming all existing models used for comparison, with an mAP of 0.2% for THUMOS'14 and an mcAP of 0.1% for TVseries.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The number and dynamic nature of web and mobile applications presents significant challenges for assessing their compliance with data protection laws. In this context, symbolic and statistical Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques have been employed for the automated analysis of these systems' privacy policies. However, these techniques typically require labor-intensive and potentially error-prone manually annotated datasets for training and validation. This research proposes the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) as an alternative for effectively and efficiently extracting privacy practices from privacy policies at scale. Particularly, we leverage well-known LLMs such as ChatGPT and Llama 2, and offer guidance on the optimal design of prompts, parameters, and models, incorporating advanced strategies such as few-shot learning. We further illustrate its capability to detect detailed and varied privacy practices accurately. Using several renowned datasets in the domain as a benchmark, our evaluation validates its exceptional performance, achieving an F1 score exceeding 93%. Besides, it does so with reduced costs, faster processing times, and fewer technical knowledge requirements. Consequently, we advocate for LLM-based solutions as a sound alternative to traditional NLP techniques for the automated analysis of privacy policies at scale.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) showcase impressive reasoning capabilities when coupled with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. However, the robustness of this approach warrants further investigation. In this paper, we introduce a novel scenario termed preemptive answers, where the LLM obtains an answer before engaging in reasoning. This situation can arise inadvertently or induced by malicious users by prompt injection attacks. Experiments reveal that preemptive answers significantly impair the model's reasoning capability across various CoT methods and a broad spectrum of datasets. To bolster the robustness of reasoning, we propose two measures aimed at mitigating this issue to some extent.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The simulation of many complex phenomena in engineering and science requires solving expensive, high-dimensional systems of partial differential equations (PDEs). To circumvent this, reduced-order models (ROMs) have been developed to speed up computations. However, when governing equations are unknown or partially known, typically ROMs lack interpretability and reliability of the predicted solutions. In this work we present a data-driven, non-intrusive framework for building ROMs where the latent variables and dynamics are identified in an interpretable manner and uncertainty is quantified. Starting from a limited amount of high-dimensional, noisy data the proposed framework constructs an efficient ROM by leveraging variational autoencoders for dimensionality reduction along with a newly introduced, variational version of sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy), which we refer to as Variational Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (VINDy). In detail, the method consists of Variational Encoding of Noisy Inputs (VENI) to identify the distribution of reduced coordinates. Simultaneously, we learn the distribution of the coefficients of a pre-determined set of candidate functions by VINDy. Once trained offline, the identified model can be queried for new parameter instances and new initial conditions to compute the corresponding full-time solutions. The probabilistic setup enables uncertainty quantification as the online testing consists of Variational Inference naturally providing Certainty Intervals (VICI). In this work we showcase the effectiveness of the newly proposed VINDy method in identifying interpretable and accurate dynamical system for the Rössler system with different noise intensities and sources. Then the performance of the overall method - named VENI, VINDy, VICI - is tested on PDE benchmarks including structural mechanics and fluid dynamics.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, protect, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The growing popular awareness of personal privacy raises the following quandary: what is the new paradigm for collecting and protecting the data produced by ever-increasing sensor devices. Most previous studies on co-design of data aggregation and privacy preservation assume that a trusted fusion center adheres to privacy regimes. Very recent work has taken steps towards relaxing the assumption by allowing data contributors to locally perturb their own data. Although these solutions withhold some data content to mitigate privacy risks, they have been shown to offer insufficient protection against disclosure attacks. Aiming at providing a more rigorous data safeguard for the Internet of Things (IoTs), this paper initiates the study of privacy-preserving data aggregation. We propose a novel paradigm (called RASE), which can be generalized into a 3-step sequential procedure, noise addition, followed by random permutation, and then parameter estimation. Specially, we design a differentially private randomizer, which carefully guides data contributors to obfuscate the truth. Then, a shuffler is employed to receive the noisy data from all data contributors. After that, it breaks the correct linkage between senders and receivers by applying a random permutation. The estimation phase involves using inaccurate data to calculate an approximate aggregate value. Extensive simulations are provided to explore the privacy-utility landscape of our RASE.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Temporal logic is a framework for representing and reasoning about propositions that evolve over time. It is commonly used for specifying requirements in various domains, including hardware and software systems, as well as robotics. Specification mining or formula generation involves extracting temporal logic formulae from system traces and has numerous applications, such as detecting bugs and improving interpretability. Although there has been a surge of deep learning-based methods for temporal logic satisfiability checking in recent years, the specification mining literature has been lagging behind in adopting deep learning methods despite their many advantages, such as scalability. In this paper, we introduce autoregressive models that can generate linear temporal logic formulae from traces, towards addressing the specification mining problem. We propose multiple architectures for this task: transformer encoder-decoder, decoder-only transformer, and Mamba, which is an emerging alternative to transformer models. Additionally, we devise a metric for quantifying the distinctiveness of the generated formulae and a straightforward algorithm to enforce the syntax constraints. Our experiments show that the proposed architectures yield promising results, generating correct and distinct formulae at a fraction of the compute cost needed for the combinatorial baseline.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) require careful safety alignment to prevent malicious outputs. While significant research focuses on mitigating harmful content generation, the enhanced safety often come with the side effect of over-refusal, where the LLMs may reject innocuous prompts and become less helpful. Although the issue of over-refusal has been empirically observed, a systematic measurement is challenging due to the difficulty of crafting prompts that appear harmful but are benign. This study proposes a novel method for automatically generating large-scale sets of ``seemingly toxic prompts'' (benign prompts likely rejected by LLMs). Leveraging this technique, we introduce OR-Bench, the first large-scale over-refusal benchmark. OR-Bench comprises 80,000 seemingly toxic prompts across 10 common rejection categories, a subset of around 1,000 hard prompts that are challenging even for state-of-the-art LLMs, and an additional 600 toxic prompts to prevent indiscriminate responses. We then conduct a comprehensive study to measure the over-refusal of 25 popular LLMs across 8 model families. Our datasets are available at this https URL and the corresponding demo can be found at this https URL. We hope this benchmark can help the community develop better safety aligned models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, data-free, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models have emerged as effective distribution estimators in vision, language, and reinforcement learning, but their use as priors in downstream tasks poses an intractable posterior inference problem. This paper studies amortized sampling of the posterior over data, $\mathbf{x}\sim p^{\rm post}(\mathbf{x})\propto p(\mathbf{x})r(\mathbf{x})$, in a model that consists of a diffusion generative model prior $p(\mathbf{x})$ and a black-box constraint or likelihood function $r(\mathbf{x})$. We state and prove the asymptotic correctness of a data-free learning objective, relative trajectory balance, for training a diffusion model that samples from this posterior, a problem that existing methods solve only approximately or in restricted cases. Relative trajectory balance arises from the generative flow network perspective on diffusion models, which allows the use of deep reinforcement learning techniques to improve mode coverage. Experiments illustrate the broad potential of unbiased inference of arbitrary posteriors under diffusion priors: in vision (classifier guidance), language (infilling under a discrete diffusion LLM), and multimodal data (text-to-image generation). Beyond generative modeling, we apply relative trajectory balance to the problem of continuous control with a score-based behavior prior, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmarks in offline reinforcement learning.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models~(LLMs) have recently demonstrated promising performance in many tasks. However, the high storage and computational cost of LLMs has become a challenge for deploying LLMs. Weight quantization has been widely used for model compression, which can reduce both storage and computational cost. Most existing weight quantization methods for LLMs use a rank-one codebook for quantization, which results in substantial accuracy loss when the compression ratio is high. In this paper, we propose a novel weight quantization method, called low-rank codebook based quantization~(LCQ), for LLMs. LCQ adopts a low-rank codebook, the rank of which can be larger than one, for quantization. Experiments show that LCQ can achieve better accuracy than existing methods with a negligibly extra storage cost.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) often generate inaccurate or fabricated information and generally fail to indicate their confidence, which limits their broader applications. Previous work elicits confidence from LLMs by direct or self-consistency prompting, or constructing specific datasets for supervised finetuning. The prompting-based approaches have inferior performance, and the training-based approaches are limited to binary or inaccurate group-level confidence estimates. In this work, we present the advanced SaySelf, a training framework that teaches LLMs to express more accurate fine-grained confidence estimates. In addition, beyond the confidence scores, SaySelf initiates the process of directing LLMs to produce self-reflective rationales that clearly identify gaps in their parametric knowledge and explain their uncertainty. This is achieved by using an LLM to automatically summarize the uncertainties in specific knowledge via natural language. The summarization is based on the analysis of the inconsistency in multiple sampled reasoning chains, and the resulting data is utilized for supervised fine-tuning. Moreover, we utilize reinforcement learning with a meticulously crafted reward function to calibrate the confidence estimates, motivating LLMs to deliver accurate, high-confidence predictions and to penalize overconfidence in erroneous outputs. Experimental results in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SaySelf in reducing the confidence calibration error and maintaining the task performance. We show that the generated self-reflective rationales are reasonable and can further contribute to the calibration. The code is made public at \url{this https URL}.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In Federated Learning (FL), a set of clients collaboratively train a machine learning model (called global model) without sharing their local training data. The local training data of clients is typically non-i.i.d. and heterogeneous, resulting in varying contributions from individual clients to the final performance of the global model. In response, many contribution evaluation methods were proposed, where the server could evaluate the contribution made by each client and incentivize the high-contributing clients to sustain their long-term participation in FL. Existing studies mainly focus on developing new metrics or algorithms to better measure the contribution of each client. However, the security of contribution evaluation methods of FL operating in adversarial environments is largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose the first model poisoning attack on contribution evaluation methods in FL, termed ACE. Specifically, we show that any malicious client utilizing ACE could manipulate the parameters of its local model such that it is evaluated to have a high contribution by the server, even when its local training data is indeed of low quality. We perform both theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations of ACE. Theoretically, we show our design of ACE can effectively boost the malicious client's perceived contribution when the server employs the widely-used cosine distance metric to measure contribution. Empirically, our results show ACE effectively and efficiently deceive five state-of-the-art contribution evaluation methods. In addition, ACE preserves the accuracy of the final global models on testing inputs. We also explore six countermeasures to defend ACE. Our results show they are inadequate to thwart ACE, highlighting the urgent need for new defenses to safeguard the contribution evaluation methods in FL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The visual projector, which bridges the vision and language modalities and facilitates cross-modal alignment, serves as a crucial component in MLLMs. However, measuring the effectiveness of projectors in vision-language alignment remains under-explored, which currently can only be inferred from the performance of MLLMs on downstream tasks. Motivated by the problem, this study examines the projector module by interpreting the vision-language semantic flow within MLLMs. Specifically, we trace back the semantic relevance flow from generated language tokens to raw visual encoder patches and the intermediate outputs produced by projectors. Our findings reveal that compressive projectors (e.g., QFormer), abstract visual patches into a limited set of semantic concepts, such as objects or attributes, resulting in a 'double abstraction' phenomenon. This involves a first visual semantic abstraction by the projector referring to pre-defined query tokens, and a second extraction by the LLM based on text instructions. The double abstraction is inefficient in training and will result in cumulative vision semantics deficiency. To mitigate this issue, we propose the key insight of 'Decouple Compression from Abstraction (DeCo), that is compressing the visual token number at the patch level by projectors and allowing the LLM to handle visual semantic abstraction entirely. Consequently, we adopt a simple compressor, i.e., 2D Adaptive Pooling, to downsample visual patches in a parameter-free manner. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that DeCo surpasses traditional compressive projectors regarding both performance and efficiency. It achieves performance gains of 0.9%, 7.1%, and 2.9% across the MLLM Benchmarks, Visual Localization, and Open-ended VQA tasks with fewer trainable parameters and faster convergence speed.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The fusion of raw features from multiple sensors on an autonomous vehicle to create a Bird's Eye View (BEV) representation is crucial for planning and control systems. There is growing interest in using deep learning models for BEV semantic segmentation. Anticipating segmentation errors and improving the explainability of DNNs is essential for autonomous driving, yet it is under-studied. This paper introduces a benchmark for predictive uncertainty quantification in BEV segmentation. The benchmark assesses various approaches across three popular datasets using two representative backbones and focuses on the effectiveness of predicted uncertainty in identifying misclassified and out-of-distribution (OOD) pixels, as well as calibration. Empirical findings highlight the challenges in uncertainty quantification. Our results find that evidential deep learning based approaches show the most promise by efficiently quantifying aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. We propose the Uncertainty-Focal-Cross-Entropy (UFCE) loss, designed for highly imbalanced data, which consistently improves the segmentation quality and calibration. Additionally, we introduce a vacuity-scaled regularization term that enhances the model's focus on high uncertainty pixels, improving epistemic uncertainty quantification.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have high computational costs to train their complex architectures. Throughout the training process, GANs' output is analyzed qualitatively based on the loss and synthetic images' diversity and quality. Based on this qualitative analysis, training is manually halted once the desired synthetic images are generated. By utilizing an early stopping criterion, the computational cost and dependence on manual oversight can be reduced yet impacted by training problems such as mode collapse, non-convergence, and instability. This is particularly prevalent in biomedical imagery, where training problems degrade the diversity and quality of synthetic images, and the high computational cost associated with training makes complex architectures increasingly inaccessible. This work proposes a novel early stopping criteria to quantitatively detect training problems, halt training, and reduce the computational costs associated with synthesizing biomedical images. Firstly, the range of generator and discriminator loss values is investigated to assess whether mode collapse, non-convergence, and instability occur sequentially, concurrently, or interchangeably throughout the training of GANs. Secondly, utilizing these occurrences in conjunction with the Mean Structural Similarity Index (MS-SSIM) and Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) scores of synthetic images forms the basis of the proposed early stopping criteria. This work helps identify the occurrence of training problems in GANs using low-resource computational cost and reduces training time to generate diversified and high-quality synthetic images.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Driven by the ever-growing volume and decentralized nature of data, coupled with the escalating size of modern models, distributed deep learning (DDL) has been entrenched as the preferred paradigm for training. However, frequent synchronization of DL models, encompassing millions to many billions of parameters, creates a communication bottleneck, severely hindering scalability. Worse yet, DDL algorithms typically waste valuable bandwidth, and make themselves less practical in bandwidth-constrained federated settings, by relying on overly simplistic, periodic, and rigid synchronization schedules. To address these shortcomings, we propose Federated Dynamic Averaging (FDA), a communication-efficient DDL strategy that dynamically triggers synchronization based on the value of the model variance. Through extensive experiments across a wide range of learning tasks we demonstrate that FDA reduces communication cost by orders of magnitude, compared to both traditional and cutting-edge communication-efficient algorithms. Remarkably, FDA achieves this without sacrificing convergence speed - in stark contrast to the trade-offs encountered in the field. Additionally, we show that FDA maintains robust performance across diverse data heterogeneity settings.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Addressing hard cases in autonomous driving, such as anomalous road users, extreme weather conditions, and complex traffic interactions, presents significant challenges. To ensure safety, it is crucial to detect and manage these scenarios effectively for autonomous driving systems. However, the rarity and high-risk nature of these cases demand extensive, diverse datasets for training robust models. Vision-Language Foundation Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable zero-shot capabilities as being trained on extensive datasets. This work explores the potential of VLMs in detecting hard cases in autonomous driving. We demonstrate the capability of VLMs such as GPT-4v in detecting hard cases in traffic participant motion prediction on both agent and scenario levels. We introduce a feasible pipeline where VLMs, fed with sequential image frames with designed prompts, effectively identify challenging agents or scenarios, which are verified by existing prediction models. Moreover, by taking advantage of this detection of hard cases by VLMs, we further improve the training efficiency of the existing motion prediction pipeline by performing data selection for the training samples suggested by GPT. We show the effectiveness and feasibility of our pipeline incorporating VLMs with state-of-the-art methods on NuScenes datasets. The code is accessible at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Characteristic rules have been advocated for their ability to improve interpretability over discriminative rules within the area of rule learning. However, the former type of rule has not yet been used by techniques for explaining predictions. A novel explanation technique, called CEGA (Characteristic Explanatory General Association rules), is proposed, which employs association rule mining to aggregate multiple explanations generated by any standard local explanation technique into a set of characteristic rules. An empirical investigation is presented, in which CEGA is compared to two state-of-the-art methods, Anchors and GLocalX, for producing local and aggregated explanations in the form of discriminative rules. The results suggest that the proposed approach provides a better trade-off between fidelity and complexity compared to the two state-of-the-art approaches; CEGA and Anchors significantly outperform GLocalX with respect to fidelity, while CEGA and GLocalX significantly outperform Anchors with respect to the number of generated rules. The effect of changing the format of the explanations of CEGA to discriminative rules and using LIME and SHAP as local explanation techniques instead of Anchors are also investigated. The results show that the characteristic explanatory rules still compete favorably with rules in the standard discriminative format. The results also indicate that using CEGA in combination with either SHAP or Anchors consistently leads to a higher fidelity compared to using LIME as the local explanation technique.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Estimating potential outcomes for treatments over time based on observational data is important for personalized decision-making in medicine. Yet, existing neural methods for this task suffer from either (a) bias or (b) large variance. In order to address both limitations, we introduce the G-transformer (GT). Our GT is a novel, neural end-to-end model designed for unbiased, low-variance estimation of conditional average potential outcomes (CAPOs) over time. Specifically, our GT is the first neural model to perform regression-based iterative G-computation for CAPOs in the time-varying setting. We evaluate the effectiveness of our GT across various experiments. In sum, this work represents a significant step towards personalized decision-making from electronic health records.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text-rich images have significant and extensive value, deeply integrated into various aspects of human life. Notably, both visual cues and linguistic symbols in text-rich images play crucial roles in information transmission but are accompanied by diverse challenges. Therefore, the efficient and effective understanding of text-rich images is a crucial litmus test for the capability of Vision-Language Models. We have crafted an efficient vision-language model, StrucTexTv3, tailored to tackle various intelligent tasks for text-rich images. The significant design of StrucTexTv3 is presented in the following aspects: Firstly, we adopt a combination of an effective multi-scale reduced visual transformer and a multi-granularity token sampler (MG-Sampler) as a visual token generator, successfully solving the challenges of high-resolution input and complex representation learning for text-rich images. Secondly, we enhance the perception and comprehension abilities of StrucTexTv3 through instruction learning, seamlessly integrating various text-oriented tasks into a unified framework. Thirdly, we have curated a comprehensive collection of high-quality text-rich images, abbreviated as TIM-30M, encompassing diverse scenarios like incidental scenes, office documents, web pages, and screenshots, thereby improving the robustness of our model. Our method achieved SOTA results in text-rich image perception tasks, and significantly improved performance in comprehension tasks. Among multimodal models with LLM decoder of approximately 1.8B parameters, it stands out as a leader, which also makes the deployment of edge devices feasible. In summary, the StrucTexTv3 model, featuring efficient structural design, outstanding performance, and broad adaptability, offers robust support for diverse intelligent application tasks involving text-rich images, thus exhibiting immense potential for widespread application.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) are being rapidly developed, and a key component of their widespread deployment is their safety-related alignment. Many red-teaming efforts aim to jailbreak LLMs, where among these efforts, the Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) attack's success has led to a growing interest in the study of optimization-based jailbreaking techniques. Although GCG is a significant milestone, its attacking efficiency remains unsatisfactory. In this paper, we present several improved (empirical) techniques for optimization-based jailbreaks like GCG. We first observe that the single target template of "Sure" largely limits the attacking performance of GCG; given this, we propose to apply diverse target templates containing harmful self-suggestion and/or guidance to mislead LLMs. Besides, from the optimization aspects, we propose an automatic multi-coordinate updating strategy in GCG (i.e., adaptively deciding how many tokens to replace in each step) to accelerate convergence, as well as tricks like easy-to-hard initialisation. Then, we combine these improved technologies to develop an efficient jailbreak method, dubbed $\mathcal{I}$-GCG. In our experiments, we evaluate on a series of benchmarks (such as NeurIPS 2023 Red Teaming Track). The results demonstrate that our improved techniques can help GCG outperform state-of-the-art jailbreaking attacks and achieve nearly 100% attack success rate.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Dynamic Positron Emission Tomography (dPET) imaging and Time-Activity Curve (TAC) analyses are essential for understanding and quantifying the biodistribution of radiopharmaceuticals over time and space. Traditional compartmental modeling, while foundational, commonly struggles to fully capture the complexities of biological systems, including non-linear dynamics and variability. This study introduces an innovative data-driven neural network-based framework, inspired by Reaction Diffusion systems, designed to address these limitations. Our approach, which adaptively fits TACs from dPET, enables the direct calibration of diffusion coefficients and reaction terms from observed data, offering significant improvements in predictive accuracy and robustness over traditional methods, especially in complex biological scenarios. By more accurately modeling the spatio-temporal dynamics of radiopharmaceuticals, our method advances modeling of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic processes, enabling new possibilities in quantitative nuclear medicine.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>When answering questions, LLMs can convey not only an answer, but a level of confidence about the answer being correct. This includes explicit confidence markers (e.g. giving a numeric score) as well as implicit markers, like an authoritative tone or elaborating with additional knowledge. For LLMs to be trustworthy knowledge sources, the confidence they convey should match their actual expertise; however, most current models tend towards overconfidence. To calibrate both implicit and explicit confidence markers, we introduce a pragmatic, listener-aware finetuning method (LACIE) that models the listener, considering not only whether an answer is right, but whether it will be accepted by a listener. We cast calibration as preference optimization, creating data via a two-agent game, where a speaker model's outputs are judged by a simulated listener. We then finetune three LLMs (Mistral-7B, Llama3-8B, Llama3-70B) with LACIE, and show that the resulting models are better calibrated w.r.t. a simulated listener. Crucially, these trends transfer to human listeners, helping them correctly predict model correctness: we conduct a human evaluation where annotators accept or reject an LLM's answers, finding that training with LACIE results in 47% fewer incorrect answers being accepted while maintaining the same level of acceptance for correct answers. Furthermore, LACIE generalizes to another dataset, resulting in a large increase in truthfulness on TruthfulQA when trained on TriviaQA. Our analysis indicates that LACIE leads to a better confidence separation between correct and incorrect examples. Qualitatively, we find that a LACIE-trained model hedges more and implicitly signals certainty when it is correct by using an authoritative tone or including details. Finally, LACIE finetuning leads to an emergent increase in model abstention (e.g. saying "I don't know") for answers that are likely wrong.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has been commonly used to align the behaviors of Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences. Recently, a popular alternative is Direct Policy Optimization (DPO), which replaces an LLM-based reward model with the policy itself, thus obviating the need for extra memory and training time to learn the reward model. However, DPO does not consider the relative qualities of the positive and negative responses, and can lead to sub-optimal training outcomes. To alleviate this problem, we investigate the use of intrinsic knowledge within the on-the-fly fine-tuning LLM to obtain relative qualities and help to refine the loss function. Specifically, we leverage the knowledge of the LLM to design a refinement function to estimate the quality of both the positive and negative responses. We show that the constructed refinement function can help self-refine the loss function under mild assumptions. The refinement function is integrated into DPO and its variant Identity Policy Optimization (IPO). Experiments across various evaluators indicate that they can improve the performance of the fine-tuned models over DPO and IPO.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful tool for generating high-quality images from textual descriptions. Despite their successes, these models often exhibit limited diversity in the sampled images, particularly when sampling with a high classifier-free guidance weight. To address this issue, we present Kaleido, a novel approach that enhances the diversity of samples by incorporating autoregressive latent priors. Kaleido integrates an autoregressive language model that encodes the original caption and generates latent variables, serving as abstract and intermediary representations for guiding and facilitating the image generation process. In this paper, we explore a variety of discrete latent representations, including textual descriptions, detection bounding boxes, object blobs, and visual tokens. These representations diversify and enrich the input conditions to the diffusion models, enabling more diverse outputs. Our experimental results demonstrate that Kaleido effectively broadens the diversity of the generated image samples from a given textual description while maintaining high image quality. Furthermore, we show that Kaleido adheres closely to the guidance provided by the generated latent variables, demonstrating its capability to effectively control and direct the image generation process.</li>

Traditional methods like low rank adaptation achieve parameter efficiency by imposing constraints but may not be optimal for tasks requiring high representation capacity. We propose a novel spectrum-aware adaptation framework for generative models. Our method adjusts both singular values and their basis vectors of pretrained weights. Using the Kronecker product and efficient Stiefel optimizers, we achieve parameter-efficient adaptation of orthogonal matrices. We introduce Spectral Orthogonal Decomposition Adaptation (SODA), which balances computational efficiency and representation capacity. Extensive evaluations on text-to-image diffusion models demonstrate SODA's effectiveness, offering a spectrum-aware alternative to existing fine-tuning methods.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Previous work has demonstrated that, in the Variance Preserving (VP) scenario, the nascent Directly Denoising Diffusion Models (DDDM) can generate high-quality images in one step while achieving even better performance in multistep sampling. However, the Pseudo-LPIPS loss used in DDDM leads to concerns about the bias in assessment. Here, we propose a unified DDDM (uDDDM) framework that generates images in one-step/multiple steps for both Variance Preserving (VP) and Variance Exploding (VE) cases. We provide theoretical proofs of the existence and uniqueness of the model's solution paths, as well as the non-intersecting property of the sampling paths. Additionally, we propose an adaptive Pseudo-Huber loss function to balance the convergence to the true solution and the stability of convergence process.Through a comprehensive evaluation, we demonstrate that uDDDMs achieve FID scores comparable to the best-performing methods available for CIFAR-10 in both VP and VE. Specifically, uDDDM achieves one-step generation on CIFAR10 with FID of 2.63 and 2.53 for VE and VP respectively. By extending the sampling to 1000 steps, we further reduce FID score to 1.71 and 1.65 for VE and VP respectively, setting state-of-the-art performance in both cases.</li>

We show that these families of models are actually quite closely related, and develop a rich framework of theoretical connections between SSMs and variants of attention, connected through various decompositions of a well-studied class of structured semiseparable matrices. Our state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The Transformer architecture has recently gained considerable attention in the field of graph representation learning, as it naturally overcomes several limitations of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with customized attention mechanisms or positional and structural encodings. Despite making some progress, existing works tend to overlook external information of graphs, specifically the correlation between graphs. Intuitively, graphs with similar structures should have similar representations. Therefore, we propose Graph External Attention (GEA) -- a novel attention mechanism that leverages multiple external node/edge key-value units to capture inter-graph correlations implicitly. On this basis, we design an effective architecture called Graph External Attention Enhanced Transformer (GEAET), which integrates local structure and global interaction information for more comprehensive graph representations. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that GEAET achieves state-of-the-art empirical performance. The source code is available for reproducibility at: this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Branch-and-bound (BaB) is among the most effective methods for neural network (NN) verification. However, existing works on BaB have mostly focused on NNs with piecewise linear activations, especially ReLU networks. In this paper, we develop a general framework, named GenBaB, to conduct BaB for general nonlinearities in general computational graphs based on linear bound propagation. To decide which neuron to branch, we design a new branching heuristic which leverages linear bounds as shortcuts to efficiently estimate the potential improvement after branching. To decide nontrivial branching points for general nonlinear functions, we propose to optimize branching points offline, which can be efficiently leveraged during verification with a lookup table. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our GenBaB on verifying a wide range of NNs, including networks with activation functions such as Sigmoid, Tanh, Sine and GeLU, as well as networks involving multi-dimensional nonlinear operations such as multiplications in LSTMs and Vision Transformers. Our framework also allows the verification of general nonlinear computation graphs and enables verification applications beyond simple neural networks, particularly for AC Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF). GenBaB is part of the latest $\alpha,\!\beta$-CROWN, the winner of the 4th International Verification of Neural Networks Competition (VNN-COMP 2023).</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Realistic conditional 3D scene synthesis significantly enhances and accelerates the creation of virtual environments, which can also provide extensive training data for computer vision and robotics research among other applications. Diffusion models have shown great performance in related applications, e.g., making precise arrangements of unordered sets. However, these models have not been fully explored in floor-conditioned scene synthesis problems. We present MiDiffusion, a novel mixed discrete-continuous diffusion model architecture, designed to synthesize plausible 3D indoor scenes from given room types, floor plans, and potentially pre-existing objects. We represent a scene layout by a 2D floor plan and a set of objects, each defined by its category, location, size, and orientation. Our approach uniquely implements structured corruption across the mixed discrete semantic and continuous geometric domains, resulting in a better conditioned problem for the reverse denoising step. We evaluate our approach on the 3D-FRONT dataset. Our experimental results demonstrate that MiDiffusion substantially outperforms state-of-the-art autoregressive and diffusion models in floor-conditioned 3D scene synthesis. In addition, our models can handle partial object constraints via a corruption-and-masking strategy without task specific training. We show MiDiffusion maintains clear advantages over existing approaches in scene completion and furniture arrangement experiments.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Severe data imbalance naturally exists among web-scale vision-language datasets. Despite this, we find CLIP pre-trained thereupon exhibits notable robustness to the data imbalance compared to supervised learning, and demonstrates significant effectiveness in learning generalizable representations. With an aim to investigate the reasons behind this finding, we conduct controlled experiments to study various underlying factors, and reveal that CLIP's pretext task forms a dynamic classification problem wherein only a subset of classes is present in training. This isolates the bias from dominant classes and implicitly balances the learning signal. Furthermore, the robustness and discriminability of CLIP improve with more descriptive language supervision, larger data scale, and broader open-world concepts, which are inaccessible to supervised learning. Our study not only uncovers the mechanisms behind CLIP's generalizability beyond data imbalance but also provides transferable insights for the research community. The findings are validated in both supervised and self-supervised learning, enabling models trained on imbalanced data to achieve CLIP-level performance on diverse recognition tasks.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the quest for artificial general intelligence, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a focal point in recent advancements. However, the predominant focus remains on developing their capabilities in static image understanding. The potential of MLLMs in processing sequential visual data is still insufficiently explored, highlighting the absence of a comprehensive, high-quality assessment of their performance. In this paper, we introduce Video-MME, the first-ever full-spectrum, Multi-Modal Evaluation benchmark of MLLMs in Video analysis. Our work distinguishes from existing benchmarks through four key features: 1) Diversity in video types, spanning 6 primary visual domains with 30 subfields to ensure broad scenario generalizability; 2) Duration in temporal dimension, encompassing both short-, medium-, and long-term videos, ranging from 11 seconds to 1 hour, for robust contextual dynamics; 3) Breadth in data modalities, integrating multi-modal inputs besides video frames, including subtitles and audios, to unveil the all-round capabilities of MLLMs; 4) Quality in annotations, utilizing rigorous manual labeling by expert annotators to facilitate precise and reliable model assessment. 900 videos with a total of 256 hours are manually selected and annotated by repeatedly viewing all the video content, resulting in 2,700 question-answer pairs. With Video-MME, we extensively evaluate various state-of-the-art MLLMs, including GPT-4 series and Gemini 1.5 Pro, as well as open-source image models like InternVL-Chat-V1.5 and video models like LLaVA-NeXT-Video. Our experiments reveal that Gemini 1.5 Pro is the best-performing commercial model, significantly outperforming the open-source models. Our dataset along with these findings underscores the need for further improvements in handling longer sequences and multi-modal data. Project Page: this https URL</li>
