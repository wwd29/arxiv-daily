<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, defense, attack, robust, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Despite the promise of Federated Learning (FL) for privacy-preserving model training on distributed data, it remains susceptible to backdoor attacks. These attacks manipulate models by embedding triggers (specific input patterns) in the training data, forcing misclassification as predefined classes during deployment. Traditional single-trigger attacks and recent work on cooperative multiple-trigger attacks, where clients collaborate, highlight limitations in attack realism due to coordination requirements. We investigate a more alarming scenario: non-cooperative multiple-trigger attacks. Here, independent adversaries introduce distinct triggers targeting unique classes. These parallel attacks exploit FL's decentralized nature, making detection difficult. Our experiments demonstrate the alarming vulnerability of FL to such attacks, where individual backdoors can be successfully learned without impacting the main task. This research emphasizes the critical need for robust defenses against diverse backdoor attacks in the evolving FL landscape. While our focus is on empirical analysis, we believe it can guide backdoor research toward more realistic settings, highlighting the crucial role of FL in building robust defenses against diverse backdoor threats.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Machine learning has been successfully applied in developing malware detection systems, with a primary focus on accuracy, and increasing attention to reducing computational overhead and improving model interpretability. However, an important question remains underexplored: How well can machine learning-based models detect entirely new forms of malware not present in the training data? In this study, we present a machine learning-based system for detecting obfuscated malware that is not only highly accurate, lightweight and interpretable, but also capable of successfully adapting to new types of malware attacks. Our system is capable of detecting 15 malware subtypes despite being exclusively trained on one malware subtype, namely the Transponder from the Spyware family. This system was built after training 15 distinct random forest-based models, each on a different malware subtype from the CIC-MalMem-2022 dataset. These models were evaluated against the entire range of malware subtypes, including all unseen malware subtypes. To maintain the system's streamlined nature, training was confined to the top five most important features, which also enhanced interpretability. The Transponder-focused model exhibited high accuracy, exceeding 99.8%, with an average processing speed of 5.7 microseconds per file. We also illustrate how the Shapley additive explanations technique can facilitate the interpretation of the model predictions. Our research contributes to advancing malware detection methodologies, pioneering the feasibility of detecting obfuscated malware by exclusively training a model on a single or a few carefully selected malware subtypes and applying it to detect unseen subtypes.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, privacy, attack, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>There is a significant demand for indoor localization technology in smart buildings, and the most promising solution in this field is using RF sensors and fingerprinting-based methods that employ machine learning models trained on crowd-sourced user data gathered from IoT devices. However, this raises security and privacy issues in practice. Some researchers propose to use federated learning to partially overcome privacy problems, but there still remain security concerns, e.g., single-point failure and malicious attacks. In this paper, we propose a framework named DFLoc to achieve precise 3D localization tasks while considering the following two security concerns. Particularly, we design a specialized blockchain to decentralize the framework by distributing the tasks such as model distribution and aggregation which are handled by a central server to all clients in most previous works, to address the issue of the single-point failure for a reliable and accurate indoor localization system. Moreover, we introduce an updated model verification mechanism within the blockchain to alleviate the concern of malicious node attacks. Experimental results substantiate the framework's capacity to deliver accurate 3D location predictions and its superior resistance to the impacts of single-point failure and malicious attacks when compared to conventional centralized federated learning systems.</li>

          Vulnerability Detection in Smart Contracts: A Comprehensive Survey(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the growing field of blockchain technology, smart contracts exist as transformative digital agreements that execute transactions autonomously in decentralised networks. However, these contracts face challenges in the form of security vulnerabilities, posing significant financial and operational risks. While traditional methods to detect and mitigate vulnerabilities in smart contracts are limited due to a lack of comprehensiveness and effectiveness, integrating advanced machine learning technologies presents an attractive approach to increasing effective vulnerability countermeasures. We endeavour to fill an important gap in the existing literature by conducting a rigorous systematic review, exploring the intersection between machine learning and smart contracts. Specifically, the study examines the potential of machine learning techniques to improve the detection and mitigation of vulnerabilities in smart contracts. We analysed 88 articles published between 2018 and 2023 from the following databases: IEEE, ACM, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Google Scholar. The findings reveal that classical machine learning techniques, including KNN, RF, DT, XG-Boost, and SVM, outperform static tools in vulnerability detection. Moreover, multi-model approaches integrating deep learning and classical machine learning show significant improvements in precision and recall, while hybrid models employing various techniques achieve near-perfect performance in vulnerability detection accuracy. By integrating state-of-the-art solutions, this work synthesises current methods, thoroughly investigates research gaps, and suggests directions for future studies. The insights gathered from this study are intended to serve as a seminal reference for academics, industry experts, and bodies interested in leveraging machine learning to enhance smart contract security.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Synthetic data has been considered a better privacy-preserving alternative to traditionally sanitized data across various applications. However, a recent article challenges this notion, stating that synthetic data does not provide a better trade-off between privacy and utility than traditional anonymization techniques, and that it leads to unpredictable utility loss and highly unpredictable privacy gain. The article also claims to have identified a breach in the differential privacy guarantees provided by PATEGAN and PrivBayes. When a study claims to refute or invalidate prior findings, it is crucial to verify and validate the study. In our work, we analyzed the implementation of the privacy game described in the article and found that it operated in a highly specialized and constrained environment, which limits the applicability of its findings to general cases. Our exploration also revealed that the game did not satisfy a crucial precondition concerning data distributions, which contributed to the perceived violation of the differential privacy guarantees offered by PATEGAN and PrivBayes. We also conducted a privacy-utility trade-off analysis in a more general and unconstrained environment. Our experimentation demonstrated that synthetic data achieves a more favorable privacy-utility trade-off compared to the provided implementation of k-anonymization, thereby reaffirming earlier conclusions.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this study, we conduct a comprehensive review of smart grid security, exploring system architectures, attack methodologies, defense strategies, and future research opportunities. We provide an in-depth analysis of various attack vectors, focusing on new attack surfaces introduced by advanced components in smart grids. The review particularly includes an extensive analysis of coordinated attacks that incorporate multiple attack strategies and exploit vulnerabilities across various smart grid components to increase their adverse impact, demonstrating the complexity and potential severity of these threats. Following this, we examine innovative detection and mitigation strategies, including game theory, graph theory, blockchain, and machine learning, discussing their advancements in counteracting evolving threats and associated research challenges. In particular, our review covers a thorough examination of widely used machine learning-based mitigation strategies, analyzing their applications and research challenges spanning across supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, ensemble, and reinforcement learning. Further, we outline future research directions and explore new techniques and concerns. We first discuss the research opportunities for existing and emerging strategies, and then explore the potential role of new techniques, such as large language models (LLMs), and the emerging threat of adversarial machine learning in the future of smart grid security.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Understanding the motion states of the surrounding environment is critical for safe autonomous driving. These motion states can be accurately derived from scene flow, which captures the three-dimensional motion field of points. Existing LiDAR scene flow methods extract spatial features from each point cloud and then fuse them channel-wise, resulting in the implicit extraction of spatio-temporal features. Furthermore, they utilize 2D Bird's Eye View and process only two frames, missing crucial spatial information along the Z-axis and the broader temporal context, leading to suboptimal performance. To address these limitations, we propose Flow4D, which temporally fuses multiple point clouds after the 3D intra-voxel feature encoder, enabling more explicit extraction of spatio-temporal features through a 4D voxel network. However, while using 4D convolution improves performance, it significantly increases the computational load. For further efficiency, we introduce the Spatio-Temporal Decomposition Block (STDB), which combines 3D and 1D convolutions instead of using heavy 4D convolution. In addition, Flow4D further improves performance by using five frames to take advantage of richer temporal information. As a result, the proposed method achieves a 45.9% higher performance compared to the state-of-the-art while running in real-time, and won 1st place in the 2024 Argoverse 2 Scene Flow Challenge.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Reversing a diffusion process by learning its score forms the heart of diffusion-based generative modeling and for estimating properties of scientific systems. The diffusion processes that are tractable center on linear processes with a Gaussian stationary distribution. This limits the kinds of models that can be built to those that target a Gaussian prior or more generally limits the kinds of problems that can be generically solved to those that have conditionally linear score functions. In this work, we introduce a family of tractable denoising score matching objectives, called local-DSM, built using local increments of the diffusion process. We show how local-DSM melded with Taylor expansions enables automated training and score estimation with nonlinear diffusion processes. To demonstrate these ideas, we use automated-DSM to train generative models using non-Gaussian priors on challenging low dimensional distributions and the CIFAR10 image dataset. Additionally, we use the automated-DSM to learn the scores for nonlinear processes studied in statistical physics.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is characterized as a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disease that presents individuals with limited treatment options in the realm of medical interventions and therapies. The disease showcases a diverse range of onset patterns and progression trajectories, emphasizing the critical importance of early detection of functional decline to enable tailored care strategies and timely therapeutic interventions. The present investigation, spearheaded by the iDPP@CLEF 2024 challenge, focuses on utilizing sensor-derived data obtained through an app. This data is used to construct various machine learning models specifically designed to forecast the advancement of the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) score, leveraging the dataset provided by the organizers. In our analysis, multiple predictive models were evaluated to determine their efficacy in handling ALS sensor data. The temporal aspect of the sensor data was compressed and amalgamated using statistical methods, thereby augmenting the interpretability and applicability of the gathered information for predictive modeling objectives. The models that demonstrated optimal performance were a naive baseline and ElasticNet regression. The naive model achieved a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.20 and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.49, slightly outperforming the ElasticNet model, which recorded an MAE of 0.22 and an RMSE of 0.50. Our comparative analysis suggests that while the naive approach yielded marginally better predictive accuracy, the ElasticNet model provides a robust framework for understanding feature contributions.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present working notes for DS@GT team in the eRisk 2024 for Tasks 1 and 3. We propose a ranking system for Task 1 that predicts symptoms of depression based on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) questionnaire using binary classifiers trained on question relevancy as a proxy for ranking. We find that binary classifiers are not well calibrated for ranking, and perform poorly during evaluation. For Task 3, we use embeddings from BERT to predict the severity of eating disorder symptoms based on user post history. We find that classical machine learning models perform well on the task, and end up competitive with the baseline models. Representation of text data is crucial in both tasks, and we find that sentence transformers are a powerful tool for downstream modeling.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper proposes a new self-organizing interval type-2 fuzzy neural network with multiple outputs (SOIT2FNN-MO) for multi-step time series prediction. Differing from the traditional six-layer IT2FNN, a nine-layer network is developed to improve prediction accuracy, uncertainty handling and model interpretability. First, a new co-antecedent layer and a modified consequent layer are devised to improve the interpretability of the fuzzy model for multi-step predictions. Second, a new transformation layer is designed to address the potential issues in the vanished rule firing strength caused by highdimensional inputs. Third, a new link layer is proposed to build temporal connections between multi-step predictions. Furthermore, a two-stage self-organizing mechanism is developed to automatically generate the fuzzy rules, in which the first stage is used to create the rule base from empty and perform the initial optimization, while the second stage is to fine-tune all network parameters. Finally, various simulations are carried out on chaotic and microgrid time series prediction problems, demonstrating the superiority of our approach in terms of prediction accuracy, uncertainty handling and model interpretability.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the advancements in denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), image inpainting has significantly evolved from merely filling information based on nearby regions to generating content conditioned on various prompts such as text, exemplar images, and sketches. However, existing methods, such as model fine-tuning and simple concatenation of latent vectors, often result in generation failures due to overfitting and inconsistency between the inpainted region and the background. In this paper, we argue that the current large diffusion models are sufficiently powerful to generate realistic images without further tuning. Hence, we introduce PILOT (in\textbf{P}ainting v\textbf{I}a \textbf{L}atent \textbf{O}p\textbf{T}imization), an optimization approach grounded on a novel \textit{semantic centralization} and \textit{background preservation loss}. Our method searches latent spaces capable of generating inpainted regions that exhibit high fidelity to user-provided prompts while maintaining coherence with the background. Furthermore, we propose a strategy to balance optimization expense and image quality, significantly enhancing generation efficiency. Our method seamlessly integrates with any pre-trained model, including ControlNet and DreamBooth, making it suitable for deployment in multi-modal editing tools. Our qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that PILOT outperforms existing approaches by generating more coherent, diverse, and faithful inpainted regions in response to provided prompts.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Placenta volume measurement from 3D ultrasound images is critical for predicting pregnancy outcomes, and manual annotation is the gold standard. However, such manual annotation is expensive and time-consuming. Automated segmentation algorithms can often successfully segment the placenta, but these methods may not consistently produce robust segmentations suitable for practical use. Recently, inspired by the Segment Anything Model (SAM), deep learning-based interactive segmentation models have been widely applied in the medical imaging domain. These models produce a segmentation from visual prompts provided to indicate the target region, which may offer a feasible solution for practical use. However, none of these models are specifically designed for interactively segmenting 3D ultrasound images, which remain challenging due to the inherent noise of this modality. In this paper, we evaluate publicly available state-of-the-art 3D interactive segmentation models in contrast to a human-in-the-loop approach for the placenta segmentation task. The Dice score, normalized surface Dice, averaged symmetric surface distance, and 95-percent Hausdorff distance are used as evaluation metrics. We consider a Dice score of 0.95 a successful segmentation. Our results indicate that the human-in-the-loop segmentation model reaches this standard. Moreover, we assess the efficiency of the human-in-the-loop model as a function of the amount of prompts. Our results demonstrate that the human-in-the-loop model is both effective and efficient for interactive placenta segmentation. The code is available at \url{this https URL}.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Fishes are integral to both ecological systems and economic sectors, and studying fish traits is crucial for understanding biodiversity patterns and macro-evolution trends. To enable the analysis of visual traits from fish images, we introduce the Fish-Visual Trait Analysis (Fish-Vista) dataset - a large, annotated collection of about 60K fish images spanning 1900 different species, supporting several challenging and biologically relevant tasks including species classification, trait identification, and trait segmentation. These images have been curated through a sophisticated data processing pipeline applied to a cumulative set of images obtained from various museum collections. Fish-Vista provides fine-grained labels of various visual traits present in each image. It also offers pixel-level annotations of 9 different traits for 2427 fish images, facilitating additional trait segmentation and localization tasks. The ultimate goal of Fish-Vista is to provide a clean, carefully curated, high-resolution dataset that can serve as a foundation for accelerating biological discoveries using advances in AI. Finally, we provide a comprehensive analysis of state-of-the-art deep learning techniques on Fish-Vista.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Numerous benchmarks aim to evaluate the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) for causal inference and reasoning. However, many of them can likely be solved through the retrieval of domain knowledge, questioning whether they achieve their purpose. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of LLM benchmarks for causality. We highlight how recent benchmarks move towards a more thorough definition of causal reasoning by incorporating interventional or counterfactual reasoning. We derive a set of criteria that a useful benchmark or set of benchmarks should aim to satisfy. We hope this work will pave the way towards a general framework for the assessment of causal understanding in LLMs and the design of novel benchmarks.</li>

          FsPONER: Few-shot Prompt Optimization for Named Entity Recognition in Domain-specific Scenarios(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have provided a new pathway for Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks. Compared with fine-tuning, LLM-powered prompting methods avoid the need for training, conserve substantial computational resources, and rely on minimal annotated data. Previous studies have achieved comparable performance to fully supervised BERT-based fine-tuning approaches on general NER benchmarks. However, none of the previous approaches has investigated the efficiency of LLM-based few-shot learning in domain-specific scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce FsPONER, a novel approach for optimizing few-shot prompts, and evaluate its performance on domain-specific NER datasets, with a focus on industrial manufacturing and maintenance, while using multiple LLMs -- GPT-4-32K, GPT-3.5-Turbo, LLaMA 2-chat, and Vicuna. FsPONER consists of three few-shot selection methods based on random sampling, TF-IDF vectors, and a combination of both. We compare these methods with a general-purpose GPT-NER method as the number of few-shot examples increases and evaluate their optimal NER performance against fine-tuned BERT and LLaMA 2-chat. In the considered real-world scenarios with data scarcity, FsPONER with TF-IDF surpasses fine-tuned models by approximately 10% in F1 score.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Hallucination is often regarded as a major impediment for using large language models (LLMs), especially for knowledge-intensive tasks. Even when the training corpus consists solely of true statements, language models still generate hallucinations in the form of amalgamations of multiple facts. We coin this phenomenon as ``knowledge overshadowing'': when we query knowledge from a language model with multiple conditions, some conditions overshadow others, leading to hallucinated outputs. This phenomenon partially stems from training data imbalance, which we verify on both pretrained models and fine-tuned models, over a wide range of LM model families and sizes.From a theoretical point of view, knowledge overshadowing can be interpreted as over-generalization of the dominant conditions (patterns). We show that the hallucination rate grows with both the imbalance ratio (between the popular and unpopular condition) and the length of dominant condition description, consistent with our derived generalization bound. Finally, we propose to utilize overshadowing conditions as a signal to catch hallucination before it is produced, along with a training-free self-contrastive decoding method to alleviate hallucination during inference. Our proposed approach showcases up to 82% F1 for hallucination anticipation and 11.2% to 39.4% hallucination control, with different models and datasets.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), as a representative Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)method, significantly enhances the training efficiency by updating only a small portion of the weights in Large Language Models (LLMs). Recently, weight-only quantization techniques have also been applied to LoRA methods to reduce the memory footprint of fine-tuning. However, applying weight-activation quantization to the LoRA pipeline is under-explored, and we observe substantial performance degradation primarily due to the presence of activation outliers. In this work, we propose RoLoRA, the first LoRA-based scheme for effective weight-activation quantization. RoLoRA utilizes rotation for outlier elimination and proposes rotation-aware fine-tuning to preserve the outlier-free characteristics in rotated LLMs. Experimental results show RoLoRA consistently improves low-bit LoRA convergence and post-training quantization robustness in weight-activation settings. We evaluate RoLoRA across LLaMA2-7B/13B, LLaMA3-8B models, achieving up to 29.5% absolute accuracy gain of 4-bit weight-activation quantized LLaMA2- 13B on commonsense reasoning tasks compared to LoRA baseline. We further demonstrate its effectiveness on Large Multimodal Models (LLaVA-1.5-7B). Codes are available at this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Autonomous driving holds great promise in addressing traffic safety concerns by leveraging artificial intelligence and sensor technology. Multi-Object Tracking plays a critical role in ensuring safer and more efficient navigation through complex traffic scenarios. This paper presents a novel deep learning-based method that integrates radar and camera data to enhance the accuracy and robustness of Multi-Object Tracking in autonomous driving systems. The proposed method leverages a Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory network to incorporate long-term temporal information and improve motion prediction. An appearance feature model inspired by FaceNet is used to establish associations between objects across different frames, ensuring consistent tracking. A tri-output mechanism is employed, consisting of individual outputs for radar and camera sensors and a fusion output, to provide robustness against sensor failures and produce accurate tracking results. Through extensive evaluations of real-world datasets, our approach demonstrates remarkable improvements in tracking accuracy, ensuring reliable performance even in low-visibility scenarios.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Predicting realistic ground views from satellite imagery in urban scenes is a challenging task due to the significant view gaps between satellite and ground-view images. We propose a novel pipeline to tackle this challenge, by generating geospecifc views that maximally respect the weak geometry and texture from multi-view satellite images. Different from existing approaches that hallucinate images from cues such as partial semantics or geometry from overhead satellite images, our method directly predicts ground-view images at geolocation by using a comprehensive set of information from the satellite image, resulting in ground-level images with a resolution boost at a factor of ten or more. We leverage a novel building refinement method to reduce geometric distortions in satellite data at ground level, which ensures the creation of accurate conditions for view synthesis using diffusion networks. Moreover, we proposed a novel geospecific prior, which prompts distribution learning of diffusion models to respect image samples that are closer to the geolocation of the predicted images. We demonstrate our pipeline is the first to generate close-to-real and geospecific ground views merely based on satellite images.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose a novel hybrid Mamba-Transformer backbone, denoted as MambaVision, which is specifically tailored for vision applications. Our core contribution includes redesigning the Mamba formulation to enhance its capability for efficient modeling of visual features. In addition, we conduct a comprehensive ablation study on the feasibility of integrating Vision Transformers (ViT) with Mamba. Our results demonstrate that equipping the Mamba architecture with several self-attention blocks at the final layers greatly improves the modeling capacity to capture long-range spatial dependencies. Based on our findings, we introduce a family of MambaVision models with a hierarchical architecture to meet various design criteria. For Image classification on ImageNet-1K dataset, MambaVision model variants achieve a new State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance in terms of Top-1 accuracy and image throughput. In downstream tasks such as object detection, instance segmentation and semantic segmentation on MS COCO and ADE20K datasets, MambaVision outperforms comparably-sized backbones and demonstrates more favorable performance.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep learning algorithms - typically consisting of a class of deep neural networks trained by a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization method - are nowadays the key ingredients in many artificial intelligence (AI) systems and have revolutionized our ways of working and living in modern societies. For example, SGD methods are used to train powerful large language models (LLMs) such as versions of ChatGPT and Gemini, SGD methods are employed to create successful generative AI based text-to-image creation models such as Midjourney, DALL-E, and Stable Diffusion, but SGD methods are also used to train DNNs to approximately solve scientific models such as partial differential equation (PDE) models from physics and biology and optimal control and stopping problems from engineering. It is known that the plain vanilla standard SGD method fails to converge even in the situation of several convex optimization problems if the learning rates are bounded away from zero. However, in many practical relevant training scenarios, often not the plain vanilla standard SGD method but instead adaptive SGD methods such as the RMSprop and the Adam optimizers, in which the learning rates are modified adaptively during the training process, are employed. This naturally rises the question whether such adaptive optimizers, in which the learning rates are modified adaptively during the training process, do converge in the situation of non-vanishing learning rates. In this work we answer this question negatively by proving that adaptive SGD methods such as the popular Adam optimizer fail to converge to any possible random limit point if the learning rates are asymptotically bounded away from zero. In our proof of this non-convergence result we establish suitable pathwise a priori bounds for a class of accelerated and adaptive SGD methods, which are also of independent interest.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Urban waterlogging poses a major risk to public safety and infrastructure. Conventional methods using water-level sensors need high-maintenance to hardly achieve full coverage. Recent advances employ surveillance camera imagery and deep learning for detection, yet these struggle amidst scarce data and adverse environmental conditions. In this paper, we establish a challenging Urban Waterlogging Benchmark (UW-Bench) under diverse adverse conditions to advance real-world applications. We propose a Large-Small Model co-adapter paradigm (LSM-adapter), which harnesses the substantial generic segmentation potential of large model and the specific task-directed guidance of small model. Specifically, a Triple-S Prompt Adapter module alongside a Dynamic Prompt Combiner are proposed to generate then merge multiple prompts for mask decoder adaptation. Meanwhile, a Histogram Equalization Adap-ter module is designed to infuse the image specific information for image encoder adaptation. Results and analysis show the challenge and superiority of our developed benchmark and algorithm. Project page: \url{this https URL}</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Model inversion (MI) attack reconstructs the private training data of a target model given its output, posing a significant threat to deep learning models and data privacy. On one hand, most of existing MI methods focus on searching for latent codes to represent the target identity, yet this iterative optimization-based scheme consumes a huge number of queries to the target model, making it unrealistic especially in black-box scenario. On the other hand, some training-based methods launch an attack through a single forward inference, whereas failing to directly learn high-level mappings from prediction vectors to images. Addressing these limitations, we propose a novel Prediction-to-Image (P2I) method for black-box MI attack. Specifically, we introduce the Prediction Alignment Encoder to map the target model's output prediction into the latent code of StyleGAN. In this way, prediction vector space can be well aligned with the more disentangled latent space, thus establishing a connection between prediction vectors and the semantic facial features. During the attack phase, we further design the Aligned Ensemble Attack scheme to integrate complementary facial attributes of target identity for better reconstruction. Experimental results show that our method outperforms other SOTAs, e.g.,compared with RLB-MI, our method improves attack accuracy by 8.5% and reduces query numbers by 99% on dataset CelebA.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multispectral oriented object detection faces challenges due to both inter-modal and intra-modal discrepancies. Recent studies often rely on transformer-based models to address these issues and achieve cross-modal fusion detection. However, the quadratic computational complexity of transformers limits their performance. Inspired by the efficiency and lower complexity of Mamba in long sequence tasks, we propose Disparity-guided Multispectral Mamba (DMM), a multispectral oriented object detection framework comprised of a Disparity-guided Cross-modal Fusion Mamba (DCFM) module, a Multi-scale Target-aware Attention (MTA) module, and a Target-Prior Aware (TPA) auxiliary task. The DCFM module leverages disparity information between modalities to adaptively merge features from RGB and IR images, mitigating inter-modal conflicts. The MTA module aims to enhance feature representation by focusing on relevant target regions within the RGB modality, addressing intra-modal variations. The TPA auxiliary task utilizes single-modal labels to guide the optimization of the MTA module, ensuring it focuses on targets and their local context. Extensive experiments on the DroneVehicle and VEDAI datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods while maintaining computational efficiency.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Reduplication and repetition, though similar in form, serve distinct linguistic purposes. Reduplication is a deliberate morphological process used to express grammatical, semantic, or pragmatic nuances, while repetition is often unintentional and indicative of disfluency. This paper presents the first large-scale study of reduplication and repetition in speech using computational linguistics. We introduce IndicRedRep, a new publicly available dataset containing Hindi, Telugu, and Marathi text annotated with reduplication and repetition at the word level. We evaluate transformer-based models for multi-class reduplication and repetition token classification, utilizing the Reparandum-Interregnum-Repair structure to distinguish between the two phenomena. Our models achieve macro F1 scores of up to 85.62% in Hindi, 83.95% in Telugu, and 84.82% in Marathi for reduplication-repetition classification.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Understanding of video creativity and content often varies among individuals, with differences in focal points and cognitive levels across different ages, experiences, and genders. There is currently a lack of research in this area, and most existing benchmarks suffer from several drawbacks: 1) a limited number of modalities and answers with restrictive length; 2) the content and scenarios within the videos are excessively monotonous, transmitting allegories and emotions that are overly simplistic. To bridge the gap to real-world applications, we introduce a large-scale \textbf{S}ubjective \textbf{R}esponse \textbf{I}ndicators for \textbf{A}dvertisement \textbf{V}ideos dataset, namely SRI-ADV. Specifically, we collected real changes in Electroencephalographic (EEG) and eye-tracking regions from different demographics while they viewed identical video content. Utilizing this multi-modal dataset, we developed tasks and protocols to analyze and evaluate the extent of cognitive understanding of video content among different users. Along with the dataset, we designed a \textbf{H}ypergraph \textbf{M}ulti-modal \textbf{L}arge \textbf{L}anguage \textbf{M}odel (HMLLM) to explore the associations among different demographics, video elements, EEG and eye-tracking indicators. HMLLM could bridge semantic gaps across rich modalities and integrate information beyond different modalities to perform logical reasoning. Extensive experimental evaluations on SRI-ADV and other additional video-based generative performance benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Data augmentation remains a widely utilized technique in deep learning, particularly in tasks such as image classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection. Among them, Copy-Paste is a simple yet effective method and gain great attention recently. However, existing Copy-Paste often overlook contextual relevance between source and target images, resulting in inconsistencies in generated outputs. To address this challenge, we propose a context-aware approach that integrates Bidirectional Latent Information Propagation (BLIP) for content extraction from source images. By matching extracted content information with category information, our method ensures cohesive integration of target objects using Segment Anything Model (SAM) and You Only Look Once (YOLO). This approach eliminates the need for manual annotation, offering an automated and user-friendly solution. Experimental evaluations across diverse datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in enhancing data diversity and generating high-quality pseudo-images across various computer vision tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, federate, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deduplication is a vital preprocessing step that enhances machine learning model performance and saves training time and energy. However, enhancing federated learning through deduplication poses challenges, especially regarding scalability and potential privacy violations if deduplication involves sharing all clients' data. In this paper, we address the problem of deduplication in a federated setup by introducing a pioneering protocol, Efficient Privacy-Preserving Multi-Party Deduplication (EP-MPD). It efficiently removes duplicates from multiple clients' datasets without compromising data privacy. EP-MPD is constructed in a modular fashion, utilizing two novel variants of the Private Set Intersection protocol. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the significant benefits of deduplication in federated learning of large language models. For instance, we observe up to 19.61% improvement in perplexity and up to 27.95% reduction in running time. EP-MPD effectively balances privacy and performance in federated learning, making it a valuable solution for large-scale applications.</li>

          Model-agnostic clean-label backdoor mitigation in cybersecurity environments(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, defense, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The training phase of machine learning models is a delicate step, especially in cybersecurity contexts. Recent research has surfaced a series of insidious training-time attacks that inject backdoors in models designed for security classification tasks without altering the training labels. With this work, we propose new techniques that leverage insights in cybersecurity threat models to effectively mitigate these clean-label poisoning attacks, while preserving the model utility. By performing density-based clustering on a carefully chosen feature subspace, and progressively isolating the suspicious clusters through a novel iterative scoring procedure, our defensive mechanism can mitigate the attacks without requiring many of the common assumptions in the existing backdoor defense literature. To show the generality of our proposed mitigation, we evaluate it on two clean-label model-agnostic attacks on two different classic cybersecurity data modalities: network flows classification and malware classification, using gradient boosting and neural network models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The electroretinogram (ERG) is a clinical test that records the retina's electrical response to light. The ERG is a promising way to study different neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD) - a neurodevelopmental condition that impacts language, communication, and reciprocal social interactions. However, in heterogeneous populations, such as ASD, where the ability to collect large datasets is limited, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) is complicated. Synthetic ERG signals generated from real ERG recordings carry similar information as natural ERGs and, therefore, could be used as an extension for natural data to increase datasets so that AI applications can be fully utilized. As proof of principle, this study presents a Generative Adversarial Network capable of generating synthetic ERG signals of children with ASD and typically developing control individuals. We applied a Time Series Transformer and Visual Transformer with Continuous Wavelet Transform to enhance classification results on the extended synthetic signals dataset. This approach may support classification models in related psychiatric conditions where the ERG may help classify disorders.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We address the challenge of efficiently and reliably deleting data from machine learning models trained using Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM), a process known as machine unlearning. To avoid retraining models from scratch, we propose a novel algorithm leveraging Natural Gradient Descent (NGD). Our theoretical framework ensures strong privacy guarantees for convex models, while a practical Min/Max optimization algorithm is developed for non-convex models. Comprehensive evaluations show significant improvements in privacy, computational efficiency, and generalization compared to state-of-the-art methods, advancing both the theoretical and practical aspects of machine unlearning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Domain probe lists--used to determine which URLs to probe for Web censorship--play a critical role in Internet censorship measurement studies. Indeed, the size and accuracy of the domain probe list limits the set of censored pages that can be detected; inaccurate lists can lead to an incomplete view of the censorship landscape or biased results. Previous efforts to generate domain probe lists have been mostly manual or crowdsourced. This approach is time-consuming, prone to errors, and does not scale well to the ever-changing censorship landscape. In this paper, we explore methods for automatically generating probe lists that are both comprehensive and up-to-date for Web censorship measurement. We start from an initial set of 139,957 unique URLs from various existing test lists consisting of pages from a variety of languages to generate new candidate pages. By analyzing content from these URLs (i.e., performing topic and keyword extraction), expanding these topics, and using them as a feed to search engines, our method produces 119,255 new URLs across 35,147 domains. We then test the new candidate pages by attempting to access each URL from servers in eleven different global locations over a span of four months to check for their connectivity and potential signs of censorship. Our measurements reveal that our method discovered over 1,400 domains--not present in the original dataset--we suspect to be blocked. In short, automatically updating probe lists is possible, and can help further automate censorship measurements at scale.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have revolutionized both the natural language processing research and applications. However, stereotypical biases (e.g., gender and racial discrimination) encoded in PLMs have raised negative ethical implications for PLMs, which critically limits their broader applications. To address the aforementioned unfairness issues, we present fairBERTs, a general framework for learning fair fine-tuned BERT series models by erasing the protected sensitive information via semantic and fairness-aware perturbations generated by a generative adversarial network. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on two real-world tasks, we demonstrate the great superiority of fairBERTs in mitigating unfairness while maintaining the model utility. We also verify the feasibility of transferring adversarial components in fairBERTs to other conventionally trained BERT-like models for yielding fairness improvements. Our findings may shed light on further research on building fairer fine-tuned PLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Two-view pose estimation is essential for map-free visual relocalization and object pose tracking tasks. However, traditional matching methods suffer from time-consuming robust estimators, while deep learning-based pose regressors only cater to camera-to-world pose estimation, lacking generalizability to different image sizes and camera intrinsics. In this paper, we propose SRPose, a sparse keypoint-based framework for two-view relative pose estimation in camera-to-world and object-to-camera scenarios. SRPose consists of a sparse keypoint detector, an intrinsic-calibration position encoder, and promptable prior knowledge-guided attention layers. Given two RGB images of a fixed scene or a moving object, SRPose estimates the relative camera or 6D object pose transformation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SRPose achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and speed, showing generalizability to both scenarios. It is robust to different image sizes and camera intrinsics, and can be deployed with low computing resources.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Curvilinear object segmentation plays a crucial role across various applications, yet datasets in this domain often suffer from small scale due to the high costs associated with data acquisition and annotation. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel approach for expanding curvilinear object segmentation datasets, focusing on enhancing the informativeness of generated data and the consistency between semantic maps and generated images. Our method enriches synthetic data informativeness by generating curvilinear objects through their multiple textual features. By combining textual features from each sample in original dataset, we obtain synthetic images that beyond the original dataset's distribution. This initiative necessitated the creation of the Curvilinear Object Segmentation based on Text Generation (COSTG) dataset. Designed to surpass the limitations of conventional datasets, COSTG incorporates not only standard semantic maps but also some textual descriptions of curvilinear object features. To ensure consistency between synthetic semantic maps and images, we introduce the Semantic Consistency Preserving ControlNet (SCP ControlNet). This involves an adaptation of ControlNet with Spatially-Adaptive Normalization (SPADE), allowing it to preserve semantic information that would typically be washed away in normalization layers. This modification facilitates more accurate semantic image synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach across three types of curvilinear objects (angiography, crack and retina) and six public datasets (CHUAC, XCAD, DCA1, DRIVE, CHASEDB1 and Crack500). The synthetic data generated by our method not only expand the dataset, but also effectively improves the performance of other curvilinear object segmentation models.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) combines the generative abilities of large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge sources to provide more accurate and up-to-date responses. Recent RAG advancements focus on improving retrieval outcomes through iterative LLM refinement or self-critique capabilities acquired through additional instruction tuning of LLMs. In this work, we introduce Speculative RAG - a framework that leverages a larger generalist LM to efficiently verify multiple RAG drafts produced in parallel by a smaller, distilled specialist LM. Each draft is generated from a distinct subset of retrieved documents, offering diverse perspectives on the evidence while reducing input token counts per draft. This approach enhances comprehension of each subset and mitigates potential position bias over long context. Our method accelerates RAG by delegating drafting to the smaller specialist LM, with the larger generalist LM performing a single verification pass over the drafts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Speculative RAG achieves state-of-the-art performance with reduced latency on TriviaQA, MuSiQue, PubHealth, and ARC-Challenge benchmarks. It notably enhances accuracy by up to 12.97% while reducing latency by 51% compared to conventional RAG systems on PubHealth.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Event cameras, mimicking the human retina, capture brightness changes with unparalleled temporal resolution and dynamic range. Integrating events into intensities poses a highly ill-posed challenge, marred by initial condition ambiguities. Traditional regression-based deep learning methods fall short in perceptual quality, offering deterministic and often unrealistic reconstructions. In this paper, we introduce diffusion models to events-to-video reconstruction, achieving colorful, realistic, and perceptually superior video generation from achromatic events. Powered by the image generation ability and knowledge of pretrained diffusion models, the proposed method can achieve a better trade-off between the perception and distortion of the reconstructed frame compared to previous solutions. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach can produce diverse, realistic frames with faithfulness to the given events.</li>

Our methodology incorporates Lipschitz neural networks and decomposes the training process of the neural network into sub-problems, each corresponding to the training of a specific layer. By doing so, we extend the analysis of differential privacy under the hidden state assumption to encompass non-convex problems and algorithms employing proximal gradient descent. Furthermore, in contrast to existing methods, we adopt a novel approach by utilizing calibrated noise sampled from adaptive distributions, yielding improved empirical trade-offs between utility and privacy.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Face anti-spoofing techniques based on domain generalization have recently been studied widely. Adversarial learning and meta-learning techniques have been adopted to learn domain-invariant representations. However, prior approaches often consider the dataset gap as the primary factor behind domain shifts. This perspective is not fine-grained enough to reflect the intrinsic gap among the data accurately. In our work, we redefine domains based on identities rather than datasets, aiming to disentangle liveness and identity attributes. We emphasize ignoring the adverse effect of identity shift, focusing on learning identity-invariant liveness representations through orthogonalizing liveness and identity features. To cope with style shifts, we propose Style Cross module to expand the stylistic diversity and Channel-wise Style Attention module to weaken the sensitivity to style shifts, aiming to learn robust liveness representations. Furthermore, acknowledging the asymmetry between live and spoof samples, we introduce a novel contrastive loss, Asymmetric Augmented Instance Contrast. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance under cross-dataset and limited source dataset scenarios. Additionally, our method has good scalability when expanding diversity of identities. The codes will be released soon.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Most recent unsupervised non-rigid 3D shape matching methods are based on the functional map framework due to its efficiency and superior performance. Nevertheless, respective methods struggle to obtain spatially smooth pointwise correspondences due to the lack of proper regularisation. In this work, inspired by the success of message passing on graphs, we propose a synchronous diffusion process which we use as regularisation to achieve smoothness in non-rigid 3D shape matching problems. The intuition of synchronous diffusion is that diffusing the same input function on two different shapes results in consistent outputs. Using different challenging datasets, we demonstrate that our novel regularisation can substantially improve the state-of-the-art in shape matching, especially in the presence of topological noise.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, robust, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated learning, a distributed learning paradigm, utilizes multiple clients to build a robust global model. In real-world applications, local clients often operate within their limited domains, leading to a `domain shift' across clients. Privacy concerns limit each client's learning to its own domain data, which increase the risk of overfitting. Moreover, the process of aggregating models trained on own limited domain can be potentially lead to a significant degradation in the global model performance. To deal with these challenges, we introduce the concept of federated feature diversification. Each client diversifies the own limited domain data by leveraging global feature statistics, i.e., the aggregated average statistics over all participating clients, shared through the global model's parameters. This data diversification helps local models to learn client-invariant representations while preserving privacy. Our resultant global model shows robust performance on unseen test domain data. To enhance performance further, we develop an instance-adaptive inference approach tailored for test domain data. Our proposed instance feature adapter dynamically adjusts feature statistics to align with the test input, thereby reducing the domain gap between the test and training domains. We show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on several domain generalization benchmarks within a federated learning setting.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Neural networks (NN) achieve remarkable results in various tasks, but lack key characteristics: interpretability, support for categorical features, and lightweight implementations suitable for edge devices. While ongoing efforts aim to address these challenges, Gradient Boosting Trees (GBT) inherently meet these requirements. As a result, GBTs have become the go-to method for supervised learning tasks in many real-world applications and competitions. However, their application in online learning scenarios, notably in reinforcement learning (RL), has been limited. In this work, we bridge this gap by introducing Gradient-Boosting RL (GBRL), a framework that extends the advantages of GBT to the RL domain. Using the GBRL framework, we implement various actor-critic algorithms and compare their performance with their NN counterparts. Inspired by shared backbones in NN we introduce a tree-sharing approach for policy and value functions with distinct learning rates, enhancing learning efficiency over millions of interactions. GBRL achieves competitive performance across a diverse array of tasks, excelling in domains with structured or categorical features. Additionally, we present a high-performance, GPU-accelerated implementation that integrates seamlessly with widely-used RL libraries (available at this https URL). GBRL expands the toolkit for RL practitioners, demonstrating the viability and promise of GBT within the RL paradigm, particularly in domains characterized by structured or categorical features.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Efficient extraction of spectral sequences and geospatial information has always been a hot topic in hyperspectral image classification. In terms of spectral sequence feature capture, RNN and Transformer have become mainstream classification frameworks due to their long-range feature capture capabilities. In terms of spatial information aggregation, CNN enhances the receptive field to retain integrated spatial information as much as possible. However, the spectral feature-capturing architectures exhibit low computational efficiency, and CNNs lack the flexibility to perceive spatial contextual information. To address these issues, this paper proposes GraphMamba--an efficient graph structure learning vision Mamba classification framework that fully considers HSI characteristics to achieve deep spatial-spectral information mining. Specifically, we propose a novel hyperspectral visual GraphMamba processing paradigm (HVGM) that preserves spatial-spectral features by constructing spatial-spectral cubes and utilizes linear spectral encoding to enhance the operability of subsequent tasks. The core components of GraphMamba include the HyperMamba module for improving computational efficiency and the SpectralGCN module for adaptive spatial context awareness. The HyperMamba mitigates clutter interference by employing the global mask (GM) and introduces a parallel training inference architecture to alleviate computational bottlenecks. The SpatialGCN incorporates weighted multi-hop aggregation (WMA) spatial encoding to focus on highly correlated spatial structural features, thus flexibly aggregating contextual information while mitigating spatial noise interference. Extensive experiments were conducted on three different scales of real HSI datasets, and compared with the state-of-the-art classification frameworks, GraphMamba achieved optimal performance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Models based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) and transformers have steadily been improved. They also have been applied in various computer vision downstream tasks. However, in object detection tasks, accurately localizing and classifying almost infinite categories of foods in images remains challenging. To address these problems, we first segmented the food as the region-of-interest (ROI) by using the segment-anything model (SAM) and masked the rest of the region except ROI as black pixels. This process simplified the problems into a single classification for which annotation and training were much simpler than object detection. The images in which only the ROI was preserved were fed as inputs to fine-tune various off-the-shelf models that encoded their own inductive biases. Among them, Data-efficient image Transformers (DeiTs) had the best classification performance. Nonetheless, when foods' shapes and textures were similar, the contextual features of the ROI-only images were not enough for accurate classification. Therefore, we introduced a novel type of combined architecture, RveRNet, which consisted of ROI, extra-ROI, and integration modules that allowed it to account for both the ROI's and global contexts. The RveRNet's F1 score was 10% better than other individual models when classifying ambiguous food images. If the RveRNet's modules were DeiT with the knowledge distillation from the CNN, performed the best. We investigated how architectures can be made robust against input noise caused by permutation and translocation. The results indicated that there was a trade-off between how much the CNN teacher's knowledge could be distilled to DeiT and DeiT's innate strength.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Thermal infrared tracking is an essential topic in computer vision tasks because of its advantage of all-weather imaging. However, most conventional methods utilize only hand-crafted features, while deep learning-based correlation filtering methods are limited by simple correlation operations. Transformer-based methods ignore temporal and coordinate information, which is critical for TIR tracking that lacks texture and color information. In this paper, to address these issues, we apply natural language modeling to TIR tracking and propose a novel model called NLMTrack, which enhances the utilization of coordinate and temporal information. NLMTrack applies an encoder that unifies feature extraction and feature fusion, which simplifies the TIR tracking pipeline. To address the challenge of low detail and low contrast in TIR images, on the one hand, we design a multi-level progressive fusion module that enhances the semantic representation and incorporates multi-scale features. On the other hand, the decoder combines the TIR features and the coordinate sequence features using a causal transformer to generate the target sequence step by step. Moreover, we explore an adaptive loss aimed at elevating tracking accuracy and a simple template update strategy to accommodate the target's appearance variations. Experiments show that NLMTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks. The Code is publicly available at \url{this https URL}.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>CLIP, as a vision-language model, has significantly advanced Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS) with its zero-shot capabilities. Despite its success, its application to OVSS faces challenges due to its initial image-level alignment training, which affects its performance in tasks requiring detailed local context. Our study delves into the impact of CLIP's [CLS] token on patch feature correlations, revealing a dominance of "global" patches that hinders local feature discrimination. To overcome this, we propose CLIPtrase, a novel training-free semantic segmentation strategy that enhances local feature awareness through recalibrated self-correlation among patches. This approach demonstrates notable improvements in segmentation accuracy and the ability to maintain semantic coherence across objects.Experiments show that we are 22.3% ahead of CLIP on average on 9 segmentation benchmarks, outperforming existing state-of-the-art training-free methods.The code are made publicly available at: this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) with in-context learning have significantly improved the performance of text-to-SQL task. Previous works generally focus on using exclusive SQL generation prompt to improve the LLMs' reasoning ability. However, they are mostly hard to handle large databases with numerous tables and columns, and usually ignore the significance of pre-processing database and extracting valuable information for more efficient prompt engineering. Based on above analysis, we propose RB-SQL, a novel retrieval-based LLM framework for in-context prompt engineering, which consists of three modules that retrieve concise tables and columns as schema, and targeted examples for in-context learning. Experiment results demonstrate that our model achieves better performance than several competitive baselines on public datasets BIRD and Spider.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Crop yield forecasting plays a significant role in addressing growing concerns about food security and guiding decision-making for policymakers and farmers. When deep learning is employed, understanding the learning and decision-making processes of the models, as well as their interaction with the input data, is crucial for establishing trust in the models and gaining insight into their reliability. In this study, we focus on the task of crop yield prediction, specifically for soybean, wheat, and rapeseed crops in Argentina, Uruguay, and Germany. Our goal is to develop and explain predictive models for these crops, using a large dataset of satellite images, additional data modalities, and crop yield maps. We employ a long short-term memory network and investigate the impact of using different temporal samplings of the satellite data and the benefit of adding more relevant modalities. For model explainability, we utilize feature attribution methods to quantify input feature contributions, identify critical growth stages, analyze yield variability at the field level, and explain less accurate predictions. The modeling results show an improvement when adding more modalities or using all available instances of satellite data. The explainability results reveal distinct feature importance patterns for each crop and region. We further found that the most influential growth stages on the prediction are dependent on the temporal sampling of the input data. We demonstrated how these critical growth stages, which hold significant agronomic value, closely align with the existing literature in agronomy and crop development biology.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this work, we present a novel approach for general object segmentation from a monocular image, eliminating the need for manually labeled training data and enabling rapid, straightforward training and adaptation with minimal data. Our model initially learns from LiDAR during the training process, which is subsequently removed from the system, allowing it to function solely on monocular imagery. This study leverages the concept of the Stixel-World to recognize a medium level representation of its surroundings. Our network directly predicts a 2D multi-layer Stixel-World and is capable of recognizing and locating multiple, superimposed objects within an image. Due to the scarcity of comparable works, we have divided the capabilities into modules and present a free space detection in our experiments section. Furthermore, we introduce an improved method for generating Stixels from LiDAR data, which we use as ground truth for our network.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We discuss the use of angle of arrival (AoA) as an authentication measure in analog array multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. A base station equipped with an analog array authenticates users based on the AoA estimated from certified pilot transmissions, while active attackers manipulate their transmitted signals to mount impersonation attacks. We study several attacks of increasing intensity (captured through the availability of side information at the attackers) and assess the performance of AoA-based authentication using one-class classifiers. Our results show that some attack techniques with knowledge of the combiners at the verifier are effective in falsifying the AoA and compromising the security of the considered type of physical layer authentication.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Hashing functions, which are created to provide brief and erratic digests for the message entered, are the primary cryptographic primitives used in blockchain networks. Hashing is employed in blockchain networks to create linked block lists, which offer safe and secure distributed repository storage for critical information. Due to the unique nature of the hash search problem in blockchain networks, the most parallelization of calculations is possible. This technical report presents a performance evaluation of three popular hashing algorithms Blake3, SHA-256, and SHA-512. These hashing algorithms are widely used in various applications, such as digital signatures, message authentication, and password storage. It then discusses the performance metrics used to evaluate the algorithms, such as hash rate/throughput and memory usage. The evaluation is conducted on a range of hardware platforms, including desktop and VMs. The evaluation includes synthetic benchmarks. The results of the evaluation show that Blake3 generally outperforms both SHA-256 and SHA-512 in terms of throughput and latency. However, the performance advantage of Blake3 varies depending on the specific hardware platform and the size of the input data. The report concludes with recommendations for selecting the most suitable hashing algorithm for a given application, based on its performance requirements and security needs. The evaluation results can also inform future research and development efforts to improve the performance and security of hashing algorithms.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Training Large Language Models (LLMs) is memory-intensive due to the large number of parameters and associated optimization states. GaLore, a recent method, reduces memory usage by projecting weight gradients into a low-rank subspace without compromising performance. However, GaLore relies on time-consuming Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) operations to identify the subspace, and the frequent subspace updates lead to significant training time overhead. Moreover, GaLore offers minimal improvements in accuracy and efficiency compared to LoRA in more accessible fine-tuning scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce Q-Galore, a novel approach that substantially reduces memory usage by combining quantization and low-rank projection, surpassing the benefits of GaLore. Our method is based on two key observations: (i) the gradient subspace exhibits diverse properties, with some layers converging early in training while others are subject to frequent changes; (ii) the projection matrices are highly resilient to low-bit quantization. Leveraging these insights, Q-GaLore adaptively updates the gradient subspace based on its convergence statistics, achieving comparable performance while significantly reducing the number of SVD operations. We maintain the projection matrices in INT4 format and weights in INT8 format, incorporating stochastic rounding to capture accumulated gradient information. This approach enables a high-precision training trajectory using only low-precision weights. We demonstrate that Q-GaLore achieves highly competitive performance with exceptional memory efficiency. At pre-training, Q-GaLore facilitates training a LLaMA-7B model from scratch on a single NVIDIA RTX 4060 Ti with only 16 GB memory. At fine-tuning, it reduces memory consumption by up to 50% compared to LoRA and GaLore, while consistently outperforming QLoRA at the same memory cost.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) increasingly emphasize complex understanding of various visual elements, including multiple objects, text information, and spatial relations. Their development for comprehensive visual perception hinges on the availability of high-quality image-text datasets that offer diverse visual elements and throughout image descriptions. However, the scarcity of such hyper-detailed datasets currently hinders progress within the MLLM community. The bottleneck stems from the limited perceptual capabilities of current caption engines, which fall short in providing complete and accurate annotations. To facilitate the cutting-edge research of MLLMs on comprehensive vision perception, we thereby propose Perceptual Fusion, using a low-budget but highly effective caption engine for complete and accurate image descriptions. Specifically, Perceptual Fusion integrates diverse perception experts as image priors to provide explicit information on visual elements and adopts an efficient MLLM as a centric pivot to mimic advanced MLLMs' perception abilities. We carefully select 1M highly representative images from uncurated LAION dataset and generate dense descriptions using our engine, dubbed DenseFusion-1M. Extensive experiments validate that our engine outperforms its counterparts, where the resulting dataset significantly improves the perception and cognition abilities of existing MLLMs across diverse vision-language benchmarks, especially with high-resolution images as inputs.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, protect</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Radio Frequency fingerprinting enables a passive receiver to recognize and authenticate a transmitter without the need for cryptographic tools. Authentication is achieved by isolating specific features of the transmitted signal that are unique to the transmitter's hardware. Much research has focused on improving the effectiveness and efficiency of radio frequency fingerprinting to maximize its performance in various scenarios and conditions, while little research examined how to protect devices from being subject to radio fingerprinting in the wild. In this paper, we explore a novel point of view. We examine the hostile usage of radio frequency fingerprinting, which facilitates the unauthorized tracking of wireless devices in the field by malicious entities. We also suggest a method to sanitize the transmitted signal of its fingerprint using a jammer, deployed on purpose to improve devices' anonymity on the channel while still guaranteeing the link's quality of service. Our experimental results and subsequent analysis demonstrate that a friendly jammer can effectively block a malicious eavesdropper from recognizing and tracking a device without affecting the quality of the wireless link, thereby restoring the privacy of the user when accessing the radio spectrum.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we propose the Hierarchical Document Transformer (HDT), a novel sparse Transformer architecture tailored for structured hierarchical documents. Such documents are extremely important in numerous domains, including science, law or medicine. However, most existing solutions are inefficient and fail to make use of the structure inherent to documents. HDT exploits document structure by introducing auxiliary anchor tokens and redesigning the attention mechanism into a sparse multi-level hierarchy. This approach facilitates information exchange between tokens at different levels while maintaining sparsity, thereby enhancing computational and memory efficiency while exploiting the document structure as an inductive bias. We address the technical challenge of implementing HDT's sample-dependent hierarchical attention pattern by developing a novel sparse attention kernel that considers the hierarchical structure of documents. As demonstrated by our experiments, utilizing structural information present in documents leads to faster convergence, higher sample efficiency and better performance on downstream tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In federated learning (FL), the common paradigm that FedAvg proposes and most algorithms follow is that clients train local models with their private data, and the model parameters are shared for central aggregation, mostly averaging. In this paradigm, the communication cost is often a challenge, as modern massive neural networks can contain millions to billions parameters. We suggest that clients do not share model parameters but local data summaries, to decrease the cost of sharing. We develop a new algorithm FedLog with Bayesian inference, which shares only sufficient statistics of local data. FedLog transmits messages as small as the last layer of the original model. We conducted comprehensive experiments to show we outperform other FL algorithms that aim at decreasing the communication cost. To provide formal privacy guarantees, we further extend FedLog with differential privacy and show the trade-off between privacy budget and accuracy.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper proposes a deep feature extractor for iris recognition at arbitrary resolutions. Resolution degradation reduces the recognition performance of deep learning models trained by high-resolution images. Using various-resolution images for training can improve the model's robustness while sacrificing recognition performance for high-resolution images. To achieve higher recognition performance at various resolutions, we propose a method of resolution-adaptive feature extraction with automatically switching networks. Our framework includes resolution expert modules specialized for different resolution degradations, including down-sampling and out-of-focus blurring. The framework automatically switches them depending on the degradation condition of an input image. Lower-resolution experts are trained by knowledge-distillation from the high-resolution expert in such a manner that both experts can extract common identity features. We applied our framework to three conventional neural network models. The experimental results show that our method enhances the recognition performance at low-resolution in the conventional methods and also maintains their performance at high-resolution.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we propose an innovative Graphical User Interface (GUI) aimed at improving preoperative planning and intra-operative guidance for precise spinal screw placement through vertebrae segmentation. The methodology encompasses both front-end and back-end computations. The front end comprises a GUI that allows surgeons to precisely adjust the placement of screws on X-Ray images, thereby improving the simulation of surgical screw insertion in the patient's spine. On the other hand, the back-end processing involves several steps, including acquiring spinal X-ray images, performing pre-processing techniques to reduce noise, and training a neural network model to achieve real-time segmentation of the vertebrae. The integration of vertebral segmentation in the GUI ensures precise screw placement, reducing complications like nerve injury and ultimately improving surgical outcomes. The Spine-Vision provides a comprehensive solution with innovative features like synchronous AP-LP planning, accurate screw positioning via vertebrae segmentation, effective screw visualization, and dynamic position adjustments. This X-ray image-based GUI workflow emerges as a valuable tool, enhancing precision and safety in spinal screw placement and planning procedures.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose a new topological tool for computer vision - Scalar Function Topology Divergence (SFTD), which measures the dissimilarity of multi-scale topology between sublevel sets of two functions having a common domain. Functions can be defined on an undirected graph or Euclidean space of any dimensionality. Most of the existing methods for comparing topology are based on Wasserstein distance between persistence barcodes and they don't take into account the localization of topological features. On the other hand, the minimization of SFTD ensures that the corresponding topological features of scalar functions are located in the same places. The proposed tool provides useful visualizations depicting areas where functions have topological dissimilarities. We provide applications of the proposed method to 3D computer vision. In particular, experiments demonstrate that SFTD improves the reconstruction of cellular 3D shapes from 2D fluorescence microscopy images, and helps to identify topological errors in 3D segmentation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Efficient finetuning of vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP for specific downstream tasks is gaining significant attention. Previous works primarily focus on prompt learning to adapt the CLIP into a variety of downstream tasks, however, suffering from task overfitting when finetuned on a small data set. In this paper, we introduce an orthogonal finetuning method for efficiently updating pretrained weights which enhances robustness and generalization, while a cross-regularization strategy is further exploited to maintain the stability in terms of zero-shot generalization of VLMs, dubbed \textbf{\textit{OrthCR}}. Specifically, trainable orthogonal matrices are injected seamlessly into the transformer architecture and enforced with orthogonality constraint using Cayley parameterization, benefiting from the norm-preserving property and thus leading to stable and faster convergence. To alleviate deviation from orthogonal constraint during training, a cross-regularization strategy is further employed with initial pretrained weights within a bypass manner. In addition, to enrich the sample diversity for downstream tasks, we first explore Cutout data augmentation to boost the efficient finetuning and comprehend how our approach improves the specific downstream performance and maintains the generalizability in the perspective of Orthogonality Learning. Beyond existing prompt learning techniques, we conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that our method explicitly steers pretrained weight space to represent the task-specific knowledge and presents competitive generalizability under \textit{base-to-base/base-to-new}, \textit{cross-dataset transfer} and \textit{domain generalization} evaluations.</li>

          Diff-Tracker: Text-to-Image Diffusion Models are Unsupervised Trackers(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce Diff-Tracker, a novel approach for the challenging unsupervised visual tracking task leveraging the pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model. Our main idea is to leverage the rich knowledge encapsulated within the pre-trained diffusion model, such as the understanding of image semantics and structural information, to address unsupervised visual tracking. To this end, we design an initial prompt learner to enable the diffusion model to recognize the tracking target by learning a prompt representing the target. Furthermore, to facilitate dynamic adaptation of the prompt to the target's movements, we propose an online prompt updater. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, which also achieves state-of-the-art performance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Language models achieve impressive results in tasks involving complex multistep reasoning, but scaling these capabilities further traditionally requires expensive collection of more annotated data. In this work, we explore the potential of improving the capabilities of language models without new data, merely using automated feedback to the validity of their predictions in arithmetic reasoning (self-training). We find that models can substantially improve in both single-round (offline) and online self-training. In the offline setting, supervised methods are able to deliver gains comparable to preference optimization, but in online self-training, preference optimization shows to largely outperform supervised training thanks to superior stability and robustness on unseen types of problems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>There has been an unprecedented digitization drive in the industrial sector, especially in the maritime industry. The profusion of intelligent electronic devices and IOT-enabled cyber-physical systems (CPS) has helped in the efficient use of resources and increased convenience. CPS has enabled real-time remote command and control of industrial assets. Unlike the relatively isolated legacy systems, the intertwined nature of Information Technology(IT) and Operations Technology(OT) brought by Industry 4.0 has increased the complexity of the systems, thereby increasing the attack surface. This work explores the possible consequences of these attacks from a more holistic view, focusing on high-risk assets such as offshore oil rigs, offshore wind farms, and autonomous vessels. The attacks have become more aggressive with the proliferation of such technologies, disrupting the physical process, causing fire and explosion hazards, and endangering human life and environmental health. The possible attack scenarios, the attack vectors, and their physical consequences have been discussed from the perspective of personnel safety and health, along with known security breaches of such nature. To the best of the authors' knowledge, seldom has any work been done that accentuates the possible human and environmental impacts of such attacks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Attention-based models such as Transformers and recurrent models like state space models (SSMs) have emerged as successful methods for autoregressive sequence modeling. Although both enable parallel training, none enable parallel generation due to their autoregressiveness. We propose the variational SSM (VSSM), a variational autoencoder (VAE) where both the encoder and decoder are SSMs. Since sampling the latent variables and decoding them with the SSM can be parallelized, both training and generation can be conducted in parallel. Moreover, the decoder recurrence allows generation to be resumed without reprocessing the whole sequence. Finally, we propose the autoregressive VSSM that can be conditioned on a partial realization of the sequence, as is common in language generation tasks. Interestingly, the autoregressive VSSM still enables parallel generation. We highlight on toy problems (MNIST, CIFAR) the empirical gains in speed-up and show that it competes with traditional models in terms of generation quality (Transformer, Mamba SSM).</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Topic modeling is frequently being used for analysing large text corpora such as news articles or social media data. BERTopic, consisting of sentence embedding, dimension reduction, clustering, and topic extraction, is the newest and currently the SOTA topic modeling method. However, current topic modeling methods have room for improvement because, as unsupervised methods, they require careful tuning and selection of hyperparameters, e.g., for dimension reduction and clustering. This paper aims to analyse the technical application of BERTopic in practice. For this purpose, it compares and selects different methods and hyperparameters for each stage of BERTopic through density based clustering validation and six different topic coherence measures. Moreover, it also aims to analyse the results of topic modeling on real world data as a use case. For this purpose, the German fake news dataset (GermanFakeNCovid) on Covid-19 was created by us and in order to experiment with topic modeling in a multilingual (English and German) setting combined with the FakeCovid dataset. With the final results, we were able to determine thematic similarities between the United States and Germany. Whereas, distinguishing the topics of fake news from India proved to be more challenging.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we introduce PredBench, a benchmark tailored for the holistic evaluation of spatio-temporal prediction networks. Despite significant progress in this field, there remains a lack of a standardized framework for a detailed and comparative analysis of various prediction network architectures. PredBench addresses this gap by conducting large-scale experiments, upholding standardized and appropriate experimental settings, and implementing multi-dimensional evaluations. This benchmark integrates 12 widely adopted methods with 15 diverse datasets across multiple application domains, offering extensive evaluation of contemporary spatio-temporal prediction networks. Through meticulous calibration of prediction settings across various applications, PredBench ensures evaluations relevant to their intended use and enables fair comparisons. Moreover, its multi-dimensional evaluation framework broadens the analysis with a comprehensive set of metrics, providing deep insights into the capabilities of models.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>LLM app stores have seen rapid growth, leading to the proliferation of numerous custom LLM apps. However, this expansion raises security concerns. In this study, we propose a three-layer concern framework to identify the potential security risks of LLM apps, i.e., LLM apps with abusive potential, LLM apps with malicious intent, and LLM apps with exploitable vulnerabilities. Over five months, we collected 786,036 LLM apps from six major app stores: GPT Store, FlowGPT, Poe, Coze, Cici, and this http URL. Our research integrates static and dynamic analysis, the development of a large-scale toxic word dictionary (i.e., ToxicDict) comprising over 31,783 entries, and automated monitoring tools to identify and mitigate threats. We uncovered that 15,146 apps had misleading descriptions, 1,366 collected sensitive personal information against their privacy policies, and 15,996 generated harmful content such as hate speech, self-harm, extremism, etc. Additionally, we evaluated the potential for LLM apps to facilitate malicious activities, finding that 616 apps could be used for malware generation, phishing, etc. Our findings highlight the urgent need for robust regulatory frameworks and enhanced enforcement mechanisms.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Human video generation is a dynamic and rapidly evolving task that aims to synthesize 2D human body video sequences with generative models given control conditions such as text, audio, and pose. With the potential for wide-ranging applications in film, gaming, and virtual communication, the ability to generate natural and realistic human video is critical. Recent advancements in generative models have laid a solid foundation for the growing interest in this area. Despite the significant progress, the task of human video generation remains challenging due to the consistency of characters, the complexity of human motion, and difficulties in their relationship with the environment. This survey provides a comprehensive review of the current state of human video generation, marking, to the best of our knowledge, the first extensive literature review in this domain. We start with an introduction to the fundamentals of human video generation and the evolution of generative models that have facilitated the field's growth. We then examine the main methods employed for three key sub-tasks within human video generation: text-driven, audio-driven, and pose-driven motion generation. These areas are explored concerning the conditions that guide the generation process. Furthermore, we offer a collection of the most commonly utilized datasets and the evaluation metrics that are crucial in assessing the quality and realism of generated videos. The survey concludes with a discussion of the current challenges in the field and suggests possible directions for future research. The goal of this survey is to offer the research community a clear and holistic view of the advancements in human video generation, highlighting the milestones achieved and the challenges that lie ahead.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong instruction-following ability to be helpful, they are further supposed to be controlled and guided by rules in real-world scenarios to be safe, and accurate in responses. This demands the possession of rule-following capability of LLMs. However, few works have made a clear evaluation of the rule-following capability of LLMs. Previous studies that try to evaluate the rule-following capability of LLMs fail to distinguish the rule-following scenarios from the instruction-following scenarios. Therefore, this paper first makes a clarification of the concept of rule-following, and curates a comprehensive benchmark, RuleBench, to evaluate a diversified range of rule-following abilities. Our experimental results on a variety of LLMs show that they are still limited in following rules. Our further analysis provides insights into the improvements for LLMs toward a better rule-following intelligent agent.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, fair, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence, demonstrating remarkable computational power and linguistic capabilities. However, these models are inherently prone to various biases stemming from their training data. These include selection, linguistic, and confirmation biases, along with common stereotypes related to gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, socioeconomic status, disability, and age. This study explores the presence of these biases within the responses given by the most recent LLMs, analyzing the impact on their fairness and reliability. We also investigate how known prompt engineering techniques can be exploited to effectively reveal hidden biases of LLMs, testing their adversarial robustness against jailbreak prompts specially crafted for bias elicitation. Extensive experiments are conducted using the most widespread LLMs at different scales, confirming that LLMs can still be manipulated to produce biased or inappropriate responses, despite their advanced capabilities and sophisticated alignment processes. Our findings underscore the importance of enhancing mitigation techniques to address these safety issues, toward a more sustainable and inclusive artificial intelligence.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While the field of 3D scene reconstruction is dominated by NeRFs due to their photorealistic quality, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged, offering similar quality with real-time rendering speeds. However, both methods primarily excel with well-controlled 3D scenes, while in-the-wild data - characterized by occlusions, dynamic objects, and varying illumination - remains challenging. NeRFs can adapt to such conditions easily through per-image embedding vectors, but 3DGS struggles due to its explicit representation and lack of shared parameters. To address this, we introduce WildGaussians, a novel approach to handle occlusions and appearance changes with 3DGS. By leveraging robust DINO features and integrating an appearance modeling module within 3DGS, our method achieves state-of-the-art results. We demonstrate that WildGaussians matches the real-time rendering speed of 3DGS while surpassing both 3DGS and NeRF baselines in handling in-the-wild data, all within a simple architectural framework.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>How to efficiently serve Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a pressing issue because of their huge computational cost in their autoregressive generation process. To mitigate computational costs, LLMs often employ the KV Cache technique to improve the generation speed. While improving the computational efficiency, the storage requirements of the KV cache are substantial, particularly in long-context scenarios, leading to significant memory consumption. Existing KV cache eviction methods often degrade the performance of LLMs in long-context scenarios due to the information loss introduced by eviction. In this paper, we propose a novel KV cache merging approach, called KVMerger, to achieve adaptive KV cache compression for long-context tasks without significant performance degradation under constrained memory budgets. Our approach is inspired by the intriguing observation that key states exhibit high similarity at the token level within a single sequence. To facilitate merging, we develop an effective yet straightforward merging set identification algorithm to identify suitable KV states for merging. Our merging set identification algorithm stimulates the second observation that KV cache sparsity, from similarity perspective, is independent of the dataset and remains persistent at the model level. Subsequently, we propose a Gaussian kernel weighted merging algorithm to selectively merge all states within each merging set. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of KVMerger for long-context tasks under constrained memory budgets, applying it to models including Llama2-7B-chat and Llama2-13B-chat. Using the LongBench and ZeroScroll benchmarks, we compare our method with other KV cache compression techniques, including H2O and CaM, showing that our method achieves superior performance across tasks with both 50% and 35% KV cache budgets.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Implicit Neural Representation (INR) has become a popular method for representing visual signals (e.g., 2D images and 3D scenes), demonstrating promising results in various downstream applications. Given its potential as a medium for visual signals, exploring the development of a neural blending method that utilizes INRs is a natural progression. Neural blending involves merging two INRs to create a new INR that encapsulates information from both original representations. A direct approach involves applying traditional image editing methods to the INR rendering process. However, this method often results in blending distortions, artifacts, and color shifts, primarily due to the discretization of the underlying pixel grid and the introduction of boundary conditions for solving variational problems. To tackle this issue, we introduce the Neural Poisson Solver, a plug-and-play and universally applicable framework across different signal dimensions for blending visual signals represented by INRs. Our Neural Poisson Solver offers a variational problem-solving approach based on the continuous Poisson equation, demonstrating exceptional performance across various domains. Specifically, we propose a gradient-guided neural solver to represent the solution process of the variational problem, refining the target signal to achieve natural blending results. We also develop a Poisson equation-based loss and optimization scheme to train our solver, ensuring it effectively blends the input INR scenes while preserving their inherent structure and semantic content. The lack of dependence on additional prior knowledge makes our method easily adaptable to various task categories, highlighting its versatility. Comprehensive experimental results validate the robustness of our approach across multiple dimensions and blending tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The impressive advancements in semi-supervised learning have driven researchers to explore its potential in object detection tasks within the field of computer vision. Semi-Supervised Object Detection (SSOD) leverages a combination of a small labeled dataset and a larger, unlabeled dataset. This approach effectively reduces the dependence on large labeled datasets, which are often expensive and time-consuming to obtain. Initially, SSOD models encountered challenges in effectively leveraging unlabeled data and managing noise in generated pseudo-labels for unlabeled data. However, numerous recent advancements have addressed these issues, resulting in substantial improvements in SSOD performance. This paper presents a comprehensive review of 27 cutting-edge developments in SSOD methodologies, from Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to Transformers. We delve into the core components of semi-supervised learning and its integration into object detection frameworks, covering data augmentation techniques, pseudo-labeling strategies, consistency regularization, and adversarial training methods. Furthermore, we conduct a comparative analysis of various SSOD models, evaluating their performance and architectural differences. We aim to ignite further research interest in overcoming existing challenges and exploring new directions in semi-supervised learning for object detection.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, protect, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated Learning (FL) can protect the privacy of the vehicles in vehicle edge computing (VEC) to a certain extent through sharing the gradients of vehicles' local models instead of local data. The gradients of vehicles' local models are usually large for the vehicular artificial intelligence (AI) applications, thus transmitting such large gradients would cause large per-round latency. Gradient quantization has been proposed as one effective approach to reduce the per-round latency in FL enabled VEC through compressing gradients and reducing the number of bits, i.e., the quantization level, to transmit gradients. The selection of quantization level and thresholds determines the quantization error, which further affects the model accuracy and training time. To do so, the total training time and quantization error (QE) become two key metrics for the FL enabled VEC. It is critical to jointly optimize the total training time and QE for the FL enabled VEC. However, the time-varying channel condition causes more challenges to solve this problem. In this paper, we propose a distributed deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based quantization level allocation scheme to optimize the long-term reward in terms of the total training time and QE. Extensive simulations identify the optimal weighted factors between the total training time and QE, and demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed scheme.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This research presents an enhanced approach for precise segmentation of brain tumor masses in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using an advanced 3D-UNet model combined with a Context Transformer (CoT). By architectural expansion CoT, the proposed model extends its architecture to a 3D format, integrates it smoothly with the base model to utilize the complex contextual information found in MRI scans, emphasizing how elements rely on each other across an extended spatial range. The proposed model synchronizes tumor mass characteristics from CoT, mutually reinforcing feature extraction, facilitating the precise capture of detailed tumor mass structures, including location, size, and boundaries. Several experimental results present the outstanding segmentation performance of the proposed method in comparison to current state-of-the-art approaches, achieving Dice score of 82.0%, 81.5%, 89.0% for Enhancing Tumor, Tumor Core and Whole Tumor, respectively, on BraTS2019.</li>

          Investigating Public Fine-Tuning Datasets: A Complex Review of Current Practices from a Construction Perspective(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the rapid development of the large model domain, research related to fine-tuning has concurrently seen significant advancement, given that fine-tuning is a constituent part of the training process for large-scale models. Data engineering plays a fundamental role in the training process of models, which includes data infrastructure, data processing, etc. Data during fine-tuning likewise forms the base for large models. In order to embrace the power and explore new possibilities of fine-tuning datasets, this paper reviews current public fine-tuning datasets from the perspective of data construction. An overview of public fine-tuning datasets from two sides: evolution and taxonomy, is provided in this review, aiming to chart the development trajectory. Construction techniques and methods for public fine-tuning datasets of Large Language Models (LLMs), including data generation and data augmentation among others, are detailed. This elaboration follows the aforementioned taxonomy, specifically across demonstration, comparison, and generalist categories. Additionally, a category tree of data generation techniques has been abstracted in our review to assist researchers in gaining a deeper understanding of fine-tuning datasets from the construction dimension. Our review also summarizes the construction features in different data preparation phases of current practices in this field, aiming to provide a comprehensive overview and inform future research. Fine-tuning dataset practices, encompassing various data modalities, are also discussed from a construction perspective in our review. Towards the end of the article, we offer insights and considerations regarding the future construction and developments of fine-tuning datasets.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce VideoMamba, a novel adaptation of the pure Mamba architecture, specifically designed for video recognition. Unlike transformers that rely on self-attention mechanisms leading to high computational costs by quadratic complexity, VideoMamba leverages Mamba's linear complexity and selective SSM mechanism for more efficient processing. The proposed Spatio-Temporal Forward and Backward SSM allows the model to effectively capture the complex relationship between non-sequential spatial and sequential temporal information in video. Consequently, VideoMamba is not only resource-efficient but also effective in capturing long-range dependency in videos, demonstrated by competitive performance and outstanding efficiency on a variety of video understanding benchmarks. Our work highlights the potential of VideoMamba as a powerful tool for video understanding, offering a simple yet effective baseline for future research in video analysis.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Battery-free sensor tags are devices that leverage backscatter techniques to communicate with standard IoT devices, thereby augmenting a network's sensing capabilities in a scalable way. For communicating, a sensor tag relies on an unmodulated carrier provided by a neighboring IoT device, with a schedule coordinating this provisioning across the network. Carrier scheduling--computing schedules to interrogate all sensor tags while minimizing energy, spectrum utilization, and latency--is an NP-Hard optimization problem. Recent work introduces learning-based schedulers that achieve resource savings over a carefully-crafted heuristic, generalizing to networks of up to 60 nodes. However, we find that their advantage diminishes in networks with hundreds of nodes, and degrades further in larger setups. This paper introduces RobustGANTT, a GNN-based scheduler that improves generalization (without re-training) to networks up to 1000 nodes (100x training topology sizes). RobustGANTT not only achieves better and more consistent generalization, but also computes schedules requiring up to 2x less resources than existing systems. Our scheduler exhibits average runtimes of hundreds of milliseconds, allowing it to react fast to changing network conditions. Our work not only improves resource utilization in large-scale backscatter networks, but also offers valuable insights in learning-based scheduling.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper introduces the point-axis representation for oriented object detection, emphasizing its flexibility and geometrically intuitive nature with two key components: points and axes. 1) Points delineate the spatial extent and contours of objects, providing detailed shape descriptions. 2) Axes define the primary directionalities of objects, providing essential orientation cues crucial for precise detection. The point-axis representation decouples location and rotation, addressing the loss discontinuity issues commonly encountered in traditional bounding box-based approaches. For effective optimization without introducing additional annotations, we propose the max-projection loss to supervise point set learning and the cross-axis loss for robust axis representation learning. Further, leveraging this representation, we present the Oriented DETR model, seamlessly integrating the DETR framework for precise point-axis prediction and end-to-end detection. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements in oriented object detection tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Instruction-finetuned Large Language Models exhibit unprecedented Natural Language Understanding capabilities. Recent work has been exploring political biases and political reasoning capabilities in LLMs, mainly scoped in the US context. In light of the recent 2024 European Parliament elections, we are investigating if LLMs can be used as Voting Advice Applications (VAAs). We audit MISTRAL and MIXTRAL models and evaluate their accuracy in predicting the stance of political parties based on the latest "EU and I" voting assistance questionnaire. Furthermore, we explore alternatives to improve models' performance by augmenting the input context via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) relying on web search, and Self-Reflection using staged conversations that aim to re-collect relevant content from the model's internal memory. We find that MIXTRAL is highly accurate with an 82% accuracy on average. Augmenting the input context with expert-curated information can lead to a significant boost of approx. 9%, which remains an open challenge for automated approaches.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The Retinex theory models the image as a product of illumination and reflection components, which has received extensive attention and is widely used in image enhancement, segmentation and color restoration. However, it has been rarely used in additive noise removal due to the inclusion of both multiplication and addition operations in the Retinex noisy image modeling. In this paper, we propose an exponential Retinex decomposition model based on hybrid non-convex regularization and weak space oscillation-modeling for image denoising. The proposed model utilizes non-convex first-order total variation (TV) and non-convex second-order TV to regularize the reflection component and the illumination component, respectively, and employs weak $H^{-1}$ norm to measure the residual component. By utilizing different regularizers, the proposed model effectively decomposes the image into reflection, illumination, and noise components. An alternating direction multipliers method (ADMM) combined with the Majorize-Minimization (MM) algorithm is developed to solve the proposed model. Furthermore, we provide a detailed proof of the convergence property of the algorithm. Numerical experiments validate both the proposed model and algorithm. Compared with several state-of-the-art denoising models, the proposed model exhibits superior performance in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and mean structural similarity (MSSIM).</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Continuous-Time Dynamic Graph (CTDG) precisely models evolving real-world relationships, drawing heightened interest in dynamic graph learning across academia and industry. However, existing CTDG models encounter challenges stemming from noise and limited historical data. Graph Data Augmentation (GDA) emerges as a critical solution, yet current approaches primarily focus on static graphs and struggle to effectively address the dynamics inherent in CTDGs. Moreover, these methods often demand substantial domain expertise for parameter tuning and lack theoretical guarantees for augmentation efficacy. To address these issues, we propose Conda, a novel latent diffusion-based GDA method tailored for CTDGs. Conda features a sandwich-like architecture, incorporating a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) and a conditional diffusion model, aimed at generating enhanced historical neighbor embeddings for target nodes. Unlike conventional diffusion models trained on entire graphs via pre-training, Conda requires historical neighbor sequence embeddings of target nodes for training, thus facilitating more targeted augmentation. We integrate Conda into the CTDG model and adopt an alternating training strategy to optimize performance. Extensive experimentation across six widely used real-world datasets showcases the consistent performance improvement of our approach, particularly in scenarios with limited historical data.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Facial video-based remote physiological measurement is a promising research area for detecting human vital signs (e.g., heart rate, respiration frequency) in a non-contact way. Conventional approaches are mostly supervised learning, requiring extensive collections of facial videos and synchronously recorded photoplethysmography (PPG) signals. To tackle it, self-supervised learning has recently gained attentions; due to the lack of ground truth PPG signals, its performance is however limited. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised framework that successfully integrates the popular vision-language models (VLMs) into the remote physiological measurement task. Given a facial video, we first augment its positive and negative video samples with varying rPPG signal frequencies. Next, we introduce a frequency-oriented vision-text pair generation method by carefully creating contrastive spatio-temporal maps from positive and negative samples and designing proper text prompts to describe their relative ratios of signal frequencies. A pre-trained VLM is employed to extract features for these formed vision-text pairs and estimate rPPG signals thereafter. We develop a series of generative and contrastive learning mechanisms to optimize the VLM, including the text-guided visual map reconstruction task, the vision-text contrastive learning task, and the frequency contrastive and ranking task. Overall, our method for the first time adapts VLMs to digest and align the frequency-related knowledge in vision and text modalities. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that it significantly outperforms state of the art self-supervised methods.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we show different fine-tuning methods for Stable Diffusion XL; this includes inference steps, and caption customization for each image to align with generating images in the style of a commercial 2D icon training set. We also show how important it is to properly define what "high-quality" really is especially for a commercial-use environment. As generative AI models continue to gain widespread acceptance and usage, there emerge many different ways to optimize and evaluate them for various applications. Specifically text-to-image models, such as Stable Diffusion XL and DALL-E 3 require distinct evaluation practices to effectively generate high-quality icons according to a specific style. Although some images that are generated based on a certain style may have a lower FID score (better), we show how this is not absolute in and of itself even for rasterized icons. While FID scores reflect the similarity of generated images to the overall training set, CLIP scores measure the alignment between generated images and their textual descriptions. We show how FID scores miss significant aspects, such as the minority of pixel differences that matter most in an icon, while CLIP scores result in misjudging the quality of icons. The CLIP model's understanding of "similarity" is shaped by its own training data; which does not account for feature variation in our style of choice. Our findings highlight the need for specialized evaluation metrics and fine-tuning approaches when generating high-quality commercial icons, potentially leading to more effective and tailored applications of text-to-image models in professional design contexts.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, attack, steal</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Face recognition pipelines have been widely deployed in various mission-critical systems in trust, equitable and responsible AI applications. However, the emergence of adversarial attacks has threatened the security of the entire recognition pipeline. Despite the sheer number of attack methods proposed for crafting adversarial examples in both digital and physical forms, it is never an easy task to assess the real threat level of different attacks and obtain useful insight into the key risks confronted by face recognition systems. Traditional attacks view imperceptibility as the most important measurement to keep perturbations stealthy, while we suspect that industry professionals may possess a different opinion. In this paper, we delve into measuring the threat brought about by adversarial attacks from the perspectives of the industry and the applications of face recognition. In contrast to widely studied sophisticated attacks in the field, we propose an effective yet easy-to-launch physical adversarial attack, named AdvColor, against black-box face recognition pipelines in the physical world. AdvColor fools models in the recognition pipeline via directly supplying printed photos of human faces to the system under adversarial illuminations. Experimental results show that physical AdvColor examples can achieve a fooling rate of more than 96% against the anti-spoofing model and an overall attack success rate of 88% against the face recognition pipeline. We also conduct a survey on the threats of prevailing adversarial attacks, including AdvColor, to understand the gap between the machine-measured and human-assessed threat levels of different forms of adversarial attacks. The survey results surprisingly indicate that, compared to deliberately launched imperceptible attacks, perceptible but accessible attacks pose more lethal threats to real-world commercial systems of face recognition.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While recent vision-and-language models (VLMs) like CLIP are a powerful tool for analyzing text and images in a shared semantic space, they do not explicitly model the hierarchical nature of the set of texts which may describe an image. Conversely, existing multimodal hierarchical representation learning methods require costly training from scratch, failing to leverage the knowledge encoded by state-of-the-art multimodal foundation models. In this work, we study the knowledge of existing foundation models, finding that they exhibit emergent understanding of visual-semantic hierarchies despite not being directly trained for this purpose. We propose the Radial Embedding (RE) framework for probing and optimizing hierarchical understanding, and contribute the HierarCaps dataset, a benchmark facilitating the study of hierarchical knowledge in image--text representations, constructed automatically via large language models. Our results show that foundation VLMs exhibit zero-shot hierarchical understanding, surpassing the performance of prior models explicitly designed for this purpose. Furthermore, we show that foundation models may be better aligned to hierarchical reasoning via a text-only fine-tuning phase, while retaining pretraining knowledge.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Bird's-eye-view (BEV) representation is crucial for the perception function in autonomous driving tasks. It is difficult to balance the accuracy, efficiency and range of BEV representation. The existing works are restricted to a limited perception range within 50 meters. Extending the BEV representation range can greatly benefit downstream tasks such as topology reasoning, scene understanding, and planning by offering more comprehensive information and reaction time. The Standard-Definition (SD) navigation maps can provide a lightweight representation of road structure topology, characterized by ease of acquisition and low maintenance costs. An intuitive idea is to combine the close-range visual information from onboard cameras with the beyond line-of-sight (BLOS) environmental priors from SD maps to realize expanded perceptual capabilities. In this paper, we propose BLOS-BEV, a novel BEV segmentation model that incorporates SD maps for accurate beyond line-of-sight perception, up to 200m. Our approach is applicable to common BEV architectures and can achieve excellent results by incorporating information derived from SD maps. We explore various feature fusion schemes to effectively integrate the visual BEV representations and semantic features from the SD map, aiming to leverage the complementary information from both sources optimally. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in BEV segmentation on nuScenes and Argoverse benchmark. Through multi-modal inputs, BEV segmentation is significantly enhanced at close ranges below 50m, while also demonstrating superior performance in long-range scenarios, surpassing other methods by over 20% mIoU at distances ranging from 50-200m.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, privacy, protect, defense, attack, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Spatiotemporal federated learning has recently raised intensive studies due to its ability to train valuable models with only shared gradients in various location-based services. On the other hand, recent studies have shown that shared gradients may be subject to gradient inversion attacks (GIA) on images or texts. However, so far there has not been any systematic study of the gradient inversion attacks in spatiotemporal federated learning. In this paper, we explore the gradient attack problem in spatiotemporal federated learning from attack and defense perspectives. To understand privacy risks in spatiotemporal federated learning, we first propose Spatiotemporal Gradient Inversion Attack (ST-GIA), a gradient attack algorithm tailored to spatiotemporal data that successfully reconstructs the original location from gradients. Furthermore, we design an adaptive defense strategy to mitigate gradient inversion attacks in spatiotemporal federated learning. By dynamically adjusting the perturbation levels, we can offer tailored protection for varying rounds of training data, thereby achieving a better trade-off between privacy and utility than current state-of-the-art methods. Through intensive experimental analysis on three real-world datasets, we reveal that the proposed defense strategy can well preserve the utility of spatiotemporal federated learning with effective security protection.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, attack, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Nowadays, the open-source software (OSS) ecosystem suffers from security threats of software supply chain (SSC) attacks. Interpreted OSS malware plays a vital role in SSC attacks, as criminals have an arsenal of attack vectors to deceive users into installing malware and executing malicious activities. In this paper, we introduce tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) proposed by MITRE ATT\&CK into the interpreted malware analysis to characterize different phases of an attack lifecycle. Specifically, we propose GENTTP, a zero-shot approach to extracting a TTP of an interpreted malware package. GENTTP leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate a TTP, where the input is a malicious package, and the output is a deceptive tactic and an execution tactic of attack vectors. To validate the effectiveness of GENTTP, we collect two datasets for evaluation: a dataset with ground truth labels and a large dataset in the wild. Experimental results show that GENTTP can generate TTPs with high accuracy and efficiency. To demonstrate GENTTP's benefits, we build an LLM-based Chatbot from 3,700+ PyPI malware's TTPs. We further conduct a quantitative analysis of malware's TTPs at a large scale. Our main findings include: (1) many OSS malicious packages share a relatively stable TTP, even with the increasing emergence of malware and attack campaigns, (2) a TTP reflects characteristics of a malware-based attack, and (3) an attacker's intent behind the malware is linked to a TTP.</li>

However, since AD is heterogeneous and has multiple subtypes, the pathological mechanism of AD remains not fully understood and may vary from patient to patient. Due to the lack of such understanding, it is difficult to comprehensively and effectively assess the saliency map of AD classifier. In this paper, we utilize the anatomical segmentation to allocate saliency values into different brain regions. By plotting the distributions of saliency maps corresponding to AD and NC (Normal Control), we can gain a comprehensive view of the model's decisions process. In order to leverage the fact that the brain volume shrinkage happens in AD patients during disease progression, we define a new evaluation metric, brain volume change score (VCS), by computing the average Pearson correlation of the brain volume changes and the saliency values of a model in different brain regions for each patient. Thus, the VCS metric can help us gain some knowledge of how saliency maps resulting from different models relate to the changes of the volumes across different regions in the whole brain. We trained candidate models on the ADNI dataset and tested on three different datasets. Our results indicate: (i) models with higher VCSs tend to demonstrate saliency maps with more details relevant to the AD pathology, (ii) using gradient-based adversarial training strategies such as FGSM and stochastic masking can improve the VCSs of the models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present MELLE, a novel continuous-valued tokens based language modeling approach for text to speech synthesis (TTS). MELLE autoregressively generates continuous mel-spectrogram frames directly from text condition, bypassing the need for vector quantization, which are originally designed for audio compression and sacrifice fidelity compared to mel-spectrograms. Specifically, (i) instead of cross-entropy loss, we apply regression loss with a proposed spectrogram flux loss function to model the probability distribution of the continuous-valued tokens. (ii) we have incorporated variational inference into MELLE to facilitate sampling mechanisms, thereby enhancing the output diversity and model robustness. Experiments demonstrate that, compared to the two-stage codec language models VALL-E and its variants, the single-stage MELLE mitigates robustness issues by avoiding the inherent flaws of sampling discrete codes, achieves superior performance across multiple metrics, and, most importantly, offers a more streamlined paradigm.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Robust localization is the cornerstone of autonomous driving, especially in challenging urban environments where GPS signals suffer from multipath errors. Traditional localization approaches rely on high-definition (HD) maps, which consist of precisely annotated landmarks. However, building HD map is expensive and challenging to scale up. Given these limitations, leveraging navigation maps has emerged as a promising low-cost alternative for localization. Current approaches based on navigation maps can achieve highly accurate localization, but their complex matching strategies lead to unacceptable inference latency that fails to meet the real-time demands. To address these limitations, we propose a novel transformer-based neural re-localization method. Inspired by image registration, our approach performs a coarse-to-fine neural feature registration between navigation map and visual bird's-eye view features. Our method significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art OrienterNet on both the nuScenes and Argoverse datasets, which is nearly 10%/20% localization accuracy and 30/16 FPS improvement on single-view and surround-view input settings, separately. We highlight that our research presents an HD-map-free localization method for autonomous driving, offering cost-effective, reliable, and scalable performance in challenging driving environments.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The unsupervised 3D object detection is to accurately detect objects in unstructured environments with no explicit supervisory signals. This task, given sparse LiDAR point clouds, often results in compromised performance for detecting distant or small objects due to the inherent sparsity and limited spatial resolution. In this paper, we are among the early attempts to integrate LiDAR data with 2D images for unsupervised 3D detection and introduce a new method, dubbed LiDAR-2D Self-paced Learning (LiSe). We argue that RGB images serve as a valuable complement to LiDAR data, offering precise 2D localization cues, particularly when scarce LiDAR points are available for certain objects. Considering the unique characteristics of both modalities, our framework devises a self-paced learning pipeline that incorporates adaptive sampling and weak model aggregation strategies. The adaptive sampling strategy dynamically tunes the distribution of pseudo labels during training, countering the tendency of models to overfit easily detected samples, such as nearby and large-sized objects. By doing so, it ensures a balanced learning trajectory across varying object scales and distances. The weak model aggregation component consolidates the strengths of models trained under different pseudo label distributions, culminating in a robust and powerful final model. Experimental evaluations validate the efficacy of our proposed LiSe method, manifesting significant improvements of +7.1% AP$_{BEV}$ and +3.4% AP$_{3D}$ on nuScenes, and +8.3% AP$_{BEV}$ and +7.4% AP$_{3D}$ on Lyft compared to existing techniques.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>defense, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Skeletal motion plays a pivotal role in human activity recognition (HAR). Recently, attack methods have been proposed to identify the universal vulnerability of skeleton-based HAR(S-HAR). However, the research of adversarial transferability on S-HAR is largely missing. More importantly, existing attacks all struggle in transfer across unknown S-HAR models. We observed that the key reason is that the loss landscape of the action recognizers is rugged and sharp. Given the established correlation in prior studies~\cite{qin2022boosting,wu2020towards} between loss landscape and adversarial transferability, we assume and empirically validate that smoothing the loss landscape could potentially improve adversarial transferability on S-HAR. This is achieved by proposing a new post-train Dual Bayesian strategy, which can effectively explore the model posterior space for a collection of surrogates without the need for re-training. Furthermore, to craft adversarial examples along the motion manifold, we incorporate the attack gradient with information of the motion dynamics in a Bayesian manner. Evaluated on benchmark datasets, e.g. HDM05 and NTU 60, the average transfer success rate can reach as high as 35.9\% and 45.5\% respectively. In comparison, current state-of-the-art skeletal attacks achieve only 3.6\% and 9.8\%. The high adversarial transferability remains consistent across various surrogate, victim, and even defense models. Through a comprehensive analysis of the results, we provide insights on what surrogates are more likely to exhibit transferability, to shed light on future research.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities across various fields, hallucination remains a significant challenge. Recent studies have explored hallucinations through the lens of internal representations, proposing mechanisms to decipher LLMs' adherence to facts. However, these approaches often fail to generalize to out-of-distribution data, leading to concerns about whether internal representation patterns reflect fundamental factual awareness, or only overfit spurious correlations on the specific datasets. In this work, we investigate whether a universal truthfulness hyperplane that distinguishes the model's factually correct and incorrect outputs exists within the model. To this end, we scale up the number of training datasets and conduct an extensive evaluation -- we train the truthfulness hyperplane on a diverse collection of over 40 datasets and examine its cross-task, cross-domain, and in-domain generalization. Our results indicate that increasing the diversity of the training datasets significantly enhances the performance in all scenarios, while the volume of data samples plays a less critical role. This finding supports the optimistic hypothesis that a universal truthfulness hyperplane may indeed exist within the model, offering promising directions for future research.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Attention, as a core layer of the ubiquitous Transformer architecture, is the bottleneck for large language models and long-context applications. FlashAttention elaborated an approach to speed up attention on GPUs through minimizing memory reads/writes. However, it has yet to take advantage of new capabilities present in recent hardware, with FlashAttention-2 achieving only 35% utilization on the H100 GPU. We develop three main techniques to speed up attention on Hopper GPUs: exploiting asynchrony of the Tensor Cores and TMA to (1) overlap overall computation and data movement via warp-specialization and (2) interleave block-wise matmul and softmax operations, and (3) block quantization and incoherent processing that leverages hardware support for FP8 low-precision. We demonstrate that our method, FlashAttention-3, achieves speedup on H100 GPUs by 1.5-2.0$\times$ with FP16 reaching up to 740 TFLOPs/s (75% utilization), and with FP8 reaching close to 1.2 PFLOPs/s. We validate that FP8 FlashAttention-3 achieves 2.6$\times$ lower numerical error than a baseline FP8 attention.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper delves into the text processing aspects of Language Computing, which enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. Focusing on tasks such as speech recognition, machine translation, sentiment analysis, text summarization, and language modelling, language computing integrates disciplines including linguistics, computer science, and cognitive psychology to create meaningful human-computer interactions. Recent advancements in deep learning have made computers more accessible and capable of independent learning and adaptation. In examining the landscape of language computing, the paper emphasises foundational work like encoding, where Tamil transitioned from ASCII to Unicode, enhancing digital communication. It discusses the development of computational resources, including raw data, dictionaries, glossaries, annotated data, and computational grammars, necessary for effective language processing. The challenges of linguistic annotation, the creation of treebanks, and the training of large language models are also covered, emphasising the need for high-quality, annotated data and advanced language models. The paper underscores the importance of building practical applications for languages like Tamil to address everyday communication needs, highlighting gaps in current technology. It calls for increased research collaboration, digitization of historical texts, and fostering digital usage to ensure the comprehensive development of Tamil language processing, ultimately enhancing global communication and access to digital services.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The advancement in computational power and hardware efficiency has enabled the tackling of increasingly complex and high-dimensional problems. While artificial intelligence (AI) has achieved remarkable results in various scientific and technological fields, the interpretability of these high-dimensional solutions remains challenging. A critical issue in this context is the comparison of multidimensional quantities, which is essential in techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), and k-means clustering. Common metrics such as cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, and Manhattan distance are often used for such comparisons - for example in muscular synergies of the human motor control system. However, their applicability and interpretability diminish as dimensionality increases. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the effects of dimensionality on these three widely used metrics. Our results reveal significant limitations of cosine similarity, particularly its dependency on the dimensionality of the vectors, leading to biased and less interpretable outcomes. To address this, we introduce the Dimension Insensitive Euclidean Metric (DIEM), derived from the Euclidean distance, which demonstrates superior robustness and generalizability across varying dimensions. DIEM maintains consistent variability and eliminates the biases observed in traditional metrics, making it a more reliable tool for high-dimensional comparisons. This novel metric has the potential to replace cosine similarity, providing a more accurate and insightful method to analyze multidimensional data in fields ranging from neuromotor control to machine learning and deep learning.</li>

In this framework, we represent each robot design as a grammar and leverage the capabilities of LLMs to navigate the extensive robot design space, which is traditionally time-consuming and computationally demanding. By integrating automatic prompt design and a reinforcement learning based control algorithm, RoboMorph iteratively improves robot designs through feedback loops. Our experimental results demonstrate that RoboMorph can successfully generate nontrivial robots that are optimized for a single terrain while showcasing improvements in morphology over successive evolutions. Our approach demonstrates the potential of using LLMs for data-driven and modular robot design, providing a promising methodology that can be extended to other domains with similar design frameworks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recently, decentralized learning has emerged as a popular peer-to-peer signal and information processing paradigm that enables model training across geographically distributed agents in a scalable manner, without the presence of any central server. When some of the agents are malicious (also termed as Byzantine), resilient decentralized learning algorithms are able to limit the impact of these Byzantine agents without knowing their number and identities, and have guaranteed optimization errors. However, analysis of the generalization errors, which are critical to implementations of the trained models, is still lacking. In this paper, we provide the first analysis of the generalization errors for a class of popular Byzantine-resilient decentralized stochastic gradient descent (DSGD) algorithms. Our theoretical results reveal that the generalization errors cannot be entirely eliminated because of the presence of the Byzantine agents, even if the number of training samples are infinitely large. Numerical experiments are conducted to confirm our theoretical results.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this perspective paper, we introduce the concept of Specialized Generalist Artificial Intelligence (SGAI or simply SGI) as a crucial milestone toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Compared to directly scaling general abilities, SGI is defined as AI that specializes in at least one task, surpassing human experts, while also retaining general abilities. This fusion path enables SGI to rapidly achieve high-value areas. We categorize SGI into three stages based on the level of mastery over professional skills and generality performance. Additionally, we discuss the necessity of SGI in addressing issues associated with large language models, such as their insufficient generality, specialized capabilities, uncertainty in innovation, and practical applications. Furthermore, we propose a conceptual framework for developing SGI that integrates the strengths of Systems 1 and 2 cognitive processing. This framework comprises three layers and four key components, which focus on enhancing individual abilities and facilitating collaborative evolution. We conclude by summarizing the potential challenges and suggesting future directions. We hope that the proposed SGI will provide insights into further research and applications towards achieving AGI.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multimodal AI has demonstrated superior performance over unimodal approaches by leveraging diverse data sources for more comprehensive analysis. However, applying this effectiveness in healthcare is challenging due to the limited availability of public datasets. Federated learning presents an exciting solution, allowing the use of extensive databases from hospitals and health centers without centralizing sensitive data, thus maintaining privacy and security. Yet, research in multimodal federated learning, particularly in scenarios with missing modalities a common issue in healthcare datasets remains scarce, highlighting a critical area for future exploration. Toward this, we propose a novel method for multimodal federated learning with missing modalities. Our contribution lies in a novel cross-modal data augmentation by retrieval, leveraging the small publicly available dataset to fill the missing modalities in the clients. Our method learns the parameters in a federated manner, ensuring privacy protection and improving performance in multiple challenging multimodal benchmarks in the medical domain, surpassing several competitive baselines.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, security</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Blockchain sharding improves the scalability of blockchain systems by partitioning the whole blockchain state, nodes, and transaction workloads into different shards. However, existing blockchain sharding systems generally suffer from a small number of shards, resulting in limited concurrency. The main reason is that existing sharding systems require large shard sizes to ensure security. To enhance the concurrency of blockchain sharding securely, we propose SpiralShard. The intuition is to allow the existence of some shards with a larger fraction of malicious nodes (i.e., corrupted shards), thus reducing shard sizes. SpiralShard can configure more and smaller shards for higher concurrency at the same network size. To ensure security with the existence of corrupted shards, we propose the Linked Cross-shard Endorsement (LCE) protocol. According to our LCE protocol, the blocks of each shard are sequentially verified and endorsed by a group of shards before being finalized. As a result, a corrupted shard can eliminate forks with the help of the other shards. We implement SpiralShard based on Harmony and conduct extensive evaluations. Experimental results show that, compared with Harmony, SpiralShard achieves around 19x throughput gain under a large network size with 4,000+ nodes.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce an approach to bias deep generative models, such as GANs and diffusion models, towards generating data with either enhanced fidelity or increased diversity. Our approach involves manipulating the distribution of training and generated data through a novel metric for individual samples, named pseudo density, which is based on the nearest-neighbor information from real samples. Our approach offers three distinct techniques to adjust the fidelity and diversity of deep generative models: 1) Per-sample perturbation, enabling precise adjustments for individual samples towards either more common or more unique characteristics; 2) Importance sampling during model inference to enhance either fidelity or diversity in the generated data; 3) Fine-tuning with importance sampling, which guides the generative model to learn an adjusted distribution, thus controlling fidelity and diversity. Furthermore, our fine-tuning method demonstrates the ability to improve the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) for pre-trained generative models with minimal iterations.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise for natural language generation in healthcare, but risk hallucinating factually incorrect information. Deploying LLMs for medical question answering necessitates reliable uncertainty estimation (UE) methods to detect hallucinations. In this work, we benchmark popular UE methods with different model sizes on medical question-answering datasets. Our results show that current approaches generally perform poorly in this domain, highlighting the challenge of UE for medical applications. We also observe that larger models tend to yield better results, suggesting a correlation between model size and the reliability of UE. To address these challenges, we propose Two-phase Verification, a probability-free Uncertainty Estimation approach. First, an LLM generates a step-by-step explanation alongside its initial answer, followed by formulating verification questions to check the factual claims in the explanation. The model then answers these questions twice: first independently, and then referencing the explanation. Inconsistencies between the two sets of answers measure the uncertainty in the original response. We evaluate our approach on three biomedical question-answering datasets using Llama 2 Chat models and compare it against the benchmarked baseline methods. The results show that our Two-phase Verification method achieves the best overall accuracy and stability across various datasets and model sizes, and its performance scales as the model size increases.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>protect</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Up to 10% of memory-safety vulnerabilities in languages like C and C++ stem from uninitialized variables. This work addresses the prevalence and lack of adequate software mitigations for uninitialized memory issues, proposing architectural protections in hardware. Capability-based addressing, such as the University of Cambridge's CHERI, mitigates many memory defects, including spatial and temporal safety violations at an architectural level. However, current CHERI designs do not handle undefined behavior from uninitialized variables. We extend the CHERI capability model to include "conditional capabilities", enabling memory-access policies based on prior operations. This allows enforcement of policies that satisfy memory safety objectives such as "no reads to memory without at least one prior write" (Write-before-Read). We present our architecture extension, compiler support, and a detailed evaluation of our approach using the QEMU full-system simulator and our modified FPGA-based CHERI-RISCV softcore. Our evaluation shows Write-before-Read conditional capabilities are practical, with high detection accuracy while adding a small (~3.5%) overhead to the existing CHERI architecture.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Visual Question Answering for Remote Sensing (RSVQA) is a task that aims at answering natural language questions about the content of a remote sensing image. The visual features extraction is therefore an essential step in a VQA pipeline. By incorporating attention mechanisms into this process, models gain the ability to focus selectively on salient regions of the image, prioritizing the most relevant visual information for a given question. In this work, we propose to embed an attention mechanism guided by segmentation into a RSVQA pipeline. We argue that segmentation plays a crucial role in guiding attention by providing a contextual understanding of the visual information, underlying specific objects or areas of interest. To evaluate this methodology, we provide a new VQA dataset that exploits very high-resolution RGB orthophotos annotated with 16 segmentation classes and question/answer pairs. Our study shows promising results of our new methodology, gaining almost 10% of overall accuracy compared to a classical method on the proposed dataset.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep neural networks and other modern machine learning models are often susceptible to adversarial attacks. Indeed, an adversary may often be able to change a model's prediction through a small, directed perturbation of the model's input - an issue in safety-critical applications. Adversarially robust machine learning is usually based on a minmax optimisation problem that minimises the machine learning loss under maximisation-based adversarial attacks. In this work, we study adversaries that determine their attack using a Bayesian statistical approach rather than maximisation. The resulting Bayesian adversarial robustness problem is a relaxation of the usual minmax problem. To solve this problem, we propose Abram - a continuous-time particle system that shall approximate the gradient flow corresponding to the underlying learning problem. We show that Abram approximates a McKean-Vlasov process and justify the use of Abram by giving assumptions under which the McKean-Vlasov process finds the minimiser of the Bayesian adversarial robustness problem. We discuss two ways to discretise Abram and show its suitability in benchmark adversarial deep learning experiments.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the remarkable advancements in image generation and open-form text generation, the creation of interleaved image-text content has become an increasingly intriguing field. Multimodal story generation, characterized by producing narrative texts and vivid images in an interleaved manner, has emerged as a valuable and practical task with broad applications. However, this task poses significant challenges, as it necessitates the comprehension of the complex interplay between texts and images, and the ability to generate long sequences of coherent, contextually relevant texts and visuals. In this work, we propose SEED-Story, a novel method that leverages a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to generate extended multimodal stories. Our model, built upon the powerful comprehension capability of MLLM, predicts text tokens as well as visual tokens, which are subsequently processed with an adapted visual de-tokenizer to produce images with consistent characters and styles. We further propose multimodal attention sink mechanism to enable the generation of stories with up to 25 sequences (only 10 for training) in a highly efficient autoregressive manner. Additionally, we present a large-scale and high-resolution dataset named StoryStream for training our model and quantitatively evaluating the task of multimodal story generation in various aspects.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As open-weight large language models (LLMs) achieve ever more impressive performances across a wide range of tasks in English, practitioners aim to adapt these models to different languages. However, such language adaptation is often accompanied by catastrophic forgetting of the base model's capabilities, severely limiting the usefulness of the resulting model. We address this issue by proposing Branch-and-Merge (BaM), a new adaptation method based on iteratively merging multiple models, fine-tuned on a subset of the available training data. BaM is based on the insight that this yields lower magnitude but higher quality weight changes, reducing forgetting of the source domain while maintaining learning on the target domain. We demonstrate in an extensive empirical study on Bulgarian and German that BaM can significantly reduce forgetting while matching or even improving target domain performance compared to both standard continued pretraining and instruction finetuning across different model architectures.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models have shown remarkable efficacy in generating streaming data such as text and audio, thanks to their temporally uni-directional attention mechanism, which models correlations between the current token and previous tokens. However, video streaming remains much less explored, despite a growing need for live video processing. State-of-the-art video diffusion models leverage bi-directional temporal attention to model the correlations between the current frame and all the surrounding (i.e. including future) frames, which hinders them from processing streaming videos. To address this problem, we present Live2Diff, the first attempt at designing a video diffusion model with uni-directional temporal attention, specifically targeting live streaming video translation. Compared to previous works, our approach ensures temporal consistency and smoothness by correlating the current frame with its predecessors and a few initial warmup frames, without any future frames. Additionally, we use a highly efficient denoising scheme featuring a KV-cache mechanism and pipelining, to facilitate streaming video translation at interactive framerates. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed attention mechanism and pipeline, outperforming previous methods in terms of temporal smoothness and/or efficiency.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have made remarkable progress in document-based Visual Question Answering (i.e., responding to queries about the contents of an input document provided as an image). In this work, we show these models can memorize responses for training samples and regurgitate them even when the relevant visual information has been removed. This includes Personal Identifiable Information (PII) repeated once in the training set, indicating these models could divulge memorised sensitive information and therefore pose a privacy risk. We quantitatively measure the extractability of information in controlled experiments and differentiate between cases where it arises from generalization capabilities or from memorization. We further investigate the factors that influence memorization across multiple state-of-the-art models and propose an effective heuristic countermeasure that empirically prevents the extractability of PII.</li>

To evaluate model performance on this task, we introduce eyeballvul: a benchmark designed to test the vulnerability detection capabilities of language models at scale, that is sourced and updated weekly from the stream of published vulnerabilities in open-source repositories. The benchmark consists of a list of revisions in different repositories, each associated with the list of known vulnerabilities present at that revision. An LLM-based scorer is used to compare the list of possible vulnerabilities returned by a model to the list of known vulnerabilities for each revision. As of July 2024, eyeballvul contains 24,000+ vulnerabilities across 6,000+ revisions and 5,000+ repositories, and is around 55GB in size.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose OmniNOCS, a large-scale monocular dataset with 3D Normalized Object Coordinate Space (NOCS) maps, object masks, and 3D bounding box annotations for indoor and outdoor scenes. OmniNOCS has 20 times more object classes and 200 times more instances than existing NOCS datasets (NOCS-Real275, Wild6D). We use OmniNOCS to train a novel, transformer-based monocular NOCS prediction model (NOCSformer) that can predict accurate NOCS, instance masks and poses from 2D object detections across diverse classes. It is the first NOCS model that can generalize to a broad range of classes when prompted with 2D boxes. We evaluate our model on the task of 3D oriented bounding box prediction, where it achieves comparable results to state-of-the-art 3D detection methods such as Cube R-CNN. Unlike other 3D detection methods, our model also provides detailed and accurate 3D object shape and segmentation. We propose a novel benchmark for the task of NOCS prediction based on OmniNOCS, which we hope will serve as a useful baseline for future work in this area.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Significant focus has been placed on integrating large language models (LLMs) with various tools in developing general-purpose agents. This poses a challenge to LLMs' tool-use capabilities. However, there are evident gaps between existing tool-use evaluations and real-world scenarios. Current evaluations often use AI-generated queries, single-step tasks, dummy tools, and text-only interactions, failing to reveal the agents' real-world problem-solving abilities effectively. To address this, we propose GTA, a benchmark for General Tool Agents, featuring three main aspects: (i) Real user queries: human-written queries with simple real-world objectives but implicit tool-use, requiring the LLM to reason the suitable tools and plan the solution steps. (ii) Real deployed tools: an evaluation platform equipped with tools across perception, operation, logic, and creativity categories to evaluate the agents' actual task execution performance. (iii) Real multimodal inputs: authentic image files, such as spatial scenes, web page screenshots, tables, code snippets, and printed/handwritten materials, used as the query contexts to align with real-world scenarios closely. We design 229 real-world tasks and executable tool chains to evaluate mainstream LLMs. Our findings show that real-world user queries are challenging for existing LLMs, with GPT-4 completing less than 50% of the tasks and most LLMs achieving below 25%. This evaluation reveals the bottlenecks in the tool-use capabilities of current LLMs in real-world scenarios, which provides future direction for advancing general-purpose tool agents.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models pretrained on extensive web corpora demonstrate remarkable performance across a wide range of downstream tasks. However, a growing concern is data contamination, where evaluation datasets may be contained in the pretraining corpus, inflating model performance. Decontamination, the process of detecting and removing such data, is a potential solution; yet these contaminants may originate from altered versions of the test set, evading detection during decontamination. How different types of contamination impact the performance of language models on downstream tasks is not fully understood. We present a taxonomy that categorizes the various types of contamination encountered by LLMs during the pretraining phase and identify which types pose the highest risk. We analyze the impact of contamination on two key NLP tasks -- summarization and question answering -- revealing how different types of contamination influence task performance during evaluation.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Lip-based biometric authentication (LBBA) has attracted many researchers during the last decade. The lip is specifically interesting for biometric researchers because it is a twin biometric with the potential to function both as a physiological and a behavioral trait. Although much valuable research was conducted on LBBA, none of them considered the different emotions of the client during the video acquisition step of LBBA, which can potentially affect the client's facial expressions and speech tempo. We proposed a novel network structure called WhisperNetV2, which extends our previously proposed network called WhisperNet. Our proposed network leverages a deep Siamese structure with triplet loss having three identical SlowFast networks as embedding networks. The SlowFast network is an excellent candidate for our task since the fast pathway extracts motion-related features (behavioral lip movements) with a high frame rate and low channel capacity. The slow pathway extracts visual features (physiological lip appearance) with a low frame rate and high channel capacity. Using an open-set protocol, we trained our network using the CREMA-D dataset and acquired an Equal Error Rate (EER) of 0.005 on the test set. Considering that the acquired EER is less than most similar LBBA methods, our method can be considered as a state-of-the-art LBBA method.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present a novel set of rigorous and computationally efficient topology-based complexity notions that exhibit a strong correlation with the generalization gap in modern deep neural networks (DNNs). DNNs show remarkable generalization properties, yet the source of these capabilities remains elusive, defying the established statistical learning theory. Recent studies have revealed that properties of training trajectories can be indicative of generalization. Building on this insight, state-of-the-art methods have leveraged the topology of these trajectories, particularly their fractal dimension, to quantify generalization. Most existing works compute this quantity by assuming continuous- or infinite-time training dynamics, complicating the development of practical estimators capable of accurately predicting generalization without access to test data. In this paper, we respect the discrete-time nature of training trajectories and investigate the underlying topological quantities that can be amenable to topological data analysis tools. This leads to a new family of reliable topological complexity measures that provably bound the generalization error, eliminating the need for restrictive geometric assumptions. These measures are computationally friendly, enabling us to propose simple yet effective algorithms for computing generalization indices. Moreover, our flexible framework can be extended to different domains, tasks, and architectures. Our experimental results demonstrate that our new complexity measures correlate highly with generalization error in industry-standards architectures such as transformers and deep graph networks. Our approach consistently outperforms existing topological bounds across a wide range of datasets, models, and optimizers, highlighting the practical relevance and effectiveness of our complexity measures.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Top-down Bird's Eye View (BEV) maps are a popular representation for ground robot navigation due to their richness and flexibility for downstream tasks. While recent methods have shown promise for predicting BEV maps from First-Person View (FPV) images, their generalizability is limited to small regions captured by current autonomous vehicle-based datasets. In this context, we show that a more scalable approach towards generalizable map prediction can be enabled by using two large-scale crowd-sourced mapping platforms, Mapillary for FPV images and OpenStreetMap for BEV semantic maps. We introduce Map It Anywhere (MIA), a data engine that enables seamless curation and modeling of labeled map prediction data from existing open-source map platforms. Using our MIA data engine, we display the ease of automatically collecting a dataset of 1.2 million pairs of FPV images & BEV maps encompassing diverse geographies, landscapes, environmental factors, camera models & capture scenarios. We further train a simple camera model-agnostic model on this data for BEV map prediction. Extensive evaluations using established benchmarks and our dataset show that the data curated by MIA enables effective pretraining for generalizable BEV map prediction, with zero-shot performance far exceeding baselines trained on existing datasets by 35%. Our analysis highlights the promise of using large-scale public maps for developing & testing generalizable BEV perception, paving the way for more robust autonomous navigation.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The goal of this paper is to address the problem of \textit{global} point cloud registration (PCR) i.e., finding the optimal alignment between point clouds irrespective of the initial poses of the scans. This problem is notoriously challenging for classical optimization methods due to computational constraints. First, we show that state-of-the-art deep learning methods suffer from huge performance degradation when the point clouds are arbitrarily placed in space. We propose that \textit{equivariant deep learning} should be utilized for solving this task and we characterize the specific type of bi-equivariance of PCR. Then, we design BiEquiformer a novel and scalable \textit{bi-equivariant} pipeline i.e. equivariant to the independent transformations of the input point clouds. While a naive approach would process the point clouds independently we design expressive bi-equivariant layers that fuse the information from both point clouds. This allows us to extract high-quality superpoint correspondences and in turn, robust point-cloud registration. Extensive comparisons against state-of-the-art methods show that our method achieves comparable performance in the canonical setting and superior performance in the robust setting in both the 3DMatch and the challenging low-overlap 3DLoMatch dataset.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Exceptional mathematical reasoning ability is one of the key features that demonstrate the power of large language models (LLMs). How to comprehensively define and evaluate the mathematical abilities of LLMs, and even reflect the user experience in real-world scenarios, has emerged as a critical issue. Current benchmarks predominantly concentrate on problem-solving capabilities, which presents a substantial risk of model overfitting and fails to accurately represent genuine mathematical reasoning abilities. In this paper, we argue that if a model really understands a problem, it should be robustly and readily applied across a diverse array of tasks. Motivated by this, we introduce MATHCHECK, a well-designed checklist for testing task generalization and reasoning robustness, as well as an automatic tool to generate checklists efficiently. MATHCHECK includes multiple mathematical reasoning tasks and robustness test types to facilitate a comprehensive evaluation of both mathematical reasoning ability and behavior testing. Utilizing MATHCHECK, we develop MATHCHECK-GSM and MATHCHECK-GEO to assess mathematical textual reasoning and multi-modal reasoning capabilities, respectively, serving as upgraded versions of benchmarks including GSM8k, GeoQA, UniGeo, and Geometry3K. We adopt MATHCHECK-GSM and MATHCHECK-GEO to evaluate over 20 LLMs and 11 MLLMs, assessing their comprehensive mathematical reasoning abilities. Our results demonstrate that while frontier LLMs like GPT-4o continue to excel in various abilities on the checklist, many other model families exhibit a significant decline. Further experiments indicate that, compared to traditional math benchmarks, MATHCHECK better reflects true mathematical abilities and represents mathematical intelligence more linearly, thereby supporting our design. On our MATHCHECK, we can easily conduct detailed behavior analysis to deeply investigate models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, interpretability, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Mechanistic interpretability work attempts to reverse engineer the learned algorithms present inside neural networks. One focus of this work has been to discover 'circuits' -- subgraphs of the full model that explain behaviour on specific tasks. But how do we measure the performance of such circuits? Prior work has attempted to measure circuit 'faithfulness' -- the degree to which the circuit replicates the performance of the full model. In this work, we survey many considerations for designing experiments that measure circuit faithfulness by ablating portions of the model's computation. Concerningly, we find existing methods are highly sensitive to seemingly insignificant changes in the ablation methodology. We conclude that existing circuit faithfulness scores reflect both the methodological choices of researchers as well as the actual components of the circuit - the task a circuit is required to perform depends on the ablation used to test it. The ultimate goal of mechanistic interpretability work is to understand neural networks, so we emphasize the need for more clarity in the precise claims being made about circuits. We open source a library at this https URL that includes highly efficient implementations of a wide range of ablation methodologies and circuit discovery algorithms.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We have made significant progress towards building foundational video diffusion models. As these models are trained using large-scale unsupervised data, it has become crucial to adapt these models to specific downstream tasks. Adapting these models via supervised fine-tuning requires collecting target datasets of videos, which is challenging and tedious. In this work, we utilize pre-trained reward models that are learned via preferences on top of powerful vision discriminative models to adapt video diffusion models. These models contain dense gradient information with respect to generated RGB pixels, which is critical to efficient learning in complex search spaces, such as videos. We show that backpropagating gradients from these reward models to a video diffusion model can allow for compute and sample efficient alignment of the video diffusion model. We show results across a variety of reward models and video diffusion models, demonstrating that our approach can learn much more efficiently in terms of reward queries and computation than prior gradient-free approaches.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently emerged as a significant focus in academia and industry. Despite their proficiency in general multi-modal scenarios, the mathematical problem-solving capabilities in visual contexts remain insufficiently explored. We identify three key areas within MLLMs that need to be improved: visual encoding of math diagrams, diagram-language alignment, and mathematical reasoning skills. This draws forth an urgent demand for large-scale, high-quality data and training pipelines in visual mathematics. In this paper, we propose MAVIS, the first MAthematical VISual instruction tuning paradigm for MLLMs, involving a series of mathematical visual datasets and specialized MLLMs. Targeting the three issues, MAVIS contains three progressive training stages from scratch. First, we curate MAVIS-Caption, consisting of 558K diagram-caption pairs, to fine-tune a math-specific vision encoder (CLIP-Math) through contrastive learning, tailored for improved diagram visual encoding. Second, we utilize MAVIS-Caption to align the CLIP-Math with a large language model (LLM) by a projection layer, enhancing vision-language alignment in mathematical domains. Third, we introduce MAVIS-Instruct, including 900K meticulously collected and annotated visual math problems, which is adopted to finally instruct-tune the MLLM for robust mathematical reasoning skills. In MAVIS-Instruct, we incorporate complete chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales for each problem, and minimize textual redundancy, thereby concentrating the model towards the visual elements.
