<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Consuming poisonous mushrooms can have severe health consequences, even resulting in fatality and accurately distinguishing edible from toxic mushroom varieties remains a significant challenge in ensuring food safety. So, it's crucial to distinguish between edible and poisonous mushrooms within the existing species. This is essential due to the significant demand for mushrooms in people's daily meals and their potential contributions to medical science. This work presents a novel Quantum Vision Transformer architecture that leverages quantum computing to enhance mushroom classification performance. By implementing specialized quantum self-attention mechanisms using Variational Quantum Circuits, the proposed architecture achieved 92.33% and 99.24% accuracy based on their category and their edibility respectively. This demonstrates the success of the proposed architecture in reducing false negatives for toxic mushrooms, thus ensuring food safety. Our research highlights the potential of QMViT for improving mushroom classification as a whole.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Fruit harvesting poses a significant labor and financial burden for the industry, highlighting the critical need for advancements in robotic harvesting solutions. Machine vision-based fruit detection has been recognized as a crucial component for robust identification of fruits to guide robotic manipulation. Despite considerable progress in leveraging deep learning and machine learning techniques for fruit detection, a common shortfall is the inability to swiftly extend the developed models across different orchards and/or various fruit species. Additionally, the limited availability of pertinent data further compounds these challenges. In this work, we introduce MetaFruit, the largest publicly available multi-class fruit dataset, comprising 4,248 images and 248,015 manually labeled instances across diverse U.S. orchards. Furthermore, this study proposes an innovative open-set fruit detection system leveraging advanced Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) for fruit detection that can adeptly identify a wide array of fruit types under varying orchard conditions. This system not only demonstrates remarkable adaptability in learning from minimal data through few-shot learning but also shows the ability to interpret human instructions for subtle detection tasks. The performance of the developed foundation model is comprehensively evaluated using several metrics, which outperforms the existing state-of-the-art algorithms in both our MetaFruit dataset and other open-sourced fruit datasets, thereby setting a new benchmark in the field of agricultural technology and robotic harvesting. The MetaFruit dataset and detection framework are open-sourced to foster future research in vision-based fruit harvesting, marking a significant stride toward addressing the urgent needs of the agricultural sector.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Agriculture, vital for global sustenance, necessitates innovative solutions due to a lack of organized domain experts, particularly in developing countries where many farmers are impoverished and cannot afford expert consulting. Initiatives like Farmers Helpline play a crucial role in such countries, yet challenges such as high operational costs persist. Automating query resolution can alleviate the burden on traditional call centers, providing farmers with immediate and contextually relevant information. The integration of Agriculture and Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers a transformative opportunity to empower farmers and bridge information gaps. Language models like transformers, the rising stars of AI, possess remarkable language understanding capabilities, making them ideal for addressing information gaps in agriculture. This work explores and demonstrates the transformative potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in automating query resolution for agricultural farmers, leveraging their expertise in deciphering natural language and understanding context. Using a subset of a vast dataset of real-world farmer queries collected in India, our study focuses on approximately 4 million queries from the state of Tamil Nadu, spanning various sectors, seasonal crops, and query types.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we first give an introduction to the theoretical basis of the privacy-utility equilibrium in federated learning based on Bayesian privacy definitions and total variation distance privacy definitions. We then present the \textit{Learn-to-Distort-Data} framework, which provides a principled approach to navigate the privacy-utility equilibrium by explicitly modeling the distortion introduced by the privacy-preserving mechanism as a learnable variable and optimizing it jointly with the model parameters. We demonstrate the applicability of our framework to a variety of privacy-preserving mechanisms on the basis of data distortion and highlight its connections to related areas such as adversarial training, input robustness, and unlearnable examples. These connections enable leveraging techniques from these areas to design effective algorithms for privacy-utility equilibrium in federated learning under the \textit{Learn-to-Distort-Data} framework.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) with billions of parameters have significantly boosted their performance across various real-world applications. However, the inference processes for these models require substantial energy and computational resources, presenting considerable deployment challenges. In contrast, human brains, which contain approximately 86 billion biological neurons, exhibit significantly greater energy efficiency compared to LLMs with a similar number of parameters. Inspired by this, we redesign 7 to 70 billion parameter LLMs using bio-plausible spiking mechanisms, emulating the efficient behavior of the human brain. We propose the first spiking large language model as recent LLMs termed SpikeLLM. Coupled with the proposed model, a novel spike-driven quantization framework named Optimal Brain Spiking is introduced to reduce the energy cost and accelerate inference speed via two essential approaches: first (second)-order differentiation-based salient channel detection, and per-channel salient outlier expansion with Generalized Integrate-and-Fire neurons. Our proposed spike-driven quantization can plug in main streams of quantization training methods. In the OmniQuant pipeline, SpikeLLM significantly reduces 25.51% WikiText2 perplexity and improves 3.08% average accuracy of 6 zero-shot datasets on a LLAMA2-7B 4A4W model. In the GPTQ pipeline, SpikeLLM realizes a sparse ternary quantization, which achieves additive in all linear layers. Compared with PB-LLM with similar operations, SpikeLLM also exceeds significantly. We will release our code on GitHub.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, protect, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Memory-unsafe programming languages such as C and C++ are the preferred languages for systems programming, embedded systems, and performance-critical applications. The widespread use of these languages makes the risk of memory-related attacks very high. There are well-known detection mechanisms, but they do not address software resilience. An earlier approach proposes the Secure Domain Rewind and Discard (SDRaD) of isolated domains as a method to enhance the resilience of software targeted by runtime attacks on x86 architecture, based on hardware-enforced Memory Protection Key (MPK). In this work, SDRaD has been adapted to work with the Capability Hardware Enhanced RISC Instructions (CHERI) architecture to be more lightweight and performant. The results obtained in this thesis show that CHERI-SDRaD, the prototype adaption that leverages the memory-safety properties inherent to the CHERI architecture, results in a solution with less performance degradation (2.2% in Nginx benchmarks) compared to earlier results obtained with the original SDRaD prototype on an Intel-based architecture. The adaption to CHERI additionally allowed limitations inherent to the MPK-based approach to be resolved.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, explainability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper presents a novel anomaly and outlier detection algorithm from the SPINEX (Similarity-based Predictions with Explainable Neighbors Exploration) family. This algorithm leverages the concept of similarity and higher-order interactions across multiple subspaces to identify outliers. A comprehensive set of experiments was conducted to evaluate the performance of SPINEX. This algorithm was examined against 21 commonly used anomaly detection algorithms, namely, namely, Angle-Based Outlier Detection (ABOD), Connectivity-Based Outlier Factor (COF), Copula-Based Outlier Detection (COPOD), ECOD, Elliptic Envelope (EE), Feature Bagging with KNN, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), Histogram-based Outlier Score (HBOS), Isolation Forest (IF), Isolation Neural Network Ensemble (INNE), Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Lightweight Online Detector of Anomalies (LODA), Linear Model Deviation-based Detector (LMDD), Local Outlier Factor (LOF), Minimum Covariance Determinant (MCD), One-Class SVM (OCSVM), Quadratic MCD (QMCD), Robust Covariance (RC), Stochastic Outlier Selection (SOS), and Subspace Outlier Detection (SOD), and across 39 synthetic and real datasets from various domains and of a variety of dimensions and complexities. Furthermore, a complexity analysis was carried out to examine the complexity of the proposed algorithm. Our results demonstrate that SPINEX achieves superior performance, outperforms commonly used anomaly detection algorithms, and has moderate complexity (e.g., O(n log n d)). More specifically, SPINEX was found to rank at the top of algorithms on the synthetic datasets and the 7th on the real datasets. Finally, a demonstration of the explainability capabilities of SPINEX, along with future research needs, is presented.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present a new method for large language models to solve compositional tasks. Although they have shown strong performance on traditional language understanding tasks, large language models struggle to solve compositional tasks, where the solution depends on solving smaller instances of the same problem. We propose a natural approach to solve compositional tasks recursively. Our method, Re-Tuning, tunes models to break down a problem into subproblems, solve those subproblems, and combine the results. We show that our method significantly improves model performance on three representative compositional tasks: integer addition, dynamic programming, and parity. Compared to state-of-the-art methods that keep intermediate steps towards solving the problems, Re-Tuning achieves significantly higher accuracy and is more GPU memory efficient.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, robust, watermark, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in various applications, including text generation and complex tasks. However, the misuse of LLMs raises concerns about the authenticity and ethical implications of the content they produce, such as deepfake news, academic fraud, and copyright infringement. Watermarking techniques, which embed identifiable markers in machine-generated text, offer a promising solution to these issues by allowing for content verification and origin tracing. Unfortunately, the robustness of current LLM watermarking schemes under potential watermark removal attacks has not been comprehensively explored. In this paper, to fill this gap, we first systematically comb the mainstream watermarking schemes and removal attacks on machine-generated texts, and then we categorize them into pre-text (before text generation) and post-text (after text generation) classes so that we can conduct diversified analyses. In our experiments, we evaluate eight watermarks (five pre-text, three post-text) and twelve attacks (two pre-text, ten post-text) across 87 scenarios. Evaluation results indicate that (1) KGW and Exponential watermarks offer high text quality and watermark retention but remain vulnerable to most attacks; (2) Post-text attacks are found to be more efficient and practical than pre-text attacks; (3) Pre-text watermarks are generally more imperceptible, as they do not alter text fluency, unlike post-text watermarks; (4) Additionally, combined attack methods can significantly increase effectiveness, highlighting the need for more robust watermarking solutions. Our study underscores the vulnerabilities of current techniques and the necessity for developing more resilient schemes.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair, diffusion, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce segmentation-free guidance, a novel method designed for text-to-image diffusion models like Stable Diffusion. Our method does not require retraining of the diffusion model. At no additional compute cost, it uses the diffusion model itself as an implied segmentation network, hence named segmentation-free guidance, to dynamically adjust the negative prompt for each patch of the generated image, based on the patch's relevance to concepts in the prompt. We evaluate segmentation-free guidance both objectively, using FID, CLIP, IS, and PickScore, and subjectively, through human evaluators. For the subjective evaluation, we also propose a methodology for subsampling the prompts in a dataset like MS COCO-30K to keep the number of human evaluations manageable while ensuring that the selected subset is both representative in terms of content and fair in terms of model performance. The results demonstrate the superiority of our segmentation-free guidance to the widely used classifier-free method. Human evaluators preferred segmentation-free guidance over classifier-free 60% to 19%, with 18% of occasions showing a strong preference. Additionally, PickScore win-rate, a recently proposed metric mimicking human preference, also indicates a preference for our method over classifier-free.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable success across various domains, such as video games, robotics, and, recently, large language models. However, the computational costs and memory requirements of DRL models often limit their deployment in resource-constrained environments. The challenge underscores the urgent need to explore neural network compression methods to make RDL models more practical and broadly applicable. Our study investigates the impact of two prominent compression methods, quantization and pruning on DRL models. We examine how these techniques influence four performance factors: average return, memory, inference time, and battery utilization across various DRL algorithms and environments. Despite the decrease in model size, we identify that these compression techniques generally do not improve the energy efficiency of DRL models, but the model size decreases. We provide insights into the trade-offs between model compression and DRL performance, offering guidelines for deploying efficient DRL models in resource-constrained settings.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Submodular optimization is a fundamental problem with many applications in machine learning, often involving decision-making over datasets with sensitive attributes such as gender or age. In such settings, it is often desirable to produce a diverse solution set that is fairly distributed with respect to these attributes. Motivated by this, we initiate the study of Fair Submodular Cover (FSC), where given a ground set $U$, a monotone submodular function $f:2^U\to\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$, a threshold $\tau$, the goal is to find a balanced subset of $S$ with minimum cardinality such that $f(S)\ge\tau$. We first introduce discrete algorithms for FSC that achieve a bicriteria approximation ratio of $(\frac{1}{\epsilon}, 1-O(\epsilon))$. We then present a continuous algorithm that achieves a $(\ln\frac{1}{\epsilon}, 1-O(\epsilon))$-bicriteria approximation ratio, which matches the best approximation guarantee of submodular cover without a fairness constraint. Finally, we complement our theoretical results with a number of empirical evaluations that demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms on instances of maximum coverage.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we propose to reformulate the blind image deblurring task to directly learn an inverse of the degradation model using a deep linear network. We introduce Deep Identity Learning (DIL), a novel learning strategy that includes a dedicated regularization term based on the properties of linear systems, to exploit the identity relation between the degradation and inverse degradation models. The salient aspect of our proposed framework is it neither relies on a deblurring dataset nor a single input blurred image (like Polyblur, a self-supervised method). Since it is purely image-data-independent, we term our model as Null-Shot deblurring Using Deep Identity Learning (NSD-DIL). We also provide an explicit representation of the learned deep linear network in a matrix form, called Deep Restoration Kernel (DRK) for deblurring task. The proposed framework detours the typical degradation kernel estimation step involved in most of the existing blind deblurring solutions by the proposition of our Random Kernel Gallery (RKG) dataset. In this work, we focus on the restoration of mild blur images, generated by small out-of-focus, lens blur, or slight camera motion, which often occurs in real images. Our experiments show that the proposed method outperforms both traditional and deep learning based deblurring methods, with at least an order of 100 lesser computational resources. The proposed NSD-DIL method can be effortlessly extended to the Image Super-Resolution (ISR) task as well to restore the low-resolution images with fine details. The NSD-DIL model and its kernel form representation (DRK) are lightweight yet robust and restore the mild blur input in a fraction of a second. Hence, more suitable for wide real-time applications.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Data mining has various real-time applications in fields such as finance telecommunications, biology, and government. Classification is a primary task in data mining. With the rise of cloud computing, users can outsource and access their data from anywhere, offloading data and it is processing to the cloud. However, in public cloud environments while data is often encrypted, the cloud service provider typically controls the encryption keys, meaning they can potentially access the data at any time. This situation makes traditional privacy-preserving classification systems inadequate. The recommended protocol ensures data privacy, protects user queries, and conceals access patterns. Given that encrypted data on the cloud cannot be directly mined, we focus on a secure k nearest neighbor classification algorithm for encrypted, outsourced data. This approach maintains the privacy of user queries and data access patterns while allowing effective data mining operations to be conducted securely in the cloud. With cloud computing, particularly in public cloud environments, the encryption of data necessitates advanced methods like secure k nearest neighbor algorithms to ensure privacy and functionality in data mining. This innovation protects sensitive information and user privacy, addressing the challenges posed by traditional systems where cloud providers control encryption keys.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper addresses the challenge of creating a neural architecture for very long sequences that requires constant time for processing new information at each time step. Our approach, Associative Recurrent Memory Transformer (ARMT), is based on transformer self-attention for local context and segment-level recurrence for storage of task specific information distributed over a long context. We demonstrate that ARMT outperfors existing alternatives in associative retrieval tasks and sets a new performance record in the recent BABILong multi-task long-context benchmark by answering single-fact questions over 50 million tokens with an accuracy of 79.9%.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While text-to-image models like DALLE-3 and Stable Diffusion are rapidly proliferating, they often encounter challenges such as hallucination, bias, and the production of unsafe, low-quality output. To effectively address these issues, it is crucial to align these models with desired behaviors based on feedback from a multimodal judge. Despite their significance, current multimodal judges frequently undergo inadequate evaluation of their capabilities and limitations, potentially leading to misalignment and unsafe fine-tuning outcomes. To address this issue, we introduce MJ-Bench, a novel benchmark which incorporates a comprehensive preference dataset to evaluate multimodal judges in providing feedback for image generation models across four key perspectives: alignment, safety, image quality, and bias. Specifically, we evaluate a large variety of multimodal judges including smaller-sized CLIP-based scoring models, open-source VLMs (e.g. LLaVA family), and close-source VLMs (e.g. GPT-4o, Claude 3) on each decomposed subcategory of our preference dataset. Experiments reveal that close-source VLMs generally provide better feedback, with GPT-4o outperforming other judges in average. Compared with open-source VLMs, smaller-sized scoring models can provide better feedback regarding text-image alignment and image quality, while VLMs provide more accurate feedback regarding safety and generation bias due to their stronger reasoning capabilities. Further studies in feedback scale reveal that VLM judges can generally provide more accurate and stable feedback in natural language (Likert-scale) than numerical scales. Notably, human evaluations on end-to-end fine-tuned models using separate feedback from these multimodal judges provide similar conclusions, further confirming the effectiveness of MJ-Bench.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The Rashomon Effect, coined by Leo Breiman, describes the phenomenon that there exist many equally good predictive models for the same dataset. This phenomenon happens for many real datasets and when it does, it sparks both magic and consternation, but mostly magic. In light of the Rashomon Effect, this perspective piece proposes reshaping the way we think about machine learning, particularly for tabular data problems in the nondeterministic (noisy) setting. We address how the Rashomon Effect impacts (1) the existence of simple-yet-accurate models, (2) flexibility to address user preferences, such as fairness and monotonicity, without losing performance, (3) uncertainty in predictions, fairness, and explanations, (4) reliable variable importance, (5) algorithm choice, specifically, providing advanced knowledge of which algorithms might be suitable for a given problem, and (6) public policy. We also discuss a theory of when the Rashomon Effect occurs and why. Our goal is to illustrate how the Rashomon Effect can have a massive impact on the use of machine learning for complex problems in society.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>AI-supported programming has taken giant leaps with tools such as Meta's Llama and openAI's chatGPT. These are examples of stochastic sources of programs and have already greatly influenced how we produce code and teach programming. If we consider input to such models as a stochastic source, a natural question is, what is the relation between the input and the output distributions, between the chatGPT prompt and the resulting program? In this paper, we will show how the relation between random Python programs generated from chatGPT can be described geometrically and topologically using Tree-edit distances between the program's syntax trees and without explicit modeling of the underlying space. A popular approach to studying high-dimensional samples in a metric space is to use low-dimensional embedding using, e.g., multidimensional scaling. Such methods imply errors depending on the data and dimension of the embedding space. In this article, we propose to restrict such projection methods to purely visualization purposes and instead use geometric summary statistics, methods from spatial point statistics, and topological data analysis to characterize the configurations of random programs that do not rely on embedding approximations. To demonstrate their usefulness, we compare two publicly available models: ChatGPT-4 and TinyLlama, on a simple problem related to image processing. Application areas include understanding how questions should be asked to obtain useful programs; measuring how consistently a given large language model answers; and comparing the different large language models as a programming assistant. Finally, we speculate that our approach may in the future give new insights into the structure of programming languages.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Extractive summarization plays a pivotal role in natural language processing due to its wide-range applications in summarizing diverse content efficiently, while also being faithful to the original content. Despite significant advancement achieved in extractive summarization by Large Language Models (LLMs), these summaries frequently exhibit incoherence. An important aspect of the coherent summary is its readability for intended users. Although there have been many datasets and benchmarks proposed for creating coherent extractive summaries, none of them currently incorporate user intent to improve coherence in extractive summarization. Motivated by this, we propose a systematically created human-annotated dataset consisting of coherent summaries for five publicly available datasets and natural language user feedback, offering valuable insights into how to improve coherence in extractive summaries. We utilize this dataset for aligning LLMs through supervised fine-tuning with natural language human feedback to enhance the coherence of their generated summaries. Preliminary experiments with Falcon-40B and Llama-2-13B show significant performance improvements (~10% Rouge-L) in terms of producing coherent summaries. We further utilize human feedback to benchmark results over instruction-tuned models such as FLAN-T5 which resulted in several interesting findings.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In neural network (NN) security, safeguarding model integrity and resilience against adversarial attacks has become paramount. This study investigates the application of stochastic computing (SC) as a novel mechanism to fortify NN models. The primary objective is to assess the efficacy of SC to mitigate the deleterious impact of attacks on NN results. Through a series of rigorous experiments and evaluations, we explore the resilience of NNs employing SC when subjected to adversarial attacks. Our findings reveal that SC introduces a robust layer of defense, significantly reducing the susceptibility of networks to attack-induced alterations in their outcomes. This research contributes novel insights into the development of more secure and reliable NN systems, essential for applications in sensitive domains where data integrity is of utmost concern.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Image classification is an essential part of computer vision which assigns a given input image to a specific category based on the similarity evaluation within given criteria. While promising classifiers can be obtained through deep learning models, these approaches lack explainability, where the classification results are hard to interpret in a human-understandable way. In this paper, we present an explainable metric learning framework, which constructs hierarchical levels of semantic segments of an image for better interpretability. The key methodology involves a bottom-up learning strategy, starting by training the local metric learning model for the individual segments and then combining segments to compose comprehensive metrics in a tree. Specifically, our approach enables a more human-understandable similarity measurement between two images based on the semantic segments within it, which can be utilized to generate new samples to reduce bias in a training dataset. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed approach can drastically improve model accuracy compared with state-of-the-art methods.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Secure and efficient multi-user access mechanisms are increasingly important for the growing number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices being used today. Kerberos is a well-known and time-tried security authentication and access control system for distributed systems wherein many users securely access various distributed services. Traditionally, these services are software applications or devices, such as printers. However, Kerberos is not directly suitable for IoT devices due to its relatively heavy-weight protocols and the resource-constrained nature of the devices. This paper presents KESIC, a system that enables efficient and secure multi-user access for IoT devices. KESIC aims to facilitate mutual authentication of IoT devices and users via Kerberos without modifying the latter's protocols. To facilitate that, KESIC includes a special Kerberized service, called IoT Server, that manages access to IoT devices. KESIC presents two protocols for secure and comprehensive multi-user access system for two types of IoT devices: general and severely power constrained. In terms of performance, KESIC onsumes $\approx~47$ times less memory, and incurs $\approx~135$ times lower run-time overhead than Kerberos.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We show that it is possible to privately train convex problems that give models with similar privacy-utility trade-off as one hidden-layer ReLU networks trained with differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD). As we show, this is possible via a certain dual formulation of the ReLU minimization problem. We derive a stochastic approximation of the dual problem that leads to a strongly convex problem which allows applying, for example, the privacy amplification by iteration type of analysis for gradient-based private optimizers, and in particular allows giving accurate privacy bounds for the noisy cyclic mini-batch gradient descent with fixed disjoint mini-batches. We obtain on the MNIST and FashionMNIST problems for the noisy cyclic mini-batch gradient descent first empirical results that show similar privacy-utility-trade-offs as DP-SGD applied to a ReLU network. We outline theoretical utility bounds that illustrate the speed-ups of the private convex approximation of ReLU networks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) has heightened the demand for AI-based scientific assistants capable of understanding scientific articles and figures. Despite progress, there remains a significant gap in evaluating models' comprehension of professional, graduate-level, and even PhD-level scientific content. Current datasets and benchmarks primarily focus on relatively simple scientific tasks and figures, lacking comprehensive assessments across diverse advanced scientific disciplines. To bridge this gap, we collected a multimodal, multidisciplinary dataset from open-access scientific articles published in Nature Communications journals. This dataset spans 72 scientific disciplines, ensuring both diversity and quality. We created benchmarks with various tasks and settings to comprehensively evaluate LMMs' capabilities in understanding scientific figures and content. Our evaluation revealed that these tasks are highly challenging: many open-source models struggled significantly, and even GPT-4V and GPT-4o faced difficulties. We also explored using our dataset as training resources by constructing visual instruction-following data, enabling the 7B LLaVA model to achieve performance comparable to GPT-4V/o on our benchmark. Additionally, we investigated the use of our interleaved article texts and figure images for pre-training LMMs, resulting in improvements on the material generation task. The source dataset, including articles, figures, constructed benchmarks, and visual instruction-following data, is open-sourced.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this work, we analyze two large-scale surveys to examine how individuals think about sharing smartphone access with romantic partners as a function of trust in relationships. We find that the majority of couples have access to each others' devices, but may have explicit or implicit boundaries on how this access is to be used. Investigating these boundaries and related social norms, we find that there is little consensus about the level of smartphone access (i.e., transparency), or lack thereof (i.e., privacy) that is desirable in romantic contexts. However, there is broad agreement that the level of access should be mutual and consensual. Most individuals understand trust to be the basis of their decisions about transparency and privacy. Furthermore, we find individuals have crossed these boundaries, violating their partners' privacy and betraying their trust. We examine how, when, why, and by whom these betrayals occur. We consider the ramifications of these boundary violations in the case of intimate partner violence. Finally, we provide recommendations for design changes to enable technological enforcement of boundaries currently enforced by trust, bringing access control in line with users' sharing preferences.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Robust perception is critical for autonomous driving, especially under adverse weather and lighting conditions that commonly occur in real-world environments. In this paper, we introduce the Stereo Image Dataset (SID), a large-scale stereo-image dataset that captures a wide spectrum of challenging real-world environmental scenarios. Recorded at a rate of 20 Hz using a ZED stereo camera mounted on a vehicle, SID consists of 27 sequences totaling over 178k stereo image pairs that showcase conditions from clear skies to heavy snow, captured during the day, dusk, and night. The dataset includes detailed sequence-level annotations for weather conditions, time of day, location, and road conditions, along with instances of camera lens soiling, offering a realistic representation of the challenges in autonomous navigation. Our work aims to address a notable gap in research for autonomous driving systems by presenting high-fidelity stereo images essential for the development and testing of advanced perception algorithms. These algorithms support consistent and reliable operation across variable weather and lighting conditions, even when handling challenging situations like lens soiling.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In learning vision-language representations from web-scale data, the contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) mechanism has demonstrated a remarkable performance in many vision tasks. However, its application to the widely studied video quality assessment (VQA) task is still an open issue. In this paper, we propose an efficient and effective CLIP-based Transformer method for the VQA problem (CLIPVQA). Specifically, we first design an effective video frame perception paradigm with the goal of extracting the rich spatiotemporal quality and content information among video frames. Then, the spatiotemporal quality features are adequately integrated together using a self-attention mechanism to yield video-level quality representation. To utilize the quality language descriptions of videos for supervision, we develop a CLIP-based encoder for language embedding, which is then fully aggregated with the generated content information via a cross-attention module for producing video-language representation. Finally, the video-level quality and video-language representations are fused together for final video quality prediction, where a vectorized regression loss is employed for efficient end-to-end optimization. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on eight in-the-wild video datasets with diverse resolutions to evaluate the performance of CLIPVQA. The experimental results show that the proposed CLIPVQA achieves new state-of-the-art VQA performance and up to 37% better generalizability than existing benchmark VQA methods. A series of ablation studies are also performed to validate the effectiveness of each module in CLIPVQA.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Volumetric medical image segmentation is pivotal in enhancing disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and advancing medical research. While existing volumetric foundation models for medical image segmentation, such as SAM-Med3D and SegVol, have shown remarkable performance on general organs and tumors, their ability to segment certain categories in clinical downstream tasks remains limited. Supervised Finetuning (SFT) serves as an effective way to adapt such foundation models for task-specific downstream tasks but at the cost of degrading the general knowledge previously stored in the original foundation this http URL address this, we propose SAM-Med3D-MoE, a novel framework that seamlessly integrates task-specific finetuned models with the foundational model, creating a unified model at minimal additional training expense for an extra gating network. This gating network, in conjunction with a selection strategy, allows the unified model to achieve comparable performance of the original models in their respective tasks both general and specialized without updating any parameters of them.Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of SAM-Med3D-MoE, with an average Dice performance increase from 53 to 56.4 on 15 specific classes. It especially gets remarkable gains of 29.6, 8.5, 11.2 on the spinal cord, esophagus, and right hip, respectively. Additionally, it achieves 48.9 Dice on the challenging SPPIN2023 Challenge, significantly surpassing the general expert's performance of 32.3. We anticipate that SAM-Med3D-MoE can serve as a new framework for adapting the foundation model to specific areas in medical image analysis. Codes and datasets will be publicly available.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>YOLO is a deep neural network (DNN) model presented for robust real-time object detection following the one-stage inference approach. It outperforms other real-time object detectors in terms of speed and accuracy by a wide margin. Nevertheless, since YOLO is developed upon a DNN backbone with numerous parameters, it will cause excessive memory load, thereby deploying it on memory-constrained devices is a severe challenge in practice. To overcome this limitation, model compression techniques, such as quantizing parameters to lower-precision values, can be adopted. As the most recent version of YOLO, YOLOv7 achieves such state-of-the-art performance in speed and accuracy in the range of 5 FPS to 160 FPS that it surpasses all former versions of YOLO and other existing models in this regard. So far, the robustness of several quantization schemes has been evaluated on older versions of YOLO. These methods may not necessarily yield similar results for YOLOv7 as it utilizes a different architecture. In this paper, we conduct in-depth research on the effectiveness of a variety of quantization schemes on the pre-trained weights of the state-of-the-art YOLOv7 model. Experimental results demonstrate that using 4-bit quantization coupled with the combination of different granularities results in ~3.92x and ~3.86x memory-saving for uniform and non-uniform quantization, respectively, with only 2.5% and 1% accuracy loss compared to the full-precision baseline model.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We offer a novel approach to image composition, which integrates multiple input images into a single, coherent image. Rather than concentrating on specific use cases such as appearance editing (image harmonization) or semantic editing (semantic image composition), we showcase the potential of utilizing the powerful generative prior inherent in large-scale pre-trained diffusion models to accomplish generic image composition applicable to both scenarios. We observe that the pre-trained diffusion models automatically identify simple copy-paste boundary areas as low-density regions during denoising. Building on this insight, we propose to optimize the composed image towards high-density regions guided by the diffusion prior. In addition, we introduce a novel maskguided loss to further enable flexible semantic image composition. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our approach in achieving generic zero-shot image composition. Additionally, our approach shows promising potential in various tasks, such as object removal and multiconcept customization.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, robust, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated Learning is widely employed to tackle distributed sensitive data. Existing methods primarily focus on addressing in-federation data heterogeneity. However, we observed that they suffer from significant performance degradation when applied to unseen clients for out-of-federation (OOF) generalization. The recent attempts to address generalization to unseen clients generally struggle to scale up to large-scale distributed settings due to high communication or computation costs. Moreover, methods that scale well often demonstrate poor generalization capability. To achieve OOF-resiliency in a scalable manner, we propose Topology-aware Federated Learning (TFL) that leverages client topology - a graph representing client relationships - to effectively train robust models against OOF data. We formulate a novel optimization problem for TFL, consisting of two key modules: Client Topology Learning, which infers the client relationships in a privacy-preserving manner, and Learning on Client Topology, which leverages the learned topology to identify influential clients and harness this information into the FL optimization process to efficiently build robust models. Empirical evaluation on a variety of real-world datasets verifies TFL's superior OOF robustness and scalability.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vision Language Models (VLMs) are rapidly advancing in their capability to answer information-seeking questions. As these models are widely deployed in consumer applications, they could lead to new privacy risks due to emergent abilities to identify people in photos, geolocate images, etc. As we demonstrate, somewhat surprisingly, current open-source and proprietary VLMs are very capable image geolocators, making widespread geolocation with VLMs an immediate privacy risk, rather than merely a theoretical future concern. As a first step to address this challenge, we develop a new benchmark, GPTGeoChat, to test the ability of VLMs to moderate geolocation dialogues with users. We collect a set of 1,000 image geolocation conversations between in-house annotators and GPT-4v, which are annotated with the granularity of location information revealed at each turn. Using this new dataset, we evaluate the ability of various VLMs to moderate GPT-4v geolocation conversations by determining when too much location information has been revealed. We find that custom fine-tuned models perform on par with prompted API-based models when identifying leaked location information at the country or city level; however, fine-tuning on supervised data appears to be needed to accurately moderate finer granularities, such as the name of a restaurant or building.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Understanding human intentions (e.g., emotions) from videos has received considerable attention recently. Video streams generally constitute a blend of temporal data stemming from distinct modalities, including natural language, facial expressions, and auditory clues. Despite the impressive advancements of previous works via attention-based paradigms, the inherent temporal asynchrony and modality heterogeneity challenges remain in multimodal sequence fusion, causing adverse performance bottlenecks. To tackle these issues, we propose a Multimodal fusion approach for learning modality-Exclusive and modality-Agnostic representations (MEA) to refine multimodal features and leverage the complementarity across distinct modalities. On the one hand, MEA introduces a predictive self-attention module to capture reliable context dynamics within modalities and reinforce unique features over the modality-exclusive spaces. On the other hand, a hierarchical cross-modal attention module is designed to explore valuable element correlations among modalities over the modality-agnostic space. Meanwhile, a double-discriminator strategy is presented to ensure the production of distinct representations in an adversarial manner. Eventually, we propose a decoupled graph fusion mechanism to enhance knowledge exchange across heterogeneous modalities and learn robust multimodal representations for downstream tasks. Numerous experiments are implemented on three multimodal datasets with asynchronous sequences. Systematic analyses show the necessity of our approach.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Normalizing Flows (NFs) have gained popularity among deep generative models due to their ability to provide exact likelihood estimation and efficient sampling. However, a crucial limitation of NFs is their substantial memory requirements, arising from maintaining the dimension of the latent space equal to that of the input space. Multi-scale architectures bypass this limitation by progressively reducing the dimension of latent variables while ensuring reversibility. Existing multi-scale architectures split the latent variables in a simple, static manner at the channel level, compromising NFs' expressive power. To address this issue, we propose a regularized and feature-dependent $\mathtt{Shuffle}$ operation and integrate it into vanilla multi-scale architecture. This operation heuristically generates channel-wise weights and adaptively shuffles latent variables before splitting them with these weights. We observe that such operation guides the variables to evolve in the direction of entropy increase, hence we refer to NFs with the $\mathtt{Shuffle}$ operation as \emph{Entropy-Informed Weighting Channel Normalizing Flow} (EIW-Flow). Experimental results indicate that the EIW-Flow achieves state-of-the-art density estimation results and comparable sample quality on CIFAR-10, CelebA and ImageNet datasets, with negligible additional computational overhead.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>protect, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world scenarios with the help of recent model compression techniques. Such momentum towards local deployment means the use of compressed LLMs will widely impact a large population. However, prior analysis works often prioritize on preserving perplexity which is a direct analogy to training loss. The impact of compression method on other critical aspects of model behavior, particularly safety, still calls for a systematic assessment. To this end, we investigate the impact of model compression on four dimensions: 1) degeneration harm, i.e., bias and toxicity in generation; 2) representational harm, i.e., biases in discriminative tasks; 3) dialect bias; 4) language modeling and downstream task performance. We cover a wide spectrum of LLM compression techniques, including structured pruning, un/semi-structured ones, and quantization. Our analyses reveal that compression can lead to unexpected consequences. Although compression may unintentionally remedy LLMs' degeneration harm, it can still exacerbate on the representational harm axis. Moreover, there is a divergent impact on different protected groups as the compression rate grows. Finally, different compression methods have drastically different safety impacts, e.g., quantization mostly preserves bias while pruning degrades quickly. Our findings underscore the importance of integrating safety assessments into the development of compressed LLMs to ensure their reliability across real-world applications.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Summarization is a fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP) and since large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and Claude, come out, increasing attention has been paid to long-form summarization whose input sequences are much longer, indicating more information contained. The current evaluation metrics either use similarity-based metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore which rely on similarity and fail to consider informativeness or LLM-based metrics, lacking quantitative analysis of information richness and are rather subjective. In this paper, we propose a new evaluation metric called EVA-Score using Atomic Fact Chain Generation and Document-level Relation Extraction together to automatically calculate the informativeness and give a definite number as an information score. Experiment results show that our metric shows a state-of-the-art correlation with humans. We also re-evaluate the performance of LLMs on long-form summarization comprehensively from the information aspect, forecasting future ways to use LLMs for long-form summarization.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) represents a substantial leap forward in natural language understanding and generation. However, alongside these advancements come significant challenges related to the accountability and transparency of LLM responses. Reliable source attribution is essential to adhering to stringent legal and regulatory standards, including those set forth by the General Data Protection Regulation. Despite the well-established methods in source attribution within the computer vision domain, the application of robust attribution frameworks to natural language processing remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel and versatile TRansformer-based Attribution framework using Contrastive Embeddings called TRACE that, in particular, exploits contrastive learning for source attribution. We perform an extensive empirical evaluation to demonstrate the performance and efficiency of TRACE in various settings and show that TRACE significantly improves the ability to attribute sources accurately, making it a valuable tool for enhancing the reliability and trustworthiness of LLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Treating texts as images, combining prompts with textual labels for prompt tuning, and leveraging the alignment properties of CLIP have been successfully applied in zero-shot multi-label image recognition. Nonetheless, relying solely on textual labels to store visual information is insufficient for representing the diversity of visual objects. In this paper, we propose reversing the training process of CLIP and introducing the concept of Pseudo Visual Prompts. These prompts are initialized for each object category and pre-trained on large-scale, low-cost sentence data generated by large language models. This process mines the aligned visual information in CLIP and stores it in class-specific visual prompts. We then employ contrastive learning to transfer the stored visual information to the textual labels, enhancing their visual representation capacity. Additionally, we introduce a dual-adapter module that simultaneously leverages knowledge from the original CLIP and new learning knowledge derived from downstream datasets. Benefiting from the pseudo visual prompts, our method surpasses the state-of-the-art not only on clean annotated text data but also on pseudo text data generated by large language models.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper presents a data-free, parameter-isolation-based continual learning algorithm we developed for the sequential task continual learning track of the 2nd Greater Bay Area International Algorithm Competition. The method learns an independent parameter subspace for each task within the network's convolutional and linear layers and freezes the batch normalization layers after the first task. Specifically, for domain incremental setting where all domains share a classification head, we freeze the shared classification head after first task is completed, effectively solving the issue of catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, facing the challenge of domain incremental settings without providing a task identity, we designed an inference task identity strategy, selecting an appropriate mask matrix for each sample. Furthermore, we introduced a gradient supplementation strategy to enhance the importance of unselected parameters for the current task, facilitating learning for new tasks. We also implemented an adaptive importance scoring strategy that dynamically adjusts the amount of parameters to optimize single-task performance while reducing parameter usage. Moreover, considering the limitations of storage space and inference time, we designed a mask matrix compression strategy to save storage space and improve the speed of encryption and decryption of the mask matrix. Our approach does not require expanding the core network or using external auxiliary networks or data, and performs well under both task incremental and domain incremental settings. This solution ultimately won a second-place prize in the competition.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Graph classification benchmarks, vital for assessing and developing graph neural networks (GNNs), have recently been scrutinized, as simple methods like MLPs have demonstrated comparable performance. This leads to an important question: Do these benchmarks effectively distinguish the advancements of GNNs over other methodologies? If so, how do we quantitatively measure this effectiveness? In response, we first propose an empirical protocol based on a fair benchmarking framework to investigate the performance discrepancy between simple methods and GNNs. We further propose a novel metric to quantify the dataset effectiveness by considering both dataset complexity and model performance. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to thoroughly study and provide an explicit definition for dataset effectiveness in the graph learning area. Through testing across 16 real-world datasets, we found our metric to align with existing studies and intuitive assumptions. Finally, we explore the causes behind the low effectiveness of certain datasets by investigating the correlation between intrinsic graph properties and class labels, and we developed a novel technique supporting the correlation-controllable synthetic dataset generation. Our findings shed light on the current understanding of benchmark datasets, and our new platform could fuel the future evolution of graph classification benchmarks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper focuses on Federated Domain-Incremental Learning (FDIL) where each client continues to learn incremental tasks where their domain shifts from each other. We propose a novel adaptive knowledge matching-based personalized FDIL approach (pFedDIL) which allows each client to alternatively utilize appropriate incremental task learning strategy on the correlation with the knowledge from previous tasks. More specifically, when a new task arrives, each client first calculates its local correlations with previous tasks. Then, the client can choose to adopt a new initial model or a previous model with similar knowledge to train the new task and simultaneously migrate knowledge from previous tasks based on these correlations. Furthermore, to identify the correlations between the new task and previous tasks for each client, we separately employ an auxiliary classifier to each target classification model and propose sharing partial parameters between the target classification model and the auxiliary classifier to condense model parameters. We conduct extensive experiments on several datasets of which results demonstrate that pFedDIL outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 14.35\% in terms of average accuracy of all tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Research in the NLP sphere of the Turkic counterparts of Central Asian languages, namely Kazakh, Uzbek, Kyrgyz, and Turkmen, comes with the typical challenges of low-resource languages, like data scarcity and a general lack of linguistic resources. However, in the recent years research has greatly advanced via collection of language-specific datasets and development of downstream task technologies. Aiming to summarize this research up until May 2024, this paper also seeks to identify potential areas of future work. To achieve this, the paper gives a broad, high-level overview of the linguistic properties of the languages, the current coverage and performance of already developed technology, application of transfer learning techniques from higher-resource languages, and availability of labeled and unlabeled data for each language. Providing a summary of the current state of affairs, we hope that further research will be facilitated with the considerations we provide in the current paper.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Floods are an increasingly common global threat, causing emergencies and severe damage to infrastructure. During crises, organisations such as the World Food Programme use remotely sensed imagery, typically obtained through drones, for rapid situational analysis to plan life-saving actions. Computer Vision tools are needed to support task force experts on-site in the evaluation of the imagery to improve their efficiency and to allocate resources strategically. We introduce the BlessemFlood21 dataset to stimulate research on efficient flood detection tools. The imagery was acquired during the 2021 Erftstadt-Blessem flooding event and consists of high-resolution and georeferenced RGB-NIR images. In the resulting RGB dataset, the images are supplemented with detailed water masks, obtained via a semi-supervised human-in-the-loop technique, where in particular the NIR information is leveraged to classify pixels as either water or non-water. We evaluate our dataset by training and testing established Deep Learning models for semantic segmentation. With BlessemFlood21 we provide labeled high-resolution RGB data and a baseline for further development of algorithmic solutions tailored to flood detection in RGB imagery.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce PRANCE, a Vision Transformer compression framework that jointly optimizes the activated channels and reduces tokens, based on the characteristics of inputs. Specifically, PRANCE~ leverages adaptive token optimization strategies for a certain computational budget, aiming to accelerate ViTs' inference from a unified data and architectural perspective. However, the joint framework poses challenges to both architectural and decision-making aspects. Firstly, while ViTs inherently support variable-token inference, they do not facilitate dynamic computations for variable channels. To overcome this limitation, we propose a meta-network using weight-sharing techniques to support arbitrary channels of the Multi-head Self-Attention and Multi-layer Perceptron layers, serving as a foundational model for architectural decision-making. Second, simultaneously optimizing the structure of the meta-network and input data constitutes a combinatorial optimization problem with an extremely large decision space, reaching up to around $10^{14}$, making supervised learning infeasible. To this end, we design a lightweight selector employing Proximal Policy Optimization for efficient decision-making. Furthermore, we introduce a novel "Result-to-Go" training mechanism that models ViTs' inference process as a Markov decision process, significantly reducing action space and mitigating delayed-reward issues during training. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of PRANCE~ in reducing FLOPs by approximately 50\%, retaining only about 10\% of tokens while achieving lossless Top-1 accuracy. Additionally, our framework is shown to be compatible with various token optimization techniques such as pruning, merging, and sequential pruning-merging strategies.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Self-improvement through post-training methods such as iterative preference learning has been acclaimed for enhancing the problem-solving capabilities (e.g., mathematical reasoning) of Large Language Models (LLMs) without human intervention. However, as exploration deepens, it becomes crucial to assess whether these improvements genuinely signify progress in solving more challenging problems or if they could lead to unintended regressions. To address this, we propose a comprehensive evaluative framework that goes beyond the superficial pass@1 metric to scrutinize the underlying enhancements of post-training paradigms for self-improvement. Through rigorous experimentation and analysis across diverse problem-solving tasks, the empirical results point out the phenomenon of \emph{self-improvement reversal}, where models showing improved performance across benchmarks will paradoxically exhibit declines in broader, essential capabilities, like output diversity and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. These findings indicate that current self-improvement practices through post-training are inadequate for equipping models to tackle more complex problems. Furthermore, they underscore the necessity of our critical evaluation metrics in discerning the \emph{progress or regress} dichotomy for self-improving LLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) have recently become the leading source of answers for users' questions online. Despite their ability to offer eloquent answers, their accuracy and reliability can pose a significant challenge. This is especially true for sensitive domains such as biomedicine, where there is a higher need for factually correct answers. This paper introduces a biomedical retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system designed to enhance the reliability of generated responses. The system is based on a fine-tuned LLM for the referenced question-answering, where retrieved relevant abstracts from PubMed are passed to LLM's context as input through a prompt. Its output is an answer based on PubMed abstracts, where each statement is referenced accordingly, allowing the users to verify the answer. Our retrieval system achieves an absolute improvement of 23% compared to the PubMed search engine. Based on the manual evaluation on a small sample, our fine-tuned LLM component achieves comparable results to GPT-4 Turbo in referencing relevant abstracts. We make the dataset used to fine-tune the models and the fine-tuned models based on Mistral-7B-instruct-v0.1 and v0.2 publicly available.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are a popular machine learning model with a wide range of applications in graph analytics, including healthcare, transportation, and finance. Similar to other neural networks, a GCN may memorize parts of the training data through its model weights. Thus, when the underlying graph data contains sensitive information such as interpersonal relationships, a GCN trained without privacy-protection measures could be exploited to extract private data, leading to potential violations of privacy regulations such as GDPR. To defend against such attacks, a promising approach is to train the GCN with differential privacy (DP), which is a rigorous framework that provides strong privacy protection by injecting random noise into the trained model weights. However, training a large graph neural network under DP is a highly challenging task. Existing solutions either introduce random perturbations in the graph topology, which leads to severe distortions of the network's message passing, or inject randomness into each neighborhood aggregation operation, which leads to a high noise scale when the GCN performs multiple levels of aggregations. Motivated by this, we propose GCON, a novel and effective solution for training GCNs with edge differential privacy. The main idea is to (i) convert the GCN training process into a convex optimization problem, and then (ii) apply the classic idea of perturbing the objective function to satisfy DP. Extensive experiments using multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate GCON's consistent and superior performance over existing solutions in a wide variety of settings.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Converting different modalities into general text, serving as input prompts for large language models (LLMs), is a common method to align multimodal models when there is limited pairwise data. This text-centric approach leverages the unique properties of text as a modality space, transforming diverse inputs into a unified textual representation. This enables downstream models to effectively interpret various modal inputs. This study assesses the quality and robustness of multimodal representations in the presence of missing entries, noise, or absent modalities, revealing that current text-centric alignment methods compromise downstream robustness. To address this issue, we propose a new text-centric approach that achieves superior robustness compared to previous methods across various modalities in different settings. Our findings highlight the potential of this approach to enhance the robustness and adaptability of multimodal representations, offering a promising solution for dynamic and real-world applications.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this work, we leverage the pure skin color patch from the face image as the additional information to train an auxiliary skin color feature extractor and face recognition model in parallel to improve performance of state-of-the-art (SOTA) privacy-preserving face recognition (PPFR) systems. Our solution is robust against black-box attacking and well-established generative adversarial network (GAN) based image restoration. We analyze the potential risk in previous work, where the proposed cosine similarity computation might directly leak the protected precomputed embedding stored on the server side. We propose a Function Secret Sharing (FSS) based face embedding comparison protocol without any intermediate result leakage. In addition, we show in experiments that the proposed protocol is more efficient compared to the Secret Sharing (SS) based protocol.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Objective: Brain metastases (BMs) are common in cancer patients and determining the primary tumor site is crucial for effective treatment. This study aims to predict the primary tumor site from BM MRI data using radiomic features and advanced machine learning algorithms. Methods: We utilized a comprehensive dataset from Ocana-Tienda et al. (2023) comprising MRI and clinical data from 75 patients with BMs. Radiomic features were extracted from post-contrast T1-weighted MRI sequences. Feature selection was performed using the GINI index, and data normalization was applied to ensure consistent scaling. We developed and evaluated Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers, both with and without hyperparameter optimization using the FOX (Fox optimizer) algorithm. Model interpretability was enhanced using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values. Results: The baseline Random Forest model achieved an accuracy of 0.85, which improved to 0.93 with FOX optimization. The XGBoost model showed an initial accuracy of 0.96, increasing to 0.99 after optimization. SHAP analysis revealed the most influential radiomic features contributing to the models' predictions. The FOX-optimized XGBoost model exhibited the best performance with a precision, recall, and F1-score of 0.99. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the effectiveness of using radiomic features and machine learning to predict primary tumor sites from BM MRI data. The FOX optimization algorithm significantly enhanced model performance, and SHAP provided valuable insights into feature importance. These findings highlight the potential of integrating radiomics and machine learning into clinical practice for improved diagnostic accuracy and personalized treatment planning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent VLMs, pre-trained on large amounts of image-text pairs to align both modalities, have opened the way to open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. Given an arbitrary set of textual queries, image regions are assigned the closest query in feature space. However, the usual setup expects the user to list all possible visual concepts that may occur in the image, typically all classes of benchmark datasets, that act as negatives to each other. We consider here the more challenging scenario of segmenting a single concept, given a textual prompt and nothing else. To achieve good results, besides contrasting with the generic 'background' text, we study different ways to generate query-specific test-time contrastive textual concepts, which leverage either the distribution of text in the VLM's training set or crafted LLM prompts. We show the relevance of our approach using a new, specific metric.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In an era where digital connectivity is increasingly foundational to daily life, the security of Wi-Fi Access Points (APs) is a critical concern. This paper addresses the vulnerabilities inherent in Wi-Fi APs, with a particular focus on those using proprietary file systems like MiniFS found in TP-Link's AC1900 WiFi router. Through reverse engineering, we unravel the structure and operation of MiniFS, marking a significant advancement in our understanding of this previously opaque file system. Our investigation reveals not only the architecture of MiniFS but also identifies several private keys and underscores a concerning lack of cryptographic protection. These findings point to broader security vulnerabilities, emphasizing the risks of security-by-obscurity practices in an interconnected environment. Our contributions are twofold: firstly, based, on the file system structure, we develop a methodology for the extraction and analysis of MiniFS, facilitating the identification and mitigation of potential vulnerabilities. Secondly, our work lays the groundwork for further research into WiFi APs' security, particularly those running on similar proprietary systems. By highlighting the critical need for transparency and community engagement in firmware analysis, this study contributes to the development of more secure network devices, thus enhancing the overall security posture of digital infrastructures.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>federate, diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Despite extensive research into data heterogeneity in federated learning (FL), system heterogeneity remains a significant yet often overlooked challenge. Traditional FL approaches typically assume homogeneous hardware resources across FL clients, implying that clients can train a global model within a comparable time. However, in practical FL systems, clients often have heterogeneous resources, which impacts their capacity for training tasks. This discrepancy highlights the significance of exploring model-heterogeneous FL, a paradigm that allows clients to train different models based on their resource capabilities. To address this, we introduce FedTSA, a cluster-based two-stage aggregation method tailored for system heterogeneity in FL. FedTSA starts by clustering clients based on their capabilities, then conducts a two-stage aggregation, i.e., conventional weight averaging for homogeneous models as Stage 1, and deep mutual learning with a diffusion model for aggregating heterogeneous models as Stage 2. Extensive experiments not only show that FedTSA outperforms the baselines, but also explore various factors influencing model performance, thereby validating FedTSA as a promising approach for model-heterogeneous FL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Neuromorphic sensors, specifically event cameras, revolutionize visual data acquisition by capturing pixel intensity changes with exceptional dynamic range, minimal latency, and energy efficiency, setting them apart from conventional frame-based cameras. The distinctive capabilities of event cameras have ignited significant interest in the domain of event-based action recognition, recognizing their vast potential for advancement. However, the development in this field is currently slowed by the lack of comprehensive, large-scale datasets, which are critical for developing robust recognition frameworks. To bridge this gap, we introduces DailyDVS-200, a meticulously curated benchmark dataset tailored for the event-based action recognition community. DailyDVS-200 is extensive, covering 200 action categories across real-world scenarios, recorded by 47 participants, and comprises more than 22,000 event sequences. This dataset is designed to reflect a broad spectrum of action types, scene complexities, and data acquisition diversity. Each sequence in the dataset is annotated with 14 attributes, ensuring a detailed characterization of the recorded actions. Moreover, DailyDVS-200 is structured to facilitate a wide range of research paths, offering a solid foundation for both validating existing approaches and inspiring novel methodologies. By setting a new benchmark in the field, we challenge the current limitations of neuromorphic data processing and invite a surge of new approaches in event-based action recognition techniques, which paves the way for future explorations in neuromorphic computing and beyond.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Machine learning models trained on vast amounts of real or synthetic data often achieve outstanding predictive performance across various domains. However, this utility comes with increasing concerns about privacy, as the training data may include sensitive information. To address these concerns, machine unlearning has been proposed to erase specific data samples from models. While some unlearning techniques efficiently remove data at low costs, recent research highlights vulnerabilities where malicious users could request unlearning on manipulated data to compromise the model. Despite these attacks' effectiveness, perturbed data differs from original training data, failing hash verification. Existing attacks on machine unlearning also suffer from practical limitations and require substantial additional knowledge and resources. To fill the gaps in current unlearning attacks, we introduce the Unlearning Usability Attack. This model-agnostic, unlearning-agnostic, and budget-friendly attack distills data distribution information into a small set of benign data. These data are identified as benign by automatic poisoning detection tools due to their positive impact on model training. While benign for machine learning, unlearning these data significantly degrades model information. Our evaluation demonstrates that unlearning this benign data, comprising no more than 1% of the total training data, can reduce model accuracy by up to 50%. Furthermore, our findings show that well-prepared benign data poses challenges for recent unlearning techniques, as erasing these synthetic instances demands higher resources than regular data. These insights underscore the need for future research to reconsider "data poisoning" in the context of machine unlearning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Temporal grounding, a.k.a video moment retrieval, aims at locating video segments corresponding to a given query sentence. The compositional nature of natural language enables the localization beyond predefined events, posing a certain challenge to the compositional generalizability of existing methods. Recent studies establish the correspondence between videos and queries through a decompose-reconstruct manner to achieve compositional generalization. However, they only consider dominant primitives and build negative queries through random sampling and recombination, resulting in semantically implausible negatives that hinder the models from learning rational compositions. In addition, recent DETR-based methods still underperform in compositional temporal grounding, showing irrational saliency responses when given negative queries that have subtle differences from positive queries. To address these limitations, we first propose a large language model-driven method for negative query construction, utilizing GPT-3.5-Turbo to generate semantically plausible hard negative queries. Subsequently, we introduce a coarse-to-fine saliency ranking strategy, which encourages the model to learn the multi-granularity semantic relationships between videos and hierarchical negative queries to boost compositional generalization. Extensive experiments on two challenging benchmarks validate the effectiveness and generalizability of our proposed method. Our code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Channel and spatial attentions have respectively brought significant improvements in extracting feature dependencies and spatial structure relations for various downstream vision tasks. While their combination is more beneficial for leveraging their individual strengths, the synergy between channel and spatial attentions has not been fully explored, lacking in fully harness the synergistic potential of multi-semantic information for feature guidance and mitigation of semantic disparities. Our study attempts to reveal the synergistic relationship between spatial and channel attention at multiple semantic levels, proposing a novel Spatial and Channel Synergistic Attention module (SCSA). Our SCSA consists of two parts: the Shareable Multi-Semantic Spatial Attention (SMSA) and the Progressive Channel-wise Self-Attention (PCSA). SMSA integrates multi-semantic information and utilizes a progressive compression strategy to inject discriminative spatial priors into PCSA's channel self-attention, effectively guiding channel recalibration. Additionally, the robust feature interactions based on the self-attention mechanism in PCSA further mitigate the disparities in multi-semantic information among different sub-features within SMSA. We conduct extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets, including classification on ImageNet-1K, object detection on MSCOCO 2017, segmentation on ADE20K, and four other complex scene detection datasets. Our results demonstrate that our proposed SCSA not only surpasses the current state-of-the-art attention but also exhibits enhanced generalization capabilities across various task scenarios.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated learning (FL) enables a collaborative environment for training machine learning models without sharing training data between users. This is typically achieved by aggregating model gradients on a central server. Decentralized federated learning is a rising paradigm that enables users to collaboratively train machine learning models in a peer-to-peer manner, without the need for a central aggregation server. However, before applying decentralized FL in real-world use training environments, nodes that deviate from the FL process (Byzantine nodes) must be considered when selecting an aggregation function. Recent research has focused on Byzantine-robust aggregation for client-server or fully connected networks, but has not yet evaluated such aggregation schemes for complex topologies possible with decentralized FL. Thus, the need for empirical evidence of Byzantine robustness in differing network topologies is evident. This work investigates the effects of state-of-the-art Byzantine-robust aggregation methods in complex, large-scale network structures. We find that state-of-the-art Byzantine robust aggregation strategies are not resilient within large non-fully connected networks. As such, our findings point the field towards the development of topology-aware aggregation schemes, especially necessary within the context of large scale real-world deployment.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Image dehazing, a pivotal task in low-level vision, aims to restore the visibility and detail from hazy images. Many deep learning methods with powerful representation learning capability demonstrate advanced performance on non-homogeneous dehazing, however, these methods usually struggle with processing high-resolution images (e.g., $4000 \times 6000$) due to their heavy computational demands. To address these challenges, we introduce an innovative non-homogeneous Dehazing method via Deformable Convolutional Transformer-like architecture (DehazeDCT). Specifically, we first design a transformer-like network based on deformable convolution v4, which offers long-range dependency and adaptive spatial aggregation capabilities and demonstrates faster convergence and forward speed. Furthermore, we leverage a lightweight Retinex-inspired transformer to achieve color correction and structure refinement. Extensive experiment results and highly competitive performance of our method in NTIRE 2024 Dense and Non-Homogeneous Dehazing Challenge, ranking second among all 16 submissions, demonstrate the superior capability of our proposed method.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In heterogeneous scenarios where the data distribution amongst the Federated Learning (FL) participants is Non-Independent and Identically distributed (Non-IID), FL suffers from the well known problem of data heterogeneity. This leads the performance of FL to be significantly degraded, as the global model tends to struggle to converge. To solve this problem, we propose Differentially Private Synthetic Data Aided Federated Learning Using Foundation Models (DPSDA-FL), a novel data augmentation strategy that aids in homogenizing the local data present on the clients' side. DPSDA-FL improves the training of the local models by leveraging differentially private synthetic data generated from foundation models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by evaluating it on the benchmark image dataset: CIFAR-10. Our experimental results have shown that DPSDA-FL can improve class recall and classification accuracy of the global model by up to 26% and 9%, respectively, in FL with Non-IID issues.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In surgical skill assessment, Objective Structured Assessments of Technical Skills (OSATS scores) and the Global Rating Scale (GRS) are established tools for evaluating the performance of surgeons during training. These metrics, coupled with feedback on their performance, enable surgeons to improve and achieve standards of practice. Recent studies on the open-source dataset JIGSAW, which contains both GRS and OSATS labels, have focused on regressing GRS scores from kinematic signals, video data, or a combination of both. In this paper, we argue that regressing the GRS score, a unitless value, by itself is too restrictive, and variations throughout the surgical trial do not hold significant clinical meaning. To address this gap, we developed a recurrent transformer model that outputs the surgeon's performance throughout their training session by relating the model's hidden states to five OSATS scores derived from kinematic signals. These scores are averaged and aggregated to produce a GRS prediction, enabling assessment of the model's performance against the state-of-the-art (SOTA). We report Spearman's Correlation Coefficient (SCC), demonstrating that our model outperforms SOTA models for all tasks, except for Suturing under the leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) scheme (SCC 0.68-0.89), while achieving comparable performance for suturing and across tasks under the leave-one-user-out (LOUO) scheme (SCC 0.45-0.68) and beating SOTA for Needle Passing (0.69). We argue that relating final OSATS scores to short instances throughout a surgeon's procedure is more clinically meaningful than a single GRS score. This approach also allows us to translate quantitative predictions into qualitative feedback, which is crucial for any automated surgical skill assessment pipeline. A senior surgeon validated our model's behaviour and agreed with the semi-supervised predictions 77 \% (p = 0.006) of the time.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Components of cyber physical systems, which affect real-world processes, are often exposed to the internet. Replacing conventional control methods with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) in energy systems is an active area of research, as these systems become increasingly complex with the advent of renewable energy sources and the desire to improve their efficiency. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are vulnerable to specific perturbations of their inputs or features, called adversarial examples. These perturbations are difficult to detect when properly regularized, but have significant effects on the ANN's output. Because DRL uses ANN to map optimal actions to observations, they are similarly vulnerable to adversarial examples. This work proposes a novel attack technique for continuous control using Group Difference Logits loss with a bifurcation layer. By combining aspects of targeted and untargeted attacks, the attack significantly increases the impact compared to an untargeted attack, with drastically smaller distortions than an optimally targeted attack. We demonstrate the impacts of powerful gradient-based attacks in a realistic smart energy environment, show how the impacts change with different DRL agents and training procedures, and use statistical and time-series analysis to evaluate attacks' stealth. The results show that adversarial attacks can have significant impacts on DRL controllers, and constraining an attack's perturbations makes it difficult to detect. However, certain DRL architectures are far more robust, and robust training methods can further reduce the impact.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose Curriculum by Masking (CBM), a novel state-of-the-art curriculum learning strategy that effectively creates an easy-to-hard training schedule via patch (token) masking, offering significant accuracy improvements over the conventional training regime and previous curriculum learning (CL) methods. CBM leverages gradient magnitudes to prioritize the masking of salient image regions via a novel masking algorithm and a novel masking block. Our approach enables controlling sample difficulty via the patch masking ratio, generating an effective easy-to-hard curriculum by gradually introducing harder samples as training progresses. CBM operates with two easily configurable parameters, i.e. the number of patches and the curriculum schedule, making it a versatile curriculum learning approach for object recognition and detection. We conduct experiments with various neural architectures, ranging from convolutional networks to vision transformers, on five benchmark data sets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, Food-101 and PASCAL VOC), to compare CBM with conventional as well as curriculum-based training regimes. Our results reveal the superiority of our strategy compared with the state-of-the-art curriculum learning regimes. We also observe improvements in transfer learning contexts, where CBM surpasses previous work by considerable margins in terms of accuracy.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As the number and sophistication of cyber attacks have increased, threat hunting has become a critical aspect of active security, enabling proactive detection and mitigation of threats before they cause significant harm. Open-source cyber threat intelligence (OS-CTI) is a valuable resource for threat hunters, however, it often comes in unstructured formats that require further manual analysis. Previous studies aimed at automating OSCTI analysis are limited since (1) they failed to provide actionable outputs, (2) they did not take advantage of images present in OSCTI sources, and (3) they focused on on-premises environments, overlooking the growing importance of cloud environments. To address these gaps, we propose LLMCloudHunter, a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate generic-signature detection rule candidates from textual and visual OSCTI data. We evaluated the quality of the rules generated by the proposed framework using 12 annotated real-world cloud threat reports. The results show that our framework achieved a precision of 92% and recall of 98% for the task of accurately extracting API calls made by the threat actor and a precision of 99% with a recall of 98% for IoCs. Additionally, 99.18% of the generated detection rule candidates were successfully compiled and converted into Splunk queries.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper introduces Helios, the first extremely low-power, real-time, event-based hand gesture recognition system designed for all-day on smart eyewear. As augmented reality (AR) evolves, current smart glasses like the Meta Ray-Bans prioritize visual and wearable comfort at the expense of functionality. Existing human-machine interfaces (HMIs) in these devices, such as capacitive touch and voice controls, present limitations in ergonomics, privacy and power consumption. Helios addresses these challenges by leveraging natural hand interactions for a more intuitive and comfortable user experience. Our system utilizes a extremely low-power and compact 3mmx4mm/20mW event camera to perform natural hand-based gesture recognition for always-on smart eyewear. The camera's output is processed by a convolutional neural network (CNN) running on a NXP Nano UltraLite compute platform, consuming less than 350mW. Helios can recognize seven classes of gestures, including subtle microgestures like swipes and pinches, with 91% accuracy. We also demonstrate real-time performance across 20 users at a remarkably low latency of 60ms. Our user testing results align with the positive feedback we received during our recent successful demo at AWE-USA-2024.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generating images from hand-drawings is a crucial and fundamental task in content creation. The translation is challenging due to the infinite possibilities and the diverse expectations of users. However, traditional methods are often limited by the availability of training data. Therefore, VisioBlend, a unified framework supporting three-dimensional control over image synthesis from sketches and strokes based on diffusion models, is proposed. It enables users to decide the level of faithfulness to the input strokes and sketches. VisioBlend achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of realism and flexibility, enabling various applications in image synthesis from sketches and strokes. It solves the problem of data availability by synthesizing new data points from hand-drawn sketches and strokes, enriching the dataset and enabling more robust and diverse image synthesis. This work showcases the power of diffusion models in image creation, offering a user-friendly and versatile approach for turning artistic visions into reality.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The advent of clinical language models integrated into electronic health records (EHR) for clinical decision support has marked a significant advancement, leveraging the depth of clinical notes for improved decision-making. Despite their success, the potential vulnerabilities of these models remain largely unexplored. This paper delves into the realm of backdoor attacks on clinical language models, introducing an innovative attention-based backdoor attack method, BadCLM (Bad Clinical Language Models). This technique clandestinely embeds a backdoor within the models, causing them to produce incorrect predictions when a pre-defined trigger is present in inputs, while functioning accurately otherwise. We demonstrate the efficacy of BadCLM through an in-hospital mortality prediction task with MIMIC III dataset, showcasing its potential to compromise model integrity. Our findings illuminate a significant security risk in clinical decision support systems and pave the way for future endeavors in fortifying clinical language models against such vulnerabilities.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Using large language models (LLMs) for automatic evaluation has become an important evaluation method in NLP research. However, it is unclear whether these LLM-based evaluators can be applied in real-world classrooms to assess student assignments. This empirical report shares how we use GPT-4 as an automatic assignment evaluator in a university course with 1,028 students. Based on student responses, we find that LLM-based assignment evaluators are generally acceptable to students when students have free access to these LLM-based evaluators. However, students also noted that the LLM sometimes fails to adhere to the evaluation instructions. Additionally, we observe that students can easily manipulate the LLM-based evaluator to output specific strings, allowing them to achieve high scores without meeting the assignment rubric. Based on student feedback and our experience, we provide several recommendations for integrating LLM-based evaluators into future classrooms.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Self-supervised learning for pre-training (SSP) can help the network learn better low-level features, especially when the size of the training set is small. In contrastive pre-training, the network is pre-trained to distinguish between different versions of the input. For example, the network learns to distinguish pairs (original, rotated) of images where the rotated image was rotated by angle $\theta$ vs. other pairs of images. In this work, we show that, when training using contrastive pre-training in this way, the angle $\theta$ and the dataset interact in interesting ways. We hypothesize, and give some evidence, that, for some datasets, the network can take "shortcuts" for particular rotation angles $\theta$ based on the distribution of the gradient directions in the input, possibly avoiding learning features other than edges, but our experiments do not seem to support that hypothesis. We demonstrate experiments on three radiology datasets. We compute the saliency map indicating which pixels were important in the SSP process, and compare the saliency map to the ground truth foreground/background segmentation. Our visualizations indicate that the effects of rotation angles in SSP are dataset-dependent. We believe the distribution of gradient orientations may play a role in this, but our experiments so far are inconclusive.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Emotion mining has become a crucial tool for understanding human emotions during disasters, leveraging the extensive data generated on social media platforms. This paper aims to summarize existing research on emotion mining within disaster contexts, highlighting both significant discoveries and persistent issues. On the one hand, emotion mining techniques have achieved acceptable accuracy enabling applications such as rapid damage assessment and mental health surveillance. On the other hand, with many studies adopting data-driven approaches, several methodological issues remain. These include arbitrary emotion classification, ignoring biases inherent in data collection from social media, such as the overrepresentation of individuals from higher socioeconomic status on Twitter, and the lack of application of theoretical frameworks like cross-cultural comparisons. These problems can be summarized as a notable lack of theory-driven research and ignoring insights from social and behavioral sciences. This paper underscores the need for interdisciplinary collaboration between computer scientists and social scientists to develop more robust and theoretically grounded approaches in emotion mining. By addressing these gaps, we aim to enhance the effectiveness and reliability of emotion mining methodologies, ultimately contributing to improved disaster preparedness, response, and recovery.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Visual tracking has advanced significantly in recent years, mainly due to the availability of large-scale training datasets. These datasets have enabled the development of numerous algorithms that can track objects with high accuracy and robustness.However, the majority of current research has been directed towards tracking generic objects, with less emphasis on more specialized and challenging scenarios. One such challenging scenario involves tracking reflected objects. Reflections can significantly distort the appearance of objects, creating ambiguous visual cues that complicate the tracking process. This issue is particularly pertinent in applications such as autonomous driving, security, smart homes, and industrial production, where accurately tracking objects reflected in surfaces like mirrors or glass is crucial. To address this gap, we introduce TRO, a benchmark specifically for Tracking Reflected Objects. TRO includes 200 sequences with around 70,000 frames, each carefully annotated with bounding boxes. This dataset aims to encourage the development of new, accurate methods for tracking reflected objects, which present unique challenges not sufficiently covered by existing benchmarks. We evaluated 20 state-of-the-art trackers and found that they struggle with the complexities of reflections. To provide a stronger baseline, we propose a new tracker, HiP-HaTrack, which uses hierarchical features to improve performance, significantly outperforming existing algorithms. We believe our benchmark, evaluation, and HiP-HaTrack will inspire further research and applications in tracking reflected objects. The TRO and code are available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) refers to a family of optimization algorithms that provide a guaranteed level of differential privacy (DP) through DP accounting techniques. However, current accounting techniques make assumptions that diverge significantly from practical DP-SGD implementations. For example, they may assume the loss function is Lipschitz continuous and convex, sample the batches randomly with replacement, or omit the gradient clipping step. In this work, we analyze the most commonly used variant of DP-SGD, in which we sample batches cyclically with replacement, perform gradient clipping, and only release the last DP-SGD iterate. More specifically - without assuming convexity, smoothness, or Lipschitz continuity of the loss function - we establish new Rényi differential privacy (RDP) bounds for the last DP-SGD iterate under the mild assumption that (i) the DP-SGD stepsize is small relative to the topological constants in the loss function, and (ii) the loss function is weakly-convex. Moreover, we show that our bounds converge to previously established convex bounds when the weak-convexity parameter of the objective function approaches zero. In the case of non-Lipschitz smooth loss functions, we provide a weaker bound that scales well in terms of the number of DP-SGD iterations.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>3D single object tracking (SOT) methods based on appearance matching has long suffered from insufficient appearance information incurred by incomplete, textureless and semantically deficient LiDAR point clouds. While motion paradigm exploits motion cues instead of appearance matching for tracking, it incurs complex multi-stage processing and segmentation module. In this paper, we first provide in-depth explorations on motion paradigm, which proves that (\textbf{i}) it is feasible to directly infer target relative motion from point clouds across consecutive frames; (\textbf{ii}) fine-grained information comparison between consecutive point clouds facilitates target motion modeling. We thereby propose to perform part-to-part motion modeling for consecutive point clouds and introduce a novel tracking framework, termed \textbf{P2P}. The novel framework fuses each corresponding part information between consecutive point clouds, effectively exploring detailed information changes and thus modeling accurate target-related motion cues. Following this framework, we present P2P-point and P2P-voxel models, incorporating implicit and explicit part-to-part motion modeling by point- and voxel-based representation, respectively. Without bells and whistles, P2P-voxel sets a new state-of-the-art performance ($\sim$\textbf{89\%}, \textbf{72\%} and \textbf{63\%} precision on KITTI, NuScenes and Waymo Open Dataset, respectively). Moreover, under the same point-based representation, P2P-point outperforms the previous motion tracker M$^2$Track by \textbf{3.3\%} and \textbf{6.7\%} on the KITTI and NuScenes, while running at a considerably high speed of \textbf{107 Fps} on a single RTX3090 GPU.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Combining machine clustering with deep models has shown remarkable superiority in deep clustering. It modifies the data processing pipeline into two alternating phases: feature clustering and model training. However, such alternating schedule may lead to instability and computational burden issues. We propose a centerless clustering algorithm called Probability Aggregation Clustering (PAC) to proactively adapt deep learning technologies, enabling easy deployment in online deep clustering. PAC circumvents the cluster center and aligns the probability space and distribution space by formulating clustering as an optimization problem with a novel objective function. Based on the computation mechanism of the PAC, we propose a general online probability aggregation module to perform stable and flexible feature clustering over mini-batch data and further construct a deep visual clustering framework deep PAC (DPAC). Extensive experiments demonstrate that PAC has superior clustering robustness and performance and DPAC remarkably outperforms the state-of-the-art deep clustering methods.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The existing barely-supervised medical image segmentation (BSS) methods, adopting a registration-segmentation paradigm, aim to learn from data with very few annotations to mitigate the extreme label scarcity problem. However, this paradigm poses a challenge: pseudo-labels generated by image registration come with significant noise. To address this issue, we propose a self-paced sample selection framework (SPSS) for BSS. Specifically, SPSS comprises two main components: 1) self-paced uncertainty sample selection (SU) for explicitly improving the quality of pseudo labels in the image space, and 2) self-paced bidirectional feature contrastive learning (SC) for implicitly improving the quality of pseudo labels through enhancing the separability between class semantics in the feature space. Both SU and SC are trained collaboratively in a self-paced learning manner, ensuring that SPSS can learn from high-quality pseudo labels for BSS. Extensive experiments on two public medical image segmentation datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of SPSS over the state-of-the-art. Our code is release at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to clinical decision-making. However, their potential to exhibit bias poses significant risks to clinical equity. Currently, there is a lack of benchmarks that systematically evaluate such clinical bias in LLMs. While in downstream tasks, some biases of LLMs can be avoided such as by instructing the model to answer "I'm not sure...", the internal bias hidden within the model still lacks deep studies. We introduce CLIMB (shorthand for A Benchmark of Clinical Bias in Large Language Models), a pioneering comprehensive benchmark to evaluate both intrinsic (within LLMs) and extrinsic (on downstream tasks) bias in LLMs for clinical decision tasks. Notably, for intrinsic bias, we introduce a novel metric, AssocMAD, to assess the disparities of LLMs across multiple demographic groups. Additionally, we leverage counterfactual intervention to evaluate extrinsic bias in a task of clinical diagnosis prediction. Our experiments across popular and medically adapted LLMs, particularly from the Mistral and LLaMA families, unveil prevalent behaviors with both intrinsic and extrinsic bias. This work underscores the critical need to mitigate clinical bias and sets a new standard for future evaluations of LLMs' clinical bias.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present CLAMP-ViT, a data-free post-training quantization method for vision transformers (ViTs). We identify the limitations of recent techniques, notably their inability to leverage meaningful inter-patch relationships, leading to the generation of simplistic and semantically vague data, impacting quantization accuracy. CLAMP-ViT employs a two-stage approach, cyclically adapting between data generation and model quantization. Specifically, we incorporate a patch-level contrastive learning scheme to generate richer, semantically meaningful data. Furthermore, we leverage contrastive learning in layer-wise evolutionary search for fixed- and mixed-precision quantization to identify optimal quantization parameters while mitigating the effects of a non-smooth loss landscape. Extensive evaluations across various vision tasks demonstrate the superiority of CLAMP-ViT, with performance improvements of up to 3% in top-1 accuracy for classification, 0.6 mAP for object detection, and 1.5 mIoU for segmentation at similar or better compression ratio over existing alternatives.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recently, the transform-based tensor representation has attracted increasing attention in multimedia data (e.g., images and videos) recovery problems, which consists of two indispensable components, i.e., transform and characterization. Previously, the development of transform-based tensor representation mainly focuses on the transform aspect. Although several attempts consider using shallow matrix factorization (e.g., singular value decomposition and negative matrix factorization) to characterize the frontal slices of transformed tensor (termed as latent tensor), the faithful characterization aspect is underexplored. To address this issue, we propose a unified Deep Tensor Representation (termed as DTR) framework by synergistically combining the deep latent generative module and the deep transform module. Especially, the deep latent generative module can faithfully generate the latent tensor as compared with shallow matrix factorization. The new DTR framework not only allows us to better understand the classic shallow representations, but also leads us to explore new representation. To examine the representation ability of the proposed DTR, we consider the representative multi-dimensional data recovery task and suggest an unsupervised DTR-based multi-dimensional data recovery model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DTR achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative aspects, especially for fine details recovery.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The training of large models, involving fine-tuning, faces the scarcity of high-quality data. Compared to the solutions based on centralized data centers, updating large models in the Internet of Things (IoT) faces challenges in coordinating knowledge from distributed clients by using their private and heterogeneous data. To tackle such a challenge, we propose KOALA (Federated Knowledge Transfer Fine-tuning Large Server Model with Resource-Constrained IoT Clients) to impel the training of large models in IoT. Since the resources obtained by IoT clients are limited and restricted, it is infeasible to locally execute large models and also update them in a privacy-preserving manner. Therefore, we leverage federated learning and knowledge distillation to update large models through collaboration with their small models, which can run locally at IoT clients to process their private data separately and enable large-small model knowledge transfer through iterative learning between the server and clients. Moreover, to support clients with similar or different computing capacities, KOALA is designed with two kinds of large-small model joint learning modes, namely to be homogeneous or heterogeneous. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to the conventional approach, our method can not only achieve similar training performance but also significantly reduce the need for local storage and computing power resources.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Name-based gender prediction has traditionally categorized individuals as either female or male based on their names, using a binary classification system. That binary approach can be problematic in the cases of gender-neutral names that do not align with any one gender, among other reasons. Relying solely on binary gender categories without recognizing gender-neutral names can reduce the inclusiveness of gender prediction tasks. We introduce an additional gender category, i.e., "neutral", to study and address potential gender biases in Large Language Models (LLMs). We evaluate the performance of several foundational and large language models in predicting gender based on first names only. Additionally, we investigate the impact of adding birth years to enhance the accuracy of gender prediction, accounting for shifting associations between names and genders over time. Our findings indicate that most LLMs identify male and female names with high accuracy (over 80%) but struggle with gender-neutral names (under 40%), and the accuracy of gender prediction is higher for English-based first names than non-English names. The experimental results show that incorporating the birth year does not improve the overall accuracy of gender prediction, especially for names with evolving gender associations. We recommend using caution when applying LLMs for gender identification in downstream tasks, particularly when dealing with non-binary gender labels.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In traditional neural network architectures, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) is typically employed as a classification block following the feature extraction stage. However, the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) presents a promising alternative to MLP, offering the potential to enhance prediction accuracy. In this paper, we propose the replacement of linear and convolutional layers of traditional networks with KAN-based counterparts. These modifications allowed us to significantly increase the per-pixel classification accuracy for hyperspectral remote-sensing images. We modified seven different neural network architectures for hyperspectral image classification and observed a substantial improvement in the classification accuracy across all the networks. The architectures considered in the paper include baseline MLP, state-of-the-art 1D (1DCNN) and 3D convolutional (two different 3DCNN, NM3DCNN), and transformer (SSFTT) architectures, as well as newly proposed M1DCNN. The greatest effect was achieved for convolutional networks working exclusively on spectral data, and the best classification quality was achieved using a KAN-based transformer architecture. All the experiments were conducted using seven openly available hyperspectral datasets. Our code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper presents UltraEdit, a large-scale (approximately 4 million editing samples), automatically generated dataset for instruction-based image editing. Our key idea is to address the drawbacks in existing image editing datasets like InstructPix2Pix and MagicBrush, and provide a systematic approach to producing massive and high-quality image editing samples. UltraEdit offers several distinct advantages: 1) It features a broader range of editing instructions by leveraging the creativity of large language models (LLMs) alongside in-context editing examples from human raters; 2) Its data sources are based on real images, including photographs and artworks, which provide greater diversity and reduced bias compared to datasets solely generated by text-to-image models; 3) It also supports region-based editing, enhanced by high-quality, automatically produced region annotations. Our experiments show that canonical diffusion-based editing baselines trained on UltraEdit set new records on MagicBrush and Emu-Edit benchmarks. Our analysis further confirms the crucial role of real image anchors and region-based editing data. The dataset, code, and models can be found in this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Unsupervised monocular depth estimation frameworks have shown promising performance in autonomous driving. However, existing solutions primarily rely on a simple convolutional neural network for ego-motion recovery, which struggles to estimate precise camera poses in dynamic, complicated real-world scenarios. These inaccurately estimated camera poses can inevitably deteriorate the photometric reconstruction and mislead the depth estimation networks with wrong supervisory signals. In this article, we introduce SCIPaD, a novel approach that incorporates spatial clues for unsupervised depth-pose joint learning. Specifically, a confidence-aware feature flow estimator is proposed to acquire 2D feature positional translations and their associated confidence levels. Meanwhile, we introduce a positional clue aggregator, which integrates pseudo 3D point clouds from DepthNet and 2D feature flows into homogeneous positional representations. Finally, a hierarchical positional embedding injector is proposed to selectively inject spatial clues into semantic features for robust camera pose decoding. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate the superior performance of our model compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Remarkably, SCIPaD achieves a reduction of 22.2\% in average translation error and 34.8\% in average angular error for camera pose estimation task on the KITTI Odometry dataset.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, protect, defense, attack, robust, federate, diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent years have witnessed the vulnerability of Federated Learning (FL) against gradient leakage attacks, where the private training data can be recovered from the exchanged gradients, making gradient protection a critical issue for the FL training process. Existing solutions often resort to perturbation-based mechanisms, such as differential privacy, where each participating client injects a specific amount of noise into local gradients before aggregating to the server, and the global distribution variation finally conceals the gradient privacy. However, perturbation is not always the panacea for gradient protection since the robustness heavily relies on the injected noise. This intuition raises an interesting question: \textit{is it possible to deactivate existing protection mechanisms by removing the perturbation inside the gradients?} In this paper, we present the answer: \textit{yes} and propose the Perturbation-resilient Gradient Leakage Attack (PGLA), the first attempt to recover the perturbed gradients, without additional access to the original model structure or third-party data. Specifically, we leverage the inherent diffusion property of gradient perturbation protection and construct a novel diffusion-based denoising model to implement PGLA. Our insight is that capturing the disturbance level of perturbation during the diffusion reverse process can release the gradient denoising capability, which promotes the diffusion model to generate approximate gradients as the original clean version through adaptive sampling steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PGLA effectively recovers the protected gradients and exposes the FL training process to the threat of gradient leakage, achieving the best quality in gradient denoising and data recovery compared to existing models. We hope to arouse public attention on PGLA and its defense.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs) over time is crucial in many disciplines such as personalized medicine. For example, electronic health records are commonly collected over several time periods and then used to personalize treatment decisions. Existing works for this task have mostly focused on model-based learners (i.e., learners that adapt specific machine-learning models). In contrast, model-agnostic learners -- so-called meta-learners -- are largely unexplored. In our paper, we propose several meta-learners that are model-agnostic and thus can be used in combination with arbitrary machine learning models (e.g., transformers) to estimate HTEs over time. Here, our focus is on learners that can be obtained via weighted pseudo-outcome regressions, which allows for efficient estimation by targeting the treatment effect directly. We then provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis that characterizes the different learners and that allows us to offer insights into when specific learners are preferable. Finally, we confirm our theoretical insights through numerical experiments. In sum, while meta-learners are already state-of-the-art for the static setting, we are the first to propose a comprehensive set of meta-learners for estimating HTEs in the time-varying setting.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Irregular and asynchronous event sequences are prevalent in many domains, such as social media, finance, and healthcare. Traditional temporal point processes (TPPs), like Hawkes processes, often struggle to model mutual inhibition and nonlinearity effectively. While recent neural network models, including RNNs and Transformers, address some of these issues, they still face challenges with long-term dependencies and computational efficiency. In this paper, we introduce the Mamba Hawkes Process (MHP), which leverages the Mamba state space architecture to capture long-range dependencies and dynamic event interactions. Our results show that MHP outperforms existing models across various datasets. Additionally, we propose the Mamba Hawkes Process Extension (MHP-E), which combines Mamba and Transformer models to enhance predictive capabilities. We present the novel application of the Mamba architecture to Hawkes processes, a flexible and extensible model structure, and a theoretical analysis of the synergy between state space models and Hawkes processes. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of both MHP and MHP-E, advancing the field of temporal point process modeling.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep learning has shown its efficacy in extracting useful features to solve various computer vision tasks. However, when the structure of the data is complex and noisy, capturing effective information to improve performance is very difficult. To this end, topological data analysis (TDA) has been utilized to derive useful representations that can contribute to improving performance and robustness against perturbations. Despite its effectiveness, the requirements for large computational resources and significant time consumption in extracting topological features through TDA are critical problems when implementing it on small devices. To address this issue, we propose a framework called Topological Guidance-based Knowledge Distillation (TGD), which uses topological features in knowledge distillation (KD) for image classification tasks. We utilize KD to train a superior lightweight model and provide topological features with multiple teachers simultaneously. We introduce a mechanism for integrating features from different teachers and reducing the knowledge gap between teachers and the student, which aids in improving performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through diverse empirical evaluations.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection (SCVD) is crucial to guarantee the quality of blockchain-based systems. Graph neural networks have been shown to be effective in learning semantic representations of smart contract code and are commonly adopted by existing deep learning-based SCVD. However, the current methods still have limitations in their utilization of graph sampling or subgraph pooling based on predefined rules for extracting crucial components from structure graphs of smart contract code. These predefined rule-based strategies, typically designed using static rules or heuristics, demonstrate limited adaptability to dynamically adjust extraction strategies according to the structure and content of the graph in heterogeneous topologies of smart contract code. Consequently, these strategies may not possess universal applicability to all smart contracts, potentially leading to false positives or omissions. To address these problems, we propose AFPNet, a novel vulnerability detection model equipped with a feature perception module that has dynamic weights for comprehensive scanning of the entire smart contract code and automatic extraction of crucial code snippets (the $P$ snippets with the largest weights). Subsequently, the relationship perception attention module employs an attention mechanism to learn dependencies among these code snippets and detect smart contract vulnerabilities. The efforts made by AFPNet consistently enable the capture of crucial code snippets and enhance the performance of SCVD optimization. We conduct an evaluation of AFPNet in the several large-scale datasets with vulnerability labels. The experimental results show that our AFPNet significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approach by 6.38\%-14.02\% in term of F1-score. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of AFPNet in dynamically extracting valuable information and vulnerability detection.</li>

Unfortunately, this paper first identifies a critical issue in the existing settings of NMT targeted adversarial attacks, where their attacking results are largely overestimated. To this end, this paper presents a new setting for NMT targeted adversarial attacks that could lead to reliable attacking results. Under the new setting, it then proposes a Targeted Word Gradient adversarial Attack (TWGA) method to craft adversarial examples. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed setting could provide faithful attacking results for targeted adversarial attacks on NMT systems, and the proposed TWGA method can effectively attack such victim NMT systems. In-depth analyses on a large-scale dataset further illustrate some valuable findings. 1 Our code and data are available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Estimating the difficulty of multiple-choice questions would be great help for educators who must spend substantial time creating and piloting stimuli for their tests, and for learners who want to practice. Supervised approaches to difficulty estimation have yielded to date mixed results. In this contribution we leverage an aspect of generative large models which might be seen as a weakness when answering questions, namely their uncertainty, and exploit it towards exploring correlations between two different metrics of uncertainty, and the actual student response distribution. While we observe some present but weak correlations, we also discover that the models' behaviour is different in the case of correct vs wrong answers, and that correlations differ substantially according to the different question types which are included in our fine-grained, previously unused dataset of 451 questions from a Biopsychology course. In discussing our findings, we also suggest potential avenues to further leverage model uncertainty as an additional proxy for item difficulty.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recently, diffusion models have increasingly demonstrated their capabilities in vision understanding. By leveraging prompt-based learning to construct sentences, these models have shown proficiency in classification and visual grounding tasks. However, existing approaches primarily showcase their ability to perform sentence-level localization, leaving the potential for leveraging contextual information for phrase-level understanding largely unexplored. In this paper, we utilize Panoptic Narrative Grounding (PNG) as a proxy task to investigate this capability further. PNG aims to segment object instances mentioned by multiple noun phrases within a given narrative text. Specifically, we introduce the DiffPNG framework, a straightforward yet effective approach that fully capitalizes on the diffusion's architecture for segmentation by decomposing the process into a sequence of localization, segmentation, and refinement steps. The framework initially identifies anchor points using cross-attention mechanisms and subsequently performs segmentation with self-attention to achieve zero-shot PNG. Moreover, we introduce a refinement module based on SAM to enhance the quality of the segmentation masks. Our extensive experiments on the PNG dataset demonstrate that DiffPNG achieves strong performance in the zero-shot PNG task setting, conclusively proving the diffusion model's capability for context-aware, phrase-level understanding.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are flourishing, but mainly focus on images with less attention than videos, especially in sub-fields such as prompt engineering, video chain-of-thought (CoT), and instruction tuning on videos. Therefore, we try to explore the collection of CoT datasets in videos to lead to video OpenQA and improve the reasoning ability of MLLMs. Unfortunately, making such video CoT datasets is not an easy task. Given that human annotation is too cumbersome and expensive, while machine-generated is not reliable due to the hallucination issue, we develop an automatic annotation tool that combines machine and human experts, under the active learning paradigm. Active learning is an interactive strategy between the model and human experts, in this way, the workload of human labeling can be reduced and the quality of the dataset can be guaranteed. With the help of the automatic annotation tool, we strive to contribute three datasets, namely VideoCoT, TopicQA, TopicCoT. Furthermore, we propose a simple but effective benchmark based on the collected datasets, which exploits CoT to maximize the complex reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness our solution.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Audio-visual segmentation (AVS) is an emerging task that aims to accurately segment sounding objects based on audio-visual cues. The success of AVS learning systems depends on the effectiveness of cross-modal interaction. Such a requirement can be naturally fulfilled by leveraging transformer-based segmentation architecture due to its inherent ability to capture long-range dependencies and flexibility in handling different modalities. However, the inherent training issues of transformer-based methods, such as the low efficacy of cross-attention and unstable bipartite matching, can be amplified in AVS, particularly when the learned audio query does not provide a clear semantic clue. In this paper, we address these two issues with the new Class-conditional Prompting Machine (CPM). CPM improves the bipartite matching with a learning strategy combining class-agnostic queries with class-conditional queries. The efficacy of cross-modal attention is upgraded with new learning objectives for the audio, visual and joint modalities. We conduct experiments on AVS benchmarks, demonstrating that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) segmentation accuracy.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>3D referring expression comprehension (3DREC) and segmentation (3DRES) have overlapping objectives, indicating their potential for collaboration. However, existing collaborative approaches predominantly depend on the results of one task to make predictions for the other, limiting effective collaboration. We argue that employing separate branches for 3DREC and 3DRES tasks enhances the model's capacity to learn specific information for each task, enabling them to acquire complementary knowledge. Thus, we propose the MCLN framework, which includes independent branches for 3DREC and 3DRES tasks. This enables dedicated exploration of each task and effective coordination between the branches. Furthermore, to facilitate mutual reinforcement between these branches, we introduce a Relative Superpoint Aggregation (RSA) module and an Adaptive Soft Alignment (ASA) module. These modules significantly contribute to the precise alignment of prediction results from the two branches, directing the module to allocate increased attention to key positions. Comprehensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the 3DREC and 3DRES tasks, with an increase of 3.27% in Acc@0.5 for 3DREC and 5.22% in mIOU for 3DRES.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Tabular data have been playing a mostly important role in diverse real-world fields, such as healthcare, engineering, finance, etc. With the recent success of deep learning, many tabular machine learning (ML) methods based on deep networks (e.g., Transformer, ResNet) have achieved competitive performance on tabular benchmarks. However, existing deep tabular ML methods suffer from the representation entanglement and localization, which largely hinders their prediction performance and leads to performance inconsistency on tabular tasks. To overcome these problems, we explore a novel direction of applying prototype learning for tabular ML and propose a prototype-based tabular representation learning framework, PTaRL, for tabular prediction tasks. The core idea of PTaRL is to construct prototype-based projection space (P-Space) and learn the disentangled representation around global data prototypes. Specifically, PTaRL mainly involves two stages: (i) Prototype Generation, that constructs global prototypes as the basis vectors of P-Space for representation, and (ii) Prototype Projection, that projects the data samples into P-Space and keeps the core global data information via Optimal Transport. Then, to further acquire the disentangled representations, we constrain PTaRL with two strategies: (i) to diversify the coordinates towards global prototypes of different representations within P-Space, we bring up a diversification constraint for representation calibration; (ii) to avoid prototype entanglement in P-Space, we introduce a matrix orthogonalization constraint to ensure the independence of global prototypes. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments in PTaRL coupled with state-of-the-art deep tabular ML models on various tabular benchmarks and the results have shown our consistent superiority.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The development of multimodal models has significantly advanced multimodal sentiment analysis and emotion recognition. However, in real-world applications, the presence of various missing modality cases often leads to a degradation in the model's performance. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal Transformer framework using prompt learning to address the issue of missing modalities. Our method introduces three types of prompts: generative prompts, missing-signal prompts, and missing-type prompts. These prompts enable the generation of missing modality features and facilitate the learning of intra- and inter-modality information. Through prompt learning, we achieve a substantial reduction in the number of trainable parameters. Our proposed method outperforms other methods significantly across all evaluation metrics. Extensive experiments and ablation studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method, showcasing its ability to effectively handle missing modalities.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>explainability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Continuous learning from an immense volume of data streams becomes exceptionally critical in the internet era. However, data streams often do not conform to the same distribution over time, leading to a phenomenon called concept drift. Since a fixed static model is unreliable for inferring concept-drifted data streams, establishing an adaptive mechanism for detecting concept drift is crucial. Current methods for concept drift detection primarily assume that the labels or error rates of downstream models are given and/or underlying statistical properties exist in data streams. These approaches, however, struggle to address high-dimensional data streams with intricate irregular distribution shifts, which are more prevalent in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose MCD-DD, a novel concept drift detection method based on maximum concept discrepancy, inspired by the maximum mean discrepancy. Our method can adaptively identify varying forms of concept drift by contrastive learning of concept embeddings without relying on labels or statistical properties. With thorough experiments under synthetic and real-world scenarios, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing baselines in identifying concept drifts and enables qualitative analysis with high explainability.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, extraction, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recently, the surge in the adoption of single-stream architectures utilizing pre-trained ViT backbones represents a promising advancement in the field of generic visual tracking. By integrating feature extraction and fusion into a cohesive framework, these architectures offer improved performance, efficiency, and robustness. However, there has been limited exploration into optimizing these frameworks for UAV tracking. In this paper, we boost the efficiency of this framework by tailoring it into an adaptive computation framework that dynamically exits Transformer blocks for real-time UAV tracking. The motivation behind this is that tracking tasks with fewer challenges can be adequately addressed using low-level feature representations. Simpler tasks can often be handled with less demanding, lower-level features. This approach allows the model use computational resources more efficiently by focusing on complex tasks and conserving resources for easier ones. Another significant enhancement introduced in this paper is the improved effectiveness of ViTs in handling motion blur, a common issue in UAV tracking caused by the fast movements of either the UAV, the tracked objects, or both. This is achieved by acquiring motion blur robust representations through enforcing invariance in the feature representation of the target with respect to simulated motion blur. The proposed approach is dubbed BDTrack. Extensive experiments conducted on five tracking benchmarks validate the effectiveness and versatility of our approach, establishing it as a cutting-edge solution in real-time UAV tracking.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Synthesizing realistic 3D indoor scenes is a challenging task that traditionally relies on manual arrangement and annotation by expert designers. Recent advances in autoregressive models have automated this process, but they often lack semantic understanding of the relationships and hierarchies present in real-world scenes, yielding limited performance. In this paper, we propose Forest2Seq, a framework that formulates indoor scene synthesis as an order-aware sequential learning problem. Forest2Seq organizes the inherently unordered collection of scene objects into structured, ordered hierarchical scene trees and forests. By employing a clustering-based algorithm and a breadth-first traversal, Forest2Seq derives meaningful orderings and utilizes a transformer to generate realistic 3D scenes autoregressively. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate Forest2Seq's superiority in synthesizing more realistic scenes compared to top-performing baselines, with significant improvements in FID and KL scores. Our additional experiments for downstream tasks and ablation studies also confirm the importance of incorporating order as a prior in 3D scene generation.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Underwater image enhancement (UIE) has attracted much attention owing to its importance for underwater operation and marine engineering. Motivated by the recent advance in generative models, we propose a novel UIE method based on image-conditional diffusion transformer (ICDT). Our method takes the degraded underwater image as the conditional input and converts it into latent space where ICDT is applied. ICDT replaces the conventional U-Net backbone in a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) with a transformer, and thus inherits favorable properties such as scalability from transformers. Furthermore, we train ICDT with a hybrid loss function involving variances to achieve better log-likelihoods, which meanwhile significantly accelerates the sampling process. We experimentally assess the scalability of ICDTs and compare with prior works in UIE on the Underwater ImageNet dataset. Besides good scaling properties, our largest model, ICDT-XL/2, outperforms all comparison methods, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) quality of image enhancement.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been widely used in many areas such as autonomous driving and face recognition. However, DNN model is fragile to backdoor attack. A backdoor in the DNN model can be activated by a poisoned input with trigger and leads to wrong prediction, which causes serious security issues in applications. It is challenging for current defenses to eliminate the backdoor effectively with limited computing resources, especially when the sizes and numbers of the triggers are variable as in the physical world. We propose an efficient backdoor defense based on evolutionary trigger detection and lightweight model repair. In the first phase of our method, CAM-focus Evolutionary Trigger Filter (CETF) is proposed for trigger detection. CETF is an effective sample-preprocessing based method with the evolutionary algorithm, and our experimental results show that CETF not only distinguishes the images with triggers accurately from the clean images, but also can be widely used in practice for its simplicity and stability in different backdoor attack situations. In the second phase of our method, we leverage several lightweight unlearning methods with the trigger detected by CETF for model repair, which also constructively demonstrate the underlying correlation of the backdoor with Batch Normalization layers.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>One-shot detection of anatomical landmarks is gaining significant attention for its efficiency in using minimal labeled data to produce promising results. However, the success of current methods heavily relies on the employment of extensive unlabeled data to pre-train an effective feature extractor, which limits their applicability in scenarios where a substantial amount of unlabeled data is unavailable. In this paper, we propose the first foundation model-enabled one-shot landmark detection (FM-OSD) framework for accurate landmark detection in medical images by utilizing solely a single template image without any additional unlabeled data. Specifically, we use the frozen image encoder of visual foundation models as the feature extractor, and introduce dual-branch global and local feature decoders to increase the resolution of extracted features in a coarse to fine manner. The introduced feature decoders are efficiently trained with a distance-aware similarity learning loss to incorporate domain knowledge from the single template image. Moreover, a novel bidirectional matching strategy is developed to improve both robustness and accuracy of landmark detection in the case of scattered similarity map obtained by foundation models. We validate our method on two public anatomical landmark detection datasets. By using solely a single template image, our method demonstrates significant superiority over strong state-of-the-art one-shot landmark detection methods.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Non-contact volume estimation of pile-type objects has considerable potential in industrial scenarios, including grain, coal, mining, and stone materials. However, using existing method for these scenarios is challenged by unstable measurement poses, significant light interference, the difficulty of training data collection, and the computational burden brought by large piles. To address the above issues, we propose the Depth Integrated Volume EStimation of Pile Of Things (DIVESPOT) based on point cloud technology in this study. For the challenges of unstable measurement poses, the point cloud pose correction and filtering algorithm is designed based on the Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) and the Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN). To cope with light interference and to avoid the relying on training data, the height-distribution-based ground feature extraction algorithm is proposed to achieve RGB-independent. To reduce the computational burden, the storage space optimizing strategy is developed, such that accurate estimation can be acquired by using compressed voxels. Experimental results demonstrate that the DIVESPOT method enables non-data-driven, RGB-independent segmentation of pile point clouds, maintaining a volume calculation relative error within 2%. Even with 90% compression of the voxel mesh, the average error of the results can be under 3%.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved notable progress in medical image segmentation. To achieve effective SSL, a model needs to be able to efficiently learn from limited labeled data and effectively exploiting knowledge from abundant unlabeled data. Recent developments in visual foundation models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), have demonstrated remarkable adaptability with improved sample efficiency. To harness the power of foundation models for application in SSL, we propose a cross prompting consistency method with segment anything model (CPC-SAM) for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Our method employs SAM's unique prompt design and innovates a cross-prompting strategy within a dual-branch framework to automatically generate prompts and supervisions across two decoder branches, enabling effectively learning from both scarce labeled and valuable unlabeled data. We further design a novel prompt consistency regularization, to reduce the prompt position sensitivity and to enhance the output invariance under different prompts. We validate our method on two medical image segmentation tasks. The extensive experiments with different labeled-data ratios and modalities demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over the state-of-the-art SSL methods, with more than 9% Dice improvement on the breast cancer segmentation task.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This work presents a novel module, namely multi-branch concat (MBC), to process the input tensor and obtain the multi-scale feature map. The proposed MBC module brings new degrees of freedom (DoF) for the design of attention networks by allowing the type of transformation operators and the number of branches to be flexibly adjusted. Two important transformation operators, multiplex and split, are considered in this work, both of which can represent multi-scale features at a more granular level and increase the range of receptive fields. By integrating the MBC and attention module, a multi-branch attention (MBA) module is consequently developed to capture the channel-wise interaction of feature maps for establishing the long-range channel dependency. By substituting the 3x3 convolutions in the bottleneck blocks of the ResNet with the proposed MBA, a novel block namely efficient multi-branch attention (EMBA) is obtained, which can be easily plugged into the state-of-the-art backbone CNN models. Furthermore, a new backbone network called EMBANet is established by stacking the EMBA blocks. The proposed EMBANet is extensively evaluated on representative computer vision tasks including: classification, detection, and segmentation. And it demonstrates consistently superior performance over the popular backbones.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Videos serve as a powerful medium to convey ideas, tell stories, and provide detailed instructions, especially through long-format tutorials. Such tutorials are valuable for learning new skills at one's own pace, yet they can be overwhelming due to their length and dense content. Viewers often seek specific information, like precise measurements or step-by-step execution details, making it essential to extract and summarize key segments efficiently. An intelligent, time-sensitive video assistant capable of summarizing and detecting highlights in long videos is highly sought after. Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models offer promising solutions to develop such an assistant. Our research explores the use of multimodal models to enhance video summarization and step-by-step instruction generation within specific domains. These models need to understand temporal events and relationships among actions across video frames. Our approach focuses on fine-tuning TimeChat to improve its performance in specific domains: cooking and medical procedures. By training the model on domain-specific datasets like Tasty for cooking and MedVidQA for medical procedures, we aim to enhance its ability to generate concise, accurate summaries of instructional videos. We curate and restructure these datasets to create high-quality video-centric instruction data. Our findings indicate that when finetuned on domain-specific procedural data, TimeChat can significantly improve the extraction and summarization of key instructional steps in long-format videos. This research demonstrates the potential of specialized multimodal models to assist with practical tasks by providing personalized, step-by-step guidance tailored to the unique aspects of each domain.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Temporal reasoning (TR) is a critical component of artificial intelligence, encompassing understanding and processing temporal information and relationships between events. To discover and study the TR ability in Large Language Models (LLMs), various datasets have been constructed in different ways for evaluating various aspects of TR ability. Our work proposes a novel approach to design and develop a pipeline for constructing datasets to evaluate the TR ability of LLMs by leveraging random directed graph generation, LTL formula, and the NuSMV model checker. Based on the pipeline, we have also constructed a dataset as a benchmark, namely LTLBench, consisting of 2,000 TR challenges and evaluated six LLMs with it. Furthermore, we have conducted additional experiments to discover the impact of increasing the number of events and formula operators on the complexity of TR problems and the performance of LLMs. We have demonstrated that although LLMs exhibit some promise in handling TR challenges, they still struggle with complex TR. We expect this work can offer insights into TR ability in LLMs while also providing a valuable tool for future TR evaluations.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Semantic segmentation and activity classification are key components to creating intelligent surgical systems able to understand and assist clinical workflow. In the Operating Room, semantic segmentation is at the core of creating robots aware of clinical surroundings, whereas activity classification aims at understanding OR workflow at a higher level. State-of-the-art semantic segmentation and activity recognition approaches are fully supervised, which is not scalable. Self-supervision can decrease the amount of annotated data needed. We propose a new 3D self-supervised task for OR scene understanding utilizing OR scene images captured with ToF cameras. Contrary to other self-supervised approaches, where handcrafted pretext tasks are focused on 2D image features, our proposed task consists of predicting the relative 3D distance of image patches by exploiting the depth maps. Learning 3D spatial context generates discriminative features for our downstream tasks. Our approach is evaluated on two tasks and datasets containing multi-view data captured from clinical scenarios. We demonstrate a noteworthy improvement of performance on both tasks, specifically on low-regime data where utility of self-supervised learning is the highest.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we present the submission to the 5th Annual Smoky Mountains Computational Sciences Data Challenge, Challenge 3. This is the solution for semantic segmentation problem in both real-world and synthetic images from a vehicle s forward-facing camera. We concentrate in building a robust model which performs well across various domains of different outdoor situations such as sunny, snowy, rainy, etc. In particular, our method is developed with two main directions: model development and domain adaptation. In model development, we use the High Resolution Network (HRNet) as the baseline. Then, this baseline s result is processed by two coarse-to-fine models: Object-Contextual Representations (OCR) and Hierarchical Multi-scale Attention (HMA) to get the better robust feature. For domain adaption, we implement the Domain-Based Batch Normalization (DNB) to reduce the distribution shift from diverse domains. Our proposed method yield 81.259 mean intersection-over-union (mIoU) in validation set. This paper studies the effectiveness of employing real-world and synthetic data to handle the domain adaptation in semantic segmentation problem.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>One of the most reliable ways to create deployable models for specialized tasks is to obtain an adequate amount of high-quality task-specific data. However, for specialized tasks, often such datasets do not exist. Existing methods address this by creating such data from large language models (LLMs) and then distilling such knowledge into smaller models. However, these methods are limited by the quality of the LLMs output, and tend to generate repetitive or incorrect data. In this work, we present Retrieval Based Distillation (ReBase), a method that first retrieves data from rich online sources and then transforms them into domain-specific data. This method greatly enhances data diversity. Moreover, ReBase generates Chain-of-Thought reasoning and distills the reasoning capacity of LLMs. We test our method on 4 benchmarks and results show that our method significantly improves performance by up to 7.8% on SQuAD, 1.37% on MNLI, and 1.94% on BigBench-Hard.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recurrent large language models that compete with Transformers in language modeling perplexity are emerging at a rapid rate (e.g., Mamba, RWKV). Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Transformers are the current architecture of choice for NLP, but their attention layers do not scale well to long contexts. Recent works propose to replace attention with linear recurrent layers -- this is the case for state space models, which enjoy efficient training and inference. However, it remains unclear whether these models are competitive with transformers in machine translation (MT). In this paper, we provide a rigorous and comprehensive experimental comparison between transformers and linear recurrent models for MT. Concretely, we experiment with RetNet, Mamba, and hybrid versions of Mamba which incorporate attention mechanisms. Our findings demonstrate that Mamba is highly competitive with transformers on sentence and paragraph-level datasets, where in the latter both models benefit from shifting the training distribution towards longer sequences. Further analysis show that integrating attention into Mamba improves translation quality, robustness to sequence length extrapolation, and the ability to recall named entities.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), Large Language Models (LLMs) are playing a pivotal role in information search and are being adopted globally. Although the multilingual capability of LLMs offers new opportunities to bridge the language barrier, do these capabilities translate into real-life scenarios where linguistic divide and knowledge conflicts between multilingual sources are known occurrences? In this paper, we studied LLM's linguistic preference in a RAG-based information search setting. We found that LLMs displayed systemic bias towards information in the same language as the query language in both information retrieval and answer generation. Furthermore, in scenarios where there is little information in the language of the query, LLMs prefer documents in high-resource languages, reinforcing the dominant views. Such bias exists for both factual and opinion-based queries. Our results highlight the linguistic divide within multilingual LLMs in information search systems. The seemingly beneficial multilingual capability of LLMs may backfire on information parity by reinforcing language-specific information cocoons or filter bubbles further marginalizing low-resource views.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Object tracking in satellite videos remains a complex endeavor in remote sensing due to the intricate and dynamic nature of satellite imagery. Existing state-of-the-art trackers in computer vision integrate sophisticated architectures, attention mechanisms, and multi-modal fusion to enhance tracking accuracy across diverse environments. However, the challenges posed by satellite imagery, such as background variations, atmospheric disturbances, and low-resolution object delineation, significantly impede the precision and reliability of traditional Single Object Tracking (SOT) techniques. Our study delves into these challenges and proposes prompt engineering methodologies, leveraging the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and TAPIR (Tracking Any Point with per-frame Initialization and temporal Refinement), to create a training-free point-based tracking method for small-scale objects on satellite videos. Experiments on the VISO dataset validate our strategy, marking a significant advancement in robust tracking solutions tailored for satellite imagery in remote sensing applications.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Various models based on StyleGAN have gained significant traction in the field of image synthesis, attributed to their robust training stability and superior performances. Within the StyleGAN framework, the adoption of image skip connection is favored over the traditional residual connection. However, this preference is just based on empirical observations; there has not been any in-depth mathematical analysis on it yet. To rectify this situation, this brief aims to elucidate the mathematical meaning of the image skip connection and introduce a groundbreaking methodology, termed the image squeeze connection, which significantly improves the quality of image synthesis. Specifically, we analyze the image skip connection technique to reveal its problem and introduce the proposed method which not only effectively boosts the GAN performance but also reduces the required number of network parameters. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate that the proposed method consistently enhances the performance of state-of-the-art models based on StyleGAN. We believe that our findings represent a vital advancement in the field of image synthesis, suggesting a novel direction for future research and applications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Training a classifier on web-crawled data demands learning algorithms that are robust to annotation errors and irrelevant examples. This paper builds upon the recent empirical observation that applying unsupervised contrastive learning to noisy, web-crawled datasets yields a feature representation under which the in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) samples are linearly separable. We show that direct estimation of the separating hyperplane can indeed offer an accurate detection of OOD samples, and yet, surprisingly, this detection does not translate into gains in classification accuracy. Digging deeper into this phenomenon, we discover that the near-perfect detection misses a type of clean examples that are valuable for supervised learning. These examples often represent visually simple images, which are relatively easy to identify as clean examples using standard loss- or distance-based methods despite being poorly separated from the OOD distribution using unsupervised learning. Because we further observe a low correlation with SOTA metrics, this urges us to propose a hybrid solution that alternates between noise detection using linear separation and a state-of-the-art (SOTA) small-loss approach. When combined with the SOTA algorithm PLS, we substantially improve SOTA results for real-world image classification in the presence of web noise this http URL</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Event cameras harness advantages such as low latency, high temporal resolution, and high dynamic range (HDR), compared to standard cameras. Due to the distinct imaging paradigm shift, a dominant line of research focuses on event-to-video (E2V) reconstruction to bridge event-based and standard computer vision. However, this task remains challenging due to its inherently ill-posed nature: event cameras only detect the edge and motion information locally. Consequently, the reconstructed videos are often plagued by artifacts and regional blur, primarily caused by the ambiguous semantics of event data. In this paper, we find language naturally conveys abundant semantic information, rendering it stunningly superior in ensuring semantic consistency for E2V reconstruction. Accordingly, we propose a novel framework, called LaSe-E2V, that can achieve semantic-aware high-quality E2V reconstruction from a language-guided perspective, buttressed by the text-conditional diffusion models. However, due to diffusion models' inherent diversity and randomness, it is hardly possible to directly apply them to achieve spatial and temporal consistency for E2V reconstruction. Thus, we first propose an Event-guided Spatiotemporal Attention (ESA) module to condition the event data to the denoising pipeline effectively. We then introduce an event-aware mask loss to ensure temporal coherence and a noise initialization strategy to enhance spatial consistency. Given the absence of event-text-video paired data, we aggregate existing E2V datasets and generate textual descriptions using the tagging models for training and evaluation. Extensive experiments on three datasets covering diverse challenging scenarios (e.g., fast motion, low light) demonstrate the superiority of our method. Dataset and code will be available upon acceptance.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multimodal generative models have shown impressive advances with the help of powerful diffusion models. Despite the progress, generating sound solely from text poses challenges in ensuring comprehensive scene depiction and temporal alignment. Meanwhile, video-to-sound generation limits the flexibility to prioritize sound synthesis for specific objects within the scene. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel video-and-text-to-sound generation method, called ReWaS, where video serves as a conditional control for a text-to-audio generation model. Our method estimates the structural information of audio (namely, energy) from the video while receiving key content cues from a user prompt. We employ a well-performing text-to-sound model to consolidate the video control, which is much more efficient for training multimodal diffusion models with massive triplet-paired (audio-video-text) data. In addition, by separating the generative components of audio, it becomes a more flexible system that allows users to freely adjust the energy, surrounding environment, and primary sound source according to their preferences. Experimental results demonstrate that our method shows superiority in terms of quality, controllability, and training efficiency. Our demo is available at this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Fine-tuning advanced diffusion models for high-quality image stylization usually requires large training datasets and substantial computational resources, hindering their practical applicability. We propose Ada-Adapter, a novel framework for few-shot style personalization of diffusion models. Ada-Adapter leverages off-the-shelf diffusion models and pre-trained image feature encoders to learn a compact style representation from a limited set of source images. Our method enables efficient zero-shot style transfer utilizing a single reference image. Furthermore, with a small number of source images (three to five are sufficient) and a few minutes of fine-tuning, our method can capture intricate style details and conceptual characteristics, generating high-fidelity stylized images that align well with the provided text prompts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on various artistic styles, including flat art, 3D rendering, and logo design. Our experimental results show that Ada-Adapter outperforms existing zero-shot and few-shot stylization methods in terms of output quality, diversity, and training efficiency.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Accurate bronchoscope localization is essential for pulmonary interventions, by providing six degrees of freedom (DOF) in airway navigation. However, the robustness of current vision-based methods is often compromised in clinical practice, and they struggle to perform in real-time and to generalize across cases unseen during training. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel Probabilistic Airway Navigation System (PANS), leveraging Monte-Carlo method with pose hypotheses and likelihoods to achieve robust and real-time bronchoscope localization. Specifically, our PANS incorporates diverse visual representations (\textit{e.g.}, odometry and landmarks) by leveraging two key modules, including the Depth-based Motion Inference (DMI) and the Bronchial Semantic Analysis (BSA). To generate the pose hypotheses of bronchoscope for PANS, we devise the DMI to accurately propagate the estimation of pose hypotheses over time. Moreover, to estimate the accurate pose likelihood, we devise the BSA module by effectively distinguishing between similar bronchial regions in endoscopic images, along with a novel metric to assess the congruence between estimated depth maps and the segmented airway structure. Under this probabilistic formulation, our PANS is capable of achieving the 6-DOF bronchoscope localization with superior accuracy and robustness. Extensive experiments on the collected pulmonary intervention dataset comprising 10 clinical cases confirm the advantage of our PANS over state-of-the-arts, in terms of both robustness and generalization in localizing deeper airway branches and the efficiency of real-time inference. The proposed PANS reveals its potential to be a reliable tool in the operating room, promising to enhance the quality and safety of pulmonary interventions.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Various contextual information has been employed by many approaches for visual detection tasks. However, most of the existing approaches only focus on specific context for specific tasks. In this paper, GMC, a general framework is proposed for multistage context learning and utilization, with various deep network architectures for various visual detection tasks. The GMC framework encompasses three stages: preprocessing, training, and post-processing. In the preprocessing stage, the representation of local context is enhanced by utilizing commonly used labeling standards. During the training stage, semantic context information is fused with visual information, leveraging prior knowledge from the training dataset to capture semantic relationships. In the post-processing stage, general topological relations and semantic masks for stuff are incorporated to enable spatial context reasoning between objects. The proposed framework provides a comprehensive and adaptable solution for context learning and utilization in visual detection scenarios. The framework offers flexibility with user-defined configurations and provide adaptability to diverse network architectures and visual detection tasks, offering an automated and streamlined solution that minimizes user effort and inference time in context learning and reasoning. Experimental results on the visual detection tasks, for storefront object detection, pedestrian detection and COCO object detection, demonstrate that our framework outperforms previous state-of-the-art detectors and transformer architectures. The experiments also demonstrate that three contextual learning components can not only be applied individually and in combination, but can also be applied to various network architectures, and its flexibility and effectiveness in various detection scenarios.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Inferring future activity information based on observed activity data is a crucial step to improve the accuracy of early activity prediction. Traditional methods based on generative adversarial networks(GAN) or joint learning frameworks can achieve good prediction accuracy under low observation ratios, but they usually have high computational costs. In view of this, this paper proposes a spatio-temporal encoding and decoding-based method for future human activity skeleton synthesis. Firstly, algorithms such as time control, discrete cosine transform, and low-pass filtering are used to cut or pad the skeleton sequences. Secondly, the encoder and decoder are responsible for extracting intermediate semantic encoding from observed skeleton sequences and inferring future sequences from the intermediate semantic encoding, respectively. Finally, joint displacement error, velocity error, and acceleration error, three higher-order kinematic features, are used as key components of the loss function to optimize model parameters. Experimental results show that the proposed future skeleton synthesis algorithm performs better than some existing algorithms. It generates skeleton sequences with smaller errors and fewer model parameters, effectively providing future information for early activity prediction.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Egocentric hand-object segmentation (EgoHOS) is a brand-new task aiming at segmenting the hands and interacting objects in the egocentric image. Although significant advancements have been achieved by current methods, establishing an end-to-end model with high accuracy remains an unresolved challenge. Moreover, existing methods lack explicit modeling of the relationships between hands and objects as well as objects and objects, thereby disregarding critical information on hand-object interaction and introducing confusion into algorithms, ultimately leading to a reduction in segmentation performance. To address the limitations of existing methods, this paper proposes a novel end-to-end Object-centric Relationship Modeling Network (ORMNet) for EgoHOS. Specifically, based on a single-encoder and multi-decoder framework, we design the Hand-Object Relation (HOR) module to leverage hand-guided attention to capture the correlation between hands and objects and facilitate their representations. Moreover, based on the observed interrelationships between diverse categories of objects, we introduce the Object Relation Decoupling (ORD) strategy. This strategy allows the decoupling of the two-hand object during training, thereby alleviating the ambiguity of the network. Experimental results on three datasets show that the proposed ORMNet has notably exceptional segmentation performance with robust generalization capabilities.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Different classes of safe reinforcement learning algorithms have shown satisfactory performance in various types of safety requirement scenarios. However, the existing methods mainly address one or several classes of specific safety requirement scenario problems and cannot be applied to arbitrary safety requirement scenarios. In addition, the optimization objectives of existing reinforcement learning algorithms are misaligned with the task requirements. Based on the need to address these issues, we propose $\mathrm{E^{2}CFD}$, an effective and efficient cost function design framework. $\mathrm{E^{2}CFD}$ leverages the capabilities of a large language model (LLM) to comprehend various safety scenarios and generate corresponding cost functions. It incorporates the \textit{fast performance evaluation (FPE)} method to facilitate rapid and iterative updates to the generated cost function. Through this iterative process, $\mathrm{E^{2}CFD}$ aims to obtain the most suitable cost function for policy training, tailored to the specific tasks within the safety scenario. Experiments have proven that the performance of policies trained using this framework is superior to traditional safe reinforcement learning algorithms and policies trained with carefully designed cost functions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The transformer architecture has catalyzed revolutionary advances in language modeling. However, recent architectural recipes, such as state-space models, have bridged the performance gap. Motivated by this, we examine the benefits of Convolution-Augmented Transformer (CAT) for recall, copying, and length generalization tasks. CAT incorporates convolutional filters in the K/Q/V embeddings of an attention layer. Through CAT, we show that the locality of the convolution synergizes with the global view of the attention. Unlike comparable architectures, such as Mamba or transformer, CAT can provably solve the associative recall (AR) and copying tasks using a single layer while also enjoying guaranteed length generalization. We also establish computational tradeoffs between convolution and attention by characterizing how convolution can mitigate the need for full attention by summarizing the context window and creating salient summary tokens to attend. Evaluations on real datasets corroborate our findings and demonstrate that CAT and its variations indeed enhance the language modeling performance.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recently, transfer learning and self-supervised learning have gained significant attention within the medical field due to their ability to mitigate the challenges posed by limited data availability, improve model generalisation, and reduce computational expenses. Transfer learning and self-supervised learning hold immense potential for advancing medical research. However, it is crucial to recognise that transfer learning and self-supervised learning architectures exhibit distinct advantages and limitations, manifesting variations in accuracy, training speed, and robustness. This paper compares the performance and robustness of transfer learning and self-supervised learning in the medical field. Specifically, we pre-trained two models using the same source domain datasets with different pre-training methods and evaluated them on small-sized medical datasets to identify the factors influencing their final performance. We tested data with several common issues in medical domains, such as data imbalance, data scarcity, and domain mismatch, through comparison experiments to understand their impact on specific pre-trained models. Finally, we provide recommendations to help users apply transfer learning and self-supervised learning methods in medical areas, and build more convenient and efficient deployment strategies.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent studies highlight that deep learning models often learn spurious features mistakenly linked to labels, compromising their reliability in real-world scenarios where such correlations do not hold. Despite the increasing research effort, existing solutions often face two main challenges: they either demand substantial annotations of spurious attributes, or they yield less competitive outcomes with expensive training when additional annotations are absent. In this paper, we introduce SLIM, a cost-effective and performance-targeted approach to reducing spurious correlations in deep learning. Our method leverages a human-in-the-loop protocol featuring a novel attention labeling mechanism with a constructed attention representation space. SLIM significantly reduces the need for exhaustive additional labeling, requiring human input for fewer than 3% of instances. By prioritizing data quality over complicated training strategies, SLIM curates a smaller yet more feature-balanced data subset, fostering the development of spuriousness-robust models. Experimental validations across key benchmarks demonstrate that SLIM competes with or exceeds the performance of leading methods while significantly reducing costs. The SLIM framework thus presents a promising path for developing reliable models more efficiently. Our code is available in this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Although recent efforts have extended Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) into LiDAR point cloud synthesis, the majority of existing works exhibit a strong dependence on precomputed poses. However, point cloud registration methods struggle to achieve precise global pose estimation, whereas previous pose-free NeRFs overlook geometric consistency in global reconstruction. In light of this, we explore the geometric insights of point clouds, which provide explicit registration priors for reconstruction. Based on this, we propose Geometry guided Neural LiDAR Fields(GeoNLF), a hybrid framework performing alternately global neural reconstruction and pure geometric pose optimization. Furthermore, NeRFs tend to overfit individual frames and easily get stuck in local minima under sparse-view inputs. To tackle this issue, we develop a selective-reweighting strategy and introduce geometric constraints for robust optimization. Extensive experiments on NuScenes and KITTI-360 datasets demonstrate the superiority of GeoNLF in both novel view synthesis and multi-view registration of low-frequency large-scale point clouds.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Misinformation about climate change causes numerous negative impacts, necessitating corrective responses. Psychological research has offered various strategies for reducing the influence of climate misinformation, such as the fact-myth-fallacy-fact-structure. However, practically implementing corrective interventions at scale represents a challenge. Automatic detection and correction of misinformation offers a solution to the misinformation problem. This study documents the development of large language models that accept as input a climate myth and produce a debunking that adheres to the fact-myth-fallacy-fact (``truth sandwich'') structure, by incorporating contrarian claim classification and fallacy detection into an LLM prompting framework. We combine open (Mixtral, Palm2) and proprietary (GPT-4) LLMs with prompting strategies of varying complexity. Experiments reveal promising performance of GPT-4 and Mixtral if combined with structured prompts. We identify specific challenges of debunking generation and human evaluation, and map out avenues for future work. We release a dataset of high-quality truth-sandwich debunkings, source code and a demo of the debunking system.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Despite the success achieved by existing image generation and editing methods, current models still struggle with complex problems including intricate text prompts, and the absence of verification and self-correction mechanisms makes the generated images unreliable. Meanwhile, a single model tends to specialize in particular tasks and possess the corresponding capabilities, making it inadequate for fulfilling all user requirements. We propose GenArtist, a unified image generation and editing system, coordinated by a multimodal large language model (MLLM) agent. We integrate a comprehensive range of existing models into the tool library and utilize the agent for tool selection and execution. For a complex problem, the MLLM agent decomposes it into simpler sub-problems and constructs a tree structure to systematically plan the procedure of generation, editing, and self-correction with step-by-step verification. By automatically generating missing position-related inputs and incorporating position information, the appropriate tool can be effectively employed to address each sub-problem. Experiments demonstrate that GenArtist can perform various generation and editing tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance and surpassing existing models such as SDXL and DALL-E 3, as can be seen in Fig. 1.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Whole slide imaging is routinely adopted for carcinoma diagnosis and prognosis. Abundant experience is required for pathologists to achieve accurate and reliable diagnostic results of whole slide images (WSI). The huge size and heterogeneous features of WSIs make the workflow of pathological reading extremely time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a novel framework (WSI-VQA) to interpret WSIs by generative visual question answering. WSI-VQA shows universality by reframing various kinds of slide-level tasks in a question-answering pattern, in which pathologists can achieve immunohistochemical grading, survival prediction, and tumor subtyping following human-machine interaction. Furthermore, we establish a WSI-VQA dataset which contains 8672 slide-level question-answering pairs with 977 WSIs. Besides the ability to deal with different slide-level tasks, our generative model which is named Wsi2Text Transformer (W2T) outperforms existing discriminative models in medical correctness, which reveals the potential of our model to be applied in the clinical scenario. Additionally, we also visualize the co-attention mapping between word embeddings and WSIs as an intuitive explanation for diagnostic results.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We study open-world multi-label text classification under extremely weak supervision (XWS), where the user only provides a brief description for classification objectives without any labels or ground-truth label space. Similar single-label XWS settings have been explored recently, however, these methods cannot be easily adapted for multi-label. We observe that (1) most documents have a dominant class covering the majority of content and (2) long-tail labels would appear in some documents as a dominant class. Therefore, we first utilize the user description to prompt a large language model (LLM) for dominant keyphrases of a subset of raw documents, and then construct a (initial) label space via clustering. We further apply a zero-shot multi-label classifier to locate the documents with small top predicted scores, so we can revisit their dominant keyphrases for more long-tail labels. We iterate this process to discover a comprehensive label space and construct a multi-label classifier as a novel method, X-MLClass. X-MLClass exhibits a remarkable increase in ground-truth label space coverage on various datasets, for example, a 40% improvement on the AAPD dataset over topic modeling and keyword extraction methods. Moreover, X-MLClass achieves the best end-to-end multi-label classification accuracy.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Private inference (PI) has emerged as a promising solution to execute computations on encrypted data, safeguarding user privacy and model parameters in edge computing. However, existing PI methods are predominantly developed considering constant resource constraints, overlooking the varied and dynamic resource constraints in diverse edge devices, like energy budgets. Consequently, model providers have to design specialized models for different devices, where all of them have to be stored on the edge server, resulting in inefficient deployment. To fill this gap, this work presents AdaPI, a novel approach that achieves adaptive PI by allowing a model to perform well across edge devices with diverse energy budgets. AdaPI employs a PI-aware training strategy that optimizes the model weights alongside weight-level and feature-level soft masks. These soft masks are subsequently transformed into multiple binary masks to enable adjustments in communication and computation workloads. Through sequentially training the model with increasingly dense binary masks, AdaPI attains optimal accuracy for each energy budget, which outperforms the state-of-the-art PI methods by 7.3\% in terms of test accuracy on CIFAR-100.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Computer network anomaly detection and log analysis, as an important topic in the field of network security, has been a key task to ensure network security and system reliability. First, existing network anomaly detection and log analysis methods are often challenged by high-dimensional data and complex network topologies, resulting in unstable performance and high false-positive rates. In addition, traditional methods are usually difficult to handle time-series data, which is crucial for anomaly detection and log analysis. Therefore, we need a more efficient and accurate method to cope with these problems. To compensate for the shortcomings of current methods, we propose an innovative fusion model that integrates Isolation Forest, GAN (Generative Adversarial Network), and Transformer with each other, and each of them plays a unique role. Isolation Forest is used to quickly identify anomalous data points, and GAN is used to generate synthetic data with the real data distribution characteristics to augment the training dataset, while the Transformer is used for modeling and context extraction on time series data. The synergy of these three components makes our model more accurate and robust in anomaly detection and log analysis tasks. We validate the effectiveness of this fusion model in an extensive experimental evaluation. Experimental results show that our model significantly improves the accuracy of anomaly detection while reducing the false alarm rate, which helps to detect potential network problems in advance. The model also performs well in the log analysis task and is able to quickly identify anomalous behaviors, which helps to improve the stability of the system. The significance of this study is that it introduces advanced deep learning techniques, which work anomaly detection and log analysis.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In computer vision, Image Difference Captioning (IDC) is crucial for accurately describing variations between closely related images. Traditional IDC methods often rely on specialist models, which restrict their applicability across varied contexts. This paper introduces the OneDiff model, a novel generalist approach that utilizes a robust vision-language model architecture, integrating a siamese image encoder with a Visual Delta Module. This innovative configuration allows for the precise detection and articulation of fine-grained differences between image pairs. OneDiff is trained through a dual-phase strategy, encompassing Coupled Sample Training and multi-task learning across a diverse array of data types, supported by our newly developed DiffCap Dataset. This dataset merges real-world and synthetic data, enhancing the training process and bolstering the model's robustness. Extensive testing on diverse IDC benchmarks, such as Spot-the-Diff, CLEVR-Change, and Birds-to-Words, shows that OneDiff consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in accuracy and adaptability, achieving improvements of up to 85\% CIDEr points in average. By setting a new benchmark in IDC, OneDiff paves the way for more versatile and effective applications in detecting and describing visual differences.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present a novel intelligent-system architecture called "Dynamic Net Architecture" (DNA) that relies on recurrence-stabilized networks and discuss it in application to vision. Our architecture models a (cerebral cortical) area wherein elementary feature neurons encode details of visual structures, and coherent nets of such neurons model holistic object structures. By interpreting smaller or larger coherent pieces of an area network as complex features, our model encodes hierarchical feature representations essentially different than artificial neural networks (ANNs). DNA models operate on a dynamic connectionism principle, wherein neural activations stemming from initial afferent signals undergo stabilization through a self-organizing mechanism facilitated by Hebbian plasticity alongside periodically tightening inhibition. In contrast to ANNs, which rely on feed-forward connections and backpropagation of error, we posit that this processing paradigm leads to highly robust representations, as by employing dynamic lateral connections, irrelevant details in neural activations are filtered out, freeing further processing steps from distracting noise and premature decisions. We empirically demonstrate the viability of the DNA by composing line fragments into longer lines and show that the construction of nets representing lines remains robust even with the introduction of up to $59\%$ noise at each spatial location. Furthermore, we demonstrate the model's capability to reconstruct anticipated features from partially obscured inputs and that it can generalize to patterns not observed during training. In this work, we limit the DNA to one cortical area and focus on its internals while providing insights into a standalone area's strengths and shortcomings. Additionally, we provide an outlook on how future work can implement invariant object recognition by combining multiple areas.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Motion forecasting plays a pivotal role in autonomous driving systems, enabling vehicles to execute collision warnings and rational local-path planning based on predictions of the surrounding vehicles. However, prevalent methods often assume complete observed trajectories, neglecting the potential impact of missing values induced by object occlusion, scope limitation, and sensor failures. Such oversights inevitably compromise the accuracy of trajectory predictions. To tackle this challenge, we propose an end-to-end framework, termed Multiscale Transformer (MSTF), meticulously crafted for incomplete trajectory prediction. MSTF integrates a Multiscale Attention Head (MAH) and an Information Increment-based Pattern Adaptive (IIPA) module. Specifically, the MAH component concurrently captures multiscale motion representation of trajectory sequence from various temporal granularities, utilizing a multi-head attention mechanism. This approach facilitates the modeling of global dependencies in motion across different scales, thereby mitigating the adverse effects of missing values. Additionally, the IIPA module adaptively extracts continuity representation of motion across time steps by analyzing missing patterns in the data. The continuity representation delineates motion trend at a higher level, guiding MSTF to generate predictions consistent with motion continuity. We evaluate our proposed MSTF model using two large-scale real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that MSTF surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in the task of incomplete trajectory prediction, showcasing its efficacy in addressing the challenges posed by missing values in motion forecasting for autonomous driving systems.</li>

In this paper, we present BEVWorld, a novel approach that tokenizes multimodal sensor inputs into a unified and compact Bird's Eye View (BEV) latent space for environment modeling. The world model consists of two parts: the multi-modal tokenizer and the latent BEV sequence diffusion model. The multi-modal tokenizer first encodes multi-modality information and the decoder is able to reconstruct the latent BEV tokens into LiDAR and image observations by ray-casting rendering in a self-supervised manner. Then the latent BEV sequence diffusion model predicts future scenarios given action tokens as conditions. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of BEVWorld in autonomous driving tasks, showcasing its capability in generating future scenes and benefiting downstream tasks such as perception and motion prediction.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Reconstructing high-fidelity hand models with intricate textures plays a crucial role in enhancing human-object interaction and advancing real-world applications. Despite the state-of-the-art methods excelling in texture generation and image rendering, they often face challenges in accurately capturing geometric details. Learning-based approaches usually offer better robustness and faster inference, which tend to produce smoother results and require substantial amounts of training data. To address these issues, we present a novel fine-grained multi-view hand mesh reconstruction method that leverages inverse rendering to restore hand poses and intricate details. Firstly, our approach predicts a parametric hand mesh model through Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) based method from multi-view images. We further introduce a novel Hand Albedo and Mesh (HAM) optimization module to refine both the hand mesh and textures, which is capable of preserving the mesh topology. In addition, we suggest an effective mesh-based neural rendering scheme to simultaneously generate photo-realistic image and optimize mesh geometry by fusing the pre-trained rendering network with vertex features. We conduct the comprehensive experiments on InterHand2.6M, DeepHandMesh and dataset collected by ourself, whose promising results show that our proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on both reconstruction accuracy and rendering quality.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In-context learning (ICL) has been instrumental in adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to downstream tasks using correct input-output examples. Recent advances have attempted to improve model performance through principles derived from mistakes, yet these approaches suffer from lack of customization and inadequate error coverage. To address these limitations, we propose Retrieved In-Context Principles (RICP), a novel teacher-student framework. In RICP, the teacher model analyzes mistakes from the student model to generate reasons and insights for preventing similar mistakes. These mistakes are clustered based on their underlying reasons for developing task-level principles, enhancing the error coverage of principles. During inference, the most relevant mistakes for each question are retrieved to create question-level principles, improving the customization of the provided guidance. RICP is orthogonal to existing prompting methods and does not require intervention from the teacher model during inference. Experimental results across seven reasoning benchmarks reveal that RICP effectively enhances performance when applied to various prompting strategies.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Structured pruning fundamentally reduces computational and memory overheads of large language models (LLMs) and offers a feasible solution for end-side LLM deployment. Structurally pruned models remain dense and high-precision, highly compatible with further tuning and compression. However, as the coarse-grained structured pruning poses large damage to the highly interconnected model, achieving a high compression ratio for scaled-up LLMs remains a challenge. In this paper, we introduce a task-agnostic structured pruning approach coupled with a compact Transformer architecture design. The proposed approach, named TransAct, reduces transitional activations inside multi-head attention (MHA) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) modules, while preserving the inter-module activations that are sensitive to perturbations. Hence, the LLM is pruned into an intra-module low-rank architecture, significantly reducing weights, KV Cache and attention computation. TransAct is implemented on the LLaMA model and evaluated on downstream benchmarks. Results verify the optimality of our approach at high compression with respect to both efficiency and performance. Further, ablation studies reveal the strength of activation-guided iterative pruning and provide experimental analysis on the redundancy of MHA and MLP modules.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In-context learning (ICL) leverages in-context examples as prompts for the predictions of Large Language Models (LLMs). These prompts play a crucial role in achieving strong performance. However, the selection of suitable prompts from a large pool of labeled examples often entails significant annotation costs. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{Sub-SA} (\textbf{Sub}modular \textbf{S}elective \textbf{A}nnotation), a submodule-based selective annotation method. The aim of Sub-SA is to reduce annotation costs while improving the quality of in-context examples and minimizing the time consumption of the selection process. In Sub-SA, we design a submodular function that facilitates effective subset selection for annotation and demonstrates the characteristics of monotonically and submodularity from the theoretical perspective. Specifically, we propose \textbf{RPR} (\textbf{R}eward and \textbf{P}enalty \textbf{R}egularization) to better balance the diversity and representativeness of the unlabeled dataset attributed to a reward term and a penalty term, respectively. Consequently, the selection for annotations can be effectively addressed with a simple yet effective greedy search algorithm based on the submodular function. Finally, we apply the similarity prompt retrieval to get the examples for ICL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advancements in open-source code large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable coding abilities by fine-tuning on the data generated from powerful closed-source LLMs such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 for instruction tuning. This paper explores how to further improve an instruction-tuned code LLM by generating data from itself rather than querying closed-source LLMs. Our key observation is the misalignment between the translation of formal and informal languages: translating formal language (i.e., code) to informal language (i.e., natural language) is more straightforward than the reverse. Based on this observation, we propose INVERSE-INSTRUCT, which summarizes instructions from code snippets instead of the reverse. Specifically, given an instruction tuning corpus for code and the resulting instruction-tuned code LLM, we ask the code LLM to generate additional high-quality instructions for the original corpus through code summarization and self-evaluation. Then, we fine-tune the base LLM on the combination of the original corpus and the self-generated one, which yields a stronger instruction-tuned LLM. We present a series of code LLMs named InverseCoder, which surpasses the performance of the original code LLMs on a wide range of benchmarks, including Python text-to-code generation, multilingual coding, and data-science code generation.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Regular screening and early discovery of uterine fibroid are crucial for preventing potential malignant transformations and ensuring timely, life-saving interventions. To this end, we collect and annotate the first ultrasound video dataset with 100 videos for uterine fibroid segmentation (UFUV). We also present Local-Global Reciprocal Network (LGRNet) to efficiently and effectively propagate the long-term temporal context which is crucial to help distinguish between uninformative noisy surrounding tissues and target lesion regions. Specifically, the Cyclic Neighborhood Propagation (CNP) is introduced to propagate the inter-frame local temporal context in a cyclic manner. Moreover, to aggregate global temporal context, we first condense each frame into a set of frame bottleneck queries and devise Hilbert Selective Scan (HilbertSS) to both efficiently path connect each frame and preserve the locality bias. A distribute layer is then utilized to disseminate back the global context for reciprocal refinement. Extensive experiments on UFUV and three public Video Polyp Segmentation (VPS) datasets demonstrate consistent improvements compared to state-of-the-art segmentation methods, indicating the effectiveness and versatility of LGRNet.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Short-term object interaction anticipation is an important task in egocentric video analysis, including precise predictions of future interactions and their timings as well as the categories and positions of the involved active objects. To alleviate the complexity of this task, our proposed method, SOIA-DOD, effectively decompose it into 1) detecting active object and 2) classifying interaction and predicting their timing. Our method first detects all potential active objects in the last frame of egocentric video by fine-tuning a pre-trained YOLOv9. Then, we combine these potential active objects as query with transformer encoder, thereby identifying the most promising next active object and predicting its future interaction and time-to-contact. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models on the challenge test set, achieving the best performance in predicting next active objects and their interactions. Finally, our proposed ranked the third overall top-5 mAP when including time-to-contact predictions. The source code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Mental health has attracted substantial attention in recent years and LLM can be an effective technology for alleviating this problem owing to its capability in text understanding and dialogue. However, existing research in this domain often suffers from limitations, such as training on datasets lacking crucial prior knowledge and evidence, and the absence of comprehensive evaluation methods. In this paper, we propose a specialized psychological large language model (LLM), named PsycoLLM, trained on a proposed high-quality psychological dataset, including single-turn QA, multi-turn dialogues enriched with prior knowledge and knowledge-based QA. Additionally, to compare the performance of PsycoLLM with other LLMs, we develop a comprehensive psychological benchmark based on authoritative psychological counseling examinations in China, which includes assessments of professional ethics, theoretical proficiency, and case analysis. The experimental results on the benchmark illustrates the effectiveness of PsycoLLM, which demonstrates superior performance compared to other LLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Machine Learning systems are increasingly prevalent across healthcare, law enforcement, and finance but often operate on historical data, which may carry biases against certain demographic groups. Causal and counterfactual fairness provides an intuitive way to define fairness that closely aligns with legal standards. Despite its theoretical benefits, counterfactual fairness comes with several practical limitations, largely related to the reliance on domain knowledge and approximate causal discovery techniques in constructing a causal model. In this study, we take a fresh perspective on counterfactually fair prediction, building upon recent work in in context learning (ICL) and prior fitted networks (PFNs) to learn a transformer called FairPFN. This model is pretrained using synthetic fairness data to eliminate the causal effects of protected attributes directly from observational data, removing the requirement of access to the correct causal model in practice. In our experiments, we thoroughly assess the effectiveness of FairPFN in eliminating the causal impact of protected attributes on a series of synthetic case studies and real world datasets. Our findings pave the way for a new and promising research area: transformers for causal and counterfactual fairness.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in Automated Essay Scoring (AES), but their zero-shot and few-shot performance often falls short compared to state-of-the-art models and human raters. However, fine-tuning LLMs for each specific task is impractical due to the variety of essay prompts and rubrics used in real-world educational contexts. This study proposes a novel approach combining LLMs and Comparative Judgment (CJ) for AES, using zero-shot prompting to choose between two essays. We demonstrate that a CJ method surpasses traditional rubric-based scoring in essay scoring using LLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This work explores the capability of conversational chatbots powered by large language models (LLMs), to understand and characterize predicate symmetry, a cognitive linguistic function traditionally believed to be an inherent human trait. Leveraging in-context learning (ICL), a paradigm shift enabling chatbots to learn new tasks from prompts without re-training, we assess the symmetrical reasoning of five chatbots: ChatGPT 4, Huggingface chat AI, Microsoft's Copilot AI, LLaMA through Perplexity, and Gemini Advanced. Using the Symmetry Inference Sentence (SIS) dataset by Tanchip et al. (2020), we compare chatbot responses against human evaluations to gauge their understanding of predicate symmetry. Experiment results reveal varied performance among chatbots, with some approaching human-like reasoning capabilities. Gemini, for example, reaches a correlation of 0.85 with human scores, while providing a sounding justification for each symmetry evaluation. This study underscores the potential and limitations of LLMs in mirroring complex cognitive processes as symmetrical reasoning.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While preliminary findings indicate that multilingual LLMs exhibit reduced bias compared to monolingual ones, a comprehensive understanding of the effect of multilingual training on bias mitigation, is lacking. This study addresses this gap by systematically training six LLMs of identical size (2.6B parameters) and architecture: five monolingual models (English, German, French, Italian, and Spanish) and one multilingual model trained on an equal distribution of data across these languages, all using publicly available data. To ensure robust evaluation, standard bias benchmarks were automatically translated into the five target languages and verified for both translation quality and bias preservation by human annotators. Our results consistently demonstrate that multilingual training effectively mitigates bias. Moreover, we observe that multilingual models achieve not only lower bias but also superior prediction accuracy when compared to monolingual models with the same amount of training data, model architecture, and size.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate extraordinary abilities in a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. In this paper, we show that, beyond text understanding capability, LLMs are capable of processing text layouts that are denoted by spatial markers. They are able to answer questions that require explicit spatial perceiving and reasoning, while a drastic performance drop is observed when the spatial markers from the original data are excluded. We perform a series of experiments with the GPT-3.5, Baichuan2, Llama2 and ChatGLM3 models on various types of layout-sensitive datasets for further analysis. The experimental results reveal that the layout understanding ability of LLMs is mainly introduced by the coding data for pretraining, which is further enhanced at the instruction-tuning stage. In addition, layout understanding can be enhanced by integrating low-cost, auto-generated data approached by a novel text game. Finally, we show that layout understanding ability is beneficial for building efficient visual question-answering (VQA) systems.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep models often struggle with out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, limiting their real-world applicability beyond controlled laboratory settings. Invariant risk minimization (IRM) addresses this issue by learning invariant features and minimizing the risk across different domains. Thus, it avoids the pitfalls of pseudo-invariant features and spurious causality associated with empirical risk minimization (ERM). However, according to the support overlap theorem, ERM and IRM may fail to address the OOD problem when pseudo-invariant features have insufficient support overlap. To this end, we propose a novel method to enlarge feature support overlap for domain generalization. Specifically, we introduce Bayesian random semantic data augmentation to increase sample diversity and overcome the deficiency of IRM. Experiments on several challenging OOD generalization benchmarks demonstrate that our approach surpasses existing models, delivering superior performance and robustness.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) play a crucial role in ensuring the security of computer networks. Machine learning has emerged as a popular approach for intrusion detection due to its ability to analyze and detect patterns in large volumes of data. However, current ML-based IDS solutions often struggle to keep pace with the ever-changing nature of attack patterns and the emergence of new attack types. Additionally, these solutions face challenges related to class imbalance, where the number of instances belonging to different classes (normal and intrusions) is significantly imbalanced, which hinders their ability to effectively detect minor classes. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) architecture, enabling automatic, efficient, and robust network intrusion detection. To enhance the capabilities of the proposed model, we have improved the DQN algorithm by implementing the weighted mean square loss function and employing cost-sensitive learning techniques. Our solution introduces a resilient architecture designed to accommodate the addition of new attacks and effectively adapt to changes in existing attack patterns. Experimental results realized using CIC-IDS-2017 dataset, demonstrate that our approach can effectively handle the class imbalance problem and provide a fine grained classification of attacks with a very low false positive rate. In comparison to the current state-of-the-art works, our solution demonstrates a significant superiority in both detection rate and false positive rate.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Self-consistency (Wang et al., 2023) suggests that the most consistent answer obtained through large language models (LLMs) is more likely to be correct. In this paper, we challenge this argument and propose a nuanced correction. Our observations indicate that consistent answers derived through more computation i.e. longer reasoning texts, rather than simply the most consistent answer across all outputs, are more likely to be correct. This is predominantly because we demonstrate that LLMs can autonomously produce chain-of-thought (CoT) style reasoning with no custom prompts merely while generating longer responses, which lead to consistent predictions that are more accurate. In the zero-shot setting, by sampling Mixtral-8x7B model multiple times and considering longer responses, we achieve 86% of its self-consistency performance obtained through zero-shot CoT prompting on the GSM8K and MultiArith datasets. Finally, we demonstrate that the probability of LLMs generating a longer response is quite low, highlighting the need for decoding strategies conditioned on output length.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Domain-specific Entity Recognition holds significant importance in legal contexts, serving as a fundamental task that supports various applications such as question-answering systems, text summarization, machine translation, sentiment analysis, and information retrieval specifically within case law documents. Recent advancements have highlighted the efficacy of Large Language Models in natural language processing tasks, demonstrating their capability to accurately detect and classify domain-specific facts (entities) from specialized texts like clinical and financial documents. This research investigates the application of Large Language Models in identifying domain-specific entities (e.g., courts, petitioner, judge, lawyer, respondents, FIR nos.) within case law documents, with a specific focus on their aptitude for handling domain-specific language complexity and contextual variations. The study evaluates the performance of state-of-the-art Large Language Model architectures, including Large Language Model Meta AI 3, Mistral, and Gemma, in the context of extracting judicial facts tailored to Indian judicial texts. Mistral and Gemma emerged as the top-performing models, showcasing balanced precision and recall crucial for accurate entity identification. These findings confirm the value of Large Language Models in judicial documents and demonstrate how they can facilitate and quicken scientific research by producing precise, organised data outputs that are appropriate for in-depth examination.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Despite recent advancements in federated learning (FL) for medical image diagnosis, addressing data heterogeneity among clients remains a significant challenge for practical implementation. A primary hurdle in FL arises from the non-IID nature of data samples across clients, which typically results in a decline in the performance of the aggregated global model. In this study, we introduce FedMRL, a novel federated multi-agent deep reinforcement learning framework designed to address data heterogeneity. FedMRL incorporates a novel loss function to facilitate fairness among clients, preventing bias in the final global model. Additionally, it employs a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach to calculate the proximal term $(\mu)$ for the personalized local objective function, ensuring convergence to the global optimum. Furthermore, FedMRL integrates an adaptive weight adjustment method using a Self-organizing map (SOM) on the server side to counteract distribution shifts among clients' local data distributions. We assess our approach using two publicly available real-world medical datasets, and the results demonstrate that FedMRL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, showing its efficacy in addressing data heterogeneity in federated learning.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Predicting ego vehicle trajectories remains a critical challenge, especially in urban and dense areas due to the unpredictable behaviours of other vehicles and pedestrians. Multimodal trajectory prediction enhances decision-making by considering multiple possible future trajectories based on diverse sources of environmental data. In this approach, we leverage ResNet-50 to extract image features from high-definition map data and use IMU sensor data to calculate speed, acceleration, and yaw rate. A temporal probabilistic network is employed to compute potential trajectories, selecting the most accurate and highly probable trajectory paths. This method integrates HD map data to improve the robustness and reliability of trajectory predictions for autonomous vehicles.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent multimodal large language models (MLLM) such as GPT-4o and GPT-4v have shown great potential in autonomous driving. In this paper, we propose a cross-domain few-shot in-context learning method based on the MLLM for enhancing traffic sign recognition (TSR). We first construct a traffic sign detection network based on Vision Transformer Adapter and an extraction module to extract traffic signs from the original road images. To reduce the dependence on training data and improve the performance stability of cross-country TSR, we introduce a cross-domain few-shot in-context learning method based on the MLLM. To enhance MLLM's fine-grained recognition ability of traffic signs, the proposed method generates corresponding description texts using template traffic signs. These description texts contain key information about the shape, color, and composition of traffic signs, which can stimulate the ability of MLLM to perceive fine-grained traffic sign categories. By using the description texts, our method reduces the cross-domain differences between template and real traffic signs. Our approach requires only simple and uniform textual indications, without the need for large-scale traffic sign images and labels. We perform comprehensive evaluations on the German traffic sign recognition benchmark dataset, the Belgium traffic sign dataset, and two real-world datasets taken from Japan. The experimental results show that our method significantly enhances the TSR performance.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Blood vessel networks, represented as 3D graphs, help predict disease biomarkers, simulate blood flow, and aid in synthetic image generation, relevant in both clinical and pre-clinical settings. However, generating realistic vessel graphs that correspond to an anatomy of interest is challenging. Previous methods aimed at generating vessel trees mostly in an autoregressive style and could not be applied to vessel graphs with cycles such as capillaries or specific anatomical structures such as the Circle of Willis. Addressing this gap, we introduce the first application of \textit{denoising diffusion models} in 3D vessel graph generation. Our contributions include a novel, two-stage generation method that sequentially denoises node coordinates and edges. We experiment with two real-world vessel datasets, consisting of microscopic capillaries and major cerebral vessels, and demonstrate the generalizability of our method for producing diverse, novel, and anatomically plausible vessel graphs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep learning has achieved impressive performance across various medical imaging tasks. However, its inherent bias against specific groups hinders its clinical applicability in equitable healthcare systems. A recently discovered phenomenon, Neural Collapse (NC), has shown potential in improving the generalization of state-of-the-art deep learning models. Nonetheless, its implications on bias in medical imaging remain unexplored. Our study investigates deep learning fairness through the lens of NC. We analyze the training dynamics of models as they approach NC when training using biased datasets, and examine the subsequent impact on test performance, specifically focusing on label bias. We find that biased training initially results in different NC configurations across subgroups, before converging to a final NC solution by memorizing all data samples. Through extensive experiments on three medical imaging datasets -- PAPILA, HAM10000, and CheXpert -- we find that in biased settings, NC can lead to a significant drop in F1 score across all subgroups.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Pathological structures in medical images are typically deviations from the expected anatomy of a patient. While clinicians consider this interplay between anatomy and pathology, recent deep learning algorithms specialize in recognizing either one of the two, rarely considering the patient's body from such a joint perspective. In this paper, we develop a generalist segmentation model that combines anatomical and pathological information, aiming to enhance the segmentation accuracy of pathological features. Our Anatomy-Pathology Exchange (APEx) training utilizes a query-based segmentation transformer which decodes a joint feature space into query-representations for human anatomy and interleaves them via a mixing strategy into the pathology-decoder for anatomy-informed pathology predictions. In doing so, we are able to report the best results across the board on FDG-PET-CT and Chest X-Ray pathology segmentation tasks with a margin of up to 3.3% as compared to strong baseline methods.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In recent years, there have been attempts to increase the kernel size of Convolutional Neural Nets (CNNs) to mimic the global receptive field of Vision Transformers' (ViTs) self-attention blocks. That approach, however, quickly hit an upper bound and saturated way before achieving a global receptive field. In this work, we demonstrate that by leveraging the Wavelet Transform (WT), it is, in fact, possible to obtain very large receptive fields without suffering from over-parameterization, e.g., for a $k \times k$ receptive field, the number of trainable parameters in the proposed method grows only logarithmically with $k$. The proposed layer, named WTConv, can be used as a drop-in replacement in existing architectures, results in an effective multi-frequency response, and scales gracefully with the size of the receptive field. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the WTConv layer within ConvNeXt and MobileNetV2 architectures for image classification, as well as backbones for downstream tasks, and show it yields additional properties such as robustness to image corruption and an increased response to shapes over textures.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, generative, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Contrastive learning (CL) for Vision Transformers (ViTs) in image domains has achieved performance comparable to CL for traditional convolutional backbones. However, in 3D point cloud pretraining with ViTs, masked autoencoder (MAE) modeling remains dominant. This raises the question: Can we take the best of both worlds? To answer this question, we first empirically validate that integrating MAE-based point cloud pre-training with the standard contrastive learning paradigm, even with meticulous design, can lead to a decrease in performance. To address this limitation, we reintroduce CL into the MAE-based point cloud pre-training paradigm by leveraging the inherent contrastive properties of MAE. Specifically, rather than relying on extensive data augmentation as commonly used in the image domain, we randomly mask the input tokens twice to generate contrastive input pairs. Subsequently, a weight-sharing encoder and two identically structured decoders are utilized to perform masked token reconstruction. Additionally, we propose that for an input token masked by both masks simultaneously, the reconstructed features should be as similar as possible. This naturally establishes an explicit contrastive constraint within the generative MAE-based pre-training paradigm, resulting in our proposed method, Point-CMAE. Consequently, Point-CMAE effectively enhances the representation quality and transfer performance compared to its MAE counterpart. Experimental evaluations across various downstream applications, including classification, part segmentation, and few-shot learning, demonstrate the efficacy of our framework in surpassing state-of-the-art techniques under standard ViTs and single-modal settings.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent studies have demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) are susceptible to being misled by false premise questions (FPQs), leading to errors in factual knowledge, know as factuality hallucination. Existing benchmarks that assess this vulnerability primarily rely on manual construction, resulting in limited scale and lack of scalability. In this work, we introduce an automated, scalable pipeline to create FPQs based on knowledge graphs (KGs). The first step is modifying true triplets extracted from KGs to create false premises. Subsequently, utilizing the state-of-the-art capabilities of GPTs, we generate semantically rich FPQs. Based on the proposed method, we present a comprehensive benchmark, the Knowledge Graph-based False Premise Questions (KG-FPQ), which contains approximately 178k FPQs across three knowledge domains, at six levels of confusability, and in two task formats. Using KG-FPQ, we conduct extensive evaluations on several representative LLMs and provide valuable insights. The KG-FPQ dataset and code are available at~this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Robust and effective scaling of models from small to large width typically requires the precise adjustment of many algorithmic and architectural details, such as parameterization and optimizer choices. In this work, we propose a new perspective on parameterization by investigating a key assumption in prior work about the alignment between parameters and data and derive new theoretical results under weaker assumptions and a broader set of optimizers. Our extensive empirical investigation includes tens of thousands of models trained with all combinations of three optimizers, four parameterizations, several alignment assumptions, more than a dozen learning rates, and fourteen model sizes up to 26.8B parameters. We find that the best learning rate scaling prescription would often have been excluded by the assumptions in prior work. Our results show that all parameterizations, not just maximal update parameterization (muP), can achieve hyperparameter transfer; moreover, our novel per-layer learning rate prescription for standard parameterization outperforms muP. Finally, we demonstrate that an overlooked aspect of parameterization, the epsilon parameter in Adam, must be scaled correctly to avoid gradient underflow and propose Adam-atan2, a new numerically stable, scale-invariant version of Adam that eliminates the epsilon hyperparameter entirely.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>For image inpainting, the existing Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) based method i.e. RePaint can produce high-quality images for any inpainting form. It utilizes a pre-trained DDPM as a prior and generates inpainting results by conditioning on the reverse diffusion process, namely denoising process. However, this process is significantly time-consuming. In this paper, we propose an efficient DDPM-based image inpainting method which includes three speed-up strategies. First, we utilize a pre-trained Light-Weight Diffusion Model (LWDM) to reduce the number of parameters. Second, we introduce a skip-step sampling scheme of Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) for the denoising process. Finally, we propose Coarse-to-Fine Sampling (CFS), which speeds up inference by reducing image resolution in the coarse stage and decreasing denoising timesteps in the refinement stage. We conduct extensive experiments on both faces and general-purpose image inpainting tasks, and our method achieves competitive performance with approximately 60 times speedup.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Transformers have exhibited promising performance in computer vision tasks including image super-resolution (SR). However, popular transformer-based SR methods often employ window self-attention with quadratic computational complexity to window sizes, resulting in fixed small windows with limited receptive fields. In this paper, we present a general strategy to convert transformer-based SR networks to hierarchical transformers (HiT-SR), boosting SR performance with multi-scale features while maintaining an efficient design. Specifically, we first replace the commonly used fixed small windows with expanding hierarchical windows to aggregate features at different scales and establish long-range dependencies. Considering the intensive computation required for large windows, we further design a spatial-channel correlation method with linear complexity to window sizes, efficiently gathering spatial and channel information from hierarchical windows. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our HiT-SR, and our improved versions of SwinIR-Light, SwinIR-NG, and SRFormer-Light yield state-of-the-art SR results with fewer parameters, FLOPs, and faster speeds ($\sim7\times$).</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The consequences of a healthcare data breach can be devastating for the patients, providers, and payers. The average financial impact of a data breach in recent months has been estimated to be close to USD 10 million. This is especially significant for healthcare organizations in India that are managing rapid digitization while still establishing data governance procedures that align with the letter and spirit of the law. Computer-based systems for de-identification of personal information are vulnerable to data drift, often rendering them ineffective in cross-institution settings. Therefore, a rigorous assessment of existing de-identification against local health datasets is imperative to support the safe adoption of digital health initiatives in India. Using a small set of de-identified patient discharge summaries provided by an Indian healthcare institution, in this paper, we report the nominal performance of de-identification algorithms (based on language models) trained on publicly available non-Indian datasets, pointing towards a lack of cross-institutional generalization. Similarly, experimentation with off-the-shelf de-identification systems reveals potential risks associated with the approach. To overcome data scarcity, we explore generating synthetic clinical reports (using publicly available and Indian summaries) by performing in-context learning over Large Language Models (LLMs). Our experiments demonstrate the use of generated reports as an effective strategy for creating high-performing de-identification systems with good generalization capabilities.</li>

This paper proposes to achieve semantic video object segmentation by learning a data-driven representation which captures the synergy of multiple instances from continuous frames. To prune the noisy detections, we exploit the rich information among multiple instances and select the discriminative and representative subset. This selection process is formulated as a facility location problem solved by maximising a submodular function. Our method retrieves the longer term contextual dependencies which underpins a robust semantic video object segmentation algorithm. We present extensive experiments on a challenging dataset that demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared with the state-of-the-art methods.</li>

This graph-based model enables the learning and propagation of higher-level spatial-temporal contexts to facilitate the semantic labeling of local regions. We introduce an exemplar-based nonparametric view of contextual cues, where the inherent relationships implied by object hypotheses are encoded on a similarity graph of regions. Contextual relationships learning and propagation are performed to estimate the pairwise contexts between all pairs of unlabeled local regions. Our algorithm integrates the learned contexts into a Conditional Random Field (CRF) in the form of pairwise potentials and infers the per-region semantic labels. We evaluate our approach on the challenging YouTube-Objects dataset which shows that the proposed contextual relationship model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) providers have a responsibility to develop valid and reliable systems. Much has been discussed about trusting AI and ML inferences (the process of running live data through a trained AI model to make a prediction or solve a task), but little has been done to define what that means. Those in the space of ML- based products are familiar with topics such as transparency, explainability, safety, bias, and so forth. Yet, there are no frameworks to quantify and measure those. Producing ever more trustworthy machine learning inferences is a path to increase the value of products (i.e., increased trust in the results) and to engage in conversations with users to gather feedback to improve products. In this paper, we begin by examining the dynamic of trust between a provider (Trustor) and users (Trustees). Trustors are required to be trusting and trustworthy, whereas trustees need not be trusting nor trustworthy. The challenge for trustors is to provide results that are good enough to make a trustee increase their level of trust above a minimum threshold for: 1- doing business together; 2- continuation of service. We conclude by defining and proposing a framework, and a set of viable metrics, to be used for computing a trust score and objectively understand how trustworthy a machine learning system can claim to be, plus their behavior over time.</li>

We worked with the domain experts of SAP SE to develop an HR support chatbot as an efficient and effective tool for addressing employee inquiries. We inserted a human-in-the-loop in various parts of the development cycles such as dataset collection, prompt optimization, and evaluation of generated output. By enhancing the LLM-driven chatbot's response quality and exploring alternative retrieval methods, we have created an efficient, scalable, and flexible tool for HR professionals to address employee inquiries effectively. Our experiments and evaluation conclude that GPT-4 outperforms other models and can overcome inconsistencies in data through internal reasoning capabilities. Additionally, through expert analysis, we infer that reference-free evaluation metrics such as G-Eval and Prometheus demonstrate reliability closely aligned with that of human evaluation.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper investigates how to efficiently deploy transformer-based neural networks on edge devices. Recent methods reduce the latency of transformer neural networks by removing or merging tokens, with small accuracy degradation. However, these methods are not designed with edge device deployment in mind, and do not leverage information about the hardware characteristics to improve efficiency. First, we show that the relationship between latency and workload size is governed by the GPU tail-effect. This relationship is used to create a token pruning schedule tailored for a pre-trained model and device pair. Second, we demonstrate a training-free token pruning method utilizing this relationship. This method achieves accuracy-latency trade-offs in a hardware aware manner. We show that for single batch inference, other methods may actually increase latency by 18.6-30.3% with respect to baseline, while we can reduce it by 9%. For similar latency (within 5.2%) across devices we achieve 78.6%-84.5% ImageNet1K accuracy, while the state-of-the-art, Token Merging, achieves 45.8%-85.4%.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Insider threats refer to threats originating from people inside organizations. Although such threats are a classical research topic, the systematization of existing knowledge is still limited particularly with respect to non-technical research approaches. To this end, this paper presents a systematic literature review on the psychology of insider threats. According to the review results, the literature has operated with multiple distinct theories but there is still a lack of robust theorization with respect to psychology. The literature has also considered characteristics of a person, his or her personal situation, and other more or less objective facts about the person. These are seen to correlate with psychological concepts such as personality traits and psychological states of a person. In addition, the review discusses gaps and limitations in the existing research, thus opening the door for further psychology research.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The dynamic characteristics of multiphase industrial processes present significant challenges in the field of industrial big data modeling. Traditional soft sensing models frequently neglect the process dynamics and have difficulty in capturing transient phenomena like phase transitions. To address this issue, this article introduces a causality-driven sequence segmentation (CDSS) model. This model first identifies the local dynamic properties of the causal relationships between variables, which are also referred to as causal mechanisms. It then segments the sequence into different phases based on the sudden shifts in causal mechanisms that occur during phase transitions. Additionally, a novel metric, similarity distance, is designed to evaluate the temporal consistency of causal mechanisms, which includes both causal similarity distance and stable similarity distance. The discovered causal relationships in each phase are represented as a temporal causal graph (TCG). Furthermore, a soft sensing model called temporal-causal graph convolutional network (TC-GCN) is trained for each phase, by using the time-extended data and the adjacency matrix of TCG. The numerical examples are utilized to validate the proposed CDSS model, and the segmentation results demonstrate that CDSS has excellent performance on segmenting both stable and unstable multiphase series. Especially, it has higher accuracy in separating non-stationary time series compared to other methods. The effectiveness of the proposed CDSS model and the TC-GCN model is also verified through a penicillin fermentation process. Experimental results indicate that the breakpoints discovered by CDSS align well with the reaction mechanisms and TC-GCN significantly has excellent predictive accuracy.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, attack, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The recent development of Sora leads to a new era in text-to-video (T2V) generation. Along with this comes the rising concern about its security risks. The generated videos may contain illegal or unethical content, and there is a lack of comprehensive quantitative understanding of their safety, posing a challenge to their reliability and practical deployment. Previous evaluations primarily focus on the quality of video generation. While some evaluations of text-to-image models have considered safety, they cover fewer aspects and do not address the unique temporal risk inherent in video generation. To bridge this research gap, we introduce T2VSafetyBench, a new benchmark designed for conducting safety-critical assessments of text-to-video models. We define 12 critical aspects of video generation safety and construct a malicious prompt dataset using LLMs and jailbreaking prompt attacks. Based on our evaluation results, we draw several important findings, including: 1) no single model excels in all aspects, with different models showing various strengths; 2) the correlation between GPT-4 assessments and manual reviews is generally high; 3) there is a trade-off between the usability and safety of text-to-video generative models. This indicates that as the field of video generation rapidly advances, safety risks are set to surge, highlighting the urgency of prioritizing video safety. We hope that T2VSafetyBench can provide insights for better understanding the safety of video generation in the era of generative AI.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advancements in both transformer-based methods and spiral neighbor sampling techniques have greatly enhanced hand mesh reconstruction. Transformers excel in capturing complex vertex relationships, and spiral neighbor sampling is vital for utilizing topological structures. This paper ingeniously integrates spiral sampling into the Transformer architecture, enhancing its ability to leverage mesh topology for superior performance in hand mesh reconstruction, resulting in substantial accuracy boosts. STMR employs a single image encoder for model efficiency. To augment its information extraction capability, we design the multi-scale pose feature extraction (MSPFE) module, which facilitates the extraction of rich pose features, ultimately enhancing the model's performance. Moreover, the proposed predefined pose-to-vertex lifting (PPVL) method improves vertex feature representation, further boosting reconstruction performance. Extensive experiments on the FreiHAND dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance and unparalleled inference speed of STMR compared with similar backbone methods, showcasing its efficiency and effectiveness.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we propose a new architecture, called Deform-Mamba, for MR image super-resolution. Unlike conventional CNN or Transformer-based super-resolution approaches which encounter challenges related to the local respective field or heavy computational cost, our approach aims to effectively explore the local and global information of images. Specifically, we develop a Deform-Mamba encoder which is composed of two branches, modulated deform block and vision Mamba block. We also design a multi-view context module in the bottleneck layer to explore the multi-view contextual content. Thanks to the extracted features of the encoder, which include content-adaptive local and efficient global information, the vision Mamba decoder finally generates high-quality MR images. Moreover, we introduce a contrastive edge loss to promote the reconstruction of edge and contrast related content. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results indicate that our approach on IXI and fastMRI datasets achieves competitive performance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The robustness of supervised deep learning-based medical image classification is significantly undermined by label noise. Although several methods have been proposed to enhance classification performance in the presence of noisy labels, they face some challenges: 1) a struggle with class-imbalanced datasets, leading to the frequent overlooking of minority classes as noisy samples; 2) a singular focus on maximizing performance using noisy datasets, without incorporating experts-in-the-loop for actively cleaning the noisy labels. To mitigate these challenges, we propose a two-phase approach that combines Learning with Noisy Labels (LNL) and active learning. This approach not only improves the robustness of medical image classification in the presence of noisy labels, but also iteratively improves the quality of the dataset by relabeling the important incorrect labels, under a limited annotation budget. Furthermore, we introduce a novel Variance of Gradients approach in LNL phase, which complements the loss-based sample selection by also sampling under-represented samples. Using two imbalanced noisy medical classification datasets, we demonstrate that that our proposed technique is superior to its predecessors at handling class imbalance by not misidentifying clean samples from minority classes as mostly noisy samples.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models~(LLMs) demonstrate remarkable translation capabilities in high-resource language tasks, yet their performance in low-resource languages is hindered by insufficient multilingual data during pre-training. To address this, we dedicate 35,000 A100-SXM4-80GB GPU hours in conducting extensive multilingual continual pre-training on the LLaMA series models, enabling translation support across more than 100 languages. Through a comprehensive analysis of training strategies, such as vocabulary expansion and data augmentation, we develop LLaMAX. Remarkably, without sacrificing its generalization ability, LLaMAX achieves significantly higher translation performance compared to existing open-source LLMs~(by more than 10 spBLEU points) and performs on-par with specialized translation model~(M2M-100-12B) on the Flores-101 benchmark. Extensive experiments indicate that LLaMAX can serve as a robust multilingual foundation model.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>explainability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Over recent years, deep convolutional neural networks have significantly advanced the field of face recognition techniques for both verification and identification purposes. Despite the impressive accuracy, these neural networks are often criticized for lacking explainability. There is a growing demand for understanding the decision-making process of AI-based face recognition systems. Some studies have investigated the use of visual saliency maps as explanations, but they have predominantly focused on the specific face verification case. The discussion on more general face recognition scenarios and the corresponding evaluation methodology for these explanations have long been absent in current research. Therefore, this manuscript conceives a comprehensive explanation framework for face recognition tasks. Firstly, an exhaustive definition of visual saliency map-based explanations for AI-based face recognition systems is provided, taking into account the two most common recognition situations individually, i.e., face verification and identification. Secondly, a new model-agnostic explanation method named CorrRISE is proposed to produce saliency maps, which reveal both the similar and dissimilar regions between any given face images. Subsequently, the explanation framework conceives a new evaluation methodology that offers quantitative measurement and comparison of the performance of general visual saliency explanation methods in face recognition. Consequently, extensive experiments are carried out on multiple verification and identification scenarios. The results showcase that CorrRISE generates insightful saliency maps and demonstrates superior performance, particularly in similarity maps in comparison with the state-of-the-art explanation approaches.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we propose a self-prior guided Mamba-UNet network (SMamba-UNet) for medical image super-resolution. Existing methods are primarily based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or Transformers. CNNs-based methods fail to capture long-range dependencies, while Transformer-based approaches face heavy calculation challenges due to their quadratic computational complexity. Recently, State Space Models (SSMs) especially Mamba have emerged, capable of modeling long-range dependencies with linear computational complexity. Inspired by Mamba, our approach aims to learn the self-prior multi-scale contextual features under Mamba-UNet networks, which may help to super-resolve low-resolution medical images in an efficient way. Specifically, we obtain self-priors by perturbing the brightness inpainting of the input image during network training, which can learn detailed texture and brightness information that is beneficial for super-resolution. Furthermore, we combine Mamba with Unet network to mine global features at different levels. We also design an improved 2D-Selective-Scan (ISS2D) module to divide image features into different directional sequences to learn long-range dependencies in multiple directions, and adaptively fuse sequence information to enhance super-resolved feature representation. Both qualitative and quantitative experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on two public medical datasets: the IXI and fastMRI.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) is a challenging task that aims to retrieve the target image based on a multimodal query, i.e., a reference image and its corresponding modification text. While previous supervised or zero-shot learning paradigms all fail to strike a good trade-off between time-consuming annotation cost and retrieval performance, recent researchers introduced the task of few-shot CIR (FS-CIR) and proposed a textual inversion-based network based on pretrained CLIP model to realize it. Despite its promising performance, the approach suffers from two key limitations: insufficient multimodal query composition training and indiscriminative training triplet selection. To address these two limitations, in this work, we propose a novel two-stage pseudo triplet guided few-shot CIR scheme, dubbed PTG-FSCIR. In the first stage, we employ a masked training strategy and advanced image caption generator to construct pseudo triplets from pure image data to enable the model to acquire primary knowledge related to multimodal query composition. In the second stage, based on active learning, we design a pseudo modification text-based query-target distance metric to evaluate the challenging score for each unlabeled sample. Meanwhile, we propose a robust top range-based random sampling strategy according to the 3-$\sigma$ rule in statistics, to sample the challenging samples for fine-tuning the pretrained model. Notably, our scheme is plug-and-play and compatible with any existing supervised CIR models. We tested our scheme across three backbones on three public datasets (i.e., FashionIQ, CIRR, and Birds-to-Words), achieving maximum improvements of 26.4%, 25.5% and 21.6% respectively, demonstrating our scheme's effectiveness.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While humans naturally develop theory of mind (ToM), the capability to understand other people's mental states and beliefs, state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) underperform on simple ToM benchmarks. We posit that we can extend our understanding of LLMs' ToM abilities by evaluating key human ToM precursors -- perception inference and perception-to-belief inference -- in LLMs. We introduce two datasets, Percept-ToMi and Percept-FANToM, to evaluate these precursory inferences for ToM in LLMs by annotating characters' perceptions on ToMi and FANToM, respectively. Our evaluation of eight state-of-the-art LLMs reveals that the models generally perform well in perception inference while exhibiting limited capability in perception-to-belief inference (e.g., lack of inhibitory control). Based on these results, we present PercepToM, a novel ToM method leveraging LLMs' strong perception inference capability while supplementing their limited perception-to-belief inference. Experimental results demonstrate that PercepToM significantly enhances LLM's performance, especially in false belief scenarios.</li>

By systematically extracting features from visual, audio, and text data, and experimenting with different combinations, we developed a robust model that achieved an impressive 99% accuracy. Our methodology emphasizes the significance of feature engineering in deception detection, providing a clear and interpretable framework. We trained various machine learning models, including LSTM, BiLSTM, and pre-trained CNNs, using both single and multi-modal approaches. The results demonstrated that combining multiple modalities significantly enhances detection performance compared to single modality training.

Analysis shows that Random Forest and Extra Trees do better in terms of accuracy though in different aspects of the dataset characteristics and types of threat. This research not only emphasizes the strengths and weaknesses of each predictive model but also addresses the difficulties associated with deploying such technologies in the real-world environment, such as data dependency and computational demands.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Night time semantic segmentation is a crucial task in computer vision, focusing on accurately classifying and segmenting objects in low-light conditions. Unlike daytime techniques, which often perform worse in nighttime scenes, it is essential for autonomous driving due to insufficient lighting, low illumination, dynamic lighting, shadow effects, and reduced contrast. We propose RHRSegNet, implementing a relighting model over a High-Resolution Network for semantic segmentation. RHRSegNet implements residual convolutional feature learning to handle complex lighting conditions. Our model then feeds the lightened scene feature maps into a high-resolution network for scene segmentation. The network consists of a convolutional producing feature maps with varying resolutions, achieving different levels of resolution through down-sampling and up-sampling. Large nighttime datasets are used for training and evaluation, such as NightCity, City-Scape, and Dark-Zurich datasets. Our proposed model increases the HRnet segmentation performance by 5% in low-light or nighttime images.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Weakly-Supervised Video Object Localization (WSVOL) involves localizing an object in videos using only video-level labels, also referred to as tags. State-of-the-art WSVOL methods like Temporal CAM (TCAM) rely on class activation mapping (CAM) and typically require a pre-trained CNN classifier. However, their localization accuracy is affected by their tendency to minimize the mutual information between different instances of a class and exploit temporal information during training for downstream tasks, e.g., detection and tracking. In the absence of bounding box annotation, it is challenging to exploit precise information about objects from temporal cues because the model struggles to locate objects over time. To address these issues, a novel method called transformer based CAM for videos (TrCAM-V), is proposed for WSVOL. It consists of a DeiT backbone with two heads for classification and localization. The classification head is trained using standard classification loss (CL), while the localization head is trained using pseudo-labels that are extracted using a pre-trained CLIP model. From these pseudo-labels, the high and low activation values are considered to be foreground and background regions, respectively. Our TrCAM-V method allows training a localization network by sampling pseudo-pixels on the fly from these regions. Additionally, a conditional random field (CRF) loss is employed to align the object boundaries with the foreground map. During inference, the model can process individual frames for real-time localization applications. Extensive experiments on challenging YouTube-Objects unconstrained video datasets show that our TrCAM-V method achieves new state-of-the-art performance in terms of classification and localization accuracy.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) can spend extra compute during inference to generate intermediate thoughts, which helps to produce better final responses. Since Chain-of-Thought (Wei et al., 2022), many such System 2 techniques have been proposed such as Rephrase and Respond (Deng et al., 2023a), System 2 Attention (Weston and Sukhbaatar, 2023) and Branch-Solve-Merge (Saha et al., 2023). In this work we investigate self-supervised methods to ``compile'' (distill) higher quality outputs from System 2 techniques back into LLM generations without intermediate reasoning token sequences, as this reasoning has been distilled into System 1. We show that several such techniques can be successfully distilled, resulting in improved results compared to the original System 1 performance, and with less inference cost than System 2. We posit that such System 2 distillation will be an important feature of future continually learning AI systems, enabling them to focus System 2 capabilities on the reasoning tasks that they cannot yet do well.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In recent years, the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has spurred a growing demand for plug-and-play AI systems. Among the various AI techniques, prompt engineering stands out as particularly significant. However, users often face challenges in writing prompts due to the steep learning curve and significant time investment, and existing automatic prompt engineering (APE) models can be difficult to use. To address this issue, we propose PAS, an LLM-based plug-and-play APE system. PAS utilizes LLMs trained on high-quality, automatically generated prompt complementary datasets, resulting in exceptional performance. In comprehensive benchmarks, PAS achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) results compared to previous APE models, with an average improvement of 6.09 points. Moreover, PAS is highly efficient, achieving SoTA performance with only 9000 data points. Additionally, PAS can autonomously generate prompt augmentation data without requiring additional human labor. Its flexibility also allows it to be compatible with all existing LLMs and applicable to a wide range of tasks. PAS excels in human evaluations, underscoring its suitability as a plug-in for users. This combination of high performance, efficiency, and flexibility makes PAS a valuable system for enhancing the usability and effectiveness of LLMs through improved prompt engineering.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Increasingly, business opportunities available to fabless design teams in the semiconductor industry far exceed those addressable with on-prem compute resources. An attractive option to capture these electronic design automation (EDA) design opportunities is through public cloud bursting. However, security concerns with public cloud bursting arise from having to protect process design kits, third party intellectual property, and new design data for semiconductor devices and chips. One way to address security concerns for public cloud bursting is to leverage confidential containers for EDA workloads. Confidential containers add zero trust computing elements to significantly reduce the probability of intellectual property escapes. A key concern that often follows security discussions is whether EDA workload performance will suffer with confidential computing. In this work we demonstrate a full set of EDA confidential containers and their deployment and characterize performance impacts of confidential elements of the flow including storage and networking. A complete end-to-end confidential container-based EDA workload exhibits 7.13% and 2.05% performance overheads over bare-metal container and VM based solutions, respectively.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) simplifies querying vast amounts of knowledge stored in a graph-based model using natural language. However, the research has largely concentrated on English, putting non-English speakers at a disadvantage. Meanwhile, existing multilingual KGQA systems face challenges in achieving performance comparable to English systems, highlighting the difficulty of generating SPARQL queries from diverse languages. In this research, we propose a simplified approach to enhance multilingual KGQA systems by incorporating linguistic context and entity information directly into the processing pipeline of a language model. Unlike existing methods that rely on separate encoders for integrating auxiliary information, our strategy leverages a single, pretrained multilingual transformer-based language model to manage both the primary input and the auxiliary data. Our methodology significantly improves the language model's ability to accurately convert a natural language query into a relevant SPARQL query. It demonstrates promising results on the most recent QALD datasets, namely QALD-9-Plus and QALD-10. Furthermore, we introduce and evaluate our approach on Chinese and Japanese, thereby expanding the language diversity of the existing datasets.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Domain adaptation (DA) techniques help deep learning models generalize across data shifts for point cloud semantic segmentation (PCSS). Test-time adaptation (TTA) allows direct adaptation of a pre-trained model to unlabeled data during inference stage without access to source data or additional training, avoiding privacy issues and large computational resources. We address TTA for geospatial PCSS by introducing three domain shift paradigms: photogrammetric to airborne LiDAR, airborne to mobile LiDAR, and synthetic to mobile laser scanning. We propose a TTA method that progressively updates batch normalization (BN) statistics with each testing batch. Additionally, a self-supervised learning module optimizes learnable BN affine parameters. Information maximization and reliability-constrained pseudo-labeling improve prediction confidence and supply supervisory signals. Experimental results show our method improves classification accuracy by up to 20\% mIoU, outperforming other methods. For photogrammetric (SensatUrban) to airborne (Hessigheim 3D) adaptation at the inference stage, our method achieves 59.46\% mIoU and 85.97\% OA without retraining or fine-turning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit undesirable behaviors, such as hallucinations and sequence repetitions. We propose to view these behaviors as fallbacks that models exhibit under uncertainty, and investigate the connection between them. We categorize fallback behaviors -- sequence repetitions, degenerate text, and hallucinations -- and extensively analyze them in models from the same family that differ by the amount of pretraining tokens, parameter count, or the inclusion of instruction-following training. Our experiments reveal a clear and consistent ordering of fallback behaviors, across all these axes: the more advanced an LLM is (i.e., trained on more tokens, has more parameters, or instruction-tuned), its fallback behavior shifts from sequence repetitions, to degenerate text, and then to hallucinations. Moreover, the same ordering is observed throughout a single generation, even for the best-performing models; as uncertainty increases, models shift from generating hallucinations to producing degenerate text and then sequence repetitions. Lastly, we demonstrate that while common decoding techniques, such as random sampling, might alleviate some unwanted behaviors like sequence repetitions, they increase harder-to-detect hallucinations.</li>

Our model employs a layered U-Net architecture that simultaneously synthesizes images at multiple resolution scales. We show that this method outperforms the baseline of synthesizing images only at the target resolution, while reducing the computational cost per step. We demonstrate that higher resolution synthesis can be achieved by layering convolutions at additional resolution scales, in contrast to other methods which require additional models for super-resolution synthesis.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Controllable learning (CL) emerges as a critical component in trustworthy machine learning, ensuring that learners meet predefined targets and can adaptively adjust without retraining according to the changes in those targets. We provide a formal definition of CL, and discuss its applications in information retrieval (IR) where information needs are often complex and dynamic. The survey categorizes CL according to who controls (users or platforms), what is controllable (e.g., retrieval objectives, users' historical behaviors, controllable environmental adaptation), how control is implemented (e.g., rule-based method, Pareto optimization, Hypernetwork), and where to implement control (e.g.,pre-processing, in-processing, post-processing methods). Then, we identify challenges faced by CL across training, evaluation, task setting, and deployment in online environments. Additionally, we outline promising directions for CL in theoretical analysis, efficient computation, empowering large language models, application scenarios and evaluation frameworks in IR.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>3D Vision-Language Pre-training (3D-VLP) aims to provide a pre-train model which can bridge 3D scenes with natural language, which is an important technique for embodied intelligence. However, current 3D-VLP datasets are hindered by limited scene-level diversity and insufficient fine-grained annotations (only 1.2K scenes and 280K textual annotations in ScanScribe), primarily due to the labor-intensive of collecting and annotating 3D scenes. To overcome these obstacles, we construct SynVL3D, a comprehensive synthetic scene-text corpus with 10K indoor scenes and 1M descriptions at object, view, and room levels, which has the advantages of diverse scene data, rich textual descriptions, multi-grained 3D-text associations, and low collection cost. Utilizing the rich annotations in SynVL3D, we pre-train a simple and unified Transformer for aligning 3D and language with multi-grained pretraining tasks. Moreover, we propose a synthetic-to-real domain adaptation in downstream task fine-tuning process to address the domain shift. Through extensive experiments, we verify the effectiveness of our model design by achieving state-of-the-art performance on downstream tasks including visual grounding, dense captioning, and question answering.</li>

In this study, we propose a self-supervised, large language model-based (LLMcap) method for PCAP failure detection. LLMcap leverages language-learning abilities and employs masked language modeling to learn grammar, context, and structure. Tested rigorously on various PCAPs, it demonstrates high accuracy despite the absence of labeled data during training, presenting a promising solution for efficient network analysis.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The prevailing approach to embedding prior knowledge within convolutional layers typically includes the design of steerable kernels or their modulation using designated kernel banks. In this study, we introduce the Analytic Convolutional Layer (ACL), an innovative model-driven convolutional layer, which is a mosaic of analytical convolution kernels (ACKs) and traditional convolution kernels. ACKs are characterized by mathematical functions governed by analytic kernel parameters (AKPs) learned in training process. Learnable AKPs permit the adaptive update of incorporated knowledge to align with the features representation of data. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the ACLs not only have a remarkable capacity for feature representation with a reduced number of parameters but also attain increased reliability through the analytical formulation of ACKs. Furthermore, ACLs offer a means for neural network interpretation, thereby paving the way for the intrinsic interpretability of neural network.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has ushered natural language processing (NLP) research into a new era. Despite their diverse capabilities, LLMs trained on different corpora exhibit varying strengths and weaknesses, leading to challenges in maximizing their overall efficiency and versatility. To address these challenges, recent studies have explored collaborative strategies for LLMs. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of this emerging research area, highlighting the motivation behind such collaborations. Specifically, we categorize collaborative strategies into three primary approaches: Merging, Ensemble, and Cooperation. Merging involves integrating multiple LLMs in the parameter space. Ensemble combines the outputs of various LLMs. Cooperation} leverages different LLMs to allow full play to their diverse capabilities for specific tasks. We provide in-depth introductions to these methods from different perspectives and discuss their potential applications. Additionally, we outline future research directions, hoping this work will catalyze further studies on LLM collaborations and paving the way for advanced NLP applications.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) provides all-weather, high-resolution imaging capabilities, but its unique imaging mechanism often requires expert interpretation, limiting its widespread applicability. Translating SAR images into more easily recognizable optical images using diffusion models helps address this challenge. However, diffusion models suffer from high latency due to numerous iterative inferences, while Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can achieve image translation with just a single iteration but often at the cost of image quality. To overcome these issues, we propose a new training framework for SAR-to-optical image translation that combines the strengths of both approaches. Our method employs consistency distillation to reduce iterative inference steps and integrates adversarial learning to ensure image clarity and minimize color shifts. Additionally, our approach allows for a trade-off between quality and speed, providing flexibility based on application requirements. We conducted experiments on SEN12 and GF3 datasets, performing quantitative evaluations using Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and Frechet Inception Distance (FID), as well as calculating the inference latency. The results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves inference speed by 131 times while maintaining the visual quality of the generated images, thus offering a robust and efficient solution for SAR-to-optical image translation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Injustice occurs when someone experiences unfair treatment or their rights are violated and is often due to the presence of implicit biases and prejudice such as stereotypes. The automated identification of injustice in text has received little attention, due in part to the fact that underlying implicit biases or stereotypes are rarely explicitly stated and that instances often occur unconsciously due to the pervasive nature of prejudice in society. Here, we describe a novel framework that combines the use of a fine-tuned BERT-based bias detection model, two stereotype detection models, and a lexicon-based approach to show that epistemological biases (i.e., words, which presupposes, entails, asserts, hedges, or boosts text to erode or assert a person's capacity as a knower) can assist with the automatic detection of injustice in text. The news media has many instances of injustice (i.e. discriminatory narratives), thus it is our use case here. We conduct and discuss an empirical qualitative research study which shows how the framework can be applied to detect injustices, even at higher volumes of data.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Modeling thermal states for complex space missions, such as the surface exploration of airless bodies, requires high computation, whether used in ground-based analysis for spacecraft design or during onboard reasoning for autonomous operations. For example, a finite-element thermal model with hundreds of elements can take significant time to simulate, which makes it unsuitable for onboard reasoning during time-sensitive scenarios such as descent and landing, proximity operations, or in-space assembly. Further, the lack of fast and accurate thermal modeling drives thermal designs to be more conservative and leads to spacecraft with larger mass and higher power budgets. The emerging paradigm of physics-informed machine learning (PIML) presents a class of hybrid modeling architectures that address this challenge by combining simplified physics models with machine learning (ML) models resulting in models which maintain both interpretability and robustness. Such techniques enable designs with reduced mass and power through onboard thermal-state estimation and control and may lead to improved onboard handling of off-nominal states, including unplanned down-time. The PIML model or hybrid model presented here consists of a neural network which predicts reduced nodalizations (distribution and size of coarse mesh) given on-orbit thermal load conditions, and subsequently a (relatively coarse) finite-difference model operates on this mesh to predict thermal states. We compare the computational performance and accuracy of the hybrid model to a data-driven neural net model, and a high-fidelity finite-difference model of a prototype Earth-orbiting small spacecraft. The PIML based active nodalization approach provides significantly better generalization than the neural net model and coarse mesh model, while reducing computing cost by up to 1.7x compared to the high-fidelity model.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Controllable generation is considered a potentially vital approach to address the challenge of annotating 3D data, and the precision of such controllable generation becomes particularly imperative in the context of data production for autonomous driving. Existing methods focus on the integration of diverse generative information into controlling inputs, utilizing frameworks such as GLIGEN or ControlNet, to produce commendable outcomes in controllable generation. However, such approaches intrinsically restrict generation performance to the learning capacities of predefined network architectures. In this paper, we explore the integration of controlling information and introduce PerlDiff (Perspective-Layout Diffusion Models), a method for effective street view image generation that fully leverages perspective 3D geometric information. Our PerlDiff employs 3D geometric priors to guide the generation of street view images with precise object-level control within the network learning process, resulting in a more robust and controllable output. Moreover, it demonstrates superior controllability compared to alternative layout control methods. Empirical results justify that our PerlDiff markedly enhances the precision of generation on the NuScenes and KITTI datasets. Our codes and models are publicly available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Crowd counting is gaining societal relevance, particularly in domains of Urban Planning, Crowd Management, and Public Safety. This paper introduces Fourier-guided attention (FGA), a novel attention mechanism for crowd count estimation designed to address the inefficient full-scale global pattern capture in existing works on convolution-based attention networks. FGA efficiently captures multi-scale information, including full-scale global patterns, by utilizing Fast-Fourier Transformations (FFT) along with spatial attention for global features and convolutions with channel-wise attention for semi-global and local features. The architecture of FGA involves a dual-path approach: (1) a path for processing full-scale global features through FFT, allowing for efficient extraction of information in the frequency domain, and (2) a path for processing remaining feature maps for semi-global and local features using traditional convolutions and channel-wise attention. This dual-path architecture enables FGA to seamlessly integrate frequency and spatial information, enhancing its ability to capture diverse crowd patterns. We apply FGA in the last layers of two popular crowd-counting works, CSRNet and CANNet, to evaluate the module's performance on benchmark datasets such as ShanghaiTech-A, ShanghaiTech-B, UCF-CC-50, and JHU++ crowd. The experiments demonstrate a notable improvement across all datasets based on Mean-Squared-Error (MSE) and Mean-Absolute-Error (MAE) metrics, showing comparable performance to recent state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we illustrate the interpretability using qualitative analysis, leveraging Grad-CAM heatmaps, to show the effectiveness of FGA in capturing crowd patterns.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper introduces Diffuse-TreeVAE, a deep generative model that integrates hierarchical clustering into the framework of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs). The proposed approach generates new images by sampling from a root embedding of a learned latent tree VAE-based structure, it then propagates through hierarchical paths, and utilizes a second-stage DDPM to refine and generate distinct, high-quality images for each data cluster. The result is a model that not only improves image clarity but also ensures that the generated samples are representative of their respective clusters, addressing the limitations of previous VAE-based methods and advancing the state of clustering-based generative modeling.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While deep learning-based general object detection has made significant strides in recent years, the effectiveness and efficiency of small object detection remain unsatisfactory. This is primarily attributed not only to the limited characteristics of such small targets but also to the high density and mutual overlap among these targets. The existing transformer-based small object detectors do not leverage the gap between accuracy and inference speed. To address challenges, we propose methods enhancing sampling within an end-to-end framework. Sample Points Refinement (SPR) constrains localization and attention, preserving meaningful interactions in the region of interest and filtering out misleading information. Scale-aligned Target (ST) integrates scale information into target confidence, improving classification for small object detection. A task-decoupled Sample Reweighting (SR) mechanism guides attention toward challenging positive examples, utilizing a weight generator module to assess the difficulty and adjust classification loss based on decoder layer outcomes. Comprehensive experiments across various benchmarks reveal that our proposed detector excels in detecting small objects. Our model demonstrates a significant enhancement, achieving a 2.9\% increase in average precision (AP) over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) on the VisDrone dataset and a 1.7\% improvement on the SODA-D dataset.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Synthetic Aperture Radar has been extensively used in numerous fields and can gather a wealth of information about the area of interest. This large scene data intensive technology puts a high value on automatic target recognition which can free the utilizers and boost the efficiency. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have made it possible to create a deep learning based SAR ATR that can automatically identify target features from massive input data. In the last 6 years, intensive research has been conducted in this area, however, most papers in the current SAR ATR field used recurrent neural network and convolutional neural network varied models to deepen the regime's understanding of the SAR images. To equip SAR ATR with updated deep learning technology, this paper tries to apply a lightweight vision transformer based model to classify SAR images. The entire structure was verified by an open-accessed SAR data set and recognition results show that the final classification outcomes are robust and more accurate in comparison with referred traditional network structures without even using any convolutional layers.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Previous open-source large multimodal models (LMMs) have faced several limitations: (1) they often lack native integration, requiring adapters to align visual representations with pre-trained large language models (LLMs); (2) many are restricted to single-modal generation; (3) while some support multimodal generation, they rely on separate diffusion models for visual modeling and generation. To mitigate these limitations, we present Anole, an open, autoregressive, native large multimodal model for interleaved image-text generation. We build Anole from Meta AI's Chameleon, adopting an innovative fine-tuning strategy that is both data-efficient and parameter-efficient. Anole demonstrates high-quality, coherent multimodal generation capabilities. We have open-sourced our model, training framework, and instruction tuning data.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) confronts the challenge of integrating new classes into a model with minimal training samples while preserving the knowledge of previously learned classes. Traditional methods widely adopt static adaptation relying on a fixed parameter space to learn from data that arrive sequentially, prone to overfitting to the current session. Existing dynamic strategies require the expansion of the parameter space continually, leading to increased complexity. To address these challenges, we integrate the recently proposed selective state space model (SSM) into FSCIL. Concretely, we propose a dual selective SSM projector that dynamically adjusts the projection parameters based on the intermediate features for dynamic adaptation. The dual design enables the model to maintain the robust features of base classes, while adaptively learning distinctive feature shifts for novel classes. Additionally, we develop a class-sensitive selective scan mechanism to guide dynamic adaptation. It minimizes the disruption to base-class representations caused by training on novel data, and meanwhile, forces the selective scan to perform in distinct patterns between base and novel classes. Experiments on miniImageNet, CUB-200, and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that our framework outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the domain of non-contact biometrics and human activity recognition, the lack of a versatile, multimodal dataset poses a significant bottleneck. To address this, we introduce the Oulu Multi Sensing (OMuSense-23) dataset that includes biosignals obtained from a mmWave radar, and an RGB-D camera. The dataset features data from 50 individuals in three distinct poses -- standing, sitting, and lying down -- each featuring four specific breathing pattern activities: regular breathing, reading, guided breathing, and apnea, encompassing both typical situations (e.g., sitting with normal breathing) and critical conditions (e.g., lying down without breathing). In our work, we present a detailed overview of the OMuSense-23 dataset, detailing the data acquisition protocol, describing the process for each participant. In addition, we provide, a baseline evaluation of several data analysis tasks related to biometrics, breathing pattern recognition and pose identification. Our results achieve a pose identification accuracy of 87\% and breathing pattern activity recognition of 83\% using features extracted from biosignals. The OMuSense-23 dataset is publicly available as resource for other researchers and practitioners in the field.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce CHAMP, a novel method for learning sequence-to-sequence, multi-hypothesis 3D human poses from 2D keypoints by leveraging a conditional distribution with a diffusion model. To predict a single output 3D pose sequence, we generate and aggregate multiple 3D pose hypotheses. For better aggregation results, we develop a method to score these hypotheses during training, effectively integrating conformal prediction into the learning process. This process results in a differentiable conformal predictor that is trained end2end with the 3D pose estimator. Post-training, the learned scoring model is used as the conformity score, and the 3D pose estimator is combined with a conformal predictor to select the most accurate hypotheses for downstream aggregation. Our results indicate that using a simple mean aggregation on the conformal prediction-filtered hypotheses set yields competitive results. When integrated with more sophisticated aggregation techniques, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across various metrics and datasets while inheriting the probabilistic guarantees of conformal prediction.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present and evaluate a method called grammar masking, which is used to guide large language models (LLMs) toward producing syntactically correct models for a given context-free grammar. Prompt engineering methods such as few-shot learning or priming can be used to improve the chances of an LLM producing correct syntax, but the more complex the grammar, the more time-consuming and less promising these methods become. Previous work is focused primarily on the usage of either language model training or prompt engineering. In this work, a method is presented that restricts the output to a given grammar using constrained decoding to ensure the output adheres to a valid syntax. We use several DSLs built with MontiCore and task multiple LLMs to produce models with and without constrained decoding. A corresponding parser is used to confirm the syntactic correctness of each model. We show that grammar masking can dramatically improve the modeling capabilities of several LLMs, reducing the need for well-refined prompting while increasing the chance of producing correct models.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Temporal grounding of activities, the identification of specific time intervals of actions within a larger event context, is a critical task in video understanding. Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for enhancing temporal reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of combining image-based and text-based large language models (LLMs) in a two-stage approach for temporal activity localization. We demonstrate that our method outperforms existing video-based LLMs. Furthermore, we explore the impact of instruction-tuning on a smaller multimodal LLM, showing that refining its ability to process action queries leads to more expressive and informative outputs, thereby enhancing its performance in identifying specific time intervals of activities. Our experimental results on the Charades-STA dataset highlight the potential of this approach in advancing the field of temporal activity localization and video understanding.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multi-modality image fusion aims at fusing specific-modality and shared-modality information from two source images. To tackle the problem of insufficient feature extraction and lack of semantic awareness for complex scenes, this paper focuses on how to model correlation-driven decomposing features and reason high-level graph representation by efficiently extracting complementary features and multi-guided feature aggregation. We propose a three-branch encoder-decoder architecture along with corresponding fusion layers as the fusion strategy. The transformer with Multi-Dconv Transposed Attention and Local-enhanced Feed Forward network is used to extract shallow features after the depthwise convolution. In the three parallel branches encoder, Cross Attention and Invertible Block (CAI) enables to extract local features and preserve high-frequency texture details. Base feature extraction module (BFE) with residual connections can capture long-range dependency and enhance shared-modality expression capabilities. Graph Reasoning Module (GR) is introduced to reason high-level cross-modality relations and extract low-level details features as CAI's specific-modality complementary information simultaneously. Experiments demonstrate that our method has obtained competitive results compared with state-of-the-art methods in visible/infrared image fusion and medical image fusion tasks. Moreover, we surpass other fusion methods in terms of subsequent tasks, averagely scoring 9.78% mAP@.5 higher in object detection and 6.46% mIoU higher in semantic segmentation.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Human Action Recognition (HAR) encompasses the task of monitoring human activities across various domains, including but not limited to medical, educational, entertainment, visual surveillance, video retrieval, and the identification of anomalous activities. Over the past decade, the field of HAR has witnessed substantial progress by leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to effectively extract and comprehend intricate information, thereby enhancing the overall performance of HAR systems. Recently, the domain of computer vision has witnessed the emergence of Vision Transformers (ViTs) as a potent solution. The efficacy of transformer architecture has been validated beyond the confines of image analysis, extending their applicability to diverse video-related tasks. Notably, within this landscape, the research community has shown keen interest in HAR, acknowledging its manifold utility and widespread adoption across various domains. This article aims to present an encompassing survey that focuses on CNNs and the evolution of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to ViTs given their importance in the domain of HAR. By conducting a thorough examination of existing literature and exploring emerging trends, this study undertakes a critical analysis and synthesis of the accumulated knowledge in this field. Additionally, it investigates the ongoing efforts to develop hybrid approaches. Following this direction, this article presents a novel hybrid model that seeks to integrate the inherent strengths of CNNs and ViTs.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multimodal generative models are rapidly evolving, leading to a surge in the generation of realistic video and audio that offers exciting possibilities but also serious risks. Deepfake videos, which can convincingly impersonate individuals, have particularly garnered attention due to their potential misuse in spreading misinformation and creating fraudulent content. This survey paper examines the dual landscape of deepfake video generation and detection, emphasizing the need for effective countermeasures against potential abuses. We provide a comprehensive overview of current deepfake generation techniques, including face swapping, reenactment, and audio-driven animation, which leverage cutting-edge technologies like generative adversarial networks and diffusion models to produce highly realistic fake videos. Additionally, we analyze various detection approaches designed to differentiate authentic from altered videos, from detecting visual artifacts to deploying advanced algorithms that pinpoint inconsistencies across video and audio signals. The effectiveness of these detection methods heavily relies on the diversity and quality of datasets used for training and evaluation. We discuss the evolution of deepfake datasets, highlighting the importance of robust, diverse, and frequently updated collections to enhance the detection accuracy and generalizability. As deepfakes become increasingly indistinguishable from authentic content, developing advanced detection techniques that can keep pace with generation technologies is crucial. We advocate for a proactive approach in the "tug-of-war" between deepfake creators and detectors, emphasizing the need for continuous research collaboration, standardization of evaluation metrics, and the creation of comprehensive benchmarks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Image segmentation is critically important in almost all medical image analysis for automatic interpretations and processing. However, it is often challenging to perform image segmentation due to data imbalance between intra- and inter-class, resulting in over- or under-segmentation. Consequently, we proposed a new methodology to address the above issue, with a compact yet effective contour-weighted loss function. Our new loss function incorporates a contour-weighted cross-entropy loss and separable dice loss. The former loss extracts the contour of target regions via morphological erosion and generates a weight map for the cross-entropy criterion, whereas the latter divides the target regions into contour and non-contour components through the extracted contour map, calculates dice loss separately, and combines them to update the network. We carried out abdominal organ segmentation and brain tumor segmentation on two public datasets to assess our approach. Experimental results demonstrated that our approach offered superior segmentation, as compared to several state-of-the-art methods, while in parallel improving the robustness of those popular state-of-the-art deep models through our new loss function.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large-scale Text-to-Video (T2V) diffusion models have recently demonstrated unprecedented capability to transform natural language descriptions into stunning and photorealistic videos. Despite the promising results, a significant challenge remains: these models struggle to fully grasp complex compositional interactions between multiple concepts and actions. This issue arises when some words dominantly influence the final video, overshadowing other this http URL tackle this problem, we introduce \textbf{Vico}, a generic framework for compositional video generation that explicitly ensures all concepts are represented properly. At its core, Vico analyzes how input tokens influence the generated video, and adjusts the model to prevent any single concept from dominating. Specifically, Vico extracts attention weights from all layers to build a spatial-temporal attention graph, and then estimates the influence as the \emph{max-flow} from the source text token to the video target token. Although the direct computation of attention flow in diffusion models is typically infeasible, we devise an efficient approximation based on subgraph flows and employ a fast and vectorized implementation, which in turn makes the flow computation manageable and differentiable. By updating the noisy latent to balance these flows, Vico captures complex interactions and consequently produces videos that closely adhere to textual descriptions. We apply our method to multiple diffusion-based video models for compositional T2V and video editing. Empirical results demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances the compositional richness and accuracy of the generated videos.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Personalized text-to-image generation models enable users to create images that depict their individual possessions in diverse scenes, finding applications in various domains. To achieve the personalization capability, existing methods rely on finetuning a text-to-image foundation model on a user's custom dataset, which can be non-trivial for general users, resource-intensive, and time-consuming. Despite attempts to develop finetuning-free methods, their generation quality is much lower compared to their finetuning counterparts. In this paper, we propose Joint-Image Diffusion (\jedi), an effective technique for learning a finetuning-free personalization model. Our key idea is to learn the joint distribution of multiple related text-image pairs that share a common subject. To facilitate learning, we propose a scalable synthetic dataset generation technique. Once trained, our model enables fast and easy personalization at test time by simply using reference images as input during the sampling process. Our approach does not require any expensive optimization process or additional modules and can faithfully preserve the identity represented by any number of reference images. Experimental results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art generation quality, both quantitatively and qualitatively, significantly outperforming both the prior finetuning-based and finetuning-free personalization baselines.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Crowd Motion Generation is essential in entertainment industries such as animation and games as well as in strategic fields like urban simulation and planning. This new task requires an intricate integration of control and generation to realistically synthesize crowd dynamics under specific spatial and semantic constraints, whose challenges are yet to be fully explored. On the one hand, existing human motion generation models typically focus on individual behaviors, neglecting the complexities of collective behaviors. On the other hand, recent methods for multi-person motion generation depend heavily on pre-defined scenarios and are limited to a fixed, small number of inter-person interactions, thus hampering their practicality. To overcome these challenges, we introduce CrowdMoGen, a zero-shot text-driven framework that harnesses the power of Large Language Model (LLM) to incorporate the collective intelligence into the motion generation framework as guidance, thereby enabling generalizable planning and generation of crowd motions without paired training data. Our framework consists of two key components: 1) Crowd Scene Planner that learns to coordinate motions and dynamics according to specific scene contexts or introduced perturbations, and 2) Collective Motion Generator that efficiently synthesizes the required collective motions based on the holistic plans. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments have validated the effectiveness of our framework, which not only fills a critical gap by providing scalable and generalizable solutions for Crowd Motion Generation task but also achieves high levels of realism and flexibility.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The performance of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) is dependent on the size and quality of their training datasets. Existing video instruction tuning datasets lack diversity as they are derived by prompting large language models with video captions to generate question-answer pairs, and are therefore mostly descriptive. Meanwhile, many labeled video datasets with diverse labels and supervision exist - however, we find that their integration into LVLMs is non-trivial. Herein, we present Video Self-Training with augmented Reasoning (Video-STaR), the first video self-training approach. Video-STaR allows the utilization of any labeled video dataset for video instruction tuning. In Video-STaR, an LVLM cycles between instruction generation and finetuning, which we show (I) improves general video understanding and (II) adapts LVLMs to novel downstream tasks with existing supervision. During generation, an LVLM is prompted to propose an answer. The answers are then filtered only to those that contain the original video labels, and the LVLM is then re-trained on the generated dataset. By only training on generated answers that contain the correct video labels, Video-STaR utilizes these existing video labels as weak supervision for video instruction tuning. Our results demonstrate that Video-STaR-enhanced LVLMs exhibit improved performance in (I) general video QA, where TempCompass performance improved by 10%, and (II) on downstream tasks, where Video-STaR improved Kinetics700-QA accuracy by 20% and action quality assessment on FineDiving by 15%.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in 3D AIGC have shown promise in directly creating 3D objects from text and images, offering significant cost savings in animation and product design. However, detailed edit and customization of 3D assets remains a long-standing challenge. Specifically, 3D Generation methods lack the ability to follow finely detailed instructions as precisely as their 2D image creation counterparts. Imagine you can get a toy through 3D AIGC but with undesired accessories and dressing. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel pipeline called Tailor3D, which swiftly creates customized 3D assets from editable dual-side images. We aim to emulate a tailor's ability to locally change objects or perform overall style transfer. Unlike creating 3D assets from multiple views, using dual-side images eliminates conflicts on overlapping areas that occur when editing individual views. Specifically, it begins by editing the front view, then generates the back view of the object through multi-view diffusion. Afterward, it proceeds to edit the back views. Finally, a Dual-sided LRM is proposed to seamlessly stitch together the front and back 3D features, akin to a tailor sewing together the front and back of a garment. The Dual-sided LRM rectifies imperfect consistencies between the front and back views, enhancing editing capabilities and reducing memory burdens while seamlessly integrating them into a unified 3D representation with the LoRA Triplane Transformer. Experimental results demonstrate Tailor3D's effectiveness across various 3D generation and editing tasks, including 3D generative fill and style transfer. It provides a user-friendly, efficient solution for editing 3D assets, with each editing step taking only seconds to complete.</li>
