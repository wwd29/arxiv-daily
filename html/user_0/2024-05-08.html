          Evaluating Large Language Models for Material Selection(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Material selection is a crucial step in conceptual design due to its significant impact on the functionality, aesthetics, manufacturability, and sustainability impact of the final product. This study investigates the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for material selection in the product design process and compares the performance of LLMs against expert choices for various design scenarios. By collecting a dataset of expert material preferences, the study provides a basis for evaluating how well LLMs can align with expert recommendations through prompt engineering and hyperparameter tuning. The divergence between LLM and expert recommendations is measured across different model configurations, prompt strategies, and temperature settings. This approach allows for a detailed analysis of factors influencing the LLMs' effectiveness in recommending materials. The results from this study highlight two failure modes, and identify parallel prompting as a useful prompt-engineering method when using LLMs for material selection. The findings further suggest that, while LLMs can provide valuable assistance, their recommendations often vary significantly from those of human experts. This discrepancy underscores the need for further research into how LLMs can be better tailored to replicate expert decision-making in material selection. This work contributes to the growing body of knowledge on how LLMs can be integrated into the design process, offering insights into their current limitations and potential for future improvements.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Invasive plant species are detrimental to the ecology of both agricultural and wildland areas. Euphorbia esula, or leafy spurge, is one such plant that has spread through much of North America from Eastern Europe. When paired with contemporary computer vision systems, unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones, offer the means to track expansion of problem plants, such as leafy spurge, and improve chances of controlling these weeds. We gathered a dataset of leafy spurge presence and absence in grasslands of western Montana, USA, then surveyed these areas with a commercial drone. We trained image classifiers on these data, and our best performing model, a pre-trained DINOv2 vision transformer, identified leafy spurge with 0.84 accuracy (test set). This result indicates that classification of leafy spurge is tractable, but not solved. We release this unique dataset of labelled and unlabelled, aerial drone imagery for the machine learning community to explore. Improving classification performance of leafy spurge would benefit the fields of ecology, conservation, and remote sensing alike. Code and data are available at our website: this http URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Network control theory (NCT) offers a robust analytical framework for understanding the influence of network topology on dynamic behaviors, enabling researchers to decipher how certain patterns of external control measures can steer system dynamics towards desired states. Distinguished from other structure-function methodologies, NCT's predictive capabilities can be coupled with deploying Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which have demonstrated exceptional utility in various network-based learning tasks. However, the performance of GNNs heavily relies on the expressiveness of node features, and the lack of node features can greatly degrade their performance. Furthermore, many real-world systems may lack node-level information, posing a challenge for this http URL tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel approach, NCT-based Enhanced Feature Augmentation (NCT-EFA), that assimilates average controllability, along with other centrality indices, into the feature augmentation pipeline to enhance GNNs performance. Our evaluation of NCT-EFA, on six benchmark GNN models across two experimental setting. solely employing average controllability and in combination with additional centrality metrics. showcases an improved performance reaching as high as 11%. Our results demonstrate that incorporating NCT into feature enrichment can substantively extend the applicability and heighten the performance of GNNs in scenarios where node-level information is unavailable.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Effective image classification hinges on discerning relevant features from both foreground and background elements, with the foreground typically holding the critical information. While humans adeptly classify images with limited exposure, artificial neural networks often struggle with feature selection from rare samples. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method for selecting class-relevant patch embeddings. Our approach involves splitting support and query images into patches, encoding them using a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) to obtain class embeddings and patch embeddings, respectively. Subsequently, we filter patch embeddings using class embeddings to retain only the class-relevant ones. For each image, we calculate the similarity between class embedding and each patch embedding, sort the similarity sequence in descending order, and only retain top-ranked patch embeddings. By prioritizing similarity between the class embedding and patch embeddings, we select top-ranked patch embeddings to be fused with class embedding to form a comprehensive image representation, enhancing pattern recognition across instances. Our strategy effectively mitigates the impact of class-irrelevant patch embeddings, yielding improved performance in pre-trained models. Extensive experiments on popular few-shot classification benchmarks demonstrate the simplicity, efficacy, and computational efficiency of our approach, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines under both 5-shot and 1-shot scenarios.</li>

          Generative adversarial learning with optimal input dimension and its adaptive generator architecture(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We investigate the impact of the input dimension on the generalization error in generative adversarial networks (GANs). In particular, we first provide both theoretical and practical evidence to validate the existence of an optimal input dimension (OID) that minimizes the generalization error. Then, to identify the OID, we introduce a novel framework called generalized GANs (G-GANs), which includes existing GANs as a special case. By incorporating the group penalty and the architecture penalty developed in the paper, G-GANs have several intriguing features. First, our framework offers adaptive dimensionality reduction from the initial dimension to a dimension necessary for generating the target distribution. Second, this reduction in dimensionality also shrinks the required size of the generator network architecture, which is automatically identified by the proposed architecture penalty. Both reductions in dimensionality and the generator network significantly improve the stability and the accuracy of the estimation and prediction. Theoretical support for the consistent selection of the input dimension and the generator network is provided. Third, the proposed algorithm involves an end-to-end training process, and the algorithm allows for dynamic adjustments between the input dimension and the generator network during training, further enhancing the overall performance of G-GANs. Extensive experiments conducted with simulated and benchmark data demonstrate the superior performance of G-GANs. In particular, compared to that of off-the-shelf methods, G-GANs achieves an average improvement of 45.68% in the CT slice dataset, 43.22% in the MNIST dataset and 46.94% in the FashionMNIST dataset in terms of the maximum mean discrepancy or Frechet inception distance. Moreover, the features generated based on the input dimensions identified by G-GANs align with visually significant features.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep neural networks are applied in more and more areas of everyday life. However, they still lack essential abilities, such as robustly dealing with spatially transformed input signals. Approaches to mitigate this severe robustness issue are limited to two pathways: Either models are implicitly regularised by increased sample variability (data augmentation) or explicitly constrained by hard-coded inductive biases. The limiting factor of the former is the size of the data space, which renders sufficient sample coverage intractable. The latter is limited by the engineering effort required to develop such inductive biases for every possible scenario. Instead, we take inspiration from human behaviour, where percepts are modified by mental or physical actions during inference. We propose a novel technique to emulate such an inference process for neural nets. This is achieved by traversing a sparsified inverse transformation tree during inference using parallel energy-based evaluations. Our proposed inference algorithm, called Inverse Transformation Search (ITS), is model-agnostic and equips the model with zero-shot pseudo-invariance to spatially transformed inputs. We evaluated our method on several benchmark datasets, including a synthesised ImageNet test set. ITS outperforms the utilised baselines on all zero-shot test scenarios.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Video Foundation Models (ViFMs) aim to learn a general-purpose representation for various video understanding tasks. Leveraging large-scale datasets and powerful models, ViFMs achieve this by capturing robust and generic features from video data. This survey analyzes over 200 video foundational models, offering a comprehensive overview of benchmarks and evaluation metrics across 14 distinct video tasks categorized into 3 main categories. Additionally, we offer an in-depth performance analysis of these models for the 6 most common video tasks. We categorize ViFMs into three categories: 1) Image-based ViFMs, which adapt existing image models for video tasks, 2) Video-Based ViFMs, which utilize video-specific encoding methods, and 3) Universal Foundational Models (UFMs), which combine multiple modalities (image, video, audio, and text etc.) within a single framework. By comparing the performance of various ViFMs on different tasks, this survey offers valuable insights into their strengths and weaknesses, guiding future advancements in video understanding. Our analysis surprisingly reveals that image-based foundation models consistently outperform video-based models on most video understanding tasks. Additionally, UFMs, which leverage diverse modalities, demonstrate superior performance on video tasks. We share the comprehensive list of ViFMs studied in this work at: \url{this https URL}</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose a secure inference protocol for a distributed setting involving a single server node and multiple client nodes. We assume that the observed data vector is partitioned across multiple client nodes while the deep learning model is located at the server node. Each client node is required to encrypt its portion of the data vector and transmit the resulting ciphertext to the server node. The server node is required to collect the ciphertexts and perform inference in the encrypted domain. We demonstrate an application of multi-party homomorphic encryption (MPHE) to satisfy these requirements. We propose a packing scheme, that enables the server to form the ciphertext of the complete data by aggregating the ciphertext of data subsets encrypted using MPHE. While our proposed protocol builds upon prior horizontal federated training protocol~\cite{sav2020poseidon}, we focus on the inference for vertically partitioned data and avoid the transmission of (encrypted) model weights from the server node to the client nodes.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The efficacy of deep learning models has been called into question by the presence of adversarial examples. Addressing the vulnerability of deep learning models to adversarial examples is crucial for ensuring their continued development and deployment. In this work, we focus on the role of rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation functions in the generation of adversarial examples. ReLU functions are commonly used in deep learning models because they facilitate the training process. However, our empirical analysis demonstrates that ReLU functions are not robust against adversarial examples. We propose a modified version of the ReLU function, which improves robustness against adversarial examples. Our results are supported by an experiment, which confirms the effectiveness of our proposed modification. Additionally, we demonstrate that applying adversarial training to our customized model further enhances its robustness compared to a general model.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper introduces a representative-based approach for distributed learning that transforms multiple raw data points into a virtual representation. Unlike traditional distributed learning methods such as Federated Learning, which do not offer human interpretability, our method makes complex machine learning processes accessible and comprehensible. It achieves this by condensing extensive datasets into digestible formats, thus fostering intuitive human-machine interactions. Additionally, this approach maintains privacy and communication efficiency, and it matches the training performance of models using raw data. Simulation results show that our approach is competitive with or outperforms traditional Federated Learning in accuracy and convergence, especially in scenarios with complex models and a higher number of clients. This framework marks a step forward in integrating human intuition with machine intelligence, which potentially enhances human-machine learning interfaces and collaborative efforts.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recently, with the advancement of deep learning, several applications in text classification have advanced significantly. However, this improvement comes with a cost because deep learning is vulnerable to adversarial examples. This weakness indicates that deep learning is not very robust. Fortunately, the input of a text classifier is discrete. Hence, it can prevent the classifier from state-of-the-art attacks. Nonetheless, previous works have generated black-box attacks that successfully manipulate the discrete values of the input to find adversarial examples. Therefore, instead of changing the discrete values, we transform the input into its embedding vector containing real values to perform the state-of-the-art white-box attacks. Then, we convert the perturbed embedding vector back into a text and name it an adversarial example. In summary, we create a framework that measures the robustness of a text classifier by using the gradients of the classifier.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Academic researchers and social media entities grappling with the identification of hate speech face significant challenges, primarily due to the vast scale of data and the dynamic nature of hate speech. Given the ethical and practical limitations of large predictive models like ChatGPT in directly addressing such sensitive issues, our research has explored alternative advanced transformer-based and generative AI technologies since 2019.

This paper delineates and evaluates the comparative efficacy of these cutting-edge methods in tackling the intricacies of hate speech detection, highlighting the need for responsible and carefully managed AI applications within sensitive contexts.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in every stage of drug development. Continuing breakthroughs in AI-based methods for drug discovery require the creation, improvement, and refinement of drug discovery data. We posit a new data challenge that slows the advancement of drug discovery AI: datasets are often collected independently from each other, often with little overlap, creating data sparsity. Data sparsity makes data curation difficult for researchers looking to answer key research questions requiring values posed across multiple datasets. We propose a novel diffusion GNN model Syngand capable of generating ligand and pharmacokinetic data end-to-end. We show and provide a methodology for sampling pharmacokinetic data for existing ligands using our Syngand model. We show the initial promising results on the efficacy of the Syngand-generated synthetic target property data on downstream regression tasks with AqSolDB, LD50, and hERG central. Using our proposed model and methodology, researchers can easily generate synthetic ligand data to help them explore research questions that require data spanning multiple datasets.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion Models have revolutionized the field of human motion generation by offering exceptional generation quality and fine-grained controllability through natural language conditioning. Their inherent stochasticity, that is the ability to generate various outputs from a single input, is key to their success. However, this diversity should not be unrestricted, as it may lead to unlikely generations. Instead, it should be confined within the boundaries of text-aligned and realistic generations. To address this issue, we propose MoDiPO (Motion Diffusion DPO), a novel methodology that leverages Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align text-to-motion models. We streamline the laborious and expensive process of gathering human preferences needed in DPO by leveraging AI feedback instead. This enables us to experiment with novel DPO strategies, using both online and offline generated motion-preference pairs. To foster future research we contribute with a motion-preference dataset which we dub Pick-a-Move. We demonstrate, both qualitatively and quantitatively, that our proposed method yields significantly more realistic motions. In particular, MoDiPO substantially improves Frechet Inception Distance (FID) while retaining the same RPrecision and Multi-Modality performances.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Merkle hash trees are the state-of-the-art method to protect the integrity of storage systems. However, using a hash tree can severely degrade performance, and prior works optimizing them have yet to yield a concrete understanding of the scalability of certain designs in the context of large-scale cloud storage systems. In this paper, we take a first-principles approach to analyzing hash tree performance for storage by introducing a definition of an optimal hash tree and a principled methodology for evaluating hash tree designs. We show that state-of-the-art designs are not scalable; they incur up to 40.1X slowdowns over an insecure baseline and deliver <50% of optimal performance across various experiments. We then exploit the characteristics of optimal hash trees to design Dynamic Hash Trees (DHTs), hash trees that can adapt to workload patterns on-the-fly, delivering >95% of optimal read and write performance and up to 4.2X speedups over the state-of-the art. Our novel methodology and DHT design provides a new foundation in the search for integrity mechanisms that can operate efficiently at scale.</li>

Nevertheless, developers encounter challenges in managing a high volume of reviews, particularly in the case of popular apps with a substantial influx of daily reviews. Consequently, there is a demand for automated solutions aimed at streamlining the process of responding to user reviews. To address this, we have developed a new system for generating automatic responses by leveraging user-contributed documents with the help of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and advanced Large Language Models (LLMs). Our solution, named SCRABLE, represents an adaptive customer review response automation that enhances itself with self-optimizing prompts and a judging mechanism based on LLMs. Additionally, we introduce an automatic scoring mechanism that mimics the role of a human evaluator to assess the quality of responses generated in customer review domains. Extensive experiments and analyses conducted on real-world datasets reveal that our method is effective in producing high-quality responses, yielding improvement of more than 8.5% compared to the baseline. Further validation through manual examination of the generated responses underscores the efficacy our proposed system.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, transformer, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Influence functions offer a robust framework for assessing the impact of each training data sample on model predictions, serving as a prominent tool in data-centric learning. Despite their widespread use in various tasks, the strong convexity assumption on the model and the computational cost associated with calculating the inverse of the Hessian matrix pose constraints, particularly when analyzing large deep models. This paper focuses on a classical data-centric scenario--trimming detrimental samples--and addresses both challenges within a unified framework. Specifically, we establish an equivalence transformation between identifying detrimental training samples via influence functions and outlier gradient detection. This transformation not only presents a straightforward and Hessian-free formulation but also provides profound insights into the role of the gradient in sample impact. Moreover, it relaxes the convexity assumption of influence functions, extending their applicability to non-convex deep models. Through systematic empirical evaluations, we first validate the correctness of our proposed outlier gradient analysis on synthetic datasets and then demonstrate its effectiveness in detecting mislabeled samples in vision models, selecting data samples for improving performance of transformer models for natural language processing, and identifying influential samples for fine-tuned Large Language Models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Motivated by the huge success of Transformers in the field of natural language processing (NLP), Vision Transformers (ViTs) have been rapidly developed and achieved remarkable performance in various computer vision tasks. However, their huge model sizes and intensive computations hinder ViTs' deployment on embedded devices, calling for effective model compression methods, such as quantization. Unfortunately, due to the existence of hardware-unfriendly and quantization-sensitive non-linear operations, particularly {Softmax}, it is non-trivial to completely quantize all operations in ViTs, yielding either significant accuracy drops or non-negligible hardware costs. In response to challenges associated with \textit{standard ViTs}, we focus our attention towards the quantization and acceleration for \textit{efficient ViTs}, which not only eliminate the troublesome Softmax but also integrate linear attention with low computational complexity, and propose \emph{Trio-ViT} accordingly. Specifically, at the algorithm level, we develop a {tailored post-training quantization engine} taking the unique activation distributions of Softmax-free efficient ViTs into full consideration, aiming to boost quantization accuracy. Furthermore, at the hardware level, we build an accelerator dedicated to the specific Convolution-Transformer hybrid architecture of efficient ViTs, thereby enhancing hardware efficiency. Extensive experimental results consistently prove the effectiveness of our Trio-ViT framework. {Particularly, we can gain up to $\uparrow$$\mathbf{7.2}\times$ and $\uparrow$$\mathbf{14.6}\times$ FPS under comparable accuracy over state-of-the-art ViT accelerators, as well as $\uparrow$$\mathbf{5.9}\times$ and $\uparrow$$\mathbf{2.0}\times$ DSP efficiency.} Codes will be released publicly upon acceptance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>3D object detection plays an important role in autonomous driving; however, its vulnerability to backdoor attacks has become evident. By injecting ''triggers'' to poison the training dataset, backdoor attacks manipulate the detector's prediction for inputs containing these triggers. Existing backdoor attacks against 3D object detection primarily poison 3D LiDAR signals, where large-sized 3D triggers are injected to ensure their visibility within the sparse 3D space, rendering them easy to detect and impractical in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we delve into the robustness of 3D object detection, exploring a new backdoor attack surface through 2D cameras. Given the prevalent adoption of camera and LiDAR signal fusion for high-fidelity 3D perception, we investigate the latent potential of camera signals to disrupt the process. Although the dense nature of camera signals enables the use of nearly imperceptible small-sized triggers to mislead 2D object detection, realizing 2D-oriented backdoor attacks against 3D object detection is non-trivial. The primary challenge emerges from the fusion process that transforms camera signals into a 3D space, compromising the association with the 2D trigger to the target output. To tackle this issue, we propose an innovative 2D-oriented backdoor attack against LiDAR-camera fusion methods for 3D object detection, named BadFusion, for preserving trigger effectiveness throughout the entire fusion process. The evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of BadFusion, achieving a significantly higher attack success rate compared to existing 2D-oriented attacks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Adversarial machine learning, focused on studying various attacks and defenses on machine learning (ML) models, is rapidly gaining importance as ML is increasingly being adopted for optimizing wireless systems such as Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN). A comprehensive modeling of the security threats and the demonstration of adversarial attacks and defenses on practical AI based O-RAN systems is still in its nascent stages. We begin by conducting threat modeling to pinpoint attack surfaces in O-RAN using an ML-based Connection management application (xApp) as an example. The xApp uses a Graph Neural Network trained using Deep Reinforcement Learning and achieves on average 54% improvement in the coverage rate measured as the 5th percentile user data rates. We then formulate and demonstrate evasion attacks that degrade the coverage rates by as much as 50% through injecting bounded noise at different threat surfaces including the open wireless medium itself. Crucially, we also compare and contrast the effectiveness of such attacks on the ML-based xApp and a non-ML based heuristic. We finally develop and demonstrate robust training-based defenses against the challenging physical/jamming-based attacks and show a 15% improvement in the coverage rates when compared to employing no defense over a range of noise budgets</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Random numbers are incredibly important in a variety of fields, and the need for their validation remains important. A Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG) can theoretically generate truly random numbers however this does not remove the need to thoroughly test their randomness. Generally, the task of validating random numbers has been delegated to different statistical tests such as the tests from the NIST Statistical Test Suite (STS) which are often slow and only perform one task at a time. Our work presents a deep learning model that utilizes the transformer architecture to encode some of the tests from the NIST STS in a single model that also runs much faster. This model performs multi-label classification on these tests and outputs the probability of passing each statistical test that it encodes. We perform a thorough hyper-parameter optimization to converge on the best possible model and as a result, achieve a high degree of accuracy with a sample f1 score of above 0.9.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Graph condensation, which reduces the size of a large-scale graph by synthesizing a small-scale condensed graph as its substitution, has immediately benefited various graph learning tasks. However, existing graph condensation methods rely on centralized data storage, which is unfeasible for real-world decentralized data distribution, and overlook data holders' privacy-preserving requirements. To bridge the gap, we propose and study the novel problem of federated graph condensation for graph neural networks (GNNs). Specifically, we first propose a general framework for federated graph condensation, in which we decouple the typical gradient matching process for graph condensation into client-side gradient calculation and server-side gradient matching. In this way, the burdensome computation cost in client-side is largely alleviated. Besides, our empirical studies show that under the federated setting, the condensed graph will consistently leak data membership privacy, i.e., the condensed graph during the federated training can be utilized to steal the training data under the membership inference attacks (MIA). To tackle this issue, we innovatively incorporate information bottleneck principles into the federated graph condensation, which only needs to extract partial node features in one local pre-training step and utilize the features during federated training. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework can consistently protect membership privacy during training. Meanwhile, it also achieves comparable and even superior performance against existing centralized graph condensation and federated graph learning methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Efficient deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) requires batching multiple requests together to improve throughput. As the batch size, context length, or model size increases, the size of the key and value (KV) cache can quickly become the main contributor to GPU memory usage and the bottleneck of inference latency. Quantization has emerged as an effective technique for KV cache compression, but existing methods still fail at very low bit widths. We observe that distinct channels of a key/value activation embedding are highly inter-dependent, and the joint entropy of multiple channels grows at a slower rate than the sum of their marginal entropies. Based on this insight, we propose Coupled Quantization (CQ), which couples multiple key/value channels together to exploit their inter-dependency and encode the activations in a more information-efficient manner. Extensive experiments reveal that CQ outperforms or is competitive with existing baselines in preserving model quality. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CQ can preserve model quality with KV cache quantized down to 1-bit.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the era of increasing concerns over cybersecurity threats, defending against backdoor attacks is paramount in ensuring the integrity and reliability of machine learning models. However, many existing approaches require substantial amounts of data for effective mitigation, posing significant challenges in practical deployment. To address this, we propose a novel approach to counter backdoor attacks by treating their mitigation as an unlearning task. We tackle this challenge through a targeted model pruning strategy, leveraging unlearning loss gradients to identify and eliminate backdoor elements within the model. Built on solid theoretical insights, our approach offers simplicity and effectiveness, rendering it well-suited for scenarios with limited data availability. Our methodology includes formulating a suitable unlearning loss and devising a model-pruning technique tailored for convolutional neural networks. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach compared to state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in realistic data settings.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deception, a prevalent aspect of human communication, has undergone a significant transformation in the digital age. With the globalization of online interactions, individuals are communicating in multiple languages and mixing languages on social media, with varied data becoming available in each language and dialect. At the same time, the techniques for detecting deception are similar across the board. Recent studies have shown the possibility of the existence of universal linguistic cues to deception across domains within the English language; however, the existence of such cues in other languages remains unknown. Furthermore, the practical task of deception detection in low-resource languages is not a well-studied problem due to the lack of labeled data. Another dimension of deception is multimodality. For example, a picture with an altered caption in fake news or disinformation may exist. This paper calls for a comprehensive investigation into the complexities of deceptive language across linguistic boundaries and modalities within the realm of computer security and natural language processing and the possibility of using multilingual transformer models and labeled data in various languages to universally address the task of deception detection.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Effectively handling instructions with extremely long context remains a challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs), typically necessitating high-quality long data and substantial computational resources. This paper introduces Step-Skipping Alignment (SkipAlign), a new technique designed to enhance the long-context capabilities of LLMs in the phase of alignment without the need for additional efforts beyond training with original data length. SkipAlign is developed on the premise that long-range dependencies are fundamental to enhancing an LLM's capacity of long context. Departing from merely expanding the length of input samples, SkipAlign synthesizes long-range dependencies from the aspect of positions indices. This is achieved by the strategic insertion of skipped positions within instruction-following samples, which utilizes the semantic structure of the data to effectively expand the context. Through extensive experiments on base models with a variety of context window sizes, SkipAlign demonstrates its effectiveness across a spectrum of long-context tasks. Particularly noteworthy is that with a careful selection of the base model and alignment datasets, SkipAlign with only 6B parameters achieves it's best performance and comparable with strong baselines like GPT-3.5-Turbo-16K on LongBench.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep learning-based predictive models, leveraging Electronic Health Records (EHR), are receiving increasing attention in healthcare. An effective representation of a patient's EHR should hierarchically encompass both the temporal relationships between historical visits and medical events, and the inherent structural information within these elements. Existing patient representation methods can be roughly categorized into sequential representation and graphical representation. The sequential representation methods focus only on the temporal relationships among longitudinal visits. On the other hand, the graphical representation approaches, while adept at extracting the graph-structured relationships between various medical events, fall short in effectively integrate temporal information. To capture both types of information, we model a patient's EHR as a novel temporal heterogeneous graph. This graph includes historical visits nodes and medical events nodes. It propagates structured information from medical event nodes to visit nodes and utilizes time-aware visit nodes to capture changes in the patient's health status. Furthermore, we introduce a novel temporal graph transformer (TRANS) that integrates temporal edge features, global positional encoding, and local structural encoding into heterogeneous graph convolution, capturing both temporal and structural information. We validate the effectiveness of TRANS through extensive experiments on three real-world datasets. The results show that our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, protect, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent efforts have been made to integrate self-supervised learning (SSL) with the framework of federated learning (FL). One unique challenge of federated self-supervised learning (FedSSL) is that the global objective of FedSSL usually does not equal the weighted sum of local SSL objectives. Consequently, conventional approaches, such as federated averaging (FedAvg), fail to precisely minimize the FedSSL global objective, often resulting in suboptimal performance, especially when data is non-i.i.d.. To fill this gap, we propose a provable FedSSL algorithm, named FedSC, based on the spectral contrastive objective. In FedSC, clients share correlation matrices of data representations in addition to model weights periodically, which enables inter-client contrast of data samples in addition to intra-client contrast and contraction, resulting in improved quality of data representations. Differential privacy (DP) protection is deployed to control the additional privacy leakage on local datasets when correlation matrices are shared. We also provide theoretical analysis on the convergence and extra privacy leakage. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have excelled in learning from graph-structured data, especially in understanding the relationships within a single graph, i.e., intra-graph relationships. Despite their successes, GNNs are limited by neglecting the context of relationships across graphs, i.e., inter-graph relationships. Recognizing the potential to extend this capability, we introduce Relating-Up, a plug-and-play module that enhances GNNs by exploiting inter-graph relationships. This module incorporates a relation-aware encoder and a feedback training strategy. The former enables GNNs to capture relationships across graphs, enriching relation-aware graph representation through collective context. The latter utilizes a feedback loop mechanism for the recursively refinement of these representations, leveraging insights from refining inter-graph dynamics to conduct feedback loop. The synergy between these two innovations results in a robust and versatile module. Relating-Up enhances the expressiveness of GNNs, enabling them to encapsulate a wider spectrum of graph relationships with greater precision. Our evaluations across 16 benchmark datasets demonstrate that integrating Relating-Up into GNN architectures substantially improves performance, positioning Relating-Up as a formidable choice for a broad spectrum of graph representation learning tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the development of laws and regulations related to privacy preservation, it has become difficult to collect personal data to perform machine learning. In this context, federated learning, which is distributed learning without sharing personal data, has been proposed. In this paper, we focus on federated learning for user authentication. We show that it is difficult to achieve both privacy preservation and high accuracy with existing methods. To address these challenges, we propose IPFed which is privacy-preserving federated learning using random projection for class embedding. Furthermore, we prove that IPFed is capable of learning equivalent to the state-of-the-art method. Experiments on face image datasets show that IPFed can protect the privacy of personal data while maintaining the accuracy of the state-of-the-art method.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Current state-of-the-art diffusion models employ U-Net architectures containing convolutional and (qkv) self-attention layers. The U-Net processes images while being conditioned on the time embedding input for each sampling step and the class or caption embedding input corresponding to the desired conditional generation. Such conditioning involves scale-and-shift operations to the convolutional layers but does not directly affect the attention layers. While these standard architectural choices are certainly effective, not conditioning the attention layers feels arbitrary and potentially suboptimal. In this work, we show that simply adding LoRA conditioning to the attention layers without changing or tuning the other parts of the U-Net architecture improves the image generation quality. For example, a drop-in addition of LoRA conditioning to EDM diffusion model yields FID scores of 1.91/1.75 for unconditional and class-conditional CIFAR-10 generation, improving upon the baseline of 1.97/1.79.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Currently, portable electronic devices are becoming more and more popular. For lightweight considerations, their fingerprint recognition modules usually use limited-size sensors. However, partial fingerprints have few matchable features, especially when there are differences in finger pressing posture or image quality, which makes partial fingerprint verification challenging. Most existing methods regard fingerprint position rectification and identity verification as independent tasks, ignoring the coupling relationship between them -- relative pose estimation typically relies on paired features as anchors, and authentication accuracy tends to improve with more precise pose alignment. Consequently, in this paper we propose a method that jointly estimates identity verification and relative pose for partial fingerprints, aiming to leverage their inherent correlation to improve each other. To achieve this, we propose a multi-task CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)-Transformer hybrid network, and design a pre-training task to enhance the feature extraction capability. Experiments on multiple public datasets (NIST SD14, FVC2002 DB1A & DB3A, FVC2004 DB1A & DB2A, FVC2006 DB1A) and an in-house dataset show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both partial fingerprint verification and relative pose estimation, while being more efficient than previous methods.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present VoxBind, a new score-based generative model for 3D molecules conditioned on protein structures. Our approach represents molecules as 3D atomic density grids and leverages a 3D voxel-denoising network for learning and generation. We extend the neural empirical Bayes formalism (Saremi & Hyvarinen, 2019) to the conditional setting and generate structure-conditioned molecules with a two-step procedure: (i) sample noisy molecules from the Gaussian-smoothed conditional distribution with underdamped Langevin MCMC using the learned score function and (ii) estimate clean molecules from the noisy samples with single-step denoising. Compared to the current state of the art, our model is simpler to train, significantly faster to sample from, and achieves better results on extensive in silico benchmarks -- the generated molecules are more diverse, exhibit fewer steric clashes, and bind with higher affinity to protein pockets.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Determining the optimal configuration of adsorbates on a slab (adslab) is pivotal in the exploration of novel catalysts across diverse applications. Traditionally, the quest for the lowest energy adslab configuration involves placing the adsorbate onto the slab followed by an optimization process. Prior methodologies have relied on heuristics, problem-specific intuitions, or brute-force approaches to guide adsorbate placement. In this work, we propose a novel framework for adsorbate placement using denoising diffusion. The model is designed to predict the optimal adsorbate site and orientation corresponding to the lowest energy configuration. Further, we have an end-to-end evaluation framework where diffusion-predicted adslab configuration is optimized with a pretrained machine learning force field and finally evaluated with Density Functional Theory (DFT). Our findings demonstrate an acceleration of up to 5x or 3.5x improvement in accuracy compared to the previous best approach. Given the novelty of this framework and application, we provide insights into the impact of pre-training, model architectures, and conduct extensive experiments to underscore the significance of this approach.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) have become a promising solution to secure DNN models on edge devices. However, the existing solutions either provide inadequate protection or introduce large performance overhead. Taking both security and performance into consideration, this paper presents TBNet, a TEE-based defense framework that protects DNN model from a neural architectural perspective. Specifically, TBNet generates a novel Two-Branch substitution model, to respectively exploit (1) the computational resources in the untrusted Rich Execution Environment (REE) for latency reduction and (2) the physically-isolated TEE for model protection. Experimental results on a Raspberry Pi across diverse DNN model architectures and datasets demonstrate that TBNet achieves efficient model protection at a low cost.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent progress of deep generative models in the vision and language domain has stimulated significant interest in more structured data generation such as molecules. However, beyond generating new random molecules, efficient exploration and a comprehensive understanding of the vast chemical space are of great importance to molecular science and applications in drug design and materials discovery. In this paper, we propose a new framework, ChemFlow, to traverse chemical space through navigating the latent space learned by molecule generative models through flows. We introduce a dynamical system perspective that formulates the problem as learning a vector field that transports the mass of the molecular distribution to the region with desired molecular properties or structure diversity. Under this framework, we unify previous approaches on molecule latent space traversal and optimization and propose alternative competing methods incorporating different physical priors. We validate the efficacy of ChemFlow on molecule manipulation and single- and multi-objective molecule optimization tasks under both supervised and unsupervised molecular discovery settings.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Binary code is pervasive, and binary analysis is a key task in reverse engineering, malware classification, and vulnerability discovery. Unfortunately, while there exist large corpuses of malicious binaries, obtaining high-quality corpuses of benign binaries for modern systems has proven challenging (e.g., due to licensing issues). Consequently, machine learning based pipelines for binary analysis utilize either costly commercial corpuses (e.g., VirusTotal) or open-source binaries (e.g., coreutils) available in limited quantities. To address these issues, we present Assemblage: an extensible cloud-based distributed system that crawls, configures, and builds Windows PE binaries to obtain high-quality binary corpuses suitable for training state-of-the-art models in binary analysis. We have run Assemblage on AWS over the past year, producing 890k Windows PE and 428k Linux ELF binaries across 29 configurations. Assemblage is designed to be both reproducible and extensible, enabling users to publish "recipes" for their datasets, and facilitating the extraction of a wide array of features. We evaluated Assemblage by using its data to train modern learning-based pipelines for compiler provenance and binary function similarity. Our results illustrate the practical need for robust corpuses of high-quality Windows PE binaries in training modern learning-based binary analyses.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this technical report, we introduce SEED-Data-Edit: a unique hybrid dataset for instruction-guided image editing, which aims to facilitate image manipulation using open-form language. SEED-Data-Edit is composed of three distinct types of data: (1) High-quality editing data produced by an automated pipeline, ensuring a substantial volume of diverse image editing pairs. (2) Real-world scenario data collected from the internet, which captures the intricacies of user intentions for promoting the practical application of image editing in the real world. (3) High-precision multi-turn editing data annotated by humans, which involves multiple rounds of edits for simulating iterative editing processes. The combination of these diverse data sources makes SEED-Data-Edit a comprehensive and versatile dataset for training language-guided image editing model. We fine-tune a pretrained Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that unifies comprehension and generation with SEED-Data-Edit. The instruction tuned model demonstrates promising results, indicating the potential and effectiveness of SEED-Data-Edit in advancing the field of instructional image editing.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Click-point-based interactive segmentation has received widespread attention due to its efficiency. However, it's hard for existing algorithms to obtain precise and robust responses after multiple clicks. In this case, the segmentation results tend to have little change or are even worse than before. To improve the robustness of the response, we propose a structured click intent model based on graph neural networks, which adaptively obtains graph nodes via the global similarity of user-clicked Transformer tokens. Then the graph nodes will be aggregated to obtain structured interaction features. Finally, the dual cross-attention will be used to inject structured interaction features into vision Transformer features, thereby enhancing the control of clicks over segmentation results. Extensive experiments demonstrated the proposed algorithm can serve as a general structure in improving Transformer-based interactive segmenta?tion performance.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In recent years, there has been a surge in malware attacks across critical infrastructures, requiring further research and development of appropriate response and remediation strategies in malware detection and classification. Several works have used machine learning models for malware classification into categories, and deep neural networks have shown promising results. However, these models have shown its vulnerabilities against intentionally crafted adversarial attacks, which yields misclassification of a malicious file. Our paper explores such adversarial vulnerabilities of neural network based malware classification system in the dynamic and online analysis environments. To evaluate our approach, we trained Feed Forward Neural Networks (FFNN) to classify malware categories based on features obtained from dynamic and online analysis environments. We use the state-of-the-art method, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), for the feature attribution for malware classification, to inform the adversarial attackers about the features with significant importance on classification decision. Using the explainability-informed features, we perform targeted misclassification adversarial white-box evasion attacks using the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attacks against the trained classifier. Our results demonstrated high evasion rate for some instances of attacks, showing a clear vulnerability of a malware classifier for such attacks. We offer recommendations for a balanced approach and a benchmark for much-needed future research into evasion attacks against malware classifiers, and develop more robust and trustworthy solutions.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Fuzzy extractors (FE) are cryptographic primitives that extract reliable cryptographic key from noisy real world random sources such as biometric sources. The FE generation algorithm takes a source sample, extracts a key and generates some helper data that will be used by the reproduction algorithm to recover the key. Reusability of FE guarantees that security holds when FE is used multiple times with the same source, and robustness of FE requires tampering with the helper data be detectable. In this paper, we consider information theoretic FEs, define a strong notion of reusability, and propose strongly robust and reusable FEs (srrFE) that provides the strongest combined notion of reusability and robustness for FEs. We give two constructions, one for reusable FEs and one for srrFE with information theoretic (IT) security for structured sources. The constructions are for structured sources and use sample-then-lock approach. We discuss each construction and show their unique properties in relation to existing work. Construction 2 is the first robust and reusable FE with IT-security without assuming random oracle. The robustness is achieved by using an IT-secure MAC with security against key-shift attack, which can be of independent interest.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose a post-processing algorithm for fair classification that mitigates model bias under a unified family of group fairness criteria covering statistical parity, equal opportunity, and equalized odds, applicable to multi-class problems and both attribute-aware and attribute-blind settings. It achieves fairness by re-calibrating the output score of the given base model with a "fairness cost" -- a linear combination of the (predicted) group memberships. Our algorithm is based on a representation result showing that the optimal fair classifier can be expressed as a linear post-processing of the loss function and the group predictor, derived via using these as sufficient statistics to reformulate the fair classification problem as a linear program. The parameters of the post-processor are estimated by solving the empirical LP. Experiments on benchmark datasets show the efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithm at reducing disparity compared to existing algorithms, including in-processing, especially on larger problems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, privacy, robust, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated learning (FL) has attracted widespread attention because it supports the joint training of models by multiple participants without moving private dataset. However, there are still many security issues in FL that deserve discussion. In this paper, we consider three major issues: 1) how to ensure that the training process can be publicly audited by any third party; 2) how to avoid the influence of malicious participants on training; 3) how to ensure that private gradients and models are not leaked to third parties. Many solutions have been proposed to address these issues, while solving the above three problems simultaneously is seldom considered. In this paper, we propose a publicly auditable and privacy-preserving federated learning scheme that is resistant to malicious participants uploading gradients with wrong directions and enables anyone to audit and verify the correctness of the training process. In particular, we design a robust aggregation algorithm capable of detecting gradients with wrong directions from malicious participants. Then, we design a random vector generation algorithm and combine it with zero sharing and blockchain technologies to make the joint training process publicly auditable, meaning anyone can verify the correctness of the training. Finally, we conduct a series of experiments, and the experimental results show that the model generated by the protocol is comparable in accuracy to the original FL approach while keeping security advantages.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large pretrained language models (LLMs) have shown surprising In-Context Learning (ICL) ability. An important application in deploying large language models is to augment LLMs with a private database for some specific task. The main problem with this promising commercial use is that LLMs have been shown to memorize their training data and their prompt data are vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIA) and prompt leaking attacks. In order to deal with this problem, we treat LLMs as untrusted in privacy and propose a locally differentially private framework of in-context learning(LDP-ICL) in the settings where labels are sensitive. Considering the mechanisms of in-context learning in Transformers by gradient descent, we provide an analysis of the trade-off between privacy and utility in such LDP-ICL for classification. Moreover, we apply LDP-ICL to the discrete distribution estimation problem. In the end, we perform several experiments to demonstrate our analysis results.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper describes a differentially private post-processing algorithm for learning fair regressors satisfying statistical parity, addressing privacy concerns of machine learning models trained on sensitive data, as well as fairness concerns of their potential to propagate historical biases. Our algorithm can be applied to post-process any given regressor to improve fairness by remapping its outputs. It consists of three steps: first, the output distributions are estimated privately via histogram density estimation and the Laplace mechanism, then their Wasserstein barycenter is computed, and the optimal transports to the barycenter are used for post-processing to satisfy fairness. We analyze the sample complexity of our algorithm and provide fairness guarantee, revealing a trade-off between the statistical bias and variance induced from the choice of the number of bins in the histogram, in which using less bins always favors fairness at the expense of error.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recently, video object segmentation (VOS) networks typically use memory-based methods: for each query frame, the mask is predicted by space-time matching to memory frames. Despite these methods having superior performance, they suffer from two issues: 1) Challenging data can destroy the space-time coherence between adjacent video frames. 2) Pixel-level matching will lead to undesired mismatching caused by the noises or distractors. To address the aforementioned issues, we first propose to generate an auxiliary frame between adjacent frames, serving as an implicit short-temporal reference for the query one. Next, we learn a prototype for each video object and prototype-level matching can be implemented between the query and memory. The experiment demonstrated that our network outperforms the state-of-the-art method on the DAVIS 2017, achieving a J&F score of 86.4%, and attains a competitive result 85.0% on YouTube VOS 2018. In addition, our network exhibits a high inference speed of 32+ FPS.</li>

          MBCT: A Monero-Based Covert Transmission Approach with On-chain Dynamic Session Key Negotiation(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, protect, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Traditional covert transmission (CT) approaches have been hindering CT application while blockchain technology offers new avenue. Current blockchain-based CT approaches require off-chain negotiation of critical information and often overlook the dynamic session keys updating, which increases the risk of message and key leakage. Additionally, in some approaches the covert transactions exhibit obvious characteristics that can be easily detected by third-parties. Moreover, most approaches do not address the issue of decreased reliability of message transmission in blockchain attack scenarios. Bitcoin- and Ethereum-based approaches also have the issue of transaction linkability, which can be tackled by Monero-based approaches because of the privacy protection mechanisms in Monero. However, Monero-based CT has the problem of sender repudiation. In this paper, we propose a novel Monero-Based CT approach (MBCT), which enables on-chain session key dynamically updating without off-chain negotiation. MBCT can assure non-repudiation of transmission participants, confidentiality of keys, reliability of message transmission and less observable characteristics. There are achieved by the three components in MBCT, namely, a sender authentication method, a dynamically on-chain session key updating method and a state feedback method. We implement MBCT in Monero-this http URL and the experiment results demonstrate its high embedding capacity of MBCT.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, protect, attack, watermark</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As spiking neural networks (SNNs) gain traction in deploying neuromorphic computing solutions, protecting their intellectual property (IP) has become crucial. Without adequate safeguards, proprietary SNN architectures are at risk of theft, replication, or misuse, which could lead to significant financial losses for the owners. While IP protection techniques have been extensively explored for artificial neural networks (ANNs), their applicability and effectiveness for the unique characteristics of SNNs remain largely unexplored. In this work, we pioneer an investigation into adapting two prominent watermarking approaches, namely, fingerprint-based and backdoor-based mechanisms to secure proprietary SNN architectures. We conduct thorough experiments to evaluate the impact on fidelity, resilience against overwrite threats, and resistance to compression attacks when applying these watermarking techniques to SNNs, drawing comparisons with their ANN counterparts. This study lays the groundwork for developing neuromorphic-aware IP protection strategies tailored to the distinctive dynamics of SNNs.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This research examines the effectiveness of OpenAI's GPT models as independent evaluators of text summaries generated by six transformer-based models from Hugging Face: DistilBART, BERT, ProphetNet, T5, BART, and PEGASUS. We evaluated these summaries based on essential properties of high-quality summary - conciseness, relevance, coherence, and readability - using traditional metrics such as ROUGE and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). Uniquely, we also employed GPT not as a summarizer but as an evaluator, allowing it to independently assess summary quality without predefined metrics. Our analysis revealed significant correlations between GPT evaluations and traditional metrics, particularly in assessing relevance and coherence. The results demonstrate GPT's potential as a robust tool for evaluating text summaries, offering insights that complement established metrics and providing a basis for comparative analysis of transformer-based models in natural language processing tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Retrieval-Augmented Language Modeling (RALM) by integrating large language models (LLM) with relevant documents from an external corpus is a proven method for enabling the LLM to generate information beyond the scope of its pre-training corpus. Previous work using utilizing retrieved content by simply prepending retrieved contents to the input poses a high runtime issue, which degrades the inference efficiency of the LLMs because they fail to use the Key-Value (KV) cache efficiently. In this paper, we propose \textsc{FlashBack}, a modular RALM designed to improve the inference efficiency of RALM with appending context pattern while maintaining decent performance after specific fine-tuning without heavily destruct the knowledge integrity of the LLM. \textsc{FlashBack} appends retrieved documents at the end of the context for efficiently utilizing the KV cache instead of prepending them. Our experiment shows that the inference speed of \textsc{FlashBack} is up to $4\times$ faster than the prepending method on a 7B LLM (Llama 2). Via bypassing unnecessary re-computation, it demonstrates an advancement by achieving significantly faster inference speed, and this heightened efficiency will substantially reduce inferential cost. Our code will be publicly available.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated proficiency in handling complex queries, much of the past work has depended on extensively annotated datasets by human experts. However, this reliance on fully-supervised annotations poses scalability challenges, particularly as models and data requirements grow. To mitigate this, we explore the potential of enhancing LLMs' reasoning abilities with minimal human supervision. In this work, we introduce self-reinforcement, which begins with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) of the model using a small collection of annotated questions. Then it iteratively improves LLMs by learning from the differences in responses from the SFT and unfinetuned models on unlabeled questions. Our approach provides an efficient approach without relying heavily on extensive human-annotated explanations. However, current reasoning benchmarks typically only include golden-reference answers or rationales. Therefore, we present \textsc{PuzzleBen}, a weakly supervised benchmark that comprises 25,147 complex questions, answers, and human-generated rationales across various domains, such as brainteasers, puzzles, riddles, parajumbles, and critical reasoning tasks. A unique aspect of our dataset is the inclusion of 10,000 unannotated questions, enabling us to explore utilizing fewer supersized data to boost LLMs' inference capabilities. Our experiments underscore the significance of \textsc{PuzzleBen}, as well as the effectiveness of our methodology as a promising direction in future endeavors. Our dataset and code will be published soon on \texttt{Anonymity Link}.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we investigate an open research task of cross-modal retrieval between 3D shapes and textual descriptions. Previous approaches mainly rely on point cloud encoders for feature extraction, which may ignore key inherent features of 3D shapes, including depth, spatial hierarchy, geometric continuity, etc. To address this issue, we propose COM3D, making the first attempt to exploit the cross-view correspondence and cross-modal mining to enhance the retrieval performance. Notably, we augment the 3D features through a scene representation transformer, to generate cross-view correspondence features of 3D shapes, which enrich the inherent features and enhance their compatibility with text matching. Furthermore, we propose to optimize the cross-modal matching process based on the semi-hard negative example mining method, in an attempt to improve the learning efficiency. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed COM3D, achieving state-of-the-art results on the Text2Shape dataset.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, privacy, protect, robust, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent booming development of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has facilitated an emerging model commercialization for the purpose of reinforcement on model performance, such as licensing or trading Deep Neural Network (DNN) models. However, DNN model trading may trigger concerns of the unauthorized replications or misuses over the model, so that the benefit of the model ownership will be violated. Model identity auditing is a challenging issue in protecting intellectual property of DNN models and verifying the integrity and ownership of models for guaranteeing trusts in transactions is one of the critical obstacles. In this paper, we focus on the above issue and propose a novel Accumulator-enabled Auditing for Distributed Identity of DNN Model (A2-DIDM) that utilizes blockchain and zero-knowledge techniques to protect data and function privacy while ensuring the lightweight on-chain ownership verification. The proposed model presents a scheme of identity records via configuring model weight checkpoints with corresponding zero-knowledge proofs, which incorporates predicates to capture incremental state changes in model weight checkpoints. Our scheme ensures both computational integrity of DNN training process and programmability, so that the uniqueness of the weight checkpoint sequence in a DNN model is preserved, ensuring the correctness of the model identity auditing. In addition, A2-DIDM also addresses privacy protections in distributed identity via a proposed method of accumulators. We systematically analyze the security and robustness of our proposed model and further evaluate the effectiveness and usability of auditing DNN model identities.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The goal of this chapter is to illuminate the operational frameworks, key actors, and significant cybersecurity implications of the Malware as a Service (MaaS) ecosystem. Highlighting the transformation of malware proliferation into a service-oriented model, the chapter discusses how MaaS democratises access to sophisticated cyberattack capabilities, enabling even those with minimal technical knowledge to execute catastrophic cyberattacks. The discussion extends to the roles within the MaaS ecosystem, including malware developers, affiliates, initial access brokers, and the essential infrastructure providers that support these nefarious activities. The study emphasises the profound challenges MaaS poses to traditional cybersecurity defences, rendered ineffective against the constantly evolving and highly adaptable threats generated by MaaS platforms. With the increase in malware sophistication, there is a parallel call for a paradigm shift in defensive strategies, advocating for dynamic analysis, behavioural detection, and the integration of AI and machine learning techniques. By exploring the intricacies of the MaaS ecosystem, including the economic motivations driving its growth and the blurred lines between legitimate service models and cyber crime, the chapter presents a comprehensive overview intended to foster a deeper understanding among researchers and cybersecurity professionals. The ultimate goal is to aid in developing more effective strategies for combating the spread of commoditised malware threats and safeguarding against the increasing accessibility and scalability of cyberattacks facilitated by the MaaS model.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the presence of impulsive noise, and missing observations, accurate online prediction of time-varying graph signals poses a crucial challenge in numerous application domains. We propose the Adaptive Least Mean $p^{th}$ Power Graph Neural Networks (LMP-GNN), a universal framework combining adaptive filter and graph neural network for online graph signal estimation. LMP-GNN retains the advantage of adaptive filtering in handling noise and missing observations as well as the online update capability. The incorporated graph neural network within the LMP-GNN can train and update filter parameters online instead of predefined filter parameters in previous methods, outputting more accurate prediction results. The adaptive update scheme of the LMP-GNN follows the solution of a $l_p$-norm optimization, rooting to the minimum dispersion criterion, and yields robust estimation results for time-varying graph signals under impulsive noise. A special case of LMP-GNN named the Sign-GNN is also provided and analyzed, Experiment results on two real-world datasets of temperature graph and traffic graph under four different noise distributions prove the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed LMP-GNN.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, defense, attack, robust, steal</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Split Learning (SL) is a distributed learning framework renowned for its privacy-preserving features and minimal computational requirements. Previous research consistently highlights the potential privacy breaches in SL systems by server adversaries reconstructing training data. However, these studies often rely on strong assumptions or compromise system utility to enhance attack performance. This paper introduces a new semi-honest Data Reconstruction Attack on SL, named Feature-Oriented Reconstruction Attack (FORA). In contrast to prior works, FORA relies on limited prior knowledge, specifically that the server utilizes auxiliary samples from the public without knowing any client's private information. This allows FORA to conduct the attack stealthily and achieve robust performance. The key vulnerability exploited by FORA is the revelation of the model representation preference in the smashed data output by victim client. FORA constructs a substitute client through feature-level transfer learning, aiming to closely mimic the victim client's representation preference. Leveraging this substitute client, the server trains the attack model to effectively reconstruct private data. Extensive experiments showcase FORA's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the paper systematically evaluates the proposed method's applicability across diverse settings and advanced defense strategies.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Modern AI systems such as self-driving cars and game-playing agents achieve superhuman performance, but often lack human-like features such as generalization, interpretability and human inter-operability. Inspired by the rich interactions between language and decision-making in humans, we introduce Policy Learning with a Language Bottleneck (PLLB), a framework enabling AI agents to generate linguistic rules that capture the strategies underlying their most rewarding behaviors. PLLB alternates between a rule generation step guided by language models, and an update step where agents learn new policies guided by rules. In a two-player communication game, a maze solving task, and two image reconstruction tasks, we show that PLLB agents are not only able to learn more interpretable and generalizable behaviors, but can also share the learned rules with human users, enabling more effective human-AI coordination.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Cross-modal knowledge transfer enhances point cloud representation learning in LiDAR semantic segmentation. Despite its potential, the \textit{weak teacher challenge} arises due to repetitive and non-diverse car camera images and sparse, inaccurate ground truth labels. To address this, we propose the Efficient Image-to-LiDAR Knowledge Transfer (ELiTe) paradigm. ELiTe introduces Patch-to-Point Multi-Stage Knowledge Distillation, transferring comprehensive knowledge from the Vision Foundation Model (VFM), extensively trained on diverse open-world images. This enables effective knowledge transfer to a lightweight student model across modalities. ELiTe employs Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning to strengthen the VFM teacher and expedite large-scale model training with minimal costs. Additionally, we introduce the Segment Anything Model based Pseudo-Label Generation approach to enhance low-quality image labels, facilitating robust semantic representations. Efficient knowledge transfer in ELiTe yields state-of-the-art results on the SemanticKITTI benchmark, outperforming real-time inference models. Our approach achieves this with significantly fewer parameters, confirming its effectiveness and efficiency.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated Learning (FL) enables multiple devices to collaboratively train a shared model while ensuring data privacy. The selection of participating devices in each training round critically affects both the model performance and training efficiency, especially given the vast heterogeneity in training capabilities and data distribution across devices. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel device selection solution called FedRank, which is an end-to-end, ranking-based approach that is pre-trained by imitation learning against state-of-the-art analytical approaches. It not only considers data and system heterogeneity at runtime but also adaptively and efficiently chooses the most suitable clients for model training. Specifically, FedRank views client selection in FL as a ranking problem and employs a pairwise training strategy for the smart selection process. Additionally, an imitation learning-based approach is designed to counteract the cold-start issues often seen in state-of-the-art learning-based approaches. Experimental results reveal that \model~ boosts model accuracy by 5.2\% to 56.9\%, accelerates the training convergence up to $2.01 \times$ and saves the energy consumption up to $40.1\%$.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The latest developments in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have demonstrated remarkable progress in a code-text retrieval problem. As the Transformer-based models used in this task continue to increase in size, the computational costs and time required for end-to-end fine-tuning become substantial. This poses a significant challenge for adapting and utilizing these models when computational resources are limited. Motivated by these concerns, we propose a fine-tuning framework that leverages Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques. Moreover, we adopt contrastive learning objectives to improve the quality of bimodal representations learned by transformer models. Additionally, for PEFT methods we provide extensive benchmarking, the lack of which has been highlighted as a crucial problem in the literature. Based on the thorough experimentation with the CodeT5+ model conducted on two datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed fine-tuning framework has the potential to improve code-text retrieval performance by tuning only 0.4% parameters at most.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The generative model has made significant advancements in the creation of realistic videos, which causes security issues. However, this emerging risk has not been adequately addressed due to the absence of a benchmark dataset for AI-generated videos. In this paper, we first construct a video dataset using advanced diffusion-based video generation algorithms with various semantic contents. Besides, typical video lossy operations over network transmission are adopted to generate degraded samples. Then, by analyzing local and global temporal defects of current AI-generated videos, a novel detection framework by adaptively learning local motion information and global appearance variation is constructed to expose fake videos. Finally, experiments are conducted to evaluate the generalization and robustness of different spatial and temporal domain detection methods, where the results can serve as the baseline and demonstrate the research challenge for future studies.</li>

The data stored on the blockchain is replicated across all nodes in the network, ensuring accessibility to all participants. While this aspect facilitates traceability, integrity, and persistence, it poses challenges for adopting public blockchains in enterprise settings due to confidentiality issues. In this paper, we present a software tool named Control Access via Key Encryption (CAKE), designed to ensure data confidentiality in scenarios involving public blockchains. After outlining its core components and functionalities, we showcase the application of CAKE in the context of a real-world cyber-security project within the logistics domain.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Transformer-based language models are treated as black-boxes because of their large number of parameters and complex internal interactions, which is a serious safety concern. Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) intends to reverse-engineer neural network behaviors in terms of human-understandable components. In this work, we focus on understanding how GPT-2 Small performs the task of predicting three-letter acronyms. Previous works in the MI field have focused so far on tasks that predict a single token. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that tries to mechanistically understand a behavior involving the prediction of multiple consecutive tokens. We discover that the prediction is performed by a circuit composed of 8 attention heads (~5% of the total heads) which we classified in three groups according to their role. We also demonstrate that these heads concentrate the acronym prediction functionality. In addition, we mechanistically interpret the most relevant heads of the circuit and find out that they use positional information which is propagated via the causal mask mechanism. We expect this work to lay the foundation for understanding more complex behaviors involving multiple-token predictions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in natural language tasks, but their outputs can exhibit undesirable attributes or biases. Existing methods for steering LLMs towards desired attributes often assume unbiased representations and rely solely on steering prompts. However, the representations learned from pre-training can introduce semantic biases that influence the steering process, leading to suboptimal results. We propose LLMGuardaril, a novel framework that incorporates causal analysis and adversarial learning to obtain unbiased steering representations in LLMs. LLMGuardaril systematically identifies and blocks the confounding effects of biases, enabling the extraction of unbiased steering representations. Additionally, it includes an explainable component that provides insights into the alignment between the generated output and the desired direction. Experiments demonstrate LLMGuardaril's effectiveness in steering LLMs towards desired attributes while mitigating biases. Our work contributes to the development of safe and reliable LLMs that align with desired attributes. We discuss the limitations and future research directions, highlighting the need for ongoing research to address the ethical implications of large language models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Automatic Sign Language Translation requires the integration of both computer vision and natural language processing to effectively bridge the communication gap between sign and spoken languages. However, the deficiency in large-scale training data to support sign language translation means we need to leverage resources from spoken language. We introduce, Sign2GPT, a novel framework for sign language translation that utilizes large-scale pretrained vision and language models via lightweight adapters for gloss-free sign language translation. The lightweight adapters are crucial for sign language translation, due to the constraints imposed by limited dataset sizes and the computational requirements when training with long sign videos. We also propose a novel pretraining strategy that directs our encoder to learn sign representations from automatically extracted pseudo-glosses without requiring gloss order information or annotations. We evaluate our approach on two public benchmark sign language translation datasets, namely RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather 2014T and CSL-Daily, and improve on state-of-the-art gloss-free translation performance with a significant margin.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Nowadays, Information spreads at an unprecedented pace in social media and discerning truth from misinformation and fake news has become an acute societal challenge. Machine learning (ML) models have been employed to identify fake news but are far from perfect with challenging problems like limited accuracy, interpretability, and generalizability. In this paper, we enhance ML-based solutions with linguistics input and we propose LingML, linguistic-informed ML, for fake news detection. We conducted an experimental study with a popular dataset on fake news during the pandemic. The experiment results show that our proposed solution is highly effective. There are fewer than two errors out of every ten attempts with only linguistic input used in ML and the knowledge is highly explainable. When linguistics input is integrated with advanced large-scale ML models for natural language processing, our solution outperforms existing ones with 1.8% average error rate. LingML creates a new path with linguistics to push the frontier of effective and efficient fake news detection. It also sheds light on real-world multi-disciplinary applications requiring both ML and domain expertise to achieve optimal performance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present three very simple variants of the classic Heads or Tails game using chips, each of which contributes to our understanding of the Bitcoin protocol. The first variant addresses the issue of temporary Bitcoin forks, which occur when two miners discover blocks simultaneously. We determine the threshold at which an honest but temporarily ``Byzantine'' miner persists in mining on their fork to save his orphaned blocks. The second variant of Heads or Tails game is biased in favor of the player and helps to explain why the difficulty adjustment formula is vulnerable to attacks of Nakamoto's consensus. We derive directly and in a simple way, without relying on a Markov decision solver as was the case until now, the threshold beyond which a miner without connectivity finds it advantageous to adopt a deviant mining strategy on Bitcoin. The third variant of Heads or Tails game is unbiased and demonstrates that this issue in the Difficulty Adjustment formula can be fully rectified. Our results are in agreement with the existing literature that we clarify both qualitatively and quantitatively using very simple models and scripts that are easy to implement.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention and widespread usage due to their impressive performance in various tasks. However, they are not without their own set of challenges, including issues such as hallucinations, factual inconsistencies, and limitations in numerical-quantitative reasoning. Evaluating LLMs in miscellaneous reasoning tasks remains an active area of research. Prior to the breakthrough of LLMs, Transformers had already proven successful in the medical domain, effectively employed for various natural language understanding (NLU) tasks. Following this trend, LLMs have also been trained and utilized in the medical domain, raising concerns regarding factual accuracy, adherence to safety protocols, and inherent limitations. In this paper, we focus on evaluating the natural language inference capabilities of popular open-source and closed-source LLMs using clinical trial reports as the dataset. We present the performance results of each LLM and further analyze their performance on a development set, particularly focusing on challenging instances that involve medical abbreviations and require numerical-quantitative reasoning. Gemini, our leading LLM, achieved a test set F1-score of 0.748, securing the ninth position on the task scoreboard. Our work is the first of its kind, offering a thorough examination of the inference capabilities of LLMs within the medical domain.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated learning algorithms, such as FedAvg, are negatively affected by data heterogeneity and partial client participation. To mitigate the latter problem, global variance reduction methods, like FedVARP, leverage stale model updates for non-participating clients. These methods are effective under homogeneous client participation. Yet, this paper shows that, when some clients participate much less than others, aggregating updates with different levels of staleness can detrimentally affect the training process. Motivated by this observation, we introduce FedStale, a novel algorithm that updates the global model in each round through a convex combination of "fresh" updates from participating clients and "stale" updates from non-participating ones. By adjusting the weight in the convex combination, FedStale interpolates between FedAvg, which only uses fresh updates, and FedVARP, which treats fresh and stale updates equally. Our analysis of FedStale convergence yields the following novel findings: i) it integrates and extends previous FedAvg and FedVARP analyses to heterogeneous client participation; ii) it underscores how the least participating client influences convergence error; iii) it provides practical guidelines to best exploit stale updates, showing that their usefulness diminishes as data heterogeneity decreases and participation heterogeneity increases. Extensive experiments featuring diverse levels of client data and participation heterogeneity not only confirm these findings but also show that FedStale outperforms both FedAvg and FedVARP in many settings.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Automated radiology reporting holds immense clinical potential in alleviating the burdensome workload of radiologists and mitigating diagnostic bias. Recently, retrieval-based report generation methods have garnered increasing attention due to their inherent advantages in terms of the quality and consistency of generated reports. However, due to the long-tail distribution of the training data, these models tend to learn frequently occurring sentences and topics, overlooking the rare topics. Regrettably, in many cases, the descriptions of rare topics often indicate critical findings that should be mentioned in the report. To address this problem, we introduce a Topicwise Separable Sentence Retrieval (Teaser) for medical report generation. To ensure comprehensive learning of both common and rare topics, we categorize queries into common and rare types to learn differentiated topics, and then propose Topic Contrastive Loss to effectively align topics and queries in the latent space. Moreover, we integrate an Abstractor module following the extraction of visual features, which aids the topic decoder in gaining a deeper understanding of the visual observational intent. Experiments on the MIMIC-CXR and IU X-ray datasets demonstrate that Teaser surpasses state-of-the-art models, while also validating its capability to effectively represent rare topics and establish more dependable correspondences between queries and topics.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid advancement in text-to-video (T2V) generative models has enabled the synthesis of high-fidelity video content guided by textual descriptions. Despite this significant progress, these models are often susceptible to hallucination, generating contents that contradict the input text, which poses a challenge to their reliability and practical deployment. To address this critical issue, we introduce the SoraDetector, a novel unified framework designed to detect hallucinations across diverse large T2V models, including the cutting-edge Sora model. Our framework is built upon a comprehensive analysis of hallucination phenomena, categorizing them based on their manifestation in the video content. Leveraging the state-of-the-art keyframe extraction techniques and multimodal large language models, SoraDetector first evaluates the consistency between extracted video content summary and textual prompts, then constructs static and dynamic knowledge graphs (KGs) from frames to detect hallucination both in single frames and across frames. Sora Detector provides a robust and quantifiable measure of consistency, static and dynamic hallucination. In addition, we have developed the Sora Detector Agent to automate the hallucination detection process and generate a complete video quality report for each input video. Lastly, we present a novel meta-evaluation benchmark, T2VHaluBench, meticulously crafted to facilitate the evaluation of advancements in T2V hallucination detection. Through extensive experiments on videos generated by Sora and other large T2V models, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in accurately detecting hallucinations.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>All fields of knowledge are being impacted by Artificial Intelligence. In particular, the Deep Learning paradigm enables the development of data analysis tools that support subject matter experts in a variety of sectors, from physics up to the recognition of ancient languages. Palaeontology is now observing this trend as well. This study explores the capability of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a particular class of Deep Learning algorithms specifically crafted for computer vision tasks, to classify images of isolated fossil shark teeth gathered from online datasets as well as from the authors$'$ experience on Peruvian Miocene and Italian Pliocene fossil assemblages. The shark taxa that are included in the final, composite dataset (which consists of more than one thousand images) are representative of both extinct and extant genera, namely, Carcharhinus, Carcharias, Carcharocles, Chlamydoselachus, Cosmopolitodus, Galeocerdo, Hemipristis, Notorynchus, Prionace and Squatina. We developed a CNN, named SharkNet-X, specifically tailored on our recognition task, reaching a 5-fold cross validated mean accuracy of 0.85 to identify images containing a single shark tooth. Furthermore, we elaborated a visualization of the features extracted from images using the last dense layer of the CNN, achieved through the application of the clustering technique t-SNE. In addition, in order to understand and explain the behaviour of the CNN while giving a paleontological point of view on the results, we introduced the explainability method SHAP. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance in which this method is applied to the field of palaeontology. The main goal of this work is to showcase how Deep Learning techniques can aid in identifying isolated fossil shark teeth, paving the way for developing new information tools for automating the recognition and classification of fossils.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Corruptions due to data perturbations and label noise are prevalent in the datasets from unreliable sources, which poses significant threats to model training. Despite existing efforts in developing robust models, current learning methods commonly overlook the possible co-existence of both corruptions, limiting the effectiveness and practicability of the model. In this paper, we develop an Effective and Robust Adversarial Training (ERAT) framework to simultaneously handle two types of corruption (i.e., data and label) without prior knowledge of their specifics. We propose a hybrid adversarial training surrounding multiple potential adversarial perturbations, alongside a semi-supervised learning based on class-rebalancing sample selection to enhance the resilience of the model for dual corruption. On the one hand, in the proposed adversarial training, the perturbation generation module learns multiple surrogate malicious data perturbations by taking a DNN model as the victim, while the model is trained to maintain semantic consistency between the original data and the hybrid perturbed data. It is expected to enable the model to cope with unpredictable perturbations in real-world data corruption. On the other hand, a class-rebalancing data selection strategy is designed to fairly differentiate clean labels from noisy labels. Semi-supervised learning is performed accordingly by discarding noisy labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed ERAT framework.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>AI technologies have become more widely adopted in wireless communications. As an emerging type of AI technologies, the generative artificial intelligence (GAI) gains lots of attention in communication security. Due to its powerful learning ability, GAI models have demonstrated superiority over conventional AI methods. However, GAI still has several limitations, including high computational complexity and limited adaptability. Mixture of Experts (MoE), which uses multiple expert models for prediction through a gate mechanism, proposes possible solutions. Firstly, we review GAI model's applications in physical layer communication security, discuss limitations, and explore how MoE can help GAI overcome these limitations. Furthermore, we propose an MoE-enabled GAI framework for network optimization problems for communication security. To demonstrate the framework's effectiveness, we provide a case study in a cooperative friendly jamming scenario. The experimental results show that the MoE-enabled framework effectively assists the GAI algorithm, solves its limitations, and enhances communication security.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Breast cancer is a significant global health concern, particularly for women. Early detection and appropriate treatment are crucial in mitigating its impact, with histopathology examinations playing a vital role in swift diagnosis. However, these examinations often require a substantial workforce and experienced medical experts for proper recognition and cancer grading. Automated image retrieval systems have the potential to assist pathologists in identifying cancerous tissues, thereby accelerating the diagnostic process. Nevertheless, due to considerable variability among the tissue and cell patterns in histological images, proposing an accurate image retrieval model is very challenging. This work introduces a novel attention-based adversarially regularized variational graph autoencoder model for breast histological image retrieval. Additionally, we incorporated cluster-guided contrastive learning as the graph feature extractor to boost the retrieval performance. We evaluated the proposed model's performance on two publicly available datasets of breast cancer histological images and achieved superior or very competitive retrieval performance, with average mAP scores of 96.5% for the BreakHis dataset and 94.7% for the BACH dataset, and mVP scores of 91.9% and 91.3%, respectively. Our proposed retrieval model has the potential to be used in clinical settings to enhance diagnostic performance and ultimately benefit patients.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) show significant potential for achieving high autonomy in various scenarios such as software development. Recent research has shown that LLM agents can leverage past experiences to reduce errors and enhance efficiency. However, the static experience paradigm, reliant on a fixed collection of past experiences acquired heuristically, lacks iterative refinement and thus hampers agents' adaptability. In this paper, we introduce the Iterative Experience Refinement framework, enabling LLM agents to refine experiences iteratively during task execution. We propose two fundamental patterns: the successive pattern, refining based on nearest experiences within a task batch, and the cumulative pattern, acquiring experiences across all previous task batches. Augmented with our heuristic experience elimination, the method prioritizes high-quality and frequently-used experiences, effectively managing the experience space and enhancing efficiency. Extensive experiments show that while the successive pattern may yield superior results, the cumulative pattern provides more stable performance. Moreover, experience elimination facilitates achieving better performance using just 11.54% of a high-quality subset.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As Internet of Things (IoT) technology advances, end devices like sensors and smartphones are progressively equipped with AI models tailored to their local memory and computational constraints. Local inference reduces communication costs and latency; however, these smaller models typically underperform compared to more sophisticated models deployed on edge servers or in the cloud. Cooperative Inference Systems (CISs) address this performance trade-off by enabling smaller devices to offload part of their inference tasks to more capable devices. These systems often deploy hierarchical models that share numerous parameters, exemplified by Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) that utilize strategies like early exits or ordered dropout. In such instances, Federated Learning (FL) may be employed to jointly train the models within a CIS. Yet, traditional training methods have overlooked the operational dynamics of CISs during inference, particularly the potential high heterogeneity in serving rates across clients. To address this gap, we propose a novel FL approach designed explicitly for use in CISs that accounts for these variations in serving rates. Our framework not only offers rigorous theoretical guarantees, but also surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) training algorithms for CISs, especially in scenarios where inference request rates or data availability are uneven among clients.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The efficacy of an large language model (LLM) generated text detector depends substantially on the availability of sizable training data. White-box zero-shot detectors, which require no such data, are nonetheless limited by the accessibility of the source model of the LLM-generated text. In this paper, we propose an simple but effective black-box zero-shot detection approach, predicated on the observation that human-written texts typically contain more grammatical errors than LLM-generated texts. This approach entails computing the Grammar Error Correction Score (GECScore) for the given text to distinguish between human-written and LLM-generated text. Extensive experimental results show that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) zero-shot and supervised methods, achieving an average AUROC of 98.7% and showing strong robustness against paraphrase and adversarial perturbation attacks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This study introduces 'clickbait spoiling', a novel technique designed to detect, categorize, and generate spoilers as succinct text responses, countering the curiosity induced by clickbait content. By leveraging a multi-task learning framework, our model's generalization capabilities are significantly enhanced, effectively addressing the pervasive issue of clickbait. The crux of our research lies in generating appropriate spoilers, be it a phrase, an extended passage, or multiple, depending on the spoiler type required. Our methodology integrates two crucial techniques: a refined spoiler categorization method and a modified version of the Question Answering (QA) mechanism, incorporated within a multi-task learning paradigm for optimized spoiler extraction from context. Notably, we have included fine-tuning methods for models capable of handling longer sequences to accommodate the generation of extended spoilers. This research highlights the potential of sophisticated text processing techniques in tackling the omnipresent issue of clickbait, promising an enhanced user experience in the digital realm.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>3D occupancy, an advanced perception technology for driving scenarios, represents the entire scene without distinguishing between foreground and background by quantifying the physical space into a grid map. The widely adopted projection-first deformable attention, efficient in transforming image features into 3D representations, encounters challenges in aggregating multi-view features due to sensor deployment constraints. To address this issue, we propose our learning-first view attention mechanism for effective multi-view feature aggregation. Moreover, we showcase the scalability of our view attention across diverse multi-view 3D tasks, such as map construction and 3D object detection. Leveraging the proposed view attention as well as an additional multi-frame streaming temporal attention, we introduce ViewFormer, a vision-centric transformer-based framework for spatiotemporal feature aggregation. To further explore occupancy-level flow representation, we present FlowOcc3D, a benchmark built on top of existing high-quality datasets. Qualitative and quantitative analyses on this benchmark reveal the potential to represent fine-grained dynamic scenes. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods. The codes and benchmark will be released soon.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Speculative decoding is a promising method for reducing the inference latency of large language models. The effectiveness of the method depends on the speculation length (SL) - the number of tokens generated by the draft model at each iteration. The vast majority of speculative decoding approaches use the same SL for all iterations. In this work, we show that this practice is suboptimal. We introduce DISCO, a DynamIc SpeCulation length Optimization method that uses a classifier to dynamically adjust the SL at each iteration, while provably preserving the decoding quality. Experiments with four benchmarks demonstrate average speedup gains of 10.3% relative to our best baselines.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Aphid infestations are one of the primary causes of extensive damage to wheat and sorghum fields and are one of the most common vectors for plant viruses, resulting in significant agricultural yield losses. To address this problem, farmers often employ the inefficient use of harmful chemical pesticides that have negative health and environmental impacts. As a result, a large amount of pesticide is wasted on areas without significant pest infestation. This brings to attention the urgent need for an intelligent autonomous system that can locate and spray sufficiently large infestations selectively within the complex crop canopies. We have developed a large multi-scale dataset for aphid cluster detection and segmentation, collected from actual sorghum fields and meticulously annotated to include clusters of aphids. Our dataset comprises a total of 54,742 image patches, showcasing a variety of viewpoints, diverse lighting conditions, and multiple scales, highlighting its effectiveness for real-world applications. In this study, we trained and evaluated four real-time semantic segmentation models and three object detection models specifically for aphid cluster segmentation and detection. Considering the balance between accuracy and efficiency, Fast-SCNN delivered the most effective segmentation results, achieving 80.46% mean precision, 81.21% mean recall, and 91.66 frames per second (FPS). For object detection, RT-DETR exhibited the best overall performance with a 61.63% mean average precision (mAP), 92.6% mean recall, and 72.55 on an NVIDIA V100 GPU. Our experiments further indicate that aphid cluster segmentation is more suitable for assessing aphid infestations than using detection models.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Automatic perception of image quality is a challenging problem that impacts billions of Internet and social media users daily. To advance research in this field, we propose a no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) method termed Cross-IQA based on vision transformer(ViT) model. The proposed Cross-IQA method can learn image quality features from unlabeled image data. We construct the pretext task of synthesized image reconstruction to unsupervised extract the image quality information based ViT block. The pretrained encoder of Cross-IQA is used to fine-tune a linear regression model for score prediction. Experimental results show that Cross-IQA can achieve state-of-the-art performance in assessing the low-frequency degradation information (e.g., color change, blurring, etc.) of images compared with the classical full-reference IQA and NR-IQA under the same datasets.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models have shown remarkable performance in image generation in recent years. However, due to a quadratic increase in memory during generating ultra-high-resolution images (e.g. 4096*4096), the resolution of generated images is often limited to 1024*1024. In this work. we propose a unidirectional block attention mechanism that can adaptively adjust the memory overhead during the inference process and handle global dependencies. Building on this module, we adopt the DiT structure for upsampling and develop an infinite super-resolution model capable of upsampling images of various shapes and resolutions. Comprehensive experiments show that our model achieves SOTA performance in generating ultra-high-resolution images in both machine and human evaluation. Compared to commonly used UNet structures, our model can save more than 5x memory when generating 4096*4096 images. The project URL is this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent developments in large language models (LLMs), while offering a powerful foundation for developing natural language agents, raise safety concerns about them and the autonomous agents built upon them. Deception is one potential capability of AI agents of particular concern, which we refer to as an act or statement that misleads, hides the truth, or promotes a belief that is not true in its entirety or in part. We move away from the conventional understanding of deception through straight-out lying, making objective selfish decisions, or giving false information, as seen in previous AI safety research. We target a specific category of deception achieved through obfuscation and equivocation. We broadly explain the two types of deception by analogizing them with the rabbit-out-of-hat magic trick, where (i) the rabbit either comes out of a hidden trap door or (ii) (our focus) the audience is completely distracted to see the magician bring out the rabbit right in front of them using sleight of hand or misdirection. Our novel testbed framework displays intrinsic deception capabilities of LLM agents in a goal-driven environment when directed to be deceptive in their natural language generations in a two-agent adversarial dialogue system built upon the legislative task of "lobbying" for a bill. Along the lines of a goal-driven environment, we show developing deceptive capacity through a reinforcement learning setup, building it around the theories of language philosophy and cognitive psychology. We find that the lobbyist agent increases its deceptive capabilities by ~ 40% (relative) through subsequent reinforcement trials of adversarial interactions, and our deception detection mechanism shows a detection capability of up to 92%. Our results highlight potential issues in agent-human interaction, with agents potentially manipulating humans towards its programmed end-goal.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the task of talking face generation, the objective is to generate a face video with lips synchronized to the corresponding audio while preserving visual details and identity information. Current methods face the challenge of learning accurate lip synchronization while avoiding detrimental effects on visual quality, as well as robustly evaluating such synchronization. To tackle these problems, we propose utilizing an audio-visual speech representation expert (AV-HuBERT) for calculating lip synchronization loss during training. Moreover, leveraging AV-HuBERT's features, we introduce three novel lip synchronization evaluation metrics, aiming to provide a comprehensive assessment of lip synchronization performance. Experimental results, along with a detailed ablation study, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and the utility of the proposed evaluation metrics.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Cryptocurrency wallets, acting as fundamental infrastructure to the blockchain ecosystem, have seen significant user growth, particularly among browser-based wallets (i.e., browser extensions). However, this expansion accompanies security challenges, making these wallets prime targets for malicious activities. Despite a substantial user base, there is not only a significant gap in comprehensive security analysis but also a pressing need for specialized tools that can aid developers in reducing vulnerabilities during the development process. To fill the void, we present a comprehensive security analysis of browser-based wallets in this paper, along with the development of an automated tool designed for this purpose. We first compile a taxonomy of security vulnerabilities resident in cryptocurrency wallets by harvesting historical security reports. Based on this, we design WALLETRADAR, an automated detection framework that can accurately identify security issues based on static and dynamic analysis. Evaluation of 96 popular browser-based wallets shows WALLETRADAR's effectiveness, by successfully automating the detection process in 90% of these wallets with high precision. This evaluation has led to the discovery of 116 security vulnerabilities corresponding to 70 wallets. By the time of this paper, we have received confirmations of 10 vulnerabilities from 8 wallet developers, with over $2,000 bug bounties. Further, we observed that 12 wallet developers have silently fixed 16 vulnerabilities after our disclosure. WALLETRADAR can effectively automate the identification of security risks in cryptocurrency wallets, thereby enhancing software development quality and safety in the blockchain ecosystem.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Adversarial attacks in Natural Language Processing apply perturbations in the character or token levels. Token-level attacks, gaining prominence for their use of gradient-based methods, are susceptible to altering sentence semantics, leading to invalid adversarial examples. While character-level attacks easily maintain semantics, they have received less attention as they cannot easily adopt popular gradient-based methods, and are thought to be easy to defend. Challenging these beliefs, we introduce Charmer, an efficient query-based adversarial attack capable of achieving high attack success rate (ASR) while generating highly similar adversarial examples. Our method successfully targets both small (BERT) and large (Llama 2) models. Specifically, on BERT with SST-2, Charmer improves the ASR in 4.84% points and the USE similarity in 8% points with respect to the previous art.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>System Management Mode (SMM) is the highest-privileged operating mode of x86 and x86-64 processors. Through SMM exploitation, attackers can tamper with the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) firmware, disabling the security mechanisms implemented by the operating system and hypervisor. Vulnerabilities enabling SMM code execution are often reported as Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs); however, no security mechanisms currently exist to prevent attackers from analyzing those vulnerabilities. To increase the cost of vulnerability analysis of SMM modules, we introduced SmmPack. The core concept of SmmPack involves encrypting an SMM module with the key securely stored in a Trusted Platform Module (TPM). We assessed the effectiveness of SmmPack in preventing attackers from obtaining and analyzing SMM modules using various acquisition methods. Our results show that SmmPack significantly increases the cost by narrowing down the means of module acquisition. Furthermore, we demonstrated that SmmPack operates without compromising the performance of the original SMM modules. We also clarified the management and adoption methods of SmmPack, as well as the procedure for applying BIOS updates, and demonstrated that the implementation of SmmPack is realistic.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present a new multi-modal face image generation method that converts a text prompt and a visual input, such as a semantic mask or scribble map, into a photo-realistic face image. To do this, we combine the strengths of Generative Adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models (DMs) by employing the multi-modal features in the DM into the latent space of the pre-trained GANs. We present a simple mapping and a style modulation network to link two models and convert meaningful representations in feature maps and attention maps into latent codes. With GAN inversion, the estimated latent codes can be used to generate 2D or 3D-aware facial images. We further present a multi-step training strategy that reflects textual and structural representations into the generated image. Our proposed network produces realistic 2D, multi-view, and stylized face images, which align well with inputs. We validate our method by using pre-trained 2D and 3D GANs, and our results outperform existing methods. Our project page is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Understanding how humans would behave during hand-object interaction is vital for applications in service robot manipulation and extended reality. To achieve this, some recent works have been proposed to simultaneously predict hand trajectories and object affordances on human egocentric videos. They are regarded as the representation of future hand-object interactions, indicating potential human motion and motivation. However, the existing approaches mostly adopt the autoregressive paradigm for unidirectional prediction, which lacks mutual constraints within the holistic future sequence, and accumulates errors along the time axis. Meanwhile, these works basically overlook the effect of camera egomotion on first-person view predictions. To address these limitations, we propose a novel diffusion-based interaction prediction method, namely Diff-IP2D, to forecast future hand trajectories and object affordances concurrently in an iterative non-autoregressive manner. We transform the sequential 2D images into latent feature space and design a denoising diffusion model to predict future latent interaction features conditioned on past ones. Motion features are further integrated into the conditional denoising process to enable Diff-IP2D aware of the camera wearer's dynamics for more accurate interaction prediction. The experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines on both the off-the-shelf metrics and our proposed new evaluation protocol. This highlights the efficacy of leveraging a generative paradigm for 2D hand-object interaction prediction. The code of Diff-IP2D will be released at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this study, explainable machine learning techniques are applied to predict the toxicity of mussels in the Gulf of Trieste (Adriatic Sea) caused by harmful algal blooms. By analysing a newly created 28-year dataset containing records of toxic phytoplankton in mussel farming areas and toxin concentrations in mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis), we train and evaluate the performance of ML models to accurately predict diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) events. The random forest model provided the best prediction of positive toxicity results based on the F1 score. Explainability methods such as permutation importance and SHAP identified key species (Dinophysis fortii and D. caudata) and environmental factors (salinity, river discharge and precipitation) as the best predictors of DSP outbreaks. These findings are important for improving early warning systems and supporting sustainable aquaculture practices.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The malware booming is a cyberspace equal to the effect of climate change to ecosystems in terms of danger. In the case of significant investments in cybersecurity technologies and staff training, the global community has become locked up in the eternal war with cyber security threats. The multi-form and changing faces of malware are continuously pushing the boundaries of the cybersecurity practitioners employ various approaches like detection and mitigate in coping with this issue. Some old mannerisms like signature-based detection and behavioral analysis are slow to adapt to the speedy evolution of malware types. Consequently, this paper proposes the utilization of the Deep Learning Model, LSTM networks, and GANs to amplify malware detection accuracy and speed. A fast-growing, state-of-the-art technology that leverages raw bytestream-based data and deep learning architectures, the AI technology provides better accuracy and performance than the traditional methods. Integration of LSTM and GAN model is the technique that is used for the synthetic generation of data, leading to the expansion of the training datasets, and as a result, the detection accuracy is improved. The paper uses the VirusShare dataset which has more than one million unique samples of the malware as the training and evaluation set for the presented models. Through thorough data preparation including tokenization, augmentation, as well as model training, the LSTM and GAN models convey the better performance in the tasks compared to straight classifiers. The research outcomes come out with 98% accuracy that shows the efficiency of deep learning plays a decisive role in proactive cybersecurity defense. Aside from that, the paper studies the output of ensemble learning and model fusion methods as a way to reduce biases and lift model complexity.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Augmenting Large Language Models (LLMs) with image-understanding capabilities has resulted in a boom of high-performing Vision-Language models (VLMs). While studying the alignment of LLMs to human values has received widespread attention, the safety of VLMs has not received the same attention. In this paper, we explore the impact of jailbreaking on three state-of-the-art VLMs, each using a distinct modeling approach. By comparing each VLM to their respective LLM backbone, we find that each VLM is more susceptible to jailbreaking. We consider this as an undesirable outcome from visual instruction-tuning, which imposes a forgetting effect on an LLM's safety guardrails. Therefore, we provide recommendations for future work based on evaluation strategies that aim to highlight the weaknesses of a VLM, as well as take safety measures into account during visual instruction tuning.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>State Space Model (SSM) is a mathematical model used to describe and analyze the behavior of dynamic systems. This model has witnessed numerous applications in several fields, including control theory, signal processing, economics and machine learning. In the field of deep learning, state space models are used to process sequence data, such as time series analysis, natural language processing (NLP) and video understanding. By mapping sequence data to state space, long-term dependencies in the data can be better captured. In particular, modern SSMs have shown strong representational capabilities in NLP, especially in long sequence modeling, while maintaining linear time complexity. Notably, based on the latest state-space models, Mamba merges time-varying parameters into SSMs and formulates a hardware-aware algorithm for efficient training and inference. Given its impressive efficiency and strong long-range dependency modeling capability, Mamba is expected to become a new AI architecture that may outperform Transformer. Recently, a number of works have attempted to study the potential of Mamba in various fields, such as general vision, multi-modal, medical image analysis and remote sensing image analysis, by extending Mamba from natural language domain to visual domain. To fully understand Mamba in the visual domain, we conduct a comprehensive survey and present a taxonomy study. This survey focuses on Mamba's application to a variety of visual tasks and data types, and discusses its predecessors, recent advances and far-reaching impact on a wide range of domains. Since Mamba is now on an upward trend, please actively notice us if you have new findings, and new progress on Mamba will be included in this survey in a timely manner and updated on the Mamba project at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We study selfish mining attacks in longest-chain blockchains like Bitcoin, but where the proof of work is replaced with efficient proof systems -- like proofs of stake or proofs of space -- and consider the problem of computing an optimal selfish mining attack which maximizes expected relative revenue of the adversary, thus minimizing the chain quality. To this end, we propose a novel selfish mining attack that aims to maximize this objective and formally model the attack as a Markov decision process (MDP). We then present a formal analysis procedure which computes an $\epsilon$-tight lower bound on the optimal expected relative revenue in the MDP and a strategy that achieves this $\epsilon$-tight lower bound, where $\epsilon>0$ may be any specified precision. Our analysis is fully automated and provides formal guarantees on the correctness. We evaluate our selfish mining attack and observe that it achieves superior expected relative revenue compared to two considered baselines. In concurrent work [Sarenche FC'24] does an automated analysis on selfish mining in predictable longest-chain blockchains based on efficient proof systems. Predictable means the randomness for the challenges is fixed for many blocks (as used e.g., in Ouroboros), while we consider unpredictable (Bitcoin-like) chains where the challenge is derived from the previous block.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Data augmentation is a key technique for addressing the challenge of limited datasets, which have become a major component in the training procedures of image processing. Techniques such as geometric transformations and color space adjustments have been thoroughly tested for their ability to artificially expand training datasets and generate semi-realistic data for training purposes. Data augmentation is the most important key to addressing the challenge of limited datasets, which have become a major component of image processing training procedures. Data augmentation techniques, such as geometric transformations and color space adjustments, are thoroughly tested for their ability to artificially expand training datasets and generate semi-realistic data for training purposes. Polygons play a crucial role in instance segmentation and have seen a surge in use across advanced models, such as YOLOv8. Despite their growing popularity, the lack of specialized libraries hampers the polygon-augmentation process. This paper introduces a novel solution to this challenge, embodied in the newly developed AugmenTory library. Notably, AugmenTory offers reduced computational demands in both time and space compared to existing methods. Additionally, the library includes a postprocessing thresholding feature.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Rapid progress in text-to-image generative models coupled with their deployment for visual content creation has magnified the importance of thoroughly evaluating their performance and identifying potential biases. In pursuit of models that generate images that are realistic, diverse, visually appealing, and consistent with the given prompt, researchers and practitioners often turn to automated metrics to facilitate scalable and cost-effective performance profiling. However, commonly-used metrics often fail to account for the full diversity of human preference; often even in-depth human evaluations face challenges with subjectivity, especially as interpretations of evaluation criteria vary across regions and cultures. In this work, we conduct a large, cross-cultural study to study how much annotators in Africa, Europe, and Southeast Asia vary in their perception of geographic representation, visual appeal, and consistency in real and generated images from state-of-the art public APIs. We collect over 65,000 image annotations and 20 survey responses. We contrast human annotations with common automated metrics, finding that human preferences vary notably across geographic location and that current metrics do not fully account for this diversity. For example, annotators in different locations often disagree on whether exaggerated, stereotypical depictions of a region are considered geographically representative. In addition, the utility of automatic evaluations is dependent on assumptions about their set-up, such as the alignment of feature extractors with human perception of object similarity or the definition of "appeal" captured in reference datasets used to ground evaluations. We recommend steps for improved automatic and human evaluations.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this work we tackle privacy concerns in biometric verification systems that typically require server-side processing of sensitive data (e.g., fingerprints and Iris Codes). Concretely, we design a solution that allows us to query whether a given Iris Code is similar to one contained in a given database, while all queries and datasets are being protected using secure multiparty computation (MPC). Addressing the substantial performance demands of operational systems like World ID and aid distributions by the Red Cross, we propose new protocols to improve performance by more than three orders of magnitude compared to the recent state-of-the-art system Janus (S&P 24). Our final protocol can achieve a throughput of over a million Iris Code comparisons per second on a single CPU core, while protecting the privacy of both the query and database Iris Codes. We additionally investigate GPU acceleration for some building blocks of our protocol, which results in further speedups of over 38x compared to the respective multi-threaded CPU implementation.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As the impact of climate change escalates, the global necessity to transition to sustainable energy sources becomes increasingly evident. Renewable energies have emerged as a viable solution for users, with Photovoltaic energy being a favored choice for small installations due to its reliability and efficiency. Accurate mapping of PV installations is crucial for understanding the extension of its adoption and informing energy policy. To meet this need, we introduce S3Former, designed to segment solar panels from aerial imagery and provide size and location information critical for analyzing the impact of such installations on the grid. Solar panel identification is challenging due to factors such as varying weather conditions, roof characteristics, Ground Sampling Distance variations and lack of appropriate initialization weights for optimized training. To tackle these complexities, S3Former features a Masked Attention Mask Transformer incorporating a self-supervised learning pretrained backbone. Specifically, our model leverages low-level and high-level features extracted from the backbone and incorporates an instance query mechanism incorporated on the Transformer architecture to enhance the localization of solar PV installations. We introduce a self-supervised learning phase (pretext task) to improve the initialization weights on the backbone of S3Former. We evaluated S3Former using diverse datasets, demonstrate improvement state-of-the-art models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>When a teacher provides examples for a student to study, these examples must be informative, enabling a student to progress from their current state toward a target concept or skill. Good teachers must therefore simultaneously infer what students already know and adapt their teaching to students' changing state of knowledge. There is increasing interest in using computational models, particularly large language models, as pedagogical tools. As students, language models in particular have shown a remarkable ability to adapt to new tasks given small numbers of examples. But how effectively can these models adapt as teachers to students of different types? To study this question, we introduce a suite of models and evaluation methods we call AdapT. AdapT has two components: (1) a collection of simulated Bayesian student models that can be used for evaluation of automated teaching methods; (2) a platform for evaluation with human students, to characterize the real-world effectiveness of these methods. We additionally introduce (3) AToM, a new probabilistic model for adaptive teaching that jointly infers students' past beliefs and optimizes for the correctness of future beliefs. In evaluations of simulated students across three learning domains (fraction arithmetic, English morphology, function learning), AToM systematically outperforms LLM-based and standard Bayesian teaching models. In human experiments, both AToM and LLMs outperform non-adaptive random example selection. Our results highlight both the difficulty of the adaptive teaching task and the potential of learned adaptive models for solving it.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Existing diffusion-based video editing methods have achieved impressive results in motion editing. Most of the existing methods focus on the motion alignment between the edited video and the reference video. However, these methods do not constrain the background and object content of the video to remain unchanged, which makes it possible for users to generate unexpected videos. In this paper, we propose a one-shot video motion editing method called Edit-Your-Motion that requires only a single text-video pair for training. Specifically, we design the Detailed Prompt-Guided Learning Strategy (DPL) to decouple spatio-temporal features in space-time diffusion models. DPL separates learning object content and motion into two training stages. In the first training stage, we focus on learning the spatial features (the features of object content) and breaking down the temporal relationships in the video frames by shuffling them. We further propose Recurrent-Causal Attention (RC-Attn) to learn the consistent content features of the object from unordered video frames. In the second training stage, we restore the temporal relationship in video frames to learn the temporal feature (the features of the background and object's motion). We also adopt the Noise Constraint Loss to smooth out inter-frame differences. Finally, in the inference stage, we inject the content features of the source object into the editing branch through a two-branch structure (editing branch and reconstruction branch). With Edit-Your-Motion, users can edit the motion of objects in the source video to generate more exciting and diverse videos. Comprehensive qualitative experiments, quantitative experiments and user preference studies demonstrate that Edit-Your-Motion performs better than other methods.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Natural languages are believed to be (mildly) context-sensitive. Despite underpinning remarkably capable large language models, transformers are unable to model many context-free language tasks. In an attempt to address this limitation in the modeling power of transformer-based language models, we propose augmenting them with a differentiable, stack-based attention mechanism. Our stack-based attention mechanism can be incorporated into any transformer-based language model and adds a level of interpretability to the model. We show that the addition of our stack-based attention mechanism enables the transformer to model some, but not all, deterministic context-free languages.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the 1990s, the constant error carousel and gating were introduced as the central ideas of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Since then, LSTMs have stood the test of time and contributed to numerous deep learning success stories, in particular they constituted the first Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the advent of the Transformer technology with parallelizable self-attention at its core marked the dawn of a new era, outpacing LSTMs at scale. We now raise a simple question: How far do we get in language modeling when scaling LSTMs to billions of parameters, leveraging the latest techniques from modern LLMs, but mitigating known limitations of LSTMs? Firstly, we introduce exponential gating with appropriate normalization and stabilization techniques. Secondly, we modify the LSTM memory structure, obtaining: (i) sLSTM with a scalar memory, a scalar update, and new memory mixing, (ii) mLSTM that is fully parallelizable with a matrix memory and a covariance update rule. Integrating these LSTM extensions into residual block backbones yields xLSTM blocks that are then residually stacked into xLSTM architectures. Exponential gating and modified memory structures boost xLSTM capabilities to perform favorably when compared to state-of-the-art Transformers and State Space Models, both in performance and scaling.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) have manifested strong ability to generate codes for productive activities. However, current benchmarks for code synthesis, such as HumanEval, MBPP, and DS-1000, are predominantly oriented towards introductory tasks on algorithm and data science, insufficiently satisfying challenging requirements prevalent in real-world coding. To fill this gap, we propose NaturalCodeBench (NCB), a challenging code benchmark designed to mirror the complexity and variety of scenarios in real coding tasks. NCB comprises 402 high-quality problems in Python and Java, meticulously selected from natural user queries from online coding services, covering 6 different domains. Noting the extraordinary difficulty in creating testing cases for real-world queries, we also introduce a semi-automated pipeline to enhance the efficiency of test case construction. Comparing with manual solutions, it achieves an efficiency increase of more than 4 times. Our systematic experiments on 39 LLMs find that performance gaps on NCB between models with close HumanEval scores could still be significant, indicating a lack of focus on practical code synthesis scenarios or over-specified optimization on HumanEval. On the other hand, even the best-performing GPT-4 is still far from satisfying on NCB. The evaluation toolkit and development set are available at this https URL.</li>

Recent studies have shown that PoW protocol is secure under random delay models as well. In this paper, we analyze the security-latency problem, i.e., how secure a block is, after it becomes k-deep in the blockchain, under general random delay distributions. We provide tight and explicit bounds which only require determining the distribution of the number of Poisson arrivals during the random delay. We further consider potential effects of recent Bitcoin halving on the security-latency problem by extending our results.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Quantization can accelerate large language model (LLM) inference. Going beyond INT8 quantization, the research community is actively exploring even lower precision, such as INT4. Nonetheless, state-of-the-art INT4 quantization techniques only accelerate low-batch, edge LLM inference, failing to deliver performance gains in large-batch, cloud-based LLM serving. We uncover a critical issue: existing INT4 quantization methods suffer from significant runtime overhead (20-90%) when dequantizing either weights or partial sums on GPUs. To address this challenge, we introduce QoQ, a W4A8KV4 quantization algorithm with 4-bit weight, 8-bit activation, and 4-bit KV cache. QoQ stands for quattuor-octo-quattuor, which represents 4-8-4 in Latin. QoQ is implemented by the QServe inference library that achieves measured speedup. The key insight driving QServe is that the efficiency of LLM serving on GPUs is critically influenced by operations on low-throughput CUDA cores. Building upon this insight, in QoQ algorithm, we introduce progressive quantization that can allow low dequantization overhead in W4A8 GEMM. Additionally, we develop SmoothAttention to effectively mitigate the accuracy degradation incurred by 4-bit KV quantization. In the QServe system, we perform compute-aware weight reordering and take advantage of register-level parallelism to reduce dequantization latency. We also make fused attention memory-bound, harnessing the performance gain brought by KV4 quantization. As a result, QServe improves the maximum achievable serving throughput of Llama-3-8B by 1.2x on A100, 1.4x on L40S; and Qwen1.5-72B by 2.4x on A100, 3.5x on L40S, compared to TensorRT-LLM. Remarkably, QServe on L40S GPU can achieve even higher throughput than TensorRT-LLM on A100. Thus, QServe effectively reduces the dollar cost of LLM serving by 3x.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Numerous methods have been proposed to detect, estimate, and analyze properties of people in images, including the estimation of 3D pose, shape, contact, human-object interaction, emotion, and more. Each of these methods works in isolation instead of synergistically. Here we address this problem and build a language-driven human understanding system -- ChatHuman, which combines and integrates the skills of many different methods. To do so, we finetune a Large Language Model (LLM) to select and use a wide variety of existing tools in response to user inputs. In doing so, ChatHuman is able to combine information from multiple tools to solve problems more accurately than the individual tools themselves and to leverage tool output to improve its ability to reason about humans. The novel features of ChatHuman include leveraging academic publications to guide the application of 3D human-related tools, employing a retrieval-augmented generation model to generate in-context-learning examples for handling new tools, and discriminating and integrating tool results to enhance 3D human understanding. Our experiments show that ChatHuman outperforms existing models in both tool selection accuracy and performance across multiple 3D human-related tasks. ChatHuman is a step towards consolidating diverse methods for human analysis into a single, powerful, system for 3D human reasoning.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present a scene representation, which we call a tactile-augmented radiance field (TaRF), that brings vision and touch into a shared 3D space. This representation can be used to estimate the visual and tactile signals for a given 3D position within a scene. We capture a scene's TaRF from a collection of photos and sparsely sampled touch probes. Our approach makes use of two insights: (i) common vision-based touch sensors are built on ordinary cameras and thus can be registered to images using methods from multi-view geometry, and (ii) visually and structurally similar regions of a scene share the same tactile features. We use these insights to register touch signals to a captured visual scene, and to train a conditional diffusion model that, provided with an RGB-D image rendered from a neural radiance field, generates its corresponding tactile signal. To evaluate our approach, we collect a dataset of TaRFs. This dataset contains more touch samples than previous real-world datasets, and it provides spatially aligned visual signals for each captured touch signal. We demonstrate the accuracy of our cross-modal generative model and the utility of the captured visual-tactile data on several downstream tasks. Project page: this https URL</li>
