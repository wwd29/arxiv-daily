<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present a comprehensive zero-training temporal drift analysis of transformer-based sentiment models validated on authentic social media data from major real-world events. Through systematic evaluation across three transformer architectures and rigorous statistical validation on 12,279 authentic social media posts, we demonstrate significant model instability with accuracy drops reaching 23.4% during event-driven periods. Our analysis reveals maximum confidence drops of 13.0% (Bootstrap 95% CI: [9.1%, 16.5%]) with strong correlation to actual performance degradation. We introduce four novel drift metrics that outperform embedding-based baselines while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for production deployment. Statistical validation across multiple events confirms robust detection capabilities with practical significance exceeding industry monitoring thresholds. This zero-training methodology enables immediate deployment for real-time sentiment monitoring systems and provides new insights into transformer model behavior during dynamic content periods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Accurate prediction of treatment outcomes in lung cancer remains challenging due to the sparsity, heterogeneity, and contextual overload of real-world electronic health data. Traditional models often fail to capture semantic information across multimodal streams, while large-scale fine-tuning approaches are impractical in clinical workflows. We introduce a framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) as Goal-oriented Knowledge Curators (GKC) to convert laboratory, genomic, and medication data into high-fidelity, task-aligned features. Unlike generic embeddings, GKC produces representations tailored to the prediction objective and operates as an offline preprocessing step that integrates naturally into hospital informatics pipelines. Using a lung cancer cohort (N=184), we benchmarked GKC against expert-engineered features, direct text embeddings, and an end-to-end transformer. Our approach achieved a mean AUROC of 0.803 (95% CI: 0.799-0.807) and outperformed all baselines. An ablation study further confirmed the complementary value of combining all three modalities. These results show that the quality of semantic representation is a key determinant of predictive accuracy in sparse clinical data settings. By reframing LLMs as knowledge curation engines rather than black-box predictors, this work demonstrates a scalable, interpretable, and workflow-compatible pathway for advancing AI-driven decision support in oncology.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Catastrophic forgetting remains a fundamental challenge in continual learning for large language models. Recent work revealed that performance degradation may stem from spurious forgetting caused by task alignment disruption rather than true knowledge loss. However, this work only qualitatively describes alignment, relies on post-hoc analysis, and lacks automatic distinction mechanisms. We introduce the shallow versus deep alignment framework, providing the first quantitative characterization of alignment depth. We identify that current task alignment approaches suffer from shallow alignment - maintained only over the first few output tokens (approximately 3-5) - making models vulnerable to forgetting. This explains why spurious forgetting occurs, why it is reversible, and why fine-tuning attacks are effective. We propose a comprehensive framework addressing all gaps: (1) quantitative metrics (0-1 scale) to measure alignment depth across token positions; (2) real-time detection methods for identifying shallow alignment during training; (3) specialized analysis tools for visualization and recovery prediction; and (4) adaptive mitigation strategies that automatically distinguish forgetting types and promote deep alignment. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and model architectures (Qwen2.5-3B to Qwen2.5-32B) demonstrate 86.2-90.6% identification accuracy and show that promoting deep alignment improves robustness against forgetting by 3.3-7.1% over baselines.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Transformer encoders are widely deployed in large-scale web services for natural language understanding tasks such as text classification, semantic retrieval, and content ranking. However, their high inference latency and memory consumption pose significant challenges for real-time serving and scalability. These limitations stem largely from architectural redundancy, particularly in the attention module. The inherent parameter redundancy of the attention mechanism, coupled with the fact that its attention heads operate with a degree of independence, makes it particularly amenable to structured model compression. In this paper, we propose SHRP (Specialized Head Routing and Pruning), a novel structured pruning framework that automatically identifies and removes redundant attention heads while preserving most of the model's accuracy and compatibility. SHRP introduces Expert Attention, a modular design that treats each attention head as an independent expert, followed by a lightweight shared expander feed-forward network that refines their outputs. The framework employs a unified Top-1 usage-driven mechanism to jointly perform dynamic routing during training and deterministic pruning at deployment. Experimental results on the GLUE benchmark using a BERT-base encoder show that SHRP achieves 93% of the original model accuracy while reducing parameters by 48 percent. Under an extreme compression scenario where 11/12 of the layers are pruned, the model still maintains 84% accuracy and delivers a 4.2x throughput gain while reducing computation to as low as 11.5 percent of the original FLOPs, demonstrating its practical utility for large-scale and latency-sensitive web deployments.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>data-free, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Many self-attention sublayers in large language models (LLMs) can be removed with little to no loss. We attribute this to the Attention Suppression Hypothesis: during pre-training, some deep attention layers learn to mute their own contribution, leaving the residual stream and the MLP to carry the representation. We propose Gate-Norm, a one-shot, weight-only criterion that ranks attention sublayers by query--key coupling and removes the least coupled ones, requiring no calibration data, no forward passes, no fine-tuning, and no specialized kernels. On 40-layer, 13B-parameter LLaMA models, Gate-Norm prunes the model in under a second. Pruning $8$--$16$ attention sublayers yields up to $1.30\times$ higher inference throughput while keeping average zero-shot accuracy within $2\%$ of the unpruned baseline across BoolQ, RTE, HellaSwag, WinoGrande, ARC-Easy/Challenge, and OpenBookQA. Across these settings, Gate-Norm matches data-driven pruning methods in accuracy while being $\sim 1000\times$ faster to score layers, enabling practical, data-free compression of LLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The evaluation of large language models (LLMs) relies heavily on standardized benchmarks. These benchmarks provide useful aggregated metrics for a given capability, but those aggregated metrics can obscure (i) particular sub-areas where the LLMs are weak ("model gaps") and (ii) imbalanced coverage in the benchmarks themselves ("benchmark gaps"). We propose a new method that uses sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to automatically uncover both types of gaps. By extracting SAE concept activations and computing saliency-weighted performance scores across benchmark data, the method grounds evaluation in the model's internal representations and enables comparison across benchmarks. As examples demonstrating our approach, we applied the method to two popular open-source models and ten benchmarks. We found that these models consistently underperformed on concepts that stand in contrast to sycophantic behaviors (e.g., politely refusing a request or asserting boundaries) and concepts connected to safety discussions. These model gaps align with observations previously surfaced in the literature; our automated, unsupervised method was able to recover them without manual supervision. We also observed benchmark gaps: many of the evaluated benchmarks over-represented concepts related to obedience, authority, or instruction-following, while missing core concepts that should fall within their intended scope. In sum, our method offers a representation-grounded approach to evaluation, enabling concept-level decomposition of benchmark scores. Rather than replacing conventional aggregated metrics, CG complements them by providing a concept-level decomposition that can reveal why a model scored as it did and how benchmarks could evolve to better reflect their intended scope.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The n body problem, fundamental to astrophysics, simulates the motion of n bodies acting under the effect of their own mutual gravitational interactions. Traditional machine learning models that are used for predicting and forecasting trajectories are often data intensive black box models, which ignore the physical laws, thereby lacking interpretability. Whereas Scientific Machine Learning ( Scientific ML ) directly embeds the known physical laws into the machine learning framework. Through robust modelling in the Julia programming language, our method uses the Scientific ML frameworks: Neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) and Universal differential equations (UDEs) to predict and forecast the system dynamics. In addition, an essential component of our analysis involves determining the forecasting breakdown point, which is the smallest possible amount of training data our models need to predict future, unseen data accurately. We employ synthetically created noisy data to simulate real-world observational limitations. Our findings indicate that the UDE model is much more data efficient, needing only 20% of data for a correct forecast, whereas the Neural ODE requires 90%.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Current approaches to AI coding agents appear to blur the lines between the Large Language Model (LLM) and the agent itself, asking the LLM to make decisions best left to deterministic processes. This leads to systems prone to stochastic failures such as gaming unit tests or hallucinating syntax. Drawing on established software engineering practices that provide deterministic frameworks for managing unpredictable processes, this paper proposes setting the control boundary such that the LLM is treated as a component of the environment environment -- preserving its creative stochasticity -- rather than the decision-making agent. A \textbf{Dual-State Architecture} is formalized, separating workflow state (deterministic control flow) from environment state (stochastic generation). \textbf{Atomic Action Pairs} couple generation with verification as indivisible transactions, where \textbf{Guard Functions} act as sensing actions that project probabilistic outputs onto observable workflow state. The framework is validated on three code generation tasks across 13 LLMs (1.3B--15B parameters). For qualified instruction-following models, task success rates improved by up to 66 percentage points at 1.2--2.1$\times$ baseline computational cost. The results suggest that architectural constraints can substitute for parameter scale in achieving reliable code generation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text-to-image diffusion models have drawn significant attention for their ability to generate diverse and high-fidelity images. However, when generating from multi-concept prompts, one concept token often dominates the generation, suppressing the others-a phenomenon we term the Dominant-vs-Dominated (DvD) imbalance. To systematically analyze this imbalance, we introduce DominanceBench and examine its causes from both data and architectural perspectives. Through various experiments, we show that the limited instance diversity in training data exacerbates the inter-concept interference. Analysis of cross-attention dynamics further reveals that dominant tokens rapidly saturate attention, progressively suppressing others across diffusion timesteps. In addition, head ablation studies show that the DvD behavior arises from distributed attention mechanisms across multiple heads. Our findings provide key insights into generative collapse, advancing toward more reliable and controllable text-to-image generation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Prevalent multimodal fake news detection relies on consistency-based fusion, yet this paradigm fundamentally misinterprets critical cross-modal discrepancies as noise, leading to over-smoothing, which dilutes critical evidence of fabrication. Mainstream consistency-based fusion inherently minimizes feature discrepancies to align modalities, yet this approach fundamentally fails because it inadvertently smoothes out the subtle cross-modal contradictions that serve as the primary evidence of fabrication. To address this, we propose the Dynamic Conflict-Consensus Framework (DCCF), an inconsistency-seeking paradigm designed to amplify rather than suppress contradictions. First, DCCF decouples inputs into independent Fact and Sentiment spaces to distinguish objective mismatches from emotional dissonance. Second, we employ physics-inspired feature dynamics to iteratively polarize these representations, actively extracting maximally informative conflicts. Finally, a conflict-consensus mechanism standardizes these local discrepancies against the global context for robust deliberative this http URL experiments conducted on three real world datasets demonstrate that DCCF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 3.52\%.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, security, attack, robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains, ensuring their security and alignment has become a critical challenge. Existing red-teaming practices depend heavily on manual testing, which limits scalability and fails to comprehensively cover the vast space of potential adversarial behaviors. This paper introduces an automated red-teaming framework that systematically generates, executes, and evaluates adversarial prompts to uncover security vulnerabilities in LLMs. Our framework integrates meta-prompting-based attack synthesis, multi-modal vulnerability detection, and standardized evaluation protocols spanning six major threat categories -- reward hacking, deceptive alignment, data exfiltration, sandbagging, inappropriate tool use, and chain-of-thought manipulation. Experiments on the GPT-OSS-20B model reveal 47 distinct vulnerabilities, including 21 high-severity and 12 novel attack patterns, achieving a $3.9\times$ improvement in vulnerability discovery rate over manual expert testing while maintaining 89\% detection accuracy. These results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in enabling scalable, systematic, and reproducible AI safety evaluations. By providing actionable insights for improving alignment robustness, this work advances the state of automated LLM red-teaming and contributes to the broader goal of building secure and trustworthy AI systems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Transformers operate as horizontal token-by-token scanners; at each generation step, the model attends to an ever-growing sequence of token-level states. This access pattern increases prefill latency and makes long-context decoding increasingly memory-bound, as KV-cache reads and writes dominate inference throughput rather than arithmetic computation. We propose Parallel Hierarchical Operation for Top-down Networks (PHOTON), a hierarchical autoregressive model that replaces flat scanning with vertical, multi-resolution context access. PHOTON maintains a hierarchy of latent streams: a bottom-up encoder progressively compresses tokens into low-rate contextual states, while lightweight top-down decoders reconstruct fine-grained token representations. Experimental results show that PHOTON is superior to competitive Transformer-based language models regarding the throughput-quality trade-off, offering significant advantages in long-context and multi-query tasks. This reduces decode-time KV-cache traffic, yielding up to $10^{3}\times$ higher throughput per unit memory.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Detecting business logic vulnerabilities is a critical challenge in software security. These flaws come from mistakes in an application's design or implementation and allow attackers to trigger unintended application behavior. Traditional fuzzing sanitizers for dynamic analysis excel at finding vulnerabilities related to memory safety violations but largely fail to detect business logic vulnerabilities, as these flaws require understanding application-specific semantic context. Recent attempts to infer this context, due to their reliance on heuristics and non-portable language features, are inherently brittle and incomplete. As business logic vulnerabilities constitute a majority (27/40) of the most dangerous software weaknesses in practice, this is a worrying blind spot of existing tools. In this paper, we tackle this challenge with ANOTA, a novel human-in-the-loop sanitizer framework. ANOTA introduces a lightweight, user-friendly annotation system that enables users to directly encode their domain-specific knowledge as lightweight annotations that define an application's intended behavior. A runtime execution monitor then observes program behavior, comparing it against the policies defined by the annotations, thereby identifying deviations that indicate vulnerabilities. To evaluate the effectiveness of ANOTA, we combine ANOTA with a state-of-the-art fuzzer and compare it against other popular bug finding methods compatible with the same targets. The results show that ANOTA+FUZZER outperforms them in terms of effectiveness. More specifically, ANOTA+FUZZER can successfully reproduce 43 known vulnerabilities, and discovered 22 previously unknown vulnerabilities (17 CVEs assigned) during the evaluation. These results demonstrate that ANOTA provides a practical and effective approach for uncovering complex business logic flaws often missed by traditional security testing techniques.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Radio frequency (RF) based systems are increasingly used to detect drones by analyzing their RF signal patterns, converting them into spectrogram images which are processed by object detection models. Existing RF attacks against image based models alter digital features, making over-the-air (OTA) implementation difficult due to the challenge of converting digital perturbations to transmittable waveforms that may introduce synchronization errors and interference, and encounter hardware limitations. We present the first physical attack on RF image based drone detectors, optimizing class-specific universal complex baseband (I/Q) perturbation waveforms that are transmitted alongside legitimate communications. We evaluated the attack using RF recordings and OTA experiments with four types of drones. Our results show that modest, structured I/Q perturbations are compatible with standard RF chains and reliably reduce target drone detection while preserving detection of legitimate drones.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, security, attack, extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While Ethereum has successfully achieved dynamic availability together with safety, a fundamental delay remains between transaction execution and immutable finality. In Ethereum's current Gasper protocol, this latency is on the order of 15 minutes, exposing the network to ex ante reorganization attacks, enabling MEV extraction, and limiting the efficiency of economic settlement. These limitations have motivated a growing body of work on Speedy Secure Finality (SSF), which aims to minimize confirmation latency without weakening formal security guarantees. This paper surveys the state of the art in fast finality protocol design. We introduce the core theoretical primitives underlying this space, including reorganization resilience and the generalized sleepy model, and trace their development from Goldfish to RLMD-GHOST. We then analyze the communication and aggregation bottlenecks faced by single-slot finality protocols in large validator settings. Finally, we survey the 3-slot finality (3SF) protocol as a practical synthesis that balances fast finality with the engineering constraints of the Ethereum network.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion based approaches to long form text generation suffer from prohibitive computational cost and memory overhead as sequence length increases. We introduce SA-DiffuSeq, a diffusion framework that integrates sparse attention to fundamentally improve scalability for long document modeling. By selectively allocating attention within the diffusion process, SA-DiffuSeq significantly reduces computational complexity while maintaining semantic coherence and generation quality. A key component of our method is a soft absorbing state tailored to sparse attention dynamics, which stabilizes diffusion trajectories and accelerates sequence reconstruction. This design improves sampling efficiency and enhances precision in long range dependency modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SA-DiffuSeq consistently surpasses state of the art diffusion baselines in both training efficiency and sampling speed, with especially strong gains on extended sequences. These properties make SA-DiffuSeq well suited for demanding long form applications such as scientific writing, large scale code generation, and multi turn long context dialogue. Overall, our results indicate that incorporating structured sparsity into diffusion models is a promising direction for efficient and expressive long text generation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>6G networks promise to be the proper technology to support a wide deployment of highly demanding services, satisfying key users-related aspects such as extremely high quality, and persistent communications. However, there is no service to support if the network is not reliable enough. In this direction, it is with no doubt that security guarantees become a must. Traditional security approaches have focused on providing specific and attack-tailored solutions that will not properly meet the uncertainties driven by a technology yet under development and showing an attack surface not completely identified either. In this positioning paper we propose a softwarized solution, defining a Security Plane built on a top of programmable and adaptable set of live Security Functions under a proactive strategy. In addition, in order to address the inaccuracies driven by the predictive models a pre-assessment scenario is also considered ensuring that no action will be deployed if not previously verified. Although more efforts are required to develop this initiative, we think that such a shift paradigm is the only way to face security provisioning challenges in 6G ecosystems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In recent years, the development of multimodal autoencoders has gained significant attention due to their potential to handle multimodal complex data types and improve model performance. Understanding the stability and robustness of these models is crucial for optimizing their training, architecture, and real-world applicability. This paper presents an analysis of Lipschitz properties in multimodal autoencoders, combining both theoretical insights and empirical validation to enhance the training stability of these models. We begin by deriving the theoretical Lipschitz constants for aggregation methods within the multimodal autoencoder framework. We then introduce a regularized attention-based fusion method, developed based on our theoretical analysis, which demonstrates improved stability and performance during training. Through a series of experiments, we empirically validate our theoretical findings by estimating the Lipschitz constants across multiple trials and fusion strategies. Our results demonstrate that our proposed fusion function not only aligns with theoretical predictions but also outperforms existing strategies in terms of consistency, convergence speed, and accuracy. This work provides a solid theoretical foundation for understanding fusion in multimodal autoencoders and contributes a solution for enhancing their performance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Ensuring the safety and efficiency of AI systems is a central goal of modern research. Formal verification provides guarantees of neural network robustness, while early exits improve inference efficiency by enabling intermediate predictions. Yet verifying networks with early exits introduces new challenges due to their conditional execution paths. In this work, we define a robustness property tailored to early exit architectures and show how off-the-shelf solvers can be used to assess it. We present a baseline algorithm, enhanced with an early stopping strategy and heuristic optimizations that maintain soundness and completeness. Experiments on multiple benchmarks validate our framework's effectiveness and demonstrate the performance gains of the improved algorithm. Alongside the natural inference acceleration provided by early exits, we show that they also enhance verifiability, enabling more queries to be solved in less time compared to standard networks. Together with a robustness analysis, we show how these metrics can help users navigate the inherent trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Tokenizers provide the fundamental basis through which text is represented and processed by language models (LMs). Despite the importance of tokenization, its role in LM performance and behavior is poorly understood due to the challenge of measuring the impact of tokenization in isolation. To address this need, we present TokSuite, a collection of models and a benchmark that supports research into tokenization's influence on LMs. Specifically, we train fourteen models that use different tokenizers but are otherwise identical using the same architecture, dataset, training budget, and initialization. Additionally, we curate and release a new benchmark that specifically measures model performance subject to real-world perturbations that are likely to influence tokenization. Together, TokSuite allows robust decoupling of the influence of a model's tokenizer, supporting a series of novel findings that elucidate the respective benefits and shortcomings of a wide range of popular tokenizers.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks. Yet, the conditions under which RLVR yields robust generalization remain poorly understood. This paper provides an empirical study of RLVR generalization in the setting of probabilistic inference over causal graphical models. This setting offers two natural axes along which to examine generalization: (i) the level of the probabilistic query -- associational, interventional, or counterfactual -- and (ii) the structural complexity of the query, measured by the size of its relevant subgraph. We construct datasets of causal graphs and queries spanning these difficulty axes and fine-tune Qwen-2.5-Instruct models using RLVR or supervised fine-tuning (SFT). We vary both the model scale (3B-32B) and the query level included in training. We find that RLVR yields stronger within-level and across-level generalization than SFT, but only for specific combinations of model size and training query level. Further analysis shows that RLVR's effectiveness depends on the model's initial reasoning competence. With sufficient initial competence, RLVR improves an LLM's marginalization strategy and reduces errors in intermediate probability calculations, producing substantial accuracy gains, particularly on more complex queries. These findings show that RLVR can improve specific causal reasoning subskills, with its benefits emerging only when the model has sufficient initial competence.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The matrix exponential is a fundamental operator in scientific computing and system simulation, with applications ranging from control theory and quantum mechanics to modern generative machine learning. While Padé approximants combined with scaling and squaring have long served as the standard, recent Taylor-based methods, which utilize polynomial evaluation schemes that surpass the classical Paterson--Stockmeyer technique, offer superior accuracy and reduced computational complexity. This paper presents an optimized Taylor-based algorithm for the matrix exponential, specifically designed for the high-throughput requirements of generative AI flows. We provide a rigorous error analysis and develop a dynamic selection strategy for the Taylor order and scaling factor to minimize computational effort under a prescribed error tolerance. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that our approach provides significant acceleration and maintains high numerical stability compared to existing state-of-the-art implementations. These results establish the proposed method as a highly efficient tool for large-scale generative modeling.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent work has explored the use of large language models for generating tutoring responses in mathematics, yet it remains unclear how closely their instructional behavior aligns with expert human practice. We examine this question using a controlled, turn-level comparison in which expert human tutors, novice human tutors, and multiple large language models respond to the same set of math remediation conversation turns. We examine both instructional strategies and linguistic characteristics of tutoring responses, including restating and revoicing, pressing for accuracy, lexical diversity, readability, politeness, and agency. We find that large language models approach expert levels of perceived pedagogical quality on average but exhibit systematic differences in their instructional and linguistic profiles. In particular, large language models tend to underuse restating and revoicing strategies characteristic of expert human tutors, while producing longer, more lexically diverse, and more polite responses. Statistical analyses show that restating and revoicing, lexical diversity, and pressing for accuracy are positively associated with perceived pedagogical quality, whereas higher levels of agentic and polite language are negatively associated. Overall, recent large language models exhibit levels of perceived pedagogical quality comparable to expert human tutors, while relying on different instructional and linguistic strategies. These findings underscore the value of analyzing instructional strategies and linguistic characteristics when evaluating tutoring responses across human tutors and intelligent tutoring systems.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Breast ultrasound (BUS) segmentation provides lesion boundaries essential for computer-aided diagnosis and treatment planning. While promptable methods can improve segmentation performance and tumor delineation when text or spatial prompts are available, many public BUS datasets lack reliable metadata or reports, constraining training to small multimodal subsets and reducing robustness. We propose NullBUS, a multimodal mixed-supervision framework that learns from images with and without prompts in a single model. To handle missing text, we introduce nullable prompts, implemented as learnable null embeddings with presence masks, enabling fallback to image-only evidence when metadata are absent and the use of text when present. Evaluated on a unified pool of three public BUS datasets, NullBUS achieves a mean IoU of 0.8568 and a mean Dice of 0.9103, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance under mixed prompt availability.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Machine learning models have become firmly established across all scientific fields. Extracting features from data and making inferences based on them with neural network models often yields high accuracy; however, this approach has several drawbacks. Symbolic regression is a powerful technique for discovering analytical equations that describe data, providing interpretable and generalizable models capable of predicting unseen data. Symbolic regression methods have gained new momentum with the advancement of neural network technologies and offer several advantages, the main one being the interpretability of results. In this work, we examined the application of the deep symbolic regression algorithm SEGVAE to determine the properties of two-dimensional materials with defects. Comparing the results with state-of-the-art graph neural network-based methods shows comparable or, in some cases, even identical outcomes. We also discuss the applicability of this class of methods in natural sciences.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Machine unlearning aims to remove unwanted information from a model, but many methods are inefficient for LLMs with large numbers of parameters or fail to fully remove the intended information without degrading performance on knowledge that should be retained. Model editing algorithms solve a similar problem of changing information in models, but they focus on redirecting inputs to a new target rather than removing that information altogether. In this work, we explore the editing algorithms ROME, IKE, and WISE and design new editing targets for an unlearning setting. Through this investigation, we show that model editing approaches can exceed baseline unlearning methods in terms of quality of forgetting depending on the setting. Like traditional unlearning techniques, they struggle to encapsulate the scope of what is to be unlearned without damage to the overall model performance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in situations where human values are at stake, such as decision-making tasks that involve reasoning when performed by humans. We investigate the so-called reasoning capabilities of LLMs over novel symbolic representations by introducing an experimental framework that tests their ability to process and manipulate unfamiliar symbols. We introduce semantic deceptions: situations in which symbols carry misleading semantic associations due to their form, such as being embedded in specific contexts, designed to probe whether LLMs can maintain symbolic abstraction or whether they default to exploiting learned semantic associations. We redefine standard digits and mathematical operators using novel symbols, and task LLMs with solving simple calculations expressed in this altered notation. The objective is: (1) to assess LLMs' capacity for abstraction and manipulation of arbitrary symbol systems; (2) to evaluate their ability to resist misleading semantic cues that conflict with the task's symbolic logic. Through experiments with four LLMs we show that semantic cues can significantly deteriorate reasoning models' performance on very simple tasks. They reveal limitations in current LLMs' ability for symbolic manipulations and highlight a tendency to over-rely on surface-level semantics, suggesting that chain-of-thoughts may amplify reliance on statistical correlations. Even in situations where LLMs seem to correctly follow instructions, semantic cues still impact basic capabilities. These limitations raise ethical and societal concerns, undermining the widespread and pernicious tendency to attribute reasoning abilities to LLMs and suggesting how LLMs might fail, in particular in decision-making contexts where robust symbolic reasoning is essential and should not be compromised by residual semantic associations inherited from the model's training.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As wildfires increasingly evolve into urban conflagrations, traditional risk models that treat structures as isolated assets fail to capture the non-linear contagion dynamics characteristic of the wildland urban interface (WUI). This research bridges the gap between mechanistic physics and data driven learning by establishing a novel dual specialist ensemble framework that disentangles vulnerability into two distinct vectors, environmental contagion and structural fragility. The architecture integrates two specialized predictive streams, an environmental specialist, implemented as a graph neural network (GNN) that operationalizes the community as a directed contagion graph weighted by physics informed convection, radiation, and ember probabilities, and enriched with high dimensional Google AlphaEarth Foundation embeddings, and a Structural Specialist, implemented via XGBoost to isolate granular asset level resilience. Applied to the 2025 Eaton Fire, the framework reveals a critical dichotomy in risk drivers. The GNN demonstrates that neighborhood scale environmental pressure overwhelmingly dominates intrinsic structural features in defining propagation pathways, while the XGBoost model identifies eaves as the primary micro scale ingress vector. By synthesizing these divergent signals through logistic stacking, the ensemble achieves robust classification and generates a diagnostic risk topology. This capability empowers decision makers to move beyond binary loss prediction and precisely target mitigation prioritizing vegetation management for high connectivity clusters and structural hardening for architecturally vulnerable nodes thereby operationalizing a proactive, data driven approach to community resilience.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper introduces \texttt{FedMPDD} (\textbf{Fed}erated Learning via \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{P}rojected \textbf{D}irectional \textbf{D}erivatives), a novel algorithm that simultaneously optimizes bandwidth utilization and enhances privacy in Federated Learning. The core idea of \texttt{FedMPDD} is to encode each client's high-dimensional gradient by computing its directional derivatives along multiple random vectors. This compresses the gradient into a much smaller message, significantly reducing uplink communication costs from $\mathcal{O}(d)$ to $\mathcal{O}(m)$, where $m \ll d$. The server then decodes the aggregated information by projecting it back onto the same random vectors. Our key insight is that averaging multiple projections overcomes the dimension-dependent convergence limitations of a single projection. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis, establishing that \texttt{FedMPDD} converges at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})$, matching the performance of FedSGD. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method provides some inherent privacy against gradient inversion attacks due to the geometric properties of low-rank projections, offering a tunable privacy-utility trade-off controlled by the number of projections. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate our theory and demonstrates our results.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Traditional autonomous driving pipelines decouple camera design from downstream perception, relying on fixed optics and handcrafted ISPs that prioritize human viewable imagery rather than machine semantics. This separation discards information during demosaicing, denoising, or quantization, while forcing models to adapt to sensor artifacts. We present a task-driven co-design framework that unifies optics, sensor modeling, and lightweight semantic segmentation networks into a single end-to-end RAW-to-task pipeline. Building on DeepLens[19], our system integrates realistic cellphone-scale lens models, learnable color filter arrays, Poisson-Gaussian noise processes, and quantization, all optimized directly for segmentation objectives. Evaluations on KITTI-360 show consistent mIoU improvements over fixed pipelines, with optics modeling and CFA learning providing the largest gains, especially for thin or low-light-sensitive classes. Importantly, these robustness gains are achieved with a compact ~1M-parameter model running at ~28 FPS, demonstrating edge deployability. Visual and quantitative analyses further highlight how co-designed sensors adapt acquisition to semantic structure, sharpening boundaries and maintaining accuracy under blur, noise, and low bit-depth. Together, these findings establish full-stack co-optimization of optics, sensors, and networks as a principled path toward efficient, reliable, and deployable perception in autonomous systems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Understanding how automated grading systems evaluate essays remains a significant challenge for educators and students, especially when large language models function as black boxes. We introduce EssayCBM, a rubric-aligned framework that prioritizes interpretability in essay assessment. Instead of predicting grades directly from text, EssayCBM evaluates eight writing concepts, such as Thesis Clarity and Evidence Use, through dedicated prediction heads on an encoder. These concept scores form a transparent bottleneck, and a lightweight network computes the final grade using only concepts. Instructors can adjust concept predictions and instantly view the updated grade, enabling accountable human-in-the-loop evaluation. EssayCBM matches black-box performance while offering actionable, concept-level feedback through an intuitive web interface.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>defense, attack, robust, steal</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Machine learning is a powerful tool enabling full automation of a huge number of tasks without explicit programming. Despite recent progress of machine learning in different domains, these models have shown vulnerabilities when they are exposed to adversarial threats. Adversarial threats aim to hinder the machine learning models from satisfying their objectives. They can create adversarial perturbations, which are imperceptible to humans' eyes but have the ability to cause misclassification during inference. Moreover, they can poison the training data to harm the model's performance or they can query the model to steal its sensitive information. In this paper, we propose a defense system, which devises an adversarial training module within mixture-of-experts architecture to enhance its robustness against adversarial threats. In our proposed defense system, we use nine pre-trained experts with ResNet-18 as their backbone. During end-to-end training, the parameters of expert models and gating mechanism are jointly updated allowing further optimization of the experts. Our proposed defense system outperforms state-of-the-art defense systems and plain classifiers, which use a more complex architecture than our model's backbone.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to medicine, yet their adoption is limited by concerns over reliability and safety. Existing evaluations either test factual medical knowledge in isolation or assess patient-level reasoning without verifying correctness, leaving a critical gap. We introduce MediEval, a benchmark that links MIMIC-IV electronic health records (EHRs) to a unified knowledge base built from UMLS and other biomedical vocabularies. MediEval generates diverse factual and counterfactual medical statements within real patient contexts, enabling systematic evaluation across a 4-quadrant framework that jointly considers knowledge grounding and contextual consistency. Using this framework, we identify critical failure modes, including hallucinated support and truth inversion, that current proprietary, open-source, and domain-specific LLMs frequently exhibit. To address these risks, we propose Counterfactual Risk-Aware Fine-tuning (CoRFu), a DPO-based method with an asymmetric penalty targeting unsafe confusions. CoRFu improves by +16.4 macro-F1 points over the base model and eliminates truth inversion errors, demonstrating both higher accuracy and substantially greater safety.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce the Nemotron 3 family of models - Nano, Super, and Ultra. These models deliver strong agentic, reasoning, and conversational capabilities. The Nemotron 3 family uses a Mixture-of-Experts hybrid Mamba-Transformer architecture to provide best-in-class throughput and context lengths of up to 1M tokens. Super and Ultra models are trained with NVFP4 and incorporate LatentMoE, a novel approach that improves model quality. The two larger models also include MTP layers for faster text generation. All Nemotron 3 models are post-trained using multi-environment reinforcement learning enabling reasoning, multi-step tool use, and support granular reasoning budget control. Nano, the smallest model, outperforms comparable models in accuracy while remaining extremely cost-efficient for inference. Super is optimized for collaborative agents and high-volume workloads such as IT ticket automation. Ultra, the largest model, provides state-of-the-art accuracy and reasoning performance. Nano is released together with its technical report and this white paper, while Super and Ultra will follow in the coming months. We will openly release the model weights, pre- and post-training software, recipes, and all data for which we hold redistribution rights.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Traditional lecture videos offer flexibility but lack mechanisms for real-time clarification, forcing learners to search externally when confusion arises. Recent advances in large language models and neural avatars provide new opportunities for interactive learning, yet existing systems typically lack lecture awareness, rely on cloud-based services, or fail to integrate retrieval and avatar-delivered explanations in a unified, privacy-preserving pipeline. We present ALIVE, an Avatar-Lecture Interactive Video Engine that transforms passive lecture viewing into a dynamic, real-time learning experience. ALIVE operates fully on local hardware and integrates (1) Avatar-delivered lecture generated through ASR transcription, LLM refinement, and neural talking-head synthesis; (2) A content-aware retrieval mechanism that combines semantic similarity with timestamp alignment to surface contextually relevant lecture segments; and (3) Real-time multimodal interaction, enabling students to pause the lecture, ask questions through text or voice, and receive grounded explanations either as text or as avatar-delivered responses. To maintain responsiveness, ALIVE employs lightweight embedding models, FAISS-based retrieval, and segmented avatar synthesis with progressive preloading. We demonstrate the system on a complete medical imaging course, evaluate its retrieval accuracy, latency characteristics, and user experience, and show that ALIVE provides accurate, content-aware, and engaging real-time support. ALIVE illustrates how multimodal AI-when combined with content-aware retrieval and local deployment-can significantly enhance the pedagogical value of recorded lectures, offering an extensible pathway toward next-generation interactive learning environments.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in transformer-based foundation models have made them the default choice for many tasks, but their rapidly growing size makes fitting a full model on a single GPU increasingly difficult and their computational cost prohibitive. Block low-rank (BLR) compression techniques address this challenge by learning compact representations of weight matrices. While traditional low-rank (LR) methods often incur sharp accuracy drops, BLR approaches such as Monarch and BLAST can better capture the underlying structure, thus preserving accuracy while reducing computations and memory footprints. In this work, we use roofline analysis to show that, although BLR methods achieve theoretical savings and practical speedups for single-token inference, multi-token inference often becomes memory-bound in practice, increasing latency despite compiler-level optimizations in PyTorch. To address this, we introduce custom Triton kernels with partial fusion and memory layout optimizations for both Monarch and BLAST. On memory-constrained NVIDIA GPUs such as Jetson Orin Nano and A40, our kernels deliver up to $3.76\times$ speedups and $3\times$ model size compression over PyTorch dense baselines using CUDA backend and compiler-level optimizations, while supporting various models including Llama-7/1B, GPT2-S, DiT-XL/2, and ViT-B.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>defense, attack, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The increasing use of machine learning in safety-critical domains amplifies the risk of adversarial threats, especially data poisoning attacks that corrupt training data to degrade performance or induce unsafe behavior. Most existing defenses lack formal guarantees or rely on restrictive assumptions about the model class, attack type, extent of poisoning, or point-wise certification, limiting their practical reliability. This paper introduces a principled formal robustness certification framework that models gradient-based training as a discrete-time dynamical system (dt-DS) and formulates poisoning robustness as a formal safety verification problem. By adapting the concept of barrier certificates (BCs) from control theory, we introduce sufficient conditions to certify a robust radius ensuring that the terminal model remains safe under worst-case ${\ell}_p$-norm based poisoning. To make this practical, we parameterize BCs as neural networks trained on finite sets of poisoned trajectories. We further derive probably approximately correct (PAC) bounds by solving a scenario convex program (SCP), which yields a confidence lower bound on the certified robustness radius generalizing beyond the training set. Importantly, our framework also extends to certification against test-time attacks, making it the first unified framework to provide formal guarantees in both training and test-time attack settings. Experiments on MNIST, SVHN, and CIFAR-10 show that our approach certifies non-trivial perturbation budgets while being model-agnostic and requiring no prior knowledge of the attack or contamination level.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>To address the issues of weak correlation between multi-view features, low recognition accuracy of small-scale targets, and insufficient robustness in complex scenarios in underground pipeline detection using 3D GPR, this paper proposes a 3D pipeline intelligent detection framework. First, based on a B/C/D-Scan three-view joint analysis strategy, a three-dimensional pipeline three-view feature evaluation method is established by cross-validating forward simulation results obtained using FDTD methods with actual measurement data. Second, the DCO-YOLO framework is proposed, which integrates DySample, CGLU, and OutlookAttention cross-dimensional correlation mechanisms into the original YOLOv11 algorithm, significantly improving the small-scale pipeline edge feature extraction capability. Furthermore, a 3D-DIoU spatial feature matching algorithm is proposed, which integrates three-dimensional geometric constraints and center distance penalty terms to achieve automated association of multi-view annotations. The three-view fusion strategy resolves inherent ambiguities in single-view detection. Experiments based on real urban underground pipeline data show that the proposed method achieves accuracy, recall, and mean average precision of 96.2%, 93.3%, and 96.7%, respectively, in complex multi-pipeline scenarios, which are 2.0%, 2.1%, and 0.9% higher than the baseline model. Ablation experiments validated the synergistic optimization effect of the dynamic feature enhancement module and Grad-CAM++ heatmap visualization demonstrated that the improved model significantly enhanced its ability to focus on pipeline geometric features. This study integrates deep learning optimization strategies with the physical characteristics of 3D GPR, offering an efficient and reliable novel technical framework for the intelligent recognition and localization of underground pipelines.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Implicit neural representations for videos (NeRV) have shown strong potential for video compression. However, applying NeRV to high-resolution 360-degree videos causes high memory usage and slow decoding, making real-time applications impractical. We propose NeRV360, an end-to-end framework that decodes only the user-selected viewport instead of reconstructing the entire panoramic frame. Unlike conventional pipelines, NeRV360 integrates viewport extraction into decoding and introduces a spatial-temporal affine transform module for conditional decoding based on viewpoint and time. Experiments on 6K-resolution videos show that NeRV360 achieves a 7-fold reduction in memory consumption and a 2.5-fold increase in decoding speed compared to HNeRV, a representative prior work, while delivering better image quality in terms of objective metrics.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present a systematic empirical study of small language models under strict compute constraints, analyzing how architectural choices and training budget interact to determine performance. Starting from a linear next-token predictor, we progressively introduce nonlinearities, self-attention, and multi-layer transformer architectures, evaluating each on character-level modeling of Tiny Shakespeare and word-level modeling of Penn Treebank (PTB) and WikiText-2. We compare models using test negative log-likelihood (NLL), parameter count, and approximate training FLOPs to characterize accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. Our results show that attention-based models dominate MLPs in per-FLOP efficiency even at small scale, while increasing depth or context without sufficient optimization can degrade performance. We further examine rotary positional embeddings (RoPE), finding that architectural techniques successful in large language models do not necessarily transfer to small-model regimes.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep clustering hinges on learning representations that are inherently clusterable. However, using a single encoder to produce a fixed embedding ignores the representation trajectory formed by a pretrained diffusion model across network hierarchies and noise timesteps, where clusterability varies substantially. We propose DiEC (Diffusion Embedded Clustering), which performs unsupervised clustering by directly reading internal activations from a pretrained diffusion U-Net. DiEC formulates representation selection as a two-dimensional search over layer x timestep, and exploits a weak-coupling property to decompose it into two stages. Specifically, we first fix the U-Net bottleneck layer as the Clustering-friendly Middle Layer (CML), and then use Optimal Timestep Search (OTS) to identify the clustering-optimal timestep (t*). During training, we extract bottleneck features at the fixed t* and obtain clustering representations via a lightweight residual mapping. We optimize a DEC-style KL self-training objective, augmented with adaptive graph regularization and entropy regularization to strengthen cluster structures. In parallel, we introduce a denoising-consistency branch at random timesteps to stabilize the representations and preserve generative consistency. Experiments show that DiEC achieves competitive clustering performance on multiple standard benchmarks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Full parameter fine tuning is a key technique for adapting large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks, but it incurs substantial memory overhead due to the need to cache extensive intermediate activations for backpropagation. This bottleneck makes full fine tuning of contemporary large scale LLMs challenging in practice. Existing distributed training frameworks such as DeepSpeed alleviate this issue using techniques like ZeRO and FSDP, which rely on multi GPU memory or CPU offloading, but often require additional hardware resources and reduce training speed. We introduce RevFFN, a memory efficient fine tuning paradigm for mixture of experts (MoE) LLMs. RevFFN employs carefully designed reversible Transformer blocks that allow reconstruction of layer input activations from outputs during backpropagation, eliminating the need to store most intermediate activations in memory. While preserving the expressive capacity of MoE architectures, this approach significantly reduces peak memory consumption for full parameter fine tuning. As a result, RevFFN enables efficient full fine tuning on a single consumer grade or server grade GPU.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Image fusion integrates complementary information from different modalities to generate high-quality fused images, thereby enhancing downstream tasks such as object detection and semantic segmentation. Unlike task-specific techniques that primarily focus on consolidating inter-modal information, general image fusion needs to address a wide range of tasks while improving performance without increasing complexity. To achieve this, we propose SMC-Mamba, a Self-supervised Multiplex Consensus Mamba framework for general image fusion. Specifically, the Modality-Agnostic Feature Enhancement (MAFE) module preserves fine details through adaptive gating and enhances global representations via spatial-channel and frequency-rotational scanning. The Multiplex Consensus Cross-modal Mamba (MCCM) module enables dynamic collaboration among experts, reaching a consensus to efficiently integrate complementary information from multiple modalities. The cross-modal scanning within MCCM further strengthens feature interactions across modalities, facilitating seamless integration of critical information from both sources. Additionally, we introduce a Bi-level Self-supervised Contrastive Learning Loss (BSCL), which preserves high-frequency information without increasing computational overhead while simultaneously boosting performance in downstream tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) image fusion algorithms in tasks such as infrared-visible, medical, multi-focus, and multi-exposure fusion, as well as downstream visual tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advancements in computer vision have successfully extended Open-vocabulary segmentation (OVS) to the 3D domain by leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS). Despite this progress, efficiently rendering the high-dimensional features required for open-vocabulary queries poses a significant challenge. Existing methods employ codebooks or feature compression, causing information loss, thereby degrading segmentation quality. To address this limitation, we introduce Quantile Rendering (Q-Render), a novel rendering strategy for 3D Gaussians that efficiently handles high-dimensional features while maintaining high fidelity. Unlike conventional volume rendering, which densely samples all 3D Gaussians intersecting each ray, Q-Render sparsely samples only those with dominant influence along the ray. By integrating Q-Render into a generalizable 3D neural network, we also propose Gaussian Splatting Network (GS-Net), which predicts Gaussian features in a generalizable manner. Extensive experiments on ScanNet and LeRF demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods, while enabling real-time rendering with an approximate ~43.7x speedup on 512-D feature maps. Code will be made publicly available.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>protect, explainability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper presents a marketing analytics framework that operationalizes subscription pricing as a dynamic, guardrailed decision system, uniting multivariate demand forecasting, segment-level price elasticity, and churn propensity to optimize revenue, margin, and retention. The approach blends seasonal time-series models with tree-based learners, runs Monte Carlo scenario tests to map risk envelopes, and solves a constrained optimization that enforces business guardrails on customer experience, margin floors, and allowable churn. Validated across heterogeneous SaaS portfolios, the method consistently outperforms static tiers and uniform uplifts by reallocating price moves toward segments with higher willingness-to-pay while protecting price-sensitive cohorts. The system is designed for real-time recalibration via modular APIs and includes model explainability for governance and compliance. Managerially, the framework functions as a strategy playbook that clarifies when to shift from flat to dynamic pricing, how to align pricing with CLV and MRR targets, and how to embed ethical guardrails, enabling durable growth without eroding customer trust.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Amodal completion, the task of inferring invisible object parts, faces significant challenges in maintaining semantic consistency and structural integrity. Prior progressive approaches are inherently limited by inference instability and error accumulation. To tackle these limitations, we present a Collaborative Multi-Agent Reasoning Framework that explicitly decouples Semantic Planning from Visual Synthesis. By employing specialized agents for upfront reasoning, our method generates a structured, explicit plan before pixel generation, enabling visually and semantically coherent single-pass synthesis. We integrate this framework with two critical mechanisms: (1) a self-correcting Verification Agent that employs Chain-of-Thought reasoning to rectify visible region segmentation and identify residual occluders strictly within the Semantic Planning phase, and (2) a Diverse Hypothesis Generator that addresses the ambiguity of invisible regions by offering diverse, plausible semantic interpretations, surpassing the limited pixel-level variations of standard random seed sampling. Furthermore, addressing the limitations of traditional metrics in assessing inferred invisible content, we introduce the MAC-Score (MLLM Amodal Completion Score), a novel human-aligned evaluation metric. Validated against human judgment and ground truth, these metrics establish a robust standard for assessing structural completeness and semantic consistency with visible context. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets. Our project is available at: this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid progress of generative models has intensified the need for reliable and robust detection under real-world conditions. However, existing detectors often overfit to generator-specific artifacts and remain highly sensitive to real-world degradations. As generative architectures evolve and images undergo multi-round cross-platform sharing and post-processing (chain degradations), these artifact cues become obsolete and harder to detect. To address this, we propose Real-centric Envelope Modeling (REM), a new paradigm that shifts detection from learning generator artifacts to modeling the robust distribution of real images. REM introduces feature-level perturbations in self-reconstruction to generate near-real samples, and employs an envelope estimator with cross-domain consistency to learn a boundary enclosing the real image manifold. We further build RealChain, a comprehensive benchmark covering both open-source and commercial generators with simulated real-world degradation. Across eight benchmark evaluations, REM achieves an average improvement of 7.5% over state-of-the-art methods, and notably maintains exceptional generalization on the severely degraded RealChain benchmark, establishing a solid foundation for synthetic image detection under real-world conditions. The code and the RealChain benchmark will be made publicly available upon acceptance of the paper.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Data-driven surrogate models are increasingly adopted to accelerate vehicle design. However, open-source multi-fidelity datasets and empirical guidelines linking dataset size to model performance remain limited. This study investigates the relationship between training data size and prediction accuracy for a graph neural network (GNN) based surrogate model for aerodynamic field prediction. We release an open-source, multi-fidelity aerodynamic dataset for double-delta wings, comprising 2448 flow snapshots across 272 geometries evaluated at angles of attack from 11 (degree) to 19 (degree) at Ma=0.3 using both Vortex Lattice Method (VLM) and Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) solvers. The geometries are generated using a nested Saltelli sampling scheme to support future dataset expansion and variance-based sensitivity analysis. Using this dataset, we conduct a preliminary empirical scaling study of the MF-VortexNet surrogate by constructing six training datasets with sizes ranging from 40 to 1280 snapshots and training models with 0.1 to 2.4 million parameters under a fixed training budget. We find that the test error decreases with data size with a power-law exponent of -0.6122, indicating efficient data utilization. Based on this scaling law, we estimate that the optimal sampling density is approximately eight samples per dimension in a d-dimensional design space. The results also suggest improved data utilization efficiency for larger surrogate models, implying a potential trade-off between dataset generation cost and model training budget.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Neuropsychiatric disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), depression, and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), are characterized by linguistic and acoustic abnormalities, offering potential biomarkers for early detection. Despite the promise of multi-modal approaches, challenges like multi-lingual generalization and the absence of a unified evaluation framework persist. To address these gaps, we propose FEND (Foundation model-based Evaluation of Neuropsychiatric Disorders), a comprehensive multi-modal framework integrating speech and text modalities for detecting AD, depression, and ASD across the lifespan. Leveraging 13 multi-lingual datasets spanning English, Chinese, Greek, French, and Dutch, we systematically evaluate multi-modal fusion performance. Our results show that multi-modal fusion excels in AD and depression detection but underperforms in ASD due to dataset heterogeneity. We also identify modality imbalance as a prevalent issue, where multi-modal fusion fails to surpass the best mono-modal models. Cross-corpus experiments reveal robust performance in task- and language-consistent scenarios but noticeable degradation in multi-lingual and task-heterogeneous settings. By providing extensive benchmarks and a detailed analysis of performance-influencing factors, FEND advances the field of automated, lifespan-inclusive, and multi-lingual neuropsychiatric disorder assessment. We encourage researchers to adopt the FEND framework for fair comparisons and reproducible research.</li>

Current hallucination detection methods based on uncertainty estimation and external knowledge retrieval suffer from the limitation that they still produce erroneous content at high confidence levels and rely heavily on retrieval efficiency and knowledge coverage. In contrast, probe methods that leverage the model's hidden-layer states offer real-time and lightweight advantages. However, traditional linear probes struggle to capture nonlinear structures in deep semantic this http URL overcome these limitations, we propose a neural network-based framework for token-level hallucination detection. By freezing language model parameters, we employ lightweight MLP probes to perform nonlinear modeling of high-level hidden states. A multi-objective joint loss function is designed to enhance detection stability and semantic disambiguity. Additionally, we establish a layer position-probe performance response model, using Bayesian optimization to automatically search for optimal probe insertion layers and achieve superior training this http URL results on LongFact, HealthBench, and TriviaQA demonstrate that MLP probes significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, recall, and detection capability under low false-positive conditions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has significantly advanced task-solving capabilities in natural language processing with large language models. Unlike standard prompting, CoT encourages the model to generate intermediate reasoning steps, non-answer tokens, that help guide the model toward more accurate final outputs. These intermediate steps enable more complex reasoning processes such as error correction, memory management, future planning, and self-reflection. However, applying CoT to non-natural language domains, such as protein and RNA language models, is not yet possible, primarily due to the limited expressiveness of their token spaces (e.g., amino acid tokens). In this work, we propose and define the concept of language expressiveness: the ability of a given language, using its tokens and grammar, to encode information. We show that the limited expressiveness of protein language severely restricts the applicability of CoT-style reasoning. To overcome this, we introduce reflection pretraining, for the first time in a biological sequence model, which enables the model to engage in intermediate reasoning through the generation of auxiliary "thinking tokens" beyond simple answer tokens. Theoretically, we demonstrate that our augmented token set significantly enhances biological language expressiveness, thereby improving the overall reasoning capacity of the model. Experimentally, our pretraining approach teaches protein models to self-correct and leads to substantial performance gains compared to standard pretraining.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Data science plays a critical role in transforming complex data into actionable insights across numerous domains. Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) have significantly automated data science workflows, but a fundamental question persists: Can these agentic AI systems truly match the performance of human data scientists who routinely leverage domain-specific knowledge? We explore this question by designing a prediction task where a crucial latent variable is hidden in relevant image data instead of tabular features. As a result, agentic AI that generates generic codes for modeling tabular data cannot perform well, while human experts could identify the important hidden variable using domain knowledge. We demonstrate this idea with a synthetic dataset for property insurance. Our experiments show that agentic AI that relies on generic analytics workflow falls short of methods that use domain-specific insights. This highlights a key limitation of the current agentic AI for data science and underscores the need for future research to develop agentic AI systems that can better recognize and incorporate domain knowledge.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models excel at generating high-quality, diverse samples, yet they risk memorizing training data when overfit to the training objective. We analyze the distinctions between memorization and generalization in diffusion models through the lens of representation learning. By investigating a two-layer ReLU denoising autoencoder (DAE), we prove that (i) memorization corresponds to the model storing raw training samples in the learned weights for encoding and decoding, yielding localized "spiky" representations, whereas (ii) generalization arises when the model captures local data statistics, producing "balanced" representations. Furthermore, we validate these theoretical findings on real-world unconditional and text-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating that the same representation structures emerge in deep generative models with significant practical implications. Building on these insights, we propose a representation-based method for detecting memorization and a training-free editing technique that allows precise control via representation steering. Together, our results highlight that learning good representations is central to novel and meaningful generative modeling.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) refer to systems capable of perceiving their states and moving without human intervention. Among the factors required for autonomous decision-making in mobility, positional awareness of the vehicle itself is the most critical. Accordingly, extensive research has been conducted on defense mechanisms against GPS spoofing attacks, which threaten AVs by disrupting position recognition. Among these, detection methods based on internal IMU sensors are regarded as some of the most effective. In this paper, we propose a spoofing attack system designed to neutralize IMU sensor-based detection. First, we present an attack modeling approach for bypassing such detection. Then, based on EKF sensor fusion, we experimentally analyze both the impact of GPS spoofing values on the internal target system and how our proposed methodology reduces anomaly detection within the target system. To this end, this paper proposes an attack model that performs GPS spoofing by stealing internal dynamic state information using an external IMU sensor, and the experimental results demonstrate that attack values can be injected without being detected.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large-scale incremental mapping is fundamental to the development of robust and reliable autonomous systems, as it underpins incremental environmental understanding with sequential inputs for navigation and decision-making. LiDAR is widely used for this purpose due to its accuracy and robustness. Recently, neural LiDAR mapping has shown impressive performance; however, most approaches rely on dense implicit representations and underutilize geometric structure, while existing voxel-guided methods struggle to achieve real-time performance. To address these challenges, we propose XGrid-Mapping, a hybrid grid framework that jointly exploits explicit and implicit representations for efficient neural LiDAR mapping. Specifically, the strategy combines a sparse grid, providing geometric priors and structural guidance, with an implicit dense grid that enriches scene representation. By coupling the VDB structure with a submap-based organization, the framework reduces computational load and enables efficient incremental mapping on a large scale. To mitigate discontinuities across submaps, we introduce a distillation-based overlap alignment strategy, in which preceding submaps supervise subsequent ones to ensure consistency in overlapping regions. To further enhance robustness and sampling efficiency, we incorporate a dynamic removal module. Extensive experiments show that our approach delivers superior mapping quality while overcoming the efficiency limitations of voxel-guided methods, thereby outperforming existing state-of-the-art mapping methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Long-tailed pulmonary anomalies in chest radiography present formidable diagnostic challenges. Despite the recent strides in diffusion-based methods for enhancing the representation of tailed lesions, the paucity of rare lesion exemplars curtails the generative capabilities of these approaches, thereby leaving the diagnostic precision less than optimal. In this paper, we propose a novel data synthesis pipeline designed to augment tail lesions utilizing a copious supply of conventional normal X-rays. Specifically, a sufficient quantity of normal samples is amassed to train a diffusion model capable of generating normal X-ray images. This pre-trained diffusion model is subsequently utilized to inpaint the head lesions present in the diseased X-rays, thereby preserving the tail classes as augmented training data. Additionally, we propose the integration of a Large Language Model Knowledge Guidance (LKG) module alongside a Progressive Incremental Learning (PIL) strategy to stabilize the inpainting fine-tuning process. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on the public lung datasets MIMIC and CheXpert demonstrate that the proposed method sets a new benchmark in performance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated in clinical settings using multi-dimensional rubrics which quantify reasoning quality, safety, and patient-centeredness. Yet, replicating specific mistakes in other LLM models is not straightforward and often requires manual effort. We introduce MedMistake, an automatic pipeline that extracts mistakes LLMs make in patient-doctor conversations and converts them into a benchmark of single-shot QA pairs. Our pipeline (1) creates complex, conversational data between an LLM patient and LLM doctor, (2) runs an evaluation with a committee of 2 LLM judges across a variety of dimensions and (3) creates simplified single-shot QA scenarios from those mistakes. We release MedMistake-All, a dataset of 3,390 single-shot QA pairs where GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5 Pro are currently failing to answer correctly, as judged by two LLM judges. We used medical experts to validate a subset of 211/3390 questions (MedMistake-Bench), which we used to run a final evaluation of 12 frontier LLMs: Claude Opus 4.5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, DeepSeek-Chat, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Gemini 3 Pro, GPT-4o, GPT-5, GPT-5.1, GPT-5.2, Grok 4, Grok 4.1, Mistral Large. We found that GPT models, Claude and Grok obtained the best performance on MedMistake-Bench. We release both the doctor-validated benchmark (MedMistake-Bench), as well as the full dataset (MedMistake-All) at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, security, protect, defense, attack, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into wearable sensing is creating a new class of mobile applications capable of nuanced human activity understanding. However, the reliability of these systems is critically undermined by their vulnerability to prompt injection attacks, where attackers deliberately input deceptive instructions into LLMs. Traditional defenses, based on static filters and rigid rules, are insufficient to address the semantic complexity of these new attacks. We argue that a paradigm shift is needed -- from passive filtering to active protection and autonomous reasoning. We introduce AegisAgent, an autonomous agent system designed to ensure the security of LLM-driven HAR systems. Instead of merely blocking threats, AegisAgent functions as a cognitive guardian. It autonomously perceives potential semantic inconsistencies, reasons about the user's true intent by consulting a dynamic memory of past interactions, and acts by generating and executing a multi-step verification and repair plan. We implement AegisAgent as a lightweight, full-stack prototype and conduct a systematic evaluation on 15 common attacks with five state-of-the-art LLM-based HAR systems on three public datasets. Results show it reduces attack success rate by 30\% on average while incurring only 78.6 ms of latency overhead on a GPU workstation. Our work makes the first step towards building secure and trustworthy LLM-driven HAR systems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in generative modeling have demonstrated strong promise for high-quality point cloud upsampling. In this work, we present PUFM++, an enhanced flow-matching framework for reconstructing dense and accurate point clouds from sparse, noisy, and partial observations. PUFM++ improves flow matching along three key axes: (i) geometric fidelity, (ii) robustness to imperfect input, and (iii) consistency with downstream surface-based tasks. We introduce a two-stage flow-matching strategy that first learns a direct, straight-path flow from sparse inputs to dense targets, and then refines it using noise-perturbed samples to approximate the terminal marginal distribution better. To accelerate and stabilize inference, we propose a data-driven adaptive time scheduler that improves sampling efficiency based on interpolation behavior. We further impose on-manifold constraints during sampling to ensure that generated points remain aligned with the underlying surface. Finally, we incorporate a recurrent interface network~(RIN) to strengthen hierarchical feature interactions and boost reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real-world scans show that PUFM++ sets a new state of the art in point cloud upsampling, delivering superior visual fidelity and quantitative accuracy across a wide range of tasks.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we propose a novel approach for the optimal identification of correlated segments in noisy correlation matrices. The proposed model is known as CoSeNet (Correlation Seg-mentation Network) and is based on a four-layer algorithmic architecture that includes several processing layers: input, formatting, re-scaling, and segmentation layer. The proposed model can effectively identify correlated segments in such matrices, better than previous approaches for similar problems. Internally, the proposed model utilizes an overlapping technique and uses pre-trained Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, which makes it robust and generalizable. CoSeNet approach also includes a method that optimizes the parameters of the re-scaling layer using a heuristic algorithm and fitness based on a Window Difference-based metric. The output of the model is a binary noise-free matrix representing optimal segmentation as well as its seg-mentation points and can be used in a variety of applications, obtaining compromise solutions between efficiency, memory, and speed of the proposed deployment model.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Distilling the reasoning capabilities from a large language model (LLM) to a smaller student model often involves training on substantial amounts of reasoning data. However, distillation over lengthy sequences with prompt (P), chain-of-thought (CoT), and answer (A) segments makes the process computationally expensive. In this work, we investigate how the allocation of supervision across different segments (P, CoT, A) affects student performance. Our analysis shows that selective knowledge distillation over only the CoT tokens can be effective when the prompt and answer information is encompassed by it. Building on this insight, we establish a truncation protocol to quantify computation-quality tradeoffs as a function of sequence length. We observe that training on only the first $50\%$ of tokens of every training sequence can retain, on average, $\approx94\%$ of full-sequence performance on math benchmarks while reducing training time, memory usage, and FLOPs by about $50\%$ each. These findings suggest that reasoning distillation benefits from prioritizing early reasoning tokens and provides a simple lever for computation-quality tradeoffs.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multi-view inverse rendering aims to recover geometry, materials, and illumination consistently across multiple viewpoints. When applied to multi-view images, existing single-view approaches often ignore cross-view relationships, leading to inconsistent results. In contrast, multi-view optimization methods rely on slow differentiable rendering and per-scene refinement, making them computationally expensive and hard to scale. To address these limitations, we introduce a feed-forward multi-view inverse rendering framework that directly predicts spatially varying albedo, metallic, roughness, diffuse shading, and surface normals from sequences of RGB images. By alternating attention across views, our model captures both intra-view long-range lighting interactions and inter-view material consistency, enabling coherent scene-level reasoning within a single forward pass. Due to the scarcity of real-world training data, models trained on existing synthetic datasets often struggle to generalize to real-world scenes. To overcome this limitation, we propose a consistency-based finetuning strategy that leverages unlabeled real-world videos to enhance both multi-view coherence and robustness under in-the-wild conditions. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of multi-view consistency, material and normal estimation quality, and generalization to real-world imagery.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in pretraining general foundation models have significantly improved performance across diverse downstream tasks. While autoregressive (AR) generative models like GPT have revolutionized NLP, most visual generative pretraining methods still rely on BERT-style masked modeling, which often disregards the temporal information essential for video analysis. The few existing autoregressive visual pretraining methods suffer from issues such as inaccurate semantic localization and poor generation quality, leading to poor semantics. In this work, we propose NExT-Vid, a novel autoregressive visual generative pretraining framework that utilizes masked next-frame prediction to jointly model images and videos. NExT-Vid introduces a context-isolated autoregressive predictor to decouple semantic representation from target decoding, and a conditioned flow-matching decoder to enhance generation quality and diversity. Through context-isolated flow-matching pretraining, our approach achieves strong representations. Extensive experiments on large-scale pretrained models demonstrate that our proposed method consistently outperforms previous generative pretraining methods for visual representation learning via attentive probing in downstream classification.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have advanced the scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) by activating only a sparse subset of parameters per input, enabling state-of-the-art performance with reduced computational cost. As these models are increasingly deployed in critical domains, understanding and strengthening their alignment mechanisms is essential to prevent harmful outputs. However, existing LLM safety research has focused almost exclusively on dense architectures, leaving the unique safety properties of MoEs largely unexamined. The modular, sparsely-activated design of MoEs suggests that safety mechanisms may operate differently than in dense models, raising questions about their robustness. In this paper, we present GateBreaker, the first training-free, lightweight, and architecture-agnostic attack framework that compromises the safety alignment of modern MoE LLMs at inference time. GateBreaker operates in three stages: (i) gate-level profiling, which identifies safety experts disproportionately routed on harmful inputs, (ii) expert-level localization, which localizes the safety structure within safety experts, and (iii) targeted safety removal, which disables the identified safety structure to compromise the safety alignment. Our study shows that MoE safety concentrates within a small subset of neurons coordinated by sparse routing. Selective disabling of these neurons, approximately 3% of neurons in the targeted expert layers, significantly increases the averaged attack success rate (ASR) from 7.4% to 64.9% against the eight latest aligned MoE LLMs with limited utility degradation. These safety neurons transfer across models within the same family, raising ASR from 17.9% to 67.7% with one-shot transfer attack. Furthermore, GateBreaker generalizes to five MoE vision language models (VLMs) with 60.9% ASR on unsafe image inputs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) and diverse specialized benchmarks necessitates a shift from fragmented, task-specific metrics to a holistic, competitive ranking system that effectively aggregates performance across multiple ability dimensions. Primarily using static scoring, current evaluation methods are fundamentally limited. They struggle to determine the proper mix ratio across diverse benchmarks, and critically, they fail to capture a model's dynamic competitive fitness or its vulnerability when confronted with sequential, high-stakes tasks. To address this, we introduce the novel Competitive Swiss-System Dynamics (CSD) framework. CSD simulates a multi-round, sequential contest where models are dynamically paired across a curated sequence of benchmarks based on their accumulated win-loss record. And Monte Carlo Simulation ($N=100,000$ iterations) is used to approximate the statistically robust Expected Win Score ($E[S_m]$), which eliminates the noise of random pairing and early-round luck. Furthermore, we implement a Failure Sensitivity Analysis by parameterizing the per-round elimination quantity ($T_k$), which allows us to profile models based on their risk appetite--distinguishing between robust generalists and aggressive specialists. We demonstrate that CSD provides a more nuanced and context-aware ranking than traditional aggregate scoring and static pairwise models, representing a vital step towards risk-informed, next-generation LLM evaluation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep learning models have achieved remarkable success in computer vision, but they still rely heavily on large-scale labeled data and tend to overfit when data are limited or distributions shift. Data augmentation, particularly mask-based information dropping, can enhance robustness by forcing models to explore complementary cues; however, existing approaches often lack structural awareness and may discard essential semantics. We propose Granular-ball Guided Masking (GBGM), a structure-aware augmentation strategy guided by Granular-ball Computing (GBC). GBGM adaptively preserves semantically rich, structurally important regions while suppressing redundant areas through a coarse-to-fine hierarchical masking process, producing augmentations that are both representative and discriminative. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in classification accuracy and masked image reconstruction, confirming the effectiveness and broad applicability of the proposed method. Simple and model-agnostic, it integrates seamlessly into CNNs and Vision Transformers and provides a new paradigm for structure-aware data augmentation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large-scale text-to-image diffusion models have achieved unprecedented success in image generation and editing. However, extending this success to video editing remains challenging. Recent video editing efforts have adapted pretrained text-to-image models by adding temporal attention mechanisms to handle video tasks. Unfortunately, these methods continue to suffer from temporal inconsistency issues and high computational overheads. In this study, we propose FluencyVE, which is a simple yet effective one-shot video editing approach. FluencyVE integrates the linear time-series module, Mamba, into a video editing model based on pretrained Stable Diffusion models, replacing the temporal attention layer. This enables global frame-level attention while reducing the computational costs. In addition, we employ low-rank approximation matrices to replace the query and key weight matrices in the causal attention, and use a weighted averaging technique during training to update the attention scores. This approach significantly preserves the generative power of the text-to-image model while effectively reducing the computational burden. Experiments and analyses demonstrate promising results in editing various attributes, subjects, and locations in real-world videos.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) component has become significant for complex reasoning tasks. However, in conventional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), the model could allocate disproportionately more attention to CoT sequences with excessive length. This reduces focus on the much shorter but essential Key portion-the final answer, whose correctness directly determines task success and evaluation quality. To address this limitation, we propose SFTKey, a two-stage training scheme. In the first stage, conventional SFT is applied to ensure proper output format, while in the second stage, only the Key portion is fine-tuned to improve accuracy. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and model families demonstrate that SFTKey achieves an average accuracy improvement exceeding 5\% over conventional SFT, while preserving the ability to generate correct formats. Overall, this study advances LLM fine-tuning by explicitly balancing CoT learning with additional optimization on answer-relevant tokens.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>State-of-the-art 3D-field video-referenced Talking Face Generation (TFG) methods synthesize high-fidelity personalized talking-face videos in real time by modeling 3D geometry and appearance from reference portrait video. This capability raises significant privacy concerns regarding malicious misuse of personal portraits. However, no efficient defense framework exists to protect such videos against 3D-field TFG methods. While image-based defenses could apply per-frame 2D perturbations, they incur prohibitive computational costs, severe video quality degradation, failing to disrupt 3D information for video protection. To address this, we propose a novel and efficient video defense framework against 3D-field TFG methods, which protects portrait video by perturbing the 3D information acquisition process while maintain high-fidelity video quality. Specifically, our method introduces: (1) a similarity-guided parameter sharing mechanism for computational efficiency, and (2) a multi-scale dual-domain attention module to jointly optimize spatial-frequency perturbations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework exhibits strong defense capability and achieves a 47x acceleration over the fastest baseline while maintaining high fidelity. Moreover, it remains robust against scaling operations and state-of-the-art purification attacks, and the effectiveness of our design choices is further validated through ablation studies.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Modern surveillance systems increasingly rely on multi-wavelength sensors and deep neural networks to recognize faces in infrared images captured at night. However, most facial recognition models are trained on visible light datasets, leading to substantial performance degradation on infrared inputs due to significant domain shifts. Early feature-based methods for infrared face recognition proved ineffective, prompting researchers to adopt generative approaches that convert infrared images into visible light images for improved recognition. This paradigm, known as Heterogeneous Face Recognition (HFR), faces challenges such as model and modality discrepancies, leading to distortion and feature loss in generated images. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a novel latent diffusion-based model designed to generate high-quality visible face images from thermal inputs while preserving critical identity features. A multi-attribute classifier is incorporated to extract key facial attributes from visible images, mitigating feature loss during infrared-to-visible image restoration. Additionally, we propose the Self-attn Mamba module, which enhances global modeling of cross-modal features and significantly improves inference speed. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both image quality and identity preservation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, privacy, membership infer, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Healthcare AI needs large, diverse datasets, yet strict privacy and governance constraints prevent raw data sharing across institutions. Federated learning (FL) mitigates this by training where data reside and exchanging only model updates, but practical deployments still face two core risks: (1) privacy leakage via gradients or updates (membership inference, gradient inversion) and (2) trust in the aggregator, a single point of failure that can drop, alter, or inject contributions undetected. We present zkFL-Health, an architecture that combines FL with zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) and Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to deliver privacy-preserving, verifiably correct collaborative training for medical AI. Clients locally train and commit their updates; the aggregator operates within a TEE to compute the global update and produces a succinct ZK proof (via Halo2/Nova) that it used exactly the committed inputs and the correct aggregation rule, without revealing any client update to the host. Verifier nodes validate the proof and record cryptographic commitments on-chain, providing an immutable audit trail and removing the need to trust any single party. We outline system and threat models tailored to healthcare, the zkFL-Health protocol, security/privacy guarantees, and a performance evaluation plan spanning accuracy, privacy risk, latency, and cost. This framework enables multi-institutional medical AI with strong confidentiality, integrity, and auditability, key properties for clinical adoption and regulatory compliance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Object pose tracking is one of the pivotal technologies in multimedia, attracting ever-growing attention in recent years. Existing methods employing traditional cameras encounter numerous challenges such as motion blur, sensor noise, partial occlusion, and changing lighting conditions. The emerging bio-inspired sensors, particularly event cameras, possess advantages such as high dynamic range and low latency, which hold the potential to address the aforementioned challenges. In this work, we present an optical flow-guided 6DoF object pose tracking method with an event camera. A 2D-3D hybrid feature extraction strategy is firstly utilized to detect corners and edges from events and object models, which characterizes object motion precisely. Then, we search for the optical flow of corners by maximizing the event-associated probability within a spatio-temporal window, and establish the correlation between corners and edges guided by optical flow. Furthermore, by minimizing the distances between corners and edges, the 6DoF object pose is iteratively optimized to achieve continuous pose tracking. Experimental results of both simulated and real events demonstrate that our methods outperform event-based state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and robustness.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The trend in sign language generation is centered around data-driven generative methods that require vast amounts of precise 2D and 3D human pose data to achieve an acceptable generation quality. However, currently, most sign language datasets are video-based and limited to automatically reconstructed 2D human poses (i.e., keypoints) and lack accurate 3D information. Furthermore, existing state-of-the-art for automatic 3D human pose estimation from sign language videos is prone to self-occlusion, noise, and motion blur effects, resulting in poor reconstruction quality. In response to this, we introduce DexAvatar, a novel framework to reconstruct bio-mechanically accurate fine-grained hand articulations and body movements from in-the-wild monocular sign language videos, guided by learned 3D hand and body priors. DexAvatar achieves strong performance in the SGNify motion capture dataset, the only benchmark available for this task, reaching an improvement of 35.11% in the estimation of body and hand poses compared to the state-of-the-art.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In computational pathology, understanding and generation have evolved along disparate paths: advanced understanding models already exhibit diagnostic-level competence, whereas generative models largely simulate pixels. Progress remains hindered by three coupled factors: the scarcity of large, high-quality image-text corpora; the lack of precise, fine-grained semantic control, which forces reliance on non-semantic cues; and terminological heterogeneity, where diverse phrasings for the same diagnostic concept impede reliable text conditioning. We introduce UniPath, a semantics-driven pathology image generation framework that leverages mature diagnostic understanding to enable controllable generation. UniPath implements Multi-Stream Control: a Raw-Text stream; a High-Level Semantics stream that uses learnable queries to a frozen pathology MLLM to distill paraphrase-robust Diagnostic Semantic Tokens and to expand prompts into diagnosis-aware attribute bundles; and a Prototype stream that affords component-level morphological control via a prototype bank. On the data front, we curate a 2.65M image-text corpus and a finely annotated, high-quality 68K subset to alleviate data scarcity. For a comprehensive assessment, we establish a four-tier evaluation hierarchy tailored to pathology. Extensive experiments demonstrate UniPath's SOTA performance, including a Patho-FID of 80.9 (51% better than the second-best) and fine-grained semantic control achieving 98.7% of the real-image. The meticulously curated datasets, complete source code, and pre-trained model weights developed in this study will be made openly accessible to the public.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Visual Place Recognition (VPR) has been traditionally formulated as a single-image retrieval task. Using multiple views offers clear advantages, yet this setting remains relatively underexplored and existing methods often struggle to generalize across diverse environments. In this work we introduce UniPR-3D, the first VPR architecture that effectively integrates information from multiple views. UniPR-3D builds on a VGGT backbone capable of encoding multi-view 3D representations, which we adapt by designing feature aggregators and fine-tune for the place recognition task. To construct our descriptor, we jointly leverage the 3D tokens and intermediate 2D tokens produced by VGGT. Based on their distinct characteristics, we design dedicated aggregation modules for 2D and 3D features, allowing our descriptor to capture fine-grained texture cues while also reasoning across viewpoints. To further enhance generalization, we incorporate both single- and multi-frame aggregation schemes, along with a variable-length sequence retrieval strategy. Our experiments show that UniPR-3D sets a new state of the art, outperforming both single- and multi-view baselines and highlighting the effectiveness of geometry-grounded tokens for VPR.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The extraction and use of diverse knowledge from numerous documents is a pressing challenge in intelligent information retrieval. Documents contain elements that require different recognition methods. Table recognition typically consists of three subtasks, namely table structure, cell position and cell content recognition. Recent models have achieved excellent recognition with a combination of multi-task learning, local attention, and mutual learning. However, their effectiveness has not been fully explained, and they require a long period of time for inference. This paper presents a novel multi-task model that utilizes non-causal attention to capture the entire table structure, and a parallel inference algorithm for faster cell content inference. The superiority is demonstrated both visually and statistically on two large public datasets.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text and formulas constitute the core informational components of many documents. Accurately and efficiently recognizing both is crucial for developing robust and generalizable document parsing systems. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive unified recognition of text and formulas. However, they are large-sized and computationally demanding, restricting their usage in many applications. In this paper, we propose UniRec-0.1B, a unified recognition model with only 0.1B parameters. It is capable of performing text and formula recognition at multiple levels, including characters, words, lines, paragraphs, and documents. To implement this task, we first establish UniRec40M, a large-scale dataset comprises 40 million text, formula and their mix samples, enabling the training of a powerful yet lightweight model. Secondly, we identify two challenges when building such a lightweight but unified expert model. They are: structural variability across hierarchies and semantic entanglement between textual and formulaic content. To tackle these, we introduce a hierarchical supervision training that explicitly guides structural comprehension, and a semantic-decoupled tokenizer that separates text and formula representations. Finally, we develop a comprehensive evaluation benchmark covering Chinese and English documents from multiple domains and with multiple levels. Experimental results on this and public benchmarks demonstrate that UniRec-0.1B outperforms both general-purpose VLMs and leading document parsing expert models, while achieving a 2-9$\times$ speedup, validating its effectiveness and efficiency.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text-guided image inpainting endeavors to generate new content within specified regions of images using textual prompts from users. The primary challenge is to accurately align the inpainted areas with the user-provided prompts while maintaining a high degree of visual fidelity. While existing inpainting methods have produced visually convincing results by leveraging the pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, they still struggle to uphold both prompt alignment and visual rationality simultaneously. In this work, we introduce FreeInpaint, a plug-and-play tuning-free approach that directly optimizes the diffusion latents on the fly during inference to improve the faithfulness of the generated images. Technically, we introduce a prior-guided noise optimization method that steers model attention towards valid inpainting regions by optimizing the initial noise. Furthermore, we meticulously design a composite guidance objective tailored specifically for the inpainting task. This objective efficiently directs the denoising process, enhancing prompt alignment and visual rationality by optimizing intermediate latents at each step. Through extensive experiments involving various inpainting diffusion models and evaluation metrics, we demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed FreeInpaint.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Graph-structured data exhibit substantial heterogeneity in where their predictive signals originate: in some domains, node-level semantics dominate, while in others, structural patterns play a central role. This structure-semantics heterogeneity implies that no graph learning model with a fixed inductive bias can generalize optimally across diverse graph domains. However, most existing methods address this challenge from the model side by incrementally injecting new inductive biases, which remains fundamentally limited given the open-ended diversity of real-world graphs. In this work, we take a data-centric perspective and treat node semantics as a task-adaptive variable. We propose a Data-Adaptive Semantic Refinement framework DAS for graph representation learning, which couples a fixed graph neural network (GNN) and a large language model (LLM) in a closed feedback loop. The GNN provides implicit supervisory signals to guide the semantic refinement of LLM, and the refined semantics are fed back to update the same graph learner. We evaluate our approach on both text-rich and text-free graphs. Results show consistent improvements on structure-dominated graphs while remaining competitive on semantics-rich graphs, demonstrating the effectiveness of data-centric semantic adaptation under structure-semantics heterogeneity.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Safety for Large Language Models (LLMs) has been an ongoing research focus since their emergence and is even more relevant nowadays with the increasing capacity of those models. Currently, there are several guardrails in place for all public LLMs and multiple proposed datasets for training safety classifiers. However, training these safety classifiers relies on large quantities of labeled data, which can be problematic to acquire, prone to labeling errors, or often include synthetic data. To address these issues, we suggest a different approach: utilizing semi-supervised learning techniques, which leverage both labeled and unlabeled data, to improve the performance on the safety task. We analyze the improvements that these techniques can offer for both prompts given to Large Language Models and the responses to those requests. Moreover, since augmentation is the central part of semi-supervised algorithms, we demonstrate the importance of using task-specific augmentations, which significantly increase the performance when compared to general-purpose augmentation techniques.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Transformers are increasingly adopted for modeling and forecasting time-series, yet their internal mechanisms remain poorly understood from a dynamical systems perspective. In contrast to classical autoregressive and state-space models, which benefit from well-established theoretical foundations, Transformer architectures are typically treated as black boxes. This gap becomes particularly relevant as attention-based models are considered for general-purpose or zero-shot forecasting across diverse dynamical regimes. In this work, we do not propose a new forecasting model, but instead investigate the representational capabilities and limitations of single-layer Transformers when applied to dynamical data. Building on a dynamical systems perspective we interpret causal self-attention as a linear, history-dependent recurrence and analyze how it processes temporal information. Through a series of linear and nonlinear case studies, we identify distinct operational regimes. For linear systems, we show that the convexity constraint imposed by softmax attention fundamentally restricts the class of dynamics that can be represented, leading to oversmoothing in oscillatory settings. For nonlinear systems under partial observability, attention instead acts as an adaptive delay-embedding mechanism, enabling effective state reconstruction when sufficient temporal context and latent dimensionality are available. These results help bridge empirical observations with classical dynamical systems theory, providing insight into when and why Transformers succeed or fail as models of dynamical systems.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Precipitation nowcasting is a critical spatio-temporal prediction task for society to prevent severe damage owing to extreme weather events. Despite the advances in this field, the complex and stochastic nature of this task still poses challenges to existing approaches. Specifically, deterministic models tend to produce blurry predictions while generative models often struggle with poor accuracy. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective model architecture termed STLDM, a diffusion-based model that learns the latent representation from end to end alongside both the Variational Autoencoder and the conditioning network. STLDM decomposes this task into two stages: a deterministic forecasting stage handled by the conditioning network, and an enhancement stage performed by the latent diffusion model. Experimental results on multiple radar datasets demonstrate that STLDM achieves superior performance compared to the state of the art, while also improving inference efficiency.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as conversational assistants in open-domain, multi-turn settings, where users often provide incomplete or ambiguous information. However, existing LLM-focused clarification benchmarks primarily assume single-turn interactions or cooperative users, limiting their ability to evaluate clarification behavior in realistic settings. We introduce \textbf{ClarifyMT-Bench}, a benchmark for multi-turn clarification grounded in a five-dimensional ambiguity taxonomy and a set of six behaviorally diverse simulated user personas. Through a hybrid LLM-human pipeline, we construct 6,120 multi-turn dialogues capturing diverse ambiguity sources and interaction patterns. Evaluating ten representative LLMs uncovers a consistent under-clarification bias: LLMs tend to answer prematurely, and performance degrades as dialogue depth increases. To mitigate this, we propose \textbf{ClarifyAgent}, an agentic approach that decomposes clarification into perception, forecasting, tracking, and planning, substantially improving robustness across ambiguity conditions. ClarifyMT-Bench establishes a reproducible foundation for studying when LLMs should ask, when they should answer, and how to navigate ambiguity in real-world human-LLM interactions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We have witnessed promising progress led by large language models (LLMs) and further vision language models (VLMs) in handling various queries as a general-purpose assistant. VLMs, as a bridge to connect the visual world and language corpus, receive both visual content and various text-only user instructions to generate corresponding responses. Though great success has been achieved by VLMs in various fields, in this work, we ask whether the existing VLMs can act as domain experts, accurately answering marine questions, which require significant domain expertise and address special domain challenges/requirements. To comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness and explore the boundary of existing VLMs, we construct the first large-scale marine VLM dataset and benchmark called MarineEval, with 2,000 image-based question-answering pairs. During our dataset construction, we ensure the diversity and coverage of the constructed data: 7 task dimensions and 20 capacity dimensions. The domain requirements are specially integrated into the data construction and further verified by the corresponding marine domain experts. We comprehensively benchmark 17 existing VLMs on our MarineEval and also investigate the limitations of existing models in answering marine research questions. The experimental results reveal that existing VLMs cannot effectively answer the domain-specific questions, and there is still a large room for further performance improvements. We hope our new benchmark and observations will facilitate future research. Project Page: this http URL</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As LLMs see wide adoption in software engineering, the reliable assessment of the correctness and security of LLM-generated code is crucial. Notably, prior work has demonstrated that security is often overlooked, exposing that LLMs are prone to generating code with security vulnerabilities. These insights were enabled by specialized benchmarks, crafted through significant manual effort by security experts. However, relying on manually-crafted benchmarks is insufficient in the long term, because benchmarks (i) naturally end up contaminating training data, (ii) must extend to new tasks to provide a more complete picture, and (iii) must increase in difficulty to challenge more capable LLMs. In this work, we address these challenges and present AutoBaxBuilder, a framework that generates tasks and tests for code security benchmarking from scratch. We introduce a robust pipeline with fine-grained plausibility checks, leveraging the code understanding capabilities of LLMs to construct functionality tests and end-to-end security-probing exploits. To confirm the quality of the generated benchmark, we conduct both a qualitative analysis and perform quantitative experiments, comparing it against tasks constructed by human experts. We use AutoBaxBuilder to construct entirely new tasks and release them to the public as AutoBaxBench, together with a thorough evaluation of the security capabilities of LLMs on these tasks. We find that a new task can be generated in under 2 hours, costing less than USD 10.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text-guided medical segmentation enhances segmentation accuracy by utilizing clinical reports as auxiliary information. However, existing methods typically rely on unaligned image and text encoders, which necessitate complex interaction modules for multimodal fusion. While CLIP provides a pre-aligned multimodal feature space, its direct application to medical imaging is limited by three main issues: insufficient preservation of fine-grained anatomical structures, inadequate modeling of complex clinical descriptions, and domain-specific semantic misalignment. To tackle these challenges, we propose TGC-Net, a CLIP-based framework focusing on parameter-efficient, task-specific adaptations. Specifically, it incorporates a Semantic-Structural Synergy Encoder (SSE) that augments CLIP's ViT with a CNN branch for multi-scale structural refinement, a Domain-Augmented Text Encoder (DATE) that injects large-language-model-derived medical knowledge, and a Vision-Language Calibration Module (VLCM) that refines cross-modal correspondence in a unified feature space. Experiments on five datasets across chest X-ray and thoracic CT modalities demonstrate that TGC-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance with substantially fewer trainable parameters, including notable Dice gains on challenging benchmarks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>protect</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Marine visual understanding is essential for monitoring and protecting marine ecosystems, enabling automatic and scalable biological surveys. However, progress is hindered by limited training data and the lack of a systematic task formulation that aligns domain-specific marine challenges with well-defined computer vision tasks, thereby limiting effective model application. To address this gap, we present ORCA, a multi-modal benchmark for marine research comprising 14,647 images from 478 species, with 42,217 bounding box annotations and 22,321 expert-verified instance captions. The dataset provides fine-grained visual and textual annotations that capture morphology-oriented attributes across diverse marine species. To catalyze methodological advances, we evaluate 18 state-of-the-art models on three tasks: object detection (closed-set and open-vocabulary), instance captioning, and visual grounding. Results highlight key challenges, including species diversity, morphological overlap, and specialized domain demands, underscoring the difficulty of marine understanding. ORCA thus establishes a comprehensive benchmark to advance research in marine domain. Project Page: this http URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Few-shot image generation aims to effectively adapt a source generative model to a target domain using very few training images. Most existing approaches introduce consistency constraints-typically through instance-level or distribution-level loss functions-to directly align the distribution patterns of source and target domains within their respective latent spaces. However, these strategies often fall short: overly strict constraints can amplify the negative effects of the domain gap, leading to distorted or uninformative content, while overly relaxed constraints may fail to leverage the source domain effectively. This limitation primarily stems from the inherent discrepancy in the underlying distribution structures of the source and target domains. The scarcity of target samples further compounds this issue by hindering accurate estimation of the target domain's distribution. To overcome these limitations, we propose Equivariant Feature Rotation (EFR), a novel adaptation strategy that aligns source and target domains at two complementary levels within a self-rotated proxy feature space. Specifically, we perform adaptive rotations within a parameterized Lie Group to transform both source and target features into an equivariant proxy space, where alignment is conducted. These learnable rotation matrices serve to bridge the domain gap by preserving intra-domain structural information without distortion, while the alignment optimization facilitates effective knowledge transfer from the source to the target domain. Comprehensive experiments on a variety of commonly used datasets demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the generative performance within the targeted domain.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Physical motions are inherently continuous, and higher camera frame rates typically contribute to improved smoothness and temporal coherence. For the first time, we explore continuous representations of human motion sequences, featuring the ability to interpolate, inbetween, and even extrapolate any input motion sequences at arbitrary frame rates. To achieve this, we propose a novel parametric activation-induced hierarchical implicit representation framework, referred to as NAME, based on Implicit Neural Representations (INRs). Our method introduces a hierarchical temporal encoding mechanism that extracts features from motion sequences at multiple temporal scales, enabling effective capture of intricate temporal patterns. Additionally, we integrate a custom parametric activation function, powered by Fourier transformations, into the MLP-based decoder to enhance the expressiveness of the continuous representation. This parametric formulation significantly augments the model's ability to represent complex motion behaviors with high accuracy. Extensive evaluations across several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed approach.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this report, we introduce UltraShape 1.0, a scalable 3D diffusion framework for high-fidelity 3D geometry generation. The proposed approach adopts a two-stage generation pipeline: a coarse global structure is first synthesized and then refined to produce detailed, high-quality geometry. To support reliable 3D generation, we develop a comprehensive data processing pipeline that includes a novel watertight processing method and high-quality data filtering. This pipeline improves the geometric quality of publicly available 3D datasets by removing low-quality samples, filling holes, and thickening thin structures, while preserving fine-grained geometric details. To enable fine-grained geometry refinement, we decouple spatial localization from geometric detail synthesis in the diffusion process. We achieve this by performing voxel-based refinement at fixed spatial locations, where voxel queries derived from coarse geometry provide explicit positional anchors encoded via RoPE, allowing the diffusion model to focus on synthesizing local geometric details within a reduced, structured solution space. Our model is trained exclusively on publicly available 3D datasets, achieving strong geometric quality despite limited training resources. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that UltraShape 1.0 performs competitively with existing open-source methods in both data processing quality and geometry generation. All code and trained models will be released to support future research.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Human infants, with only a few hundred hours of speech exposure, acquire basic units of new languages, highlighting a striking efficiency gap compared to the data-hungry self-supervised speech models. To address this gap, this paper introduces SpidR-Adapt for rapid adaptation to new languages using minimal unlabeled data. We cast such low-resource speech representation learning as a meta-learning problem and construct a multi-task adaptive pre-training (MAdaPT) protocol which formulates the adaptation process as a bi-level optimization framework. To enable scalable meta-training under this framework, we propose a novel heuristic solution, first-order bi-level optimization (FOBLO), avoiding heavy computation costs. Finally, we stabilize meta-training by using a robust initialization through interleaved supervision which alternates self-supervised and supervised objectives. Empirically, SpidR-Adapt achieves rapid gains in phonemic discriminability (ABX) and spoken language modeling (sWUGGY, sBLIMP, tSC), improving over in-domain language models after training on less than 1h of target-language audio, over $100\times$ more data-efficient than standard training. These findings highlight a practical, architecture-agnostic path toward biologically inspired, data-efficient representations.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose a unified analytic and variational framework for studying stability in deep learning systems viewed as coupled representation-parameter dynamics. The central object is the Learning Stability Profile, which tracks the infinitesimal response of representations, parameters, and update mechanisms to perturbations along the learning trajectory. We prove a Fundamental Analytic Stability Theorem showing that uniform boundedness of these stability signatures is equivalent, up to norm equivalence, to the existence of a Lyapunov-type energy that dissipates along the learning flow. In smooth regimes, the framework yields explicit stability exponents linking spectral norms, activation regularity, step sizes, and learning rates to contractivity of the learning dynamics. Classical spectral stability results for feedforward networks, a discrete CFL-type condition for residual architectures, and parametric and temporal stability laws for stochastic gradient methods arise as direct consequences. The theory extends to non-smooth learning systems, including ReLU networks, proximal and projected updates, and stochastic subgradient flows, by replacing classical derivatives with Clarke generalized derivatives and smooth energies with variational Lyapunov functionals. The resulting framework provides a unified dynamical description of stability across architectures and optimization methods, clarifying how architectural and algorithmic choices jointly govern robustness and sensitivity to perturbations. It also provides a foundation for further extensions to continuous-time limits and geometric formulations of learning dynamics.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While on-body device-based human motion estimation is crucial for applications such as XR interaction, existing methods often suffer from poor wearability, expensive hardware, and cumbersome calibration, which hinder their adoption in daily life. To address these challenges, we present EveryWear, a lightweight and practical human motion capture approach based entirely on everyday wearables: a smartphone, smartwatch, earbuds, and smart glasses equipped with one forward-facing and two downward-facing cameras, requiring no explicit calibration before use. We introduce Ego-Elec, a 9-hour real-world dataset covering 56 daily activities across 17 diverse indoor and outdoor environments, with ground-truth 3D annotations provided by the motion capture (MoCap), to facilitate robust research and benchmarking in this direction. Our approach employs a multimodal teacher-student framework that integrates visual cues from egocentric cameras with inertial signals from consumer devices. By training directly on real-world data rather than synthetic data, our model effectively eliminates the sim-to-real gap that constrains prior work. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline models, validating its effectiveness for practical full-body motion estimation.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Retrieving images from natural language descriptions is a core task at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing, with wide-ranging applications in search engines, media archiving, and digital content management. However, real-world image-text retrieval remains challenging due to vague or context-dependent queries, linguistic variability, and the need for scalable solutions. In this work, we propose a lightweight two-stage retrieval pipeline that leverages event-centric entity extraction to incorporate temporal and contextual signals from real-world captions. The first stage performs efficient candidate filtering using BM25 based on salient entities, while the second stage applies BEiT-3 models to capture deep multimodal semantics and rerank the results. Evaluated on the OpenEvents v1 benchmark, our method achieves a mean average precision of 0.559, substantially outperforming prior baselines. These results highlight the effectiveness of combining event-guided filtering with long-text vision-language modeling for accurate and efficient retrieval in complex, real-world scenarios.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models can develop reasoning capabilities through online fine-tuning with rule-based rewards. However, recent studies reveal a critical constraint: reinforcement learning succeeds only when the base model already assigns non-negligible probability to correct answers -- a property we term 'latent solvability'. This work investigates the emergence of chemical reasoning capabilities and what these prerequisites mean for chemistry. We identify two necessary conditions for RL-based chemical reasoning: 1) Symbolic competence, and 2) Latent chemical knowledge. We propose mid-stage scientific training (MiST): a set of mid-stage training techniques to satisfy these, including data-mixing with SMILES/CIF-aware pre-processing, continued pre-training on 2.9B tokens, and supervised fine-tuning on 1B tokens. These steps raise the latent-solvability score on 3B and 7B models by up to 1.8x, and enable RL to lift top-1 accuracy from 10.9 to 63.9% on organic reaction naming, and from 40.6 to 67.4% on inorganic material generation. Similar results are observed for other challenging chemical tasks, while producing interpretable reasoning traces. Our results define clear prerequisites for chemical reasoning training and highlight the broader role of mid-stage training in unlocking reasoning capabilities.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized software development through AI-assisted coding tools, enabling developers with limited programming expertise to create sophisticated applications. However, this accessibility extends to malicious actors who may exploit these powerful tools to generate harmful software. Existing jailbreaking research primarily focuses on general attack scenarios against LLMs, with limited exploration of malicious code generation as a jailbreak target. To address this gap, we propose SPELL, a comprehensive testing framework specifically designed to evaluate the weakness of security alignment in malicious code generation. Our framework employs a time-division selection strategy that systematically constructs jailbreaking prompts by intelligently combining sentences from a prior knowledge dataset, balancing exploration of novel attack patterns with exploitation of successful techniques. Extensive evaluation across three advanced code models (GPT-4.1, Claude-3.5, and Qwen2.5-Coder) demonstrates SPELL's effectiveness, achieving attack success rates of 83.75%, 19.38%, and 68.12% respectively across eight malicious code categories. The generated prompts successfully produce malicious code in real-world AI development tools such as Cursor, with outputs confirmed as malicious by state-of-the-art detection systems at rates exceeding 73%. These findings reveal significant security gaps in current LLM implementations and provide valuable insights for improving AI safety alignment in code generation applications.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generating 3D human motions from textual descriptions is an important research problem with broad applications in video games, virtual reality, and augmented reality. Recent methods align the textual description with human motion at the sequence level, neglecting the internal semantic structure of modalities. However, both motion descriptions and motion sequences can be naturally decomposed into smaller and semantically coherent segments, which can serve as atomic alignment units to achieve finer-grained correspondence. Motivated by this, we propose SegMo, a novel Segment-aligned text-conditioned human Motion generation framework to achieve fine-grained text-motion alignment. Our framework consists of three modules: (1) Text Segment Extraction, which decomposes complex textual descriptions into temporally ordered phrases, each representing a simple atomic action; (2) Motion Segment Extraction, which partitions complete motion sequences into corresponding motion segments; and (3) Fine-grained Text-Motion Alignment, which aligns text and motion segments with contrastive learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SegMo improves the strong baseline on two widely used datasets, achieving an improved TOP 1 score of 0.553 on the HumanML3D test set. Moreover, thanks to the learned shared embedding space for text and motion segments, SegMo can also be applied to retrieval-style tasks such as motion grounding and motion-to-text retrieval.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In hard-label black-box adversarial attacks, where only the top-1 predicted label is accessible, the prohibitive query complexity poses a major obstacle to practical deployment. In this paper, we focus on optimizing a representative class of attacks that search for the optimal ray direction yielding the minimum $\ell_2$-norm perturbation required to move a benign image into the adversarial region. Inspired by Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient (NAG), we propose a momentum-based algorithm, ARS-OPT, which proactively estimates the gradient with respect to a future ray direction inferred from accumulated momentum. We provide a theoretical analysis of its convergence behavior, showing that ARS-OPT enables more accurate directional updates and achieves faster, more stable optimization. To further accelerate convergence, we incorporate surrogate-model priors into ARS-OPT's gradient estimation, resulting in PARS-OPT with enhanced performance. The superiority of our approach is supported by theoretical guarantees under standard assumptions. Extensive experiments on ImageNet and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that our method surpasses 13 state-of-the-art approaches in query efficiency.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>My main worry, and the core of my research, is that our cybersecurity ecosystem is slowly but surely aging and getting old and that aging is becoming an operational risk. This is happening not only because of growing complexity, but more importantly because of accumulation of controls and measures whose effectiveness are uncertain. I introduce a new term for this aging phenomenon: cyber senescence. I will begin my lecture with a short historical overview in which I sketch a development over time that led to this worry for the future of cybersecurity. It is this worry that determined my research agenda and its central theme of the role of uncertainty in cybersecurity. My worry is that waste is accumulating in cyberspace. This waste consists of a multitude of overlapping controls whose risk reductions are uncertain. Unless we start pruning these control frameworks, this waste accumulation causes aging of cyberspace and could ultimately lead to a system collapse.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The "one-shot" technique represents a distinct and sophisticated aesthetic in filmmaking. However, its practical realization is often hindered by prohibitive costs and complex real-world constraints. Although emerging video generation models offer a virtual alternative, existing approaches typically rely on naive clip concatenation, which frequently fails to maintain visual smoothness and temporal coherence. In this paper, we introduce DreaMontage, a comprehensive framework designed for arbitrary frame-guided generation, capable of synthesizing seamless, expressive, and long-duration one-shot videos from diverse user-provided inputs. To achieve this, we address the challenge through three primary dimensions. (i) We integrate a lightweight intermediate-conditioning mechanism into the DiT architecture. By employing an Adaptive Tuning strategy that effectively leverages base training data, we unlock robust arbitrary-frame control capabilities. (ii) To enhance visual fidelity and cinematic expressiveness, we curate a high-quality dataset and implement a Visual Expression SFT stage. In addressing critical issues such as subject motion rationality and transition smoothness, we apply a Tailored DPO scheme, which significantly improves the success rate and usability of the generated content. (iii) To facilitate the production of extended sequences, we design a Segment-wise Auto-Regressive (SAR) inference strategy that operates in a memory-efficient manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves visually striking and seamlessly coherent one-shot effects while maintaining computational efficiency, empowering users to transform fragmented visual materials into vivid, cohesive one-shot cinematic experiences.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Reliable anomaly detection in brain MRI remains challenging due to the scarcity of annotated abnormal cases and the frequent absence of key imaging modalities in real clinical workflows. Existing single-class or multi-class anomaly detection (AD) models typically rely on fixed modality configurations, require repetitive training, or fail to generalize to unseen modality combinations, limiting their clinical scalability. In this work, we present a unified Any-Modality AD framework that performs robust anomaly detection and localization under arbitrary MRI modality availability. The framework integrates a dual-pathway DINOv2 encoder with a feature distribution alignment mechanism that statistically aligns incomplete-modality features with full-modality representations, enabling stable inference even with severe modality dropout. To further enhance semantic consistency, we introduce an Intrinsic Normal Prototypes (INPs) extractor and an INP-guided decoder that reconstruct only normal anatomical patterns while naturally amplifying abnormal deviations. Through randomized modality masking and indirect feature completion during training, the model learns to adapt to all modality configurations without re-training. Extensive experiments on BraTS2018, MU-Glioma-Post, and Pretreat-MetsToBrain-Masks demonstrate that our approach consistently surpasses state-of-the-art industrial and medical AD baselines across 7 modality combinations, achieving superior generalization. This study establishes a scalable paradigm for multimodal medical AD under real-world, imperfect modality conditions. Our source code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Controllability is a fundamental requirement in video synthesis, where accurate alignment with conditioning signals is essential. Existing classifier-free guidance methods typically achieve conditioning indirectly by modeling the joint distribution of data and conditions, which often results in limited controllability over the specified conditions. Classifier-based guidance enforces conditions through an external classifier, but the model may exploit this mechanism to raise the classifier score without genuinely satisfying the intended condition, resulting in adversarial artifacts and limited effective controllability. In this paper, we propose Attention-Conditional Diffusion (ACD), a novel framework for direct conditional control in video diffusion models via attention supervision. By aligning the model's attention maps with external control signals, ACD achieves better controllability. To support this, we introduce a sparse 3D-aware object layout as an efficient conditioning signal, along with a dedicated Layout ControlNet and an automated annotation pipeline for scalable layout integration. Extensive experiments on benchmark video generation datasets demonstrate that ACD delivers superior alignment with conditioning inputs while preserving temporal coherence and visual fidelity, establishing an effective paradigm for conditional video synthesis.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, transformer, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Modern deep learning methods typically treat image sequences as large tensors of sequentially stacked frames. However, is this straightforward representation ideal given the current state-of-the-art (SoTA)? In this work, we address this question in the context of generative models and aim to devise a more effective way of modeling image sequence data. Observing the inefficiencies and bottlenecks of current SoTA image sequence generation methods, we showcase that rather than working with large tensors, we can improve the generation process by factorizing it into first generating the coarse sequence at low resolution and then refining the individual frames at high resolution. We train a generative model solely on grid images comprising subsampled frames. Yet, we learn to generate image sequences, using the strong self-attention mechanism of the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) to capture correlations between frames. In effect, our formulation extends a 2D image generator to operate as a low-resolution 3D image-sequence generator without introducing any architectural modifications. Subsequently, we super-resolve each frame individually to add the sequence-independent high-resolution details. This approach offers several advantages and can overcome key limitations of the SoTA in this domain. Compared to existing image sequence generation models, our method achieves superior synthesis quality and improved coherence across sequences. It also delivers high-fidelity generation of arbitrary-length sequences and increased efficiency in inference time and training data usage. Furthermore, our straightforward formulation enables our method to generalize effectively across diverse data domains, which typically require additional priors and supervision to model in a generative context. Our method consistently outperforms SoTA in quality and inference speed (at least twice-as-fast) across datasets.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The user of Engineering Manuals (EM) finds it difficult to read EM s because they are long, have a dense format which includes written documents, step by step procedures, and standard parameter lists for engineering equipment. Off the shelf transformers, especially compact ones, treat this material as a flat stream of tokens. This approach leads to confident but incorrect numeric answers and forces the models to memorize separate facts inefficiently. SMART (Structured Memory and Reasoning Transformer) offers a different and practical solution to the above problem. SMART structures its processing by using a hierarchical approach, and is based upon three main job categories (1) A syntax-aware Fact Extractor (Grammarian) Tree LSTM which extracts facts as subject relation object relations from EM sentences (2) A compact indexed memory MANN (Memory Augmented Neural Network) that indexes these Rational Subject Relation Objects as 384 dimensional vectors that are associated with the source of the information, and (3) A 6 layer Transformer that learns to fuse the previously retrieved facts into its generated response. The entire SMART model utilizes 45.51M parameters, which is 64% less than GPT-2 (124M) and 69% less than BERT (133M), and it achieves a 21.3% higher accuracy than GPT-2, indicating that SMART fits the data better with the least amount of processing requirements. SMART employs dual modes of inference an indexed fast path for known documents (sub-second answer times) and an indexed dynamic path assisted by RAGs for new uploads (FAISS Top 20 results with memory severed at 64 slots). In real world deployment, this framework leads to more well supported results with reduced hallucinations than comparable small transformer models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, transformer, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Modern surgical systems increasingly rely on intelligent scene understanding to provide timely situational awareness for enhanced intra-operative safety. Within this pipeline, surgical scene segmentation plays a central role in accurately perceiving operative events. Although recent deep learning models, particularly large-scale foundation models, achieve remarkable segmentation accuracy, their substantial computational demands and power consumption hinder real-time deployment in resource-constrained surgical environments. To address this limitation, we explore the emerging SNN as a promising paradigm for highly efficient surgical intelligence. However, their performance is still constrained by the scarcity of labeled surgical data and the inherently sparse nature of surgical video representations. To this end, we propose \textit{SpikeSurgSeg}, the first spike-driven video Transformer framework tailored for surgical scene segmentation with real-time potential on non-GPU platforms. To address the limited availability of surgical annotations, we introduce a surgical-scene masked autoencoding pretraining strategy for SNNs that enables robust spatiotemporal representation learning via layer-wise tube masking. Building on this pretrained backbone, we further adopt a lightweight spike-driven segmentation head that produces temporally consistent predictions while preserving the low-latency characteristics of SNNs. Extensive experiments on EndoVis18 and our in-house SurgBleed dataset demonstrate that SpikeSurgSeg achieves mIoU comparable to SOTA ANN-based models while reducing inference latency by at least $8\times$. Notably, it delivers over $20\times$ acceleration relative to most foundation-model baselines, underscoring its potential for time-critical surgical scene segmentation.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Structured data extraction from tables plays a crucial role in document image analysis for scanned documents and digital archives. Although many methods have been proposed to detect table structures and extract cell contents, accurately identifying table segment boundaries (rows and columns) remains challenging, particularly in low-resolution or noisy images. In many real-world scenarios, table data are incomplete or degraded, limiting the adaptability of transformer-based methods to noisy inputs. Mask-based edge detection techniques have shown greater robustness under such conditions, as their sensitivity can be adjusted through threshold tuning; however, existing approaches typically apply masks directly to images, leading to noise sensitivity, resolution loss, or high computational cost. This paper proposes a novel multi-scale signal-processing method for detecting table edges from table masks. Row and column transitions are modeled as one-dimensional signals and processed using Gaussian convolution with progressively increasing variances, followed by statistical thresholding to suppress noise while preserving stable structural edges. Detected signal peaks are mapped back to image coordinates to obtain accurate segment boundaries. Experimental results show that applying the proposed approach to column edge detection improves Cell-Aware Segmentation Accuracy (CASA) a layout-aware metric evaluating both textual correctness and correct cell placement from 67% to 76% on the PubLayNet-1M benchmark when using TableNet with PyTesseract OCR. The method is robust to resolution variations through zero-padding and scaling strategies and produces optimized structured tabular outputs suitable for downstream analysis.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) remains a clinical challenge due to its extreme molecular heterogeneity and high relapse rates. While precision medicine has introduced mutation-specific therapies, many patients still lack effective, personalized options. This paper presents a novel, end-to-end computational framework that bridges the gap between patient-specific transcriptomics and de novo drug discovery. By analyzing bulk RNA sequencing data from the TCGA-LAML cohort, the study utilized Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to prioritize 20 high-value biomarkers, including metabolic transporters like HK3 and immune-modulatory receptors such as SIGLEC9. The physical structures of these targets were modeled using AlphaFold3, and druggable hotspots were quantitatively mapped via the DOGSiteScorer engine. Then developed a novel, reaction-first evolutionary metaheuristic algorithm as well as multi-objective optimization programming that assembles novel ligands from fragment libraries, guided by spatial alignment to these identified hotspots. The generative model produced structurally unique chemical entities with a strong bias toward drug-like space, as evidenced by QED scores peaking between 0.5 and 0.7. Validation through ADMET profiling and SwissDock molecular docking identified high-confidence candidates, such as Ligand L1, which achieved a binding free energy of -6.571 kcal/mol against the A08A96 biomarker. These results demonstrate that integrating systems biology with metaheuristic molecular assembly can produce pharmacologically viable, patient tailored leads, offering a scalable blueprint for precision oncology in AML and beyond</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) on shapes underpins many shape analysis and engineering tasks; yet, prevailing PDE solvers operate on polygonal/triangle meshes while modern 3D assets increasingly live as neural representations. This mismatch leaves no suitable method to solve surface PDEs directly within the neural domain, forcing explicit mesh extraction or per-instance residual training, preventing end-to-end workflows. We present a novel, mesh-free formulation that learns a local update operator conditioned on neural (local) shape attributes, enabling surface PDEs to be solved directly where the (neural) data lives. The operator integrates naturally with prevalent neural surface representations, is trained once on a single representative shape, and generalizes across shape and topology variations, enabling accurate, fast inference without explicit meshing or per-instance optimization while preserving differentiability. Across analytic benchmarks (heat equation and Poisson solve on sphere) and real neural assets across different representations, our method slightly outperforms CPM while remaining reasonably close to FEM, and, to our knowledge, delivers the first end-to-end pipeline that solves surface PDEs on both neural and classical surface representations.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose Parallel Token Prediction (PTP), a universal framework for parallel sequence generation in language models. PTP jointly predicts multiple dependent tokens in a single transformer call by incorporating the sampling procedure into the model. This reduces the latency bottleneck of autoregressive decoding, and avoids the restrictive independence assumptions common in existing multi-token prediction methods. We prove that PTP can represent arbitrary autoregressive sequence distributions. PTP is trained either by distilling an existing model or through inverse autoregressive training without a teacher. Experimentally, we achieve state-of-the-art speculative decoding performance on Vicuna-7B by accepting over four tokens per step on Spec-Bench. The universality of our framework indicates that parallel generation of long sequences is feasible without loss of modeling power.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The interpretation of small tiles in large whole slide images (WSI) often needs a larger image context. We introduce TICON, a transformer-based tile representation contextualizer that produces rich, contextualized embeddings for ''any'' application in computational pathology. Standard tile encoder-based pipelines, which extract embeddings of tiles stripped from their context, fail to model the rich slide-level information essential for both local and global tasks. Furthermore, different tile-encoders excel at different downstream tasks. Therefore, a unified model is needed to contextualize embeddings derived from ''any'' tile-level foundation model. TICON addresses this need with a single, shared encoder, pretrained using a masked modeling objective to simultaneously unify and contextualize representations from diverse tile-level pathology foundation models. Our experiments demonstrate that TICON-contextualized embeddings significantly improve performance across many different tasks, establishing new state-of-the-art results on tile-level benchmarks (i.e., HEST-Bench, THUNDER, CATCH) and slide-level benchmarks (i.e., Patho-Bench). Finally, we pretrain an aggregator on TICON to form a slide-level foundation model, using only 11K WSIs, outperforming SoTA slide-level foundation models pretrained with up to 350K WSIs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present C2LLM - Contrastive Code Large Language Models, a family of code embedding models in both 0.5B and 7B sizes. Building upon Qwen-2.5-Coder backbones, C2LLM adopts a Pooling by Multihead Attention (PMA) module for generating sequence embedding from token embeddings, effectively 1) utilizing the LLM's causal representations acquired during pretraining, while also 2) being able to aggregate information from all tokens in the sequence, breaking the information bottleneck in EOS-based sequence embeddings, and 3) supporting flexible adaptation of embedding dimension, serving as an alternative to MRL. Trained on three million publicly available data, C2LLM models set new records on MTEB-Code among models of similar sizes, with C2LLM-7B ranking 1st on the overall leaderboard.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2), a vision foundation model has significantly advanced in prompt-driven video object segmentation, yet their practical deployment remains limited by the high computational and memory cost of processing dense visual tokens across time. The SAM2 pipelines typically propagate all visual tokens produced by the image encoder through downstream temporal reasoning modules, regardless of their relevance to the target object, resulting in reduced scalability due to quadratic memory attention overhead. In this work, we introduce a text-guided token pruning framework that improves inference efficiency by selectively reducing token density prior to temporal propagation, without modifying the underlying segmentation architecture. Operating after visual encoding and before memory based propagation, our method ranks tokens using a lightweight routing mechanism that integrates local visual context, semantic relevance derived from object-centric textual descriptions (either user-provided or automatically generated), and uncertainty cues that help preserve ambiguous or boundary critical regions. By retaining only the most informative tokens for downstream processing, the proposed approach reduces redundant computation while maintaining segmentation fidelity. Extensive experiments across multiple challenging video segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that post-encoder token pruning provides a practical and effective pathway to efficient, prompt-aware video segmentation, achieving up to 42.50 percent faster inference and 37.41 percent lower GPU memory usage compared to the unpruned baseline SAM2, while preserving competitive J and F performance. These results highlight the potential of early token selection to improve the scalability of transformer-based video segmentation systems for real-time and resource-constrained applications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) offer flexible, non-autoregressive generation, but this freedom introduces a challenge: final output quality is highly sensitive to the decoding order. We are the first to formalize this issue, attributing the variability in output quality to the cumulative predictive uncertainty along a generative path. To quantify this uncertainty, we introduce Denoising Entropy, a computable metric that serves as an internal signal for evaluating generative process. Leveraging this metric, we propose two algorithms designed to optimize the decoding path: a post-hoc selection method and a real-time guidance strategy. Experiments demonstrate that our entropy-guided methods significantly improve generation quality, consistently boosting accuracy on challenging reasoning, planning, and code benchmarks. Our work establishes Denoising Entropy as a principled tool for understanding and controlling generation, effectively turning the uncertainty in MDMs from a liability into a key advantage for discovering high-quality solutions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>High-resolution video generation, while crucial for digital media and film, is computationally bottlenecked by the quadratic complexity of diffusion models, making practical inference infeasible. To address this, we introduce HiStream, an efficient autoregressive framework that systematically reduces redundancy across three axes: i) Spatial Compression: denoising at low resolution before refining at high resolution with cached features; ii) Temporal Compression: a chunk-by-chunk strategy with a fixed-size anchor cache, ensuring stable inference speed; and iii) Timestep Compression: applying fewer denoising steps to subsequent, cache-conditioned chunks. On 1080p benchmarks, our primary HiStream model (i+ii) achieves state-of-the-art visual quality while demonstrating up to 76.2x faster denoising compared to the Wan2.1 baseline and negligible quality loss. Our faster variant, HiStream+, applies all three optimizations (i+ii+iii), achieving a 107.5x acceleration over the baseline, offering a compelling trade-off between speed and quality, thereby making high-resolution video generation both practical and scalable.</li>
