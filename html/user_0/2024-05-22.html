<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Stochastic optimization algorithms, particularly stochastic policy gradient (SPG), report significant success in reinforcement learning (RL). Nevertheless, up to now, that how to speedily acquire an optimal solution for RL is still a challenge. To tackle this issue, this work develops a fast SPG algorithm from the perspective of utilizing a momentum, coined SPG-NM. Specifically, in SPG-NM, a novel type of the negative momentum (NM) technique is applied into the classical SPG algorithm. Different from the existing NM techniques, we have adopted a few hyper-parameters in our SPG-NM algorithm. Moreover, the computational complexity is nearly same as the modern SPG-type algorithms, e.g., accelerated policy gradient (APG), which equips SPG with Nesterov's accelerated gradient (NAG). We evaluate the resulting algorithm on two classical tasks, bandit setting and Markov decision process (MDP). Numerical results in different tasks demonstrate faster convergence rate of the resulting algorithm by comparing state-of-the-art algorithms, which confirm the positive impact of NM in accelerating SPG for RL. Also, numerical experiments under different settings confirm the robustness of our SPG-NM algorithm for some certain crucial hyper-parameters, which ride the user feel free in practice.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Identifying the features learned by neural networks is a core challenge in mechanistic interpretability. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs), which learn a sparse, overcomplete dictionary that reconstructs a network's internal activations, have been used to identify these features. However, SAEs may learn more about the structure of the datatset than the computational structure of the network. There is therefore only indirect reason to believe that the directions found in these dictionaries are functionally important to the network. We propose end-to-end (e2e) sparse dictionary learning, a method for training SAEs that ensures the features learned are functionally important by minimizing the KL divergence between the output distributions of the original model and the model with SAE activations inserted. Compared to standard SAEs, e2e SAEs offer a Pareto improvement: They explain more network performance, require fewer total features, and require fewer simultaneously active features per datapoint, all with no cost to interpretability. We explore geometric and qualitative differences between e2e SAE features and standard SAE features. E2e dictionary learning brings us closer to methods that can explain network behavior concisely and accurately. We release our library for training e2e SAEs and reproducing our analysis at this https URL</li>

          Focus on Low-Resolution Information: Multi-Granular Information-Lossless Model for Low-Resolution Human Pose Estimation(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In real-world applications of human pose estimation, low-resolution input images are frequently encountered when the performance of the image acquisition equipment is limited or the shooting distance is too far. However, existing state-of-the-art models for human pose estimation perform poorly on low-resolution images. One key reason is the presence of downsampling layers in these models, e.g., strided convolutions and pooling layers. It further reduces the already insufficient image information. Another key reason is that the body skeleton and human kinematic information are not fully utilized. In this work, we propose a Multi-Granular Information-Lossless (MGIL) model to replace the downsampling layers to address the above issues. Specifically, MGIL employs a Fine-grained Lossless Information Extraction (FLIE) module, which can prevent the loss of local information. Furthermore, we design a Coarse-grained Information Interaction (CII) module to adequately leverage human body structural information. To efficiently fuse cross-granular information and thoroughly exploit the relationships among keypoints, we further introduce a Multi-Granular Adaptive Fusion (MGAF) mechanism. The mechanism assigns weights to features of different granularities based on the content of the image. The model is effective, flexible, and universal. We show its potential in various vision tasks with comprehensive experiments. It outperforms the SOTA methods by 7.7 mAP on COCO and performs well with different input resolutions, different backbones, and different vision tasks.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper reveals a novel linear characteristic exclusive to transformer decoders, including models such as GPT, LLaMA, OPT, BLOOM and others. We analyze embedding transformations between sequential layers, uncovering a near-perfect linear relationship (Procrustes similarity score of 0.99). However, linearity decreases when the residual component is removed due to a consistently low output norm of the transformer layer. Our experiments show that removing or linearly approximating some of the most linear blocks of transformers does not affect significantly the loss or model performance. Moreover, in our pretraining experiments on smaller models we introduce a cosine-similarity-based regularization, aimed at reducing layer linearity. This regularization improves performance metrics on benchmarks like Tiny Stories and SuperGLUE and as well successfully decreases the linearity of the models. This study challenges the existing understanding of transformer architectures, suggesting that their operation may be more linear than previously assumed.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The evolving landscape of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) aims to improve the interpretability of intricate machine learning (ML) models, yet faces challenges in formalisation and empirical validation, being an inherently unsupervised process. In this paper, we bring together various benchmark datasets and novel performance metrics in an initial benchmarking platform, the Explainable AI Comparison Toolkit (EXACT), providing a standardised foundation for evaluating XAI methods. Our datasets incorporate ground truth explanations for class-conditional features, and leveraging novel quantitative metrics, this platform assesses the performance of post-hoc XAI methods in the quality of the explanations they produce. Our recent findings have highlighted the limitations of popular XAI methods, as they often struggle to surpass random baselines, attributing significance to irrelevant features. Moreover, we show the variability in explanations derived from different equally performing model architectures. This initial benchmarking platform therefore aims to allow XAI researchers to test and assure the high quality of their newly developed methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models are transformer neural networks which are trained to produce a probability distribution on the possible next words to given texts in a corpus, in such a way that the most likely word predicted is the actual word in the training text. In this paper we find what is the mathematical structure defined by such conditional probability distributions of text extensions. Changing the view point from probabilities to -log probabilities we observe that the subtext order is completely encoded in a metric structure defined on the space of texts $\mathcal{L}$, by -log probabilities. We then construct a metric polyhedron $P(\mathcal{L})$ and an isometric embedding (called Yoneda embedding) of $\mathcal{L}$ into $P(\mathcal{L})$ such that texts map to generators of certain special extremal rays. We explain that $P(\mathcal{L})$ is a $(\min,+)$ (tropical) linear span of these extremal ray generators. The generators also satisfy a system of $(\min+)$ linear equations. We then show that $P(\mathcal{L})$ is compatible with adding more text and from this we derive an approximation of a text vector as a Boltzmann weighted linear combination of the vectors for words in that text. We then prove a duality theorem showing that texts extensions and text restrictions give isometric polyhedra (even though they look a priory very different). Moreover we prove that $P(\mathcal{L})$ is the lattice closure of (a version of) the so called, Isbell completion of $\mathcal{L}$ which turns out to be the $(\max,+)$ span of the text extremal ray generators. All constructions have interpretations in category theory but we don't use category theory explicitly. The categorical interpretations are briefly explained in an appendix. In the final appendix we describe how the syntax to semantics problem could fit in a general well known mathematical duality.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>defense, attack, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Adversarial Training is a proven defense strategy against adversarial malware. However, generating adversarial malware samples for this type of training presents a challenge because the resulting adversarial malware needs to remain evasive and functional. This work proposes an attack framework, EGAN, to address this limitation. EGAN leverages an Evolution Strategy and Generative Adversarial Network to select a sequence of attack actions that can mutate a Ransomware file while preserving its original functionality. We tested this framework on popular AI-powered commercial antivirus systems listed on VirusTotal and demonstrated that our framework is capable of bypassing the majority of these systems. Moreover, we evaluated whether the EGAN attack framework can evade other commercial non-AI antivirus solutions. Our results indicate that the adversarial ransomware generated can increase the probability of evading some of them.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, steal</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are recognized as potent tools for processing real-world data organized in graph structures. Especially inductive GNNs, which enable the processing of graph-structured data without relying on predefined graph structures, are gaining importance in an increasingly wide variety of applications. As these networks demonstrate proficiency across a range of tasks, they become lucrative targets for model-stealing attacks where an adversary seeks to replicate the functionality of the targeted network. A large effort has been made to develop model-stealing attacks that focus on models trained with images and texts. However, little attention has been paid to GNNs trained on graph data. This paper introduces a novel method for unsupervised model-stealing attacks against inductive GNNs, based on graph contrasting learning and spectral graph augmentations to efficiently extract information from the target model. The proposed attack is thoroughly evaluated on six datasets. The results show that this approach demonstrates a higher level of efficiency compared to existing stealing attacks. More concretely, our attack outperforms the baseline on all benchmarks achieving higher fidelity and downstream accuracy of the stolen model while requiring fewer queries sent to the target model.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The reason for Meta Overfitting can be attributed to two factors: Mutual Non-exclusivity and the Lack of diversity, consequent to which a single global function can fit the support set data of all the meta-training tasks and fail to generalize to new unseen tasks. This issue is evidenced by low error rates on the meta-training tasks, but high error rates on new tasks. However, there can be a number of novel solutions to this problem keeping in mind any of the two objectives to be attained, i.e. to increase diversity in the tasks and to reduce the confidence of the model for some of the tasks. In light of the above, this paper proposes a number of solutions to tackle meta-overfitting on few-shot learning settings, such as few-shot sinusoid regression and few shot classification. Our proposed approaches demonstrate improved generalization performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines for learning in a non-mutually exclusive task setting. Overall, this paper aims to provide insights into tackling overfitting in meta-learning and to advance the field towards more robust and generalizable models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper introduces a full solution for decentralized routing in Low Earth Orbit satellite constellations based on continual Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). This requires addressing multiple challenges, including the partial knowledge at the satellites and their continuous movement, and the time-varying sources of uncertainty in the system, such as traffic, communication links, or communication buffers. We follow a multi-agent approach, where each satellite acts as an independent decision-making agent, while acquiring a limited knowledge of the environment based on the feedback received from the nearby agents. The solution is divided into two phases. First, an offline learning phase relies on decentralized decisions and a global Deep Neural Network (DNN) trained with global experiences. Then, the online phase with local, on-board, and pre-trained DNNs requires continual learning to evolve with the environment, which can be done in two different ways: (1) Model anticipation, where the predictable conditions of the constellation are exploited by each satellite sharing local model with the next satellite; and (2) Federated Learning (FL), where each agent's model is merged first at the cluster level and then aggregated in a global Parameter Server. The results show that, without high congestion, the proposed Multi-Agent DRL framework achieves the same E2E performance as a shortest-path solution, but the latter assumes intensive communication overhead for real-time network-wise knowledge of the system at a centralized node, whereas ours only requires limited feedback exchange among first neighbour satellites. Importantly, our solution adapts well to congestion conditions and exploits less loaded paths. Moreover, the divergence of models over time is easily tackled by the synergy between anticipation, applied in short-term alignment, and FL, utilized for long-term alignment.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The widespread use of machine learning and data-driven algorithms for decision making has been steadily increasing over many years. The areas in which this is happening are diverse: healthcare, employment, finance, education, the legal system to name a few; and the associated negative side effects are being increasingly harmful for society. Negative data \emph{bias} is one of those, which tends to result in harmful consequences for specific groups of people. Any mitigation strategy or effective policy that addresses the negative consequences of bias must start with awareness that bias exists, together with a way to understand and quantify it. However, there is a lack of consensus on how to measure data bias and oftentimes the intended meaning is context dependent and not uniform within the research community. The main contributions of our work are: (1) a general algorithmic framework for defining and efficiently quantifying the bias level of a dataset with respect to a protected group; and (2) the definition of a new bias measure. Our results are experimentally validated using nine publicly available datasets and theoretically analyzed, which provide novel insights about the problem. Based on our approach, we also derive a bias mitigation algorithm that might be useful to policymakers.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>explainability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is a pivotal research domain aimed at understanding the operational mechanisms of AI systems, particularly those considered ``black boxes'' due to their complex, opaque nature. XAI seeks to make these AI systems more understandable and trustworthy, providing insight into their decision-making processes. By producing clear and comprehensible explanations, XAI enables users, practitioners, and stakeholders to trust a model's decisions. This work analyses the value of data morphology strategies in generating counterfactual explanations. It introduces the Overlap Number of Balls Model-Agnostic CounterFactuals (ONB-MACF) method, a model-agnostic counterfactual generator that leverages data morphology to estimate a model's decision boundaries. The ONB-MACF method constructs hyperspheres in the data space whose covered points share a class, mapping the decision boundary. Counterfactuals are then generated by incrementally adjusting an instance's attributes towards the nearest alternate-class hypersphere, crossing the decision boundary with minimal modifications. By design, the ONB-MACF method generates feasible and sparse counterfactuals that follow the data distribution. Our comprehensive benchmark from a double perspective (quantitative and qualitative) shows that the ONB-MACF method outperforms existing state-of-the-art counterfactual generation methods across multiple quality metrics on diverse tabular datasets. This supports our hypothesis, showcasing the potential of data-morphology-based explainability strategies for trustworthy AI.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The accurate segmentation of medical images is crucial for diagnosing and treating diseases. Recent studies demonstrate that vision transformer-based methods have significantly improved performance in medical image segmentation, primarily due to their superior ability to establish global relationships among features and adaptability to various inputs. However, these methods struggle with the low signal-to-noise ratio inherent to medical images. Additionally, the effective utilization of channel and spatial information, which are essential for medical image segmentation, is limited by the representation capacity of self-attention. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-dimension transformer with attention-based filtering (MDT-AF), which redesigns the patch embedding and self-attention mechanism for medical image segmentation. MDT-AF incorporates an attention-based feature filtering mechanism into the patch embedding blocks and employs a coarse-to-fine process to mitigate the impact of low signal-to-noise ratio. To better capture complex structures in medical images, MDT-AF extends the self-attention mechanism to incorporate spatial and channel dimensions, enriching feature representation. Moreover, we introduce an interaction mechanism to improve the feature aggregation between spatial and channel dimensions. Experimental results on three public medical image segmentation benchmarks show that MDT-AF achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The spread of false and misleading information is receiving significant attention from legislative and regulatory bodies. Consumers place trust in specific sources of information, so a scalable, interoperable method for determining the provenance and authenticity of information is needed. In this paper we analyze the posting of broadcast news content to a social media platform, the role of open standards, the interplay of cryptographic metadata and watermarks when validating provenance, and likely success and failure scenarios. We conclude that the open standards for cryptographically authenticated metadata developed by the Coalition for Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA) and for audio and video watermarking developed by the Advanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC) are well suited to address broadcast provenance. We suggest methods for using these standards for optimal success.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The presence of interference, where the outcome of an individual may depend on the treatment assignment and behavior of neighboring nodes, can lead to biased causal effect estimation. Current approaches to network experiment design focus on limiting interference through cluster-based randomization, in which clusters are identified using graph clustering, and cluster randomization dictates the node assignment to treatment and control. However, cluster-based randomization approaches perform poorly when interference propagates in cascades, whereby the response of individuals to treatment propagates to their multi-hop neighbors. When we have knowledge of the cascade seed nodes, we can leverage this interference structure to mitigate the resulting causal effect estimation bias. With this goal, we propose a cascade-based network experiment design that initiates treatment assignment from the cascade seed node and propagates the assignment to their multi-hop neighbors to limit interference during cascade growth and thereby reduce the overall causal effect estimation error. Our extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approaches in estimating causal effects in network data.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rise of instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) marks a significant advancement in artificial intelligence (AI) (tailored to respond to specific prompts). Despite their popularity, applying such models to debug security vulnerabilities in hardware designs, i.e., register transfer language (RTL) modules, particularly at system-on-chip (SoC) level, presents considerable challenges. One of the main issues lies in the need for precisely designed instructions for pinpointing and mitigating the vulnerabilities, which requires substantial time and expertise from human experts. In response to this challenge, this paper proposes Self-HWDebug, an innovative framework that leverages LLMs to automatically create required debugging instructions. In Self-HWDebug, a set of already identified bugs from the most critical hardware common weakness enumeration (CWE) listings, along with mitigation resolutions, is provided to the framework, followed by prompting the LLMs to generate targeted instructions for such mitigation. The LLM-generated instructions are subsequently used as references to address vulnerabilities within the same CWE category but in totally different designs, effectively demonstrating the framework's ability to extend solutions across related security issues. Self-HWDebug significantly reduces human intervention by using the model's own output to guide debugging. Through comprehensive testing, Self-HWDebug proves not only to reduce experts' effort/time but also to even improve the quality of the debugging process.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Enterprise retrieval augmented generation (RAG) offers a highly flexible framework for combining powerful large language models (LLMs) with internal, possibly temporally changing, documents. In RAG, documents are first chunked. Relevant chunks are then retrieved for a specific user query, which are passed as context to a synthesizer LLM to generate the query response. However, the retrieval step can limit performance, as incorrect chunks can lead the synthesizer LLM to generate a false response. This work proposes a zero-shot adaptation of standard dense retrieval steps for more accurate chunk recall. Specifically, a chunk is first decomposed into atomic statements. A set of synthetic questions are then generated on these atoms (with the chunk as the context). Dense retrieval involves finding the closest set of synthetic questions, and associated chunks, to the user query. It is found that retrieval with the atoms leads to higher recall than retrieval with chunks. Further performance gain is observed with retrieval using the synthetic questions generated over the atoms. Higher recall at the retrieval step enables higher performance of the enterprise LLM using the RAG pipeline.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Machine Learning algorithms (ML) impact virtually every aspect of human lives and have found use across diverse sectors, including healthcare, finance, and education. Often, ML algorithms have been found to exacerbate societal biases presented in datasets, leading to adversarial impacts on subsets/groups of individuals, in many cases minority groups. To effectively mitigate these untoward effects, it is crucial that disparities/biases are identified and assessed early in a ML pipeline. This proactive approach facilitates timely interventions to prevent bias amplification and reduce complexity at later stages of model development. In this paper, we introduce DispaRisk, a novel framework designed to proactively assess the potential risks of disparities in datasets during the initial stages of the ML pipeline. We evaluate DispaRisk's effectiveness by benchmarking it with commonly used datasets in fairness research. Our findings demonstrate the capabilities of DispaRisk to identify datasets with a high-risk of discrimination, model families prone to biases, and characteristics that heighten discrimination susceptibility in a ML pipeline.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>World models constitute a promising approach for training reinforcement learning agents in a safe and sample-efficient manner. Recent world models predominantly operate on sequences of discrete latent variables to model environment dynamics. However, this compression into a compact discrete representation may ignore visual details that are important for reinforcement learning. Concurrently, diffusion models have become a dominant approach for image generation, challenging well-established methods modeling discrete latents. Motivated by this paradigm shift, we introduce DIAMOND (DIffusion As a Model Of eNvironment Dreams), a reinforcement learning agent trained in a diffusion world model. We analyze the key design choices that are required to make diffusion suitable for world modeling, and demonstrate how improved visual details can lead to improved agent performance. DIAMOND achieves a mean human normalized score of 1.46 on the competitive Atari 100k benchmark; a new best for agents trained entirely within a world model. To foster future research on diffusion for world modeling, we release our code, agents and playable world models at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As machine learning systems become increasingly integrated into real-world applications, accurately representing uncertainty is crucial for enhancing their safety, robustness, and reliability. Training neural networks to fit high-dimensional probability distributions via maximum likelihood has become an effective method for uncertainty quantification. However, such models often exhibit poor calibration, leading to overconfident predictions. Traditional metrics like Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Negative Log Likelihood (NLL) have limitations, including biases and parametric assumptions. This paper proposes a new approach using conditional kernel mean embeddings to measure calibration discrepancies without these biases and assumptions. Preliminary experiments on synthetic data demonstrate the method's potential, with future work planned for more complex applications.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce a pioneering approach to self-supervised learning for point clouds, employing a geometrically informed mask selection strategy called GeoMask3D (GM3D) to boost the efficiency of Masked Auto Encoders (MAE). Unlike the conventional method of random masking, our technique utilizes a teacher-student model to focus on intricate areas within the data, guiding the model's focus toward regions with higher geometric complexity. This strategy is grounded in the hypothesis that concentrating on harder patches yields a more robust feature representation, as evidenced by the improved performance on downstream tasks. Our method also presents a complete-to-partial feature-level knowledge distillation technique designed to guide the prediction of geometric complexity utilizing a comprehensive context from feature-level information. Extensive experiments confirm our method's superiority over State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) baselines, demonstrating marked improvements in classification, and few-shot tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Traditional 3D garment creation is labor-intensive, involving sketching, modeling, UV mapping, and texturing, which are time-consuming and costly. Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have enabled new possibilities for 3D garment generation from text prompts, images, and videos. However, existing methods either suffer from inconsistencies among multi-view images or require additional processes to separate cloth from the underlying human model. In this paper, we propose GarmentDreamer, a novel method that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) as guidance to generate wearable, simulation-ready 3D garment meshes from text prompts. In contrast to using multi-view images directly predicted by generative models as guidance, our 3DGS guidance ensures consistent optimization in both garment deformation and texture synthesis. Our method introduces a novel garment augmentation module, guided by normal and RGBA information, and employs implicit Neural Texture Fields (NeTF) combined with Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) to generate diverse geometric and texture details. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through comprehensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, showcasing the superior performance of GarmentDreamer over state-of-the-art alternatives.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) are pivotal methodologies in reward learning, which involve inferring and shaping the underlying reward function of sequential decision-making problems based on observed human demonstrations and feedback. Most prior work in reward learning has relied on prior knowledge or assumptions about decision or preference models, potentially leading to robustness issues. In response, this paper introduces a novel linear programming (LP) framework tailored for offline reward learning. Utilizing pre-collected trajectories without online exploration, this framework estimates a feasible reward set from the primal-dual optimality conditions of a suitably designed LP, and offers an optimality guarantee with provable sample efficiency. Our LP framework also enables aligning the reward functions with human feedback, such as pairwise trajectory comparison data, while maintaining computational tractability and sample efficiency. We demonstrate that our framework potentially achieves better performance compared to the conventional maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) approach through analytical examples and numerical experiments.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>M${}^{\natural}$-concave functions, a.k.a. gross substitute valuation functions, play a fundamental role in many fields, including discrete mathematics and economics. In practice, perfect knowledge of M${}^{\natural}$-concave functions is often unavailable a priori, and we can optimize them only interactively based on some feedback. Motivated by such situations, we study online M${}^{\natural}$-concave function maximization problems, which are interactive versions of the problem studied by Murota and Shioura (1999). For the stochastic bandit setting, we present $O(T^{-1/2})$-simple regret and $O(T^{2/3})$-regret algorithms under $T$ times access to unbiased noisy value oracles of M${}^{\natural}$-concave functions. A key to proving these results is the robustness of the greedy algorithm to local errors in M${}^{\natural}$-concave function maximization, which is one of our main technical results. While we obtain those positive results for the stochastic setting, another main result of our work is an impossibility in the adversarial setting. We prove that, even with full-information feedback, no algorithms that run in polynomial time per round can achieve $O(T^{1-c})$ regret for any constant $c > 0$ unless $\mathsf{P} = \mathsf{NP}$. Our proof is based on a reduction from the matroid intersection problem for three matroids, which would be a novel idea in the context of online learning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Prototype learning is widely used in face recognition, which takes the row vectors of coefficient matrix in the last linear layer of the feature extraction model as the prototypes for each class. When the prototypes are updated using the facial sample feature gradients in the model training, they are prone to being pulled away from the class center by the hard samples, resulting in decreased overall model performance. In this paper, we explicitly define prototypes as the expectations of sample features in each class and design the empirical prototypes using the existing samples in the dataset. We then devise a strategy to adaptively update these empirical prototypes during the model training based on the similarity between the sample features and the empirical prototypes. Furthermore, we propose an empirical prototype learning (EPL) method, which utilizes an adaptive margin parameter with respect to sample features. EPL assigns larger margins to the normal samples and smaller margins to the hard samples, allowing the learned empirical prototypes to better reflect the class center dominated by the normal samples and finally pull the hard samples towards the empirical prototypes through the learning. The extensive experiments on MFR, IJB-C, LFW, CFP-FP, AgeDB, and MegaFace demonstrate the effectiveness of EPL. Our code is available at $\href{this https URL}{this https URL}$.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Transformer-based models for long sequence time series forecasting (LSTF) problems have gained significant attention due to their exceptional forecasting precision. As the cornerstone of these models, the self-attention mechanism poses a challenge to efficient training and inference due to its quadratic time complexity. In this article, we propose a novel architectural design for Transformer-based models in LSTF, leveraging a substitution framework that incorporates Surrogate Attention Blocks and Surrogate FFN Blocks. The framework aims to boost any well-designed model's efficiency without sacrificing its accuracy. We further establish the equivalence of the Surrogate Attention Block to the self-attention mechanism in terms of both expressiveness and trainability. Through extensive experiments encompassing nine Transformer-based models across five time series tasks, we observe an average performance improvement of 9.45% while achieving a significant reduction in model size by 46%</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Last-level cache side-channel attacks have been mostly demonstrated in highly-controlled, quiescent local environments. Hence, it is unclear whether such attacks are feasible in a production cloud environment. In the cloud, side channels are flooded with noise from activities of other tenants and, in Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) workloads, the attacker has a very limited time window to mount the attack. In this paper, we show that such attacks are feasible in practice, although they require new techniques. We present an end-to-end, cross-tenant attack on a vulnerable ECDSA implementation in the public FaaS Google Cloud Run environment. We introduce several new techniques to improve every step of the attack. First, to speed-up the generation of eviction sets, we introduce L2-driven candidate address filtering and a Binary Search-based algorithm for address pruning. Second, to monitor victim memory accesses with high time resolution, we introduce Parallel Probing. Finally, we leverage power spectral density from signal processing to easily identify the victim's target cache set in the frequency domain. Overall, using these mechanisms, we extract a median value of 81% of the secret ECDSA nonce bits from a victim container in 19 seconds on average.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification constitutes the fundamental research in remote sensing fields. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers have demonstrated impressive capability in capturing spectral-spatial contextual dependencies. However, these architectures suffer from limited receptive fields and quadratic computational complexity, respectively. Fortunately, recent Mamba architectures built upon the State Space Model integrate the advantages of long-range sequence modeling and linear computational efficiency, exhibiting substantial potential in low-dimensional scenarios. Motivated by this, we propose a novel 3D-Spectral-Spatial Mamba (3DSS-Mamba) framework for HSI classification, allowing for global spectral-spatial relationship modeling with greater computational efficiency. Technically, a spectral-spatial token generation (SSTG) module is designed to convert the HSI cube into a set of 3D spectral-spatial tokens. To overcome the limitations of traditional Mamba, which is confined to modeling causal sequences and inadaptable to high-dimensional scenarios, a 3D-Spectral-Spatial Selective Scanning (3DSS) mechanism is introduced, which performs pixel-wise selective scanning on 3D hyperspectral tokens along the spectral and spatial dimensions. Five scanning routes are constructed to investigate the impact of dimension prioritization. The 3DSS scanning mechanism combined with conventional mapping operations forms the 3D-spectral-spatial mamba block (3DMB), enabling the extraction of global spectral-spatial semantic representations. Experimental results and analysis demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on HSI classification benchmarks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Exploring the loss landscape offers insights into the inherent principles of deep neural networks (DNNs). Recent work suggests an additional asymmetry of the valley beyond the flat and sharp ones, yet without thoroughly examining its causes or implications. Our study methodically explores the factors affecting the symmetry of DNN valleys, encompassing (1) the dataset, network architecture, initialization, and hyperparameters that influence the convergence point; and (2) the magnitude and direction of the noise for 1D visualization. Our major observation shows that the {\it degree of sign consistency} between the noise and the convergence point is a critical indicator of valley symmetry. Theoretical insights from the aspects of ReLU activation and softmax function could explain the interesting phenomenon. Our discovery propels novel understanding and applications in the scenario of Model Fusion: (1) the efficacy of interpolating separate models significantly correlates with their sign consistency ratio, and (2) imposing sign alignment during federated learning emerges as an innovative approach for model parameter alignment.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Existing solutions to image editing tasks suffer from several issues. Though achieving remarkably satisfying generated results, some supervised methods require huge amounts of paired training data, which greatly limits their usages. The other unsupervised methods take full advantage of large-scale pre-trained priors, thus being strictly restricted to the domains where the priors are trained on and behaving badly in out-of-distribution cases. The task we focus on is how to enable the users to customize their desired effects through only few image pairs. In our proposed framework, a novel few-shot learning mechanism based on the directional transformations among samples is introduced and expands the learnable space exponentially. Adopting a diffusion model pipeline, we redesign the condition calculating modules in our model and apply several technical improvements. Experimental results demonstrate the capabilities of our method in various cases.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, protect, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Enterprise security is increasingly being threatened by social engineering attacks, such as phishing, which deceive employees into giving access to enterprise data. To protect both the users themselves and enterprise data, more and more organizations provide cyber security training that seeks to teach employees/customers to identify and report suspicious content. By its very nature, such training seeks to focus on signals that are likely to persist across a wide range of attacks. Further, it expects the user to apply the learnings from these training on e-mail messages that were not filtered by existing, automatic enterprise security (e.g., spam filters and commercial phishing detection software). However, relying on such training now shifts the detection of phishing from an automatic process to a human driven one which is fallible especially when a user errs due to distraction, forgetfulness, etc. In this work we explore treating this type of detection as a natural language processing task and modifying training pipelines accordingly. We present a dataset with annotated labels where these labels are created from the classes of signals that users are typically asked to identify in such training. We also present baseline classifier models trained on these classes of labels. With a comparative analysis of performance between human annotators and the models on these labels, we provide insights which can contribute to the improvement of the respective curricula for both machine and human training.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Unsupervised Outlier Detection (UOD) is an important data mining task. With the advance of deep learning, deep Outlier Detection (OD) has received broad interest. Most deep UOD models are trained exclusively on clean datasets to learn the distribution of the normal data, which requires huge manual efforts to clean the real-world data if possible. Instead of relying on clean datasets, some approaches directly train and detect on unlabeled contaminated datasets, leading to the need for methods that are robust to such conditions. Ensemble methods emerged as a superior solution to enhance model robustness against contaminated training sets. However, the training time is greatly increased by the ensemble. In this study, we investigate the impact of outliers on the training phase, aiming to halt training on unlabeled contaminated datasets before performance degradation. Initially, we noted that blending normal and anomalous data causes AUC fluctuations, a label-dependent measure of detection accuracy. To circumvent the need for labels, we propose a zero-label entropy metric named Loss Entropy for loss distribution, enabling us to infer optimal stopping points for training without labels. Meanwhile, we theoretically demonstrate negative correlation between entropy metric and the label-based AUC. Based on this, we develop an automated early-stopping algorithm, EntropyStop, which halts training when loss entropy suggests the maximum model detection capability. We conduct extensive experiments on ADBench (including 47 real datasets), and the overall results indicate that AutoEncoder (AE) enhanced by our approach not only achieves better performance than ensemble AEs but also requires under 1\% of training time. Lastly, our proposed metric and early-stopping approach are evaluated on other deep OD models, exhibiting their broad potential applicability.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, security, defense, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Software security continues to be a critical concern for programs implemented in low-level programming languages such as C and C++. Many defenses have been proposed in the current literature, each with different trade-offs including performance, compatibility, and attack resistance. One general class of defense is pointer randomization or authentication, where invalid object access (e.g., memory errors) is obfuscated or denied. Many defenses rely on the program termination (e.g., crashing) to abort attacks, with the implicit assumption that an adversary cannot "brute force" the defense with multiple attack attempts. However, such assumptions do not always hold, such as hardware speculative execution attacks or network servers configured to restart on error. In such cases, we argue that most existing defenses provide only weak effective security. In this paper, we propose Fully Randomized Pointers (FRP) as a stronger memory error defense that is resistant to even brute force attacks. The key idea is to fully randomize pointer bits -- as much as possible while also preserving binary compatibility -- rendering the relationships between pointers highly unpredictable. Furthermore, the very high degree of randomization renders brute force attacks impractical -- providing strong effective security compared to existing work. We design a new FRP encoding that is: (1) compatible with existing binary code (without recompilation); (2) decoupled from the underlying object layout; and (3) can be efficiently decoded on-the-fly to the underlying memory address. We prototype FRP in the form of a software implementation (BlueFat) to test security and compatibility, and a proof-of-concept hardware implementation (GreenFat) to evaluate performance. We show that FRP is secure, practical, and compatible at the binary level, while a hardware implementation can achieve low performance overheads (<10%).</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable success in molecular tasks, yet their interpretability remains challenging. Traditional model-level explanation methods like XGNN and GNNInterpreter often fail to identify valid substructures like rings, leading to questionable interpretability. This limitation stems from XGNN's atom-by-atom approach and GNNInterpreter's reliance on average graph embeddings, which overlook the essential structural elements crucial for molecules. To address these gaps, we introduce an innovative \textbf{M}otif-b\textbf{A}sed \textbf{G}NN \textbf{E}xplainer (MAGE) that uses motifs as fundamental units for generating explanations. Our approach begins with extracting potential motifs through a motif decomposition technique. Then, we utilize an attention-based learning method to identify class-specific motifs. Finally, we employ a motif-based graph generator for each class to create molecular graph explanations based on these class-specific motifs. This novel method not only incorporates critical substructures into the explanations but also guarantees their validity, yielding results that are human-understandable. Our proposed method's effectiveness is demonstrated through quantitative and qualitative assessments conducted on six real-world molecular datasets.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are deep-learning architectures designed for graph-type data, where understanding relationships among individual observations is crucial. However, achieving promising GNN performance, especially on unseen data, requires comprehensive hyperparameter tuning and meticulous training. Unfortunately, these processes come with high computational costs and significant human effort. Additionally, conventional searching algorithms such as grid search may result in overfitting on validation data, diminishing generalization accuracy. To tackle these challenges, we propose a graph conditional latent diffusion framework (GNN-Diff) to generate high-performing GNNs directly by learning from checkpoints saved during a light-tuning coarse search. Our method: (1) unleashes GNN training from heavy tuning and complex search space design; (2) produces GNN parameters that outperform those obtained through comprehensive grid search; and (3) establishes higher-quality generation for GNNs compared to diffusion frameworks designed for general neural networks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, interpretability, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper introduces an efficient and robust method for discovering interpretable circuits in large language models using discrete sparse autoencoders. Our approach addresses key limitations of existing techniques, namely computational complexity and sensitivity to hyperparameters. We propose training sparse autoencoders on carefully designed positive and negative examples, where the model can only correctly predict the next token for the positive examples. We hypothesise that learned representations of attention head outputs will signal when a head is engaged in specific computations. By discretising the learned representations into integer codes and measuring the overlap between codes unique to positive examples for each head, we enable direct identification of attention heads involved in circuits without the need for expensive ablations or architectural modifications. On three well-studied tasks - indirect object identification, greater-than comparisons, and docstring completion - the proposed method achieves higher precision and recall in recovering ground-truth circuits compared to state-of-the-art baselines, while reducing runtime from hours to seconds. Notably, we require only 5-10 text examples for each task to learn robust representations. Our findings highlight the promise of discrete sparse autoencoders for scalable and efficient mechanistic interpretability, offering a new direction for analysing the inner workings of large language models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, membership infer, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Machine unlearning empowers individuals with the `right to be forgotten' by removing their private or sensitive information encoded in machine learning models. However, it remains uncertain whether MU can be effectively applied to Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), particularly in scenarios of forgetting the leaked visual data of concepts. To overcome the challenge, we propose an efficient method, Single Image Unlearning (SIU), to unlearn the visual recognition of a concept by fine-tuning a single associated image for few steps. SIU consists of two key aspects: (i) Constructing Multifaceted fine-tuning data. We introduce four targets, based on which we construct fine-tuning data for the concepts to be forgotten; (ii) Jointly training loss. To synchronously forget the visual recognition of concepts and preserve the utility of MLLMs, we fine-tune MLLMs through a novel Dual Masked KL-divergence Loss combined with Cross Entropy loss. Alongside our method, we establish MMUBench, a new benchmark for MU in MLLMs and introduce a collection of metrics for its evaluation. Experimental results on MMUBench show that SIU completely surpasses the performance of existing methods. Furthermore, we surprisingly find that SIU can avoid invasive membership inference attacks and jailbreak attacks. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore MU in MLLMs. We will release the code and benchmark in the near future.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent in various domains, their ability to process inputs of any length and maintain a degree of memory becomes essential. However, the one-off input of overly long texts is limited, as studies have shown that when input lengths exceed the LLMs' pre-trained text length, there is a dramatic decline in text generation capabilities. Moreover, simply extending the length of pre-training texts is impractical due to the difficulty in obtaining long text data and the substantial memory consumption costs this would entail for LLMs. Recent efforts have employed streaming inputs to alleviate the pressure of excessively long text inputs, but this approach can significantly impair the model's long-term memory capabilities. Motivated by this challenge, we introduce Streaming Infinite Retentive LLM (SirLLM), which allows LLMs to maintain longer memory during infinite-length dialogues without the need for fine-tuning. SirLLM utilizes the Token Entropy metric and a memory decay mechanism to filter key phrases, endowing LLMs with both long-lasting and flexible memory. We designed three distinct tasks and constructed three datasets to measure the effectiveness of SirLLM from various angles: (1) DailyDialog; (2) Grocery Shopping; (3) Rock-Paper-Scissors. Our experimental results robustly demonstrate that SirLLM can achieve stable and significant improvements across different LLMs and tasks, compellingly proving its effectiveness.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Textual image generation spans diverse fields like advertising, education, product packaging, social media, information visualization, and branding. Despite recent strides in language-guided image synthesis using diffusion models, current models excel in image generation but struggle with accurate text rendering and offer limited control over font attributes. In this paper, we aim to enhance the synthesis of high-quality images with precise text customization, thereby contributing to the advancement of image generation models. We call our proposed method CustomText. Our implementation leverages a pre-trained TextDiffuser model to enable control over font color, background, and types. Additionally, to address the challenge of accurately rendering small-sized fonts, we train the ControlNet model for a consistency decoder, significantly enhancing text-generation performance. We assess the performance of CustomText in comparison to previous methods of textual image generation on the publicly available CTW-1500 dataset and a self-curated dataset for small-text generation, showcasing superior results.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable comprehension abilities but face challenges in GPU memory usage during inference, hindering their scalability for real-time applications like chatbots. To accelerate inference, we store computed keys and values (KV cache) in the GPU memory. Existing methods study the KV cache compression to reduce memory by pruning the pre-computed KV cache. However, they neglect the inter-layer dependency between layers and huge memory consumption in pre-computation. To explore these deficiencies, we find that the number of crucial keys and values that influence future generations decreases layer by layer and we can extract them by the consistency in attention weights. Based on the findings, we propose PyramidInfer, a method that compresses the KV cache by layer-wise retaining crucial context. PyramidInfer saves significant memory by computing fewer keys and values without sacrificing performance. Experimental results show PyramidInfer improves 2.2x throughput compared to Accelerate with over 54% GPU memory reduction in KV cache.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>For visual content generation, discrepancies between user intentions and the generated content have been a longstanding problem. This discrepancy arises from two main factors. First, user intentions are inherently complex, with subtle details not fully captured by input prompts. The absence of such details makes it challenging for generative models to accurately reflect the intended meaning, leading to a mismatch between the desired and generated output. Second, generative models trained on visual-label pairs lack the comprehensive knowledge to accurately represent all aspects of the input data in their generated outputs. To address these challenges, we propose a knowledge-enhanced iterative refinement framework for visual content generation. We begin by analyzing and identifying the key challenges faced by existing generative models. Then, we introduce various knowledge sources, including human insights, pre-trained models, logic rules, and world knowledge, which can be leveraged to address these challenges. Furthermore, we propose a novel visual generation framework that incorporates a knowledge-based feedback module to iteratively refine the generation process. This module gradually improves the alignment between the generated content and user intentions. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework through preliminary results, highlighting the potential of knowledge-enhanced generative models for intention-aligned content generation.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Current methods for Video Moment Retrieval (VMR) struggle to align complex situations involving specific environmental details, character descriptions, and action narratives. To tackle this issue, we propose a Large Language Model-guided Moment Retrieval (LMR) approach that employs the extensive knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve video context representation as well as cross-modal alignment, facilitating accurate localization of target moments. Specifically, LMR introduces a context enhancement technique with LLMs to generate crucial target-related context semantics. These semantics are integrated with visual features for producing discriminative video representations. Finally, a language-conditioned transformer is designed to decode free-form language queries, on the fly, using aligned video representations for moment retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LMR achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming the nearest competitor by up to 3.28\% and 4.06\% on the challenging QVHighlights and Charades-STA benchmarks, respectively. More importantly, the performance gains are significantly higher for localization of complex queries.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This research introduces an innovative approach to explore the cognitive and biologically inspired underpinnings of feature vector splitting for analyzing the significance of different attributes in e-security biometric signature recognition applications. Departing from traditional methods of concatenating features into an extended set, we employ multiple splitting strategies, aligning with cognitive principles, to preserve control over the relative importance of each feature subset. Our methodology is applied to three diverse databases (MCYT100, MCYT300,and SVC) using two classifiers (vector quantization and dynamic time warping with one and five training samples). Experimentation demonstrates that the fusion of pressure data with spatial coordinates (x and y) consistently enhances performance. However, the inclusion of pen-tip angles in the same feature set yields mixed results, with performance improvements observed in select cases. This work delves into the cognitive aspects of feature fusion,shedding light on the cognitive relevance of feature vector splitting in e-security biometric applications.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Fact-checking based on commercial LLMs has become mainstream. Although these methods offer high explainability, it falls short in accuracy compared to traditional fine-tuning approaches, and data security is also a significant concern. In this paper, we propose a self-instruction based fine-tuning approach for fact-checking that balances accuracy and explainability. Our method consists of Data Augmentation and Improved DPO fine-tuning. The former starts by instructing the model to generate both positive and negative explanations based on claim-evidence pairs and labels, then sampling the dataset according to our customized difficulty standards. The latter employs our proposed improved DPO to fine-tune the model using the generated samples. We fine-tune the smallest-scale LLaMA-7B model and evaluate it on the challenging fact-checking datasets FEVEROUS and HOVER, utilizing four fine-tuning methods and three few-shot learning methods for comparison. The experiments demonstrate that our approach not only retains accuracy comparable to, or even surpassing, traditional fine-tuning methods, but also generates fluent explanation text. Moreover, it also exhibit high generalization performance. Our method is the first to leverage self-supervised learning for fact-checking and innovatively combines contrastive learning and improved DPO in fine-tuning LLMs, as shown in the experiments.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>federate, fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated Learning (FL) allows clients to train a model collaboratively without sharing their private data. One key challenge in practical FL systems is data heterogeneity, particularly in handling clients with rare data, also referred to as Mavericks. These clients own one or more data classes exclusively, and the model performance becomes poor without their participation. Thus, utilizing Mavericks throughout training is crucial. In this paper, we first design a Maverick-aware Shapley valuation that fairly evaluates the contribution of Mavericks. The main idea is to compute the clients' Shapley values (SV) class-wise, i.e., per label. Next, we propose FedMS, a Maverick-Shapley client selection mechanism for FL that intelligently selects the clients that contribute the most in each round, by employing our Maverick-aware SV-based contribution score. We show that, compared to an extensive list of baselines, FedMS achieves better model performance and fairer Shapley Rewards distribution.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Key-value~(KV) caching is an important technique to accelerate the inference of large language models~(LLMs), but incurs significant memory overhead. To compress the size of KV cache, existing methods often compromise precision or require extra data for calibration, limiting their practicality in LLM deployment. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{DecoQuant}, a novel data-free low-bit quantization technique based on tensor decomposition methods, to effectively compress KV cache. Our core idea is to adjust the outlier distribution of the original matrix by performing tensor decomposition, so that the quantization difficulties are migrated from the matrix to decomposed local tensors. Specially, we find that outliers mainly concentrate on small local tensors, while large tensors tend to have a narrower value range. Based on this finding, we propose to apply low-bit quantization to the large tensor, while maintaining high-precision representation for the small tensor. Furthermore, we utilize the proposed quantization method to compress the KV cache of LLMs to accelerate the inference and develop an efficient dequantization kernel tailored specifically for DecoQuant. Through extensive experiments, DecoQuant demonstrates remarkable efficiency gains, showcasing up to a $\sim$75\% reduction in memory footprint while maintaining comparable generation quality.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>LiDAR-based 3D object detection has made impressive progress recently, yet most existing models are black-box, lacking interpretability. Previous explanation approaches primarily focus on analyzing image-based models and are not readily applicable to LiDAR-based 3D detectors. In this paper, we propose a feature factorization activation map (FFAM) to generate high-quality visual explanations for 3D detectors. FFAM employs non-negative matrix factorization to generate concept activation maps and subsequently aggregates these maps to obtain a global visual explanation. To achieve object-specific visual explanations, we refine the global visual explanation using the feature gradient of a target object. Additionally, we introduce a voxel upsampling strategy to align the scale between the activation map and input point cloud. We qualitatively and quantitatively analyze FFAM with multiple detectors on several datasets. Experimental results validate the high-quality visual explanations produced by FFAM.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>defense, robust, diffusion, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the proliferation of red-teaming strategies for Large Language Models (LLMs), the deficiency in the literature about improving the safety and robustness of LLM defense strategies is becoming increasingly pronounced. This paper introduces the LLM-based \textbf{sentinel} model as a plug-and-play prefix module designed to reconstruct the input prompt with just a few ($<30$) additional tokens, effectively reducing toxicity in responses from target LLMs. The sentinel model naturally overcomes the \textit{parameter inefficiency} and \textit{limited model accessibility} for fine-tuning large target models. We employ an interleaved training regimen using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to optimize both red team and sentinel models dynamically, incorporating a value head-sharing mechanism inspired by the multi-agent centralized critic to manage the complex interplay between agents. Our extensive experiments across text-to-text and text-to-image demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in mitigating toxic outputs, even when dealing with larger models like \texttt{Llama-2}, \texttt{GPT-3.5} and \texttt{Stable-Diffusion}, highlighting the potential of our framework in enhancing safety and robustness in various applications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Reconstructing dynamic articulated objects from a singular monocular video is challenging, requiring joint estimation of shape, motion, and camera parameters from limited views. Current methods typically demand extensive computational resources and training time, and require additional human annotations such as predefined parametric models, camera poses, and key points, limiting their generalizability. We propose Synergistic Shape and Skeleton Optimization (S3O), a novel two-phase method that forgoes these prerequisites and efficiently learns parametric models including visible shapes and underlying skeletons. Conventional strategies typically learn all parameters simultaneously, leading to interdependencies where a single incorrect prediction can result in significant errors. In contrast, S3O adopts a phased approach: it first focuses on learning coarse parametric models, then progresses to motion learning and detail addition. This method substantially lowers computational complexity and enhances robustness in reconstruction from limited viewpoints, all without requiring additional annotations. To address the current inadequacies in 3D reconstruction from monocular video benchmarks, we collected the PlanetZoo dataset. Our experimental evaluations on standard benchmarks and the PlanetZoo dataset affirm that S3O provides more accurate 3D reconstruction, and plausible skeletons, and reduces the training time by approximately 60% compared to the state-of-the-art, thus advancing the state of the art in dynamic object reconstruction.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Open source large language models (LLMs) have shown great improvements in recent times. However, many of these models are focused solely on popular spoken languages. We present a high quality dataset of more than 70k prompt-response pairs in 74 languages which consist of human generated prompts and synthetic responses. We use this dataset to train a state-of-the-art open source English LLM to chat multilingually. We evaluate our model on MT-Bench chat benchmarks in 6 languages, finding that our multilingual model outperforms previous state-of-the-art open source LLMs across each language. We further find that training on more multilingual data is beneficial to the performance in a chosen target language (Japanese) compared to simply training on only data in that language. These results indicate the necessity of training on large amounts of high quality multilingual data to make a more accessible LLM.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Emergence, broadly conceptualized as the ``intelligent'' behaviors of LLMs, has recently been studied and proved challenging to quantify due to the lack of a measurable definition. Most commonly, it has been estimated statistically through model performances across extensive datasets and tasks, which consumes significant resources. In addition, such estimation is difficult to interpret and may not accurately reflect the models' intrinsic emergence. In this work, we propose a quantifiable solution for estimating emergence. Inspired by emergentism in dynamics, we quantify the strength of emergence by comparing the entropy reduction of the macroscopic (semantic) level with that of the microscopic (token) level, both of which are derived from the representations within the transformer block. Using a low-cost estimator, our quantification method demonstrates consistent behaviors across a suite of LMs (GPT-2, GEMMA, etc.) under both in-context learning (ICL) and natural sentences. Empirical results show that (1) our method gives consistent measurements which align with existing observations based on performance metrics, validating the effectiveness of our emergence quantification; (2) our proposed metric uncovers novel emergence patterns such as the correlations between the variance of our metric and the number of ``shots'' in ICL, which further suggests a new way of interpreting hallucinations in LLMs; (3) we offer a potential solution towards estimating the emergence of larger and closed-resource LMs via smaller LMs like GPT-2.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionised the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and have achieved state-of-the-art performance in practically every task in this field. However, the prevalent approach used in text generation, Causal Language Modelling (CLM), which generates text sequentially from left to right, inherently limits the freedom of the model, which does not decide when and where each token is generated. In contrast, Masked Language Modelling (MLM), primarily used for language understanding tasks, can generate tokens anywhere in the text and any order. This paper conducts an extensive comparison of MLM and CLM approaches for text generation tasks. To do so, we pre-train several language models of comparable sizes on three different datasets, namely 1) medical discharge summaries, 2) movie plot synopses, and 3) authorship verification datasets. To assess the quality of the generations, we first employ quantitative metrics and then perform a qualitative human evaluation to analyse coherence and grammatical correctness. In addition, we evaluate the usefulness of the generated texts by using them in three different downstream tasks: 1) Entity Recognition, 2) Text Classification, and 3) Authorship Verification. The results show that MLM consistently outperforms CLM in text generation across all datasets, with higher quantitative scores and better coherence in the generated text. The study also finds \textit{no strong correlation} between the quality of the generated text and the performance of the models in the downstream tasks. With this study, we show that MLM for text generation has great potential for future research and provides direction for future studies in this area.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Haar Cascade is a cost-effective and user-friendly machine learning-based algorithm for detecting objects in images and videos. Unlike Deep Learning algorithms, which typically require significant resources and expensive computing costs, it uses simple image processing techniques like edge detection and Haar features that are easy to comprehend and implement. By combining Haar Cascade with OpenCV2 on an embedded computer like the NVIDIA Jetson Nano, this system can accurately detect and match faces in a database for attendance tracking. This system aims to achieve several specific objectives that set it apart from existing solutions. It leverages Haar Cascade, enriched with carefully selected Haar features, such as Haar-like wavelets, and employs advanced edge detection techniques. These techniques enable precise face detection and matching in both images and videos, contributing to high accuracy and robust performance. By doing so, it minimizes manual intervention and reduces errors, thereby strengthening accountability. Additionally, the integration of OpenCV2 and the NVIDIA Jetson Nano optimizes processing efficiency, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments. This system caters to a diverse range of educational institutions, including schools, colleges, vocational training centers, and various workplace settings such as small businesses, offices, and factories. ... The system's affordability and efficiency democratize attendance management technology, making it accessible to a broader audience. Consequently, it has the potential to transform attendance tracking and management practices, ultimately leading to heightened productivity and accountability.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Extrapolation in Large language models (LLMs) for open-ended inquiry encounters two pivotal issues: (1) hallucination and (2) expensive training costs. These issues present challenges for LLMs in specialized domains and personalized data, requiring truthful responses and low fine-tuning costs. Existing works attempt to tackle the problem by augmenting the input of a smaller language model with information from a knowledge graph (KG). However, they have two limitations: (1) failing to extract relevant information from a large one-hop neighborhood in KG and (2) applying the same augmentation strategy for KGs with different characteristics that may result in low performance. Moreover, open-ended inquiry typically yields multiple responses, further complicating extrapolation. We propose a new task, the extreme multi-label KG link prediction task, to enable a model to perform extrapolation with multiple responses using structured real-world knowledge. Our retriever identifies relevant one-hop neighbors by considering entity, relation, and textual data together. Our experiments demonstrate that (1) KGs with different characteristics require different augmenting strategies, and (2) augmenting the language model's input with textual data improves task performance significantly. By incorporating the retrieval-augmented framework with KG, our framework, with a small parameter size, is able to extrapolate based on a given KG.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) instances is crucial for the reliable deployment of machine learning models in real-world scenarios. OOD inputs are commonly expected to cause a more uncertain prediction in the primary task; however, there are OOD cases for which the model returns a highly confident prediction. This phenomenon, denoted as "overconfidence", presents a challenge to OOD detection. Specifically, theoretical evidence indicates that overconfidence is an intrinsic property of certain neural network architectures, leading to poor OOD detection. In this work, we address this issue by measuring extreme activation values in the penultimate layer of neural networks and then leverage this proxy of overconfidence to improve on several OOD detection baselines. We test our method on a wide array of experiments spanning synthetic data and real-world data, tabular and image datasets, multiple architectures such as ResNet and Transformer, different training loss functions, and include the scenarios examined in previous theoretical work. Compared to the baselines, our method often grants substantial improvements, with double-digit increases in OOD detection AUC, and it does not damage performance in any scenario.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Affective Image Manipulation (AIM) seeks to modify user-provided images to evoke specific emotional responses. This task is inherently complex due to its twofold objective: significantly evoking the intended emotion, while preserving the original image composition. Existing AIM methods primarily adjust color and style, often failing to elicit precise and profound emotional shifts. Drawing on psychological insights, we extend AIM by incorporating content modifications to enhance emotional impact. We introduce EmoEdit, a novel two-stage framework comprising emotion attribution and image editing. In the emotion attribution stage, we leverage a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to create hierarchies of semantic factors that represent abstract emotions. In the image editing stage, the VLM identifies the most relevant factors for the provided image, and guides a generative editing model to perform affective modifications. A ranking technique that we developed selects the best edit, balancing between emotion fidelity and structure integrity. To validate EmoEdit, we assembled a dataset of 416 images, categorized into positive, negative, and neutral classes. Our method is evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques. Additionally, we showcase EmoEdit's potential in various manipulation tasks, including emotion-oriented and semantics-oriented editing.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Wrinkle defects were found widely exist in the field of industrial products, i.e. wind turbine blades and filament-wound composite pressure vessels. The magnitude of wrinkle wavelength varies from several millimeters to over one hundred millimeters. Locating the wrinkle defects and measuring their responses are very important to the assessment of the structures that containing wrinkle defects. A meso-mechanical modeling is presented based on the homogenization method to obtain the effective stiffness of a graded wrinkle. The finite element simulation predicts the trans-scale response of out-of-plane displacement of wrinkled laminates, where the maximum displacement ranges from nanoscale to millimeter scale. Such trans-scale effect requires different measurement approaches to observe the displacement responses. Here we employed Shearography (Speckle Pattern Shearing Interferometry) and fringe projection profilometry (FPP) method respectively according to the different magnitude of displacement. In FPP method, a displacement extraction algorithm was presented to obtain the out-of-plane displacement. The measurement sensitivity and accuracy of Shearography and FPP are compared, which provides a quantitative reference for industrial non-destructive test.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the field of autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) landing, conventional approaches fall short in delivering not only the required precision but also the resilience against environmental disturbances. Yet, learning-based algorithms can offer promising solutions by leveraging their ability to learn the intelligent behaviour from data. On one hand, this paper introduces a novel multimodal transformer-based Deep Learning detector, that can provide reliable positioning for precise autonomous landing. It surpasses standard approaches by addressing individual sensor limitations, achieving high reliability even in diverse weather and sensor failure conditions. It was rigorously validated across varying environments, achieving optimal true positive rates and average precisions of up to 90%. On the other hand, it is proposed a Reinforcement Learning (RL) decision-making model, based on a Deep Q-Network (DQN) rationale. Initially trained in sumlation, its adaptive behaviour is successfully transferred and validated in a real outdoor scenario. Furthermore, this approach demonstrates rapid inference times of approximately 5ms, validating its applicability on edge devices.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the medical domain, numerous scenarios necessitate the long-form generation ability of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, when addressing patients' questions, it is essential that the model's response conveys factual claims, highlighting the need for an automated method to evaluate those claims. Thus, we introduce MedLFQA, a benchmark dataset reconstructed using long-form question-answering datasets related to the biomedical domain. We use MedLFQA to facilitate the automatic evaluations of factuality. We also propose OLAPH, a simple and novel framework that enables the improvement of factuality through automatic evaluations. The OLAPH framework iteratively trains LLMs to mitigate hallucinations using sampling predictions and preference optimization. In other words, we iteratively set the highest-scoring response as a preferred response derived from sampling predictions and train LLMs to align with the preferred response that improves factuality. We highlight that, even on evaluation metrics not used during training, LLMs trained with our OLAPH framework demonstrate significant performance improvement in factuality. Our findings reveal that a 7B LLM trained with our OLAPH framework can provide long answers comparable to the medical experts' answers in terms of factuality. We believe that our work could shed light on gauging the long-text generation ability of LLMs in the medical domain. Our code and datasets are available at this https URL}{this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this article, we propose the detection of crowd anomalies through the extraction of information in the form of time series from video format using a multimodal approach. Through pattern recognition algorithms and segmentation, informative measures of the number of people and image occupancy are extracted at regular intervals, which are then analyzed to obtain trends and anomalous behaviors. Specifically, through temporal decomposition and residual analysis, intervals or specific situations of unusual behaviors are identified, which can be used in decision-making and improvement of actions in sectors related to human movement such as tourism or security. The application of this methodology on the webcam of Turisme Comunitat Valenciana in the town of Morella (Comunitat Valenciana, Spain) has provided excellent results. It is shown to correctly detect specific anomalous situations and unusual overall increases during the previous weekend and during the festivities in October 2023. These results have been obtained while preserving the confidentiality of individuals at all times by using measures that maximize anonymity, without trajectory recording or person recognition.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The Otago Exercise Program (OEP) serves as a vital rehabilitation initiative for older adults, aiming to enhance their strength and balance, and consequently prevent falls. While Human Activity Recognition (HAR) systems have been widely employed in recognizing the activities of individuals, existing systems focus on the duration of macro activities (i.e. a sequence of repetitions of the same exercise), neglecting the ability to discern micro activities (i.e. the individual repetitions of the exercises), in the case of OEP. This study presents a novel semi-supervised machine learning approach aimed at bridging this gap in recognizing the micro activities of OEP. To manage the limited dataset size, our model utilizes a Transformer encoder for feature extraction, subsequently classified by a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN). Simultaneously, the Transformer encoder is employed for masked unsupervised learning to reconstruct input signals. Results indicate that the masked unsupervised learning task enhances the performance of the supervised learning (classification task), as evidenced by f1-scores surpassing the clinically applicable threshold of 0.8. From the micro activities, two clinically relevant outcomes emerge: counting the number of repetitions of each exercise and calculating the velocity during chair rising. These outcomes enable the automatic monitoring of exercise intensity and difficulty in the daily lives of older adults.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, defense, attack, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Backdoor attacks have attracted wide attention from academia and industry due to their great security threat to deep neural networks (DNN). Most of the existing methods propose to conduct backdoor attacks by poisoning the training dataset with different strategies, so it's critical to identify the poisoned samples and then train a clean model on the unreliable dataset in the context of defending backdoor attacks. Although numerous backdoor countermeasure researches are proposed, their inherent weaknesses render them limited in practical scenarios, such as the requirement of enough clean samples, unstable defense performance under various attack conditions, poor defense performance against adaptive attacks, and so on.Therefore, in this paper, we are committed to overcome the above limitations and propose a more practical backdoor defense method. Concretely, we first explore the inherent relationship between the potential perturbations and the backdoor trigger, and the theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the poisoned samples perform more robustness to perturbation than the clean ones. Then, based on our key explorations, we introduce AdvrBD, an Adversarial perturbation-based and robust Backdoor Defense framework, which can effectively identify the poisoned samples and train a clean model on the poisoned dataset. Constructively, our AdvrBD eliminates the requirement for any clean samples or knowledge about the poisoned dataset (e.g., poisoning ratio), which significantly improves the practicality in real-world scenarios.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, robust, biometric</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As a representative of a new generation of biometrics, vein identification technology offers a high level of security and convenience. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a prominent class of deep learning architectures, have been extensively utilized for vein identification. Since their performance and robustness are limited by small Effective Receptive Fields (e.g. 3$\times$3 kernels) and insufficient training samples, however, they are unable to extract global feature representations from vein images in an effective manner. To address these issues, we propose StarLKNet, a large kernel convolution-based palm-vein identification network, with the Mixup approach. Our StarMix learns effectively the distribution of vein features to expand samples. To enable CNNs to capture comprehensive feature representations from palm-vein images, we explored the effect of convolutional kernel size on the performance of palm-vein identification networks and designed LaKNet, a network leveraging large kernel convolution and gating mechanism. In light of the current state of knowledge, this represents an inaugural instance of the deployment of a CNN with large kernels in the domain of vein identification. Extensive experiments were conducted to validate the performance of StarLKNet on two public palm-vein datasets. The results demonstrated that StarMix provided superior augmentation, and LakNet exhibited more stable performance gains compared to mainstream approaches, resulting in the highest recognition accuracy and lowest identification error.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>defense, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Model quantization is widely used to compress and accelerate deep neural networks. However, recent studies have revealed the feasibility of weaponizing model quantization via implanting quantization-conditioned backdoors (QCBs). These special backdoors stay dormant on released full-precision models but will come into effect after standard quantization. Due to the peculiarity of QCBs, existing defenses have minor effects on reducing their threats or are even infeasible. In this paper, we conduct the first in-depth analysis of QCBs. We reveal that the activation of existing QCBs primarily stems from the nearest rounding operation and is closely related to the norms of neuron-wise truncation errors (i.e., the difference between the continuous full-precision weights and its quantized version). Motivated by these insights, we propose Error-guided Flipped Rounding with Activation Preservation (EFRAP), an effective and practical defense against QCBs. Specifically, EFRAP learns a non-nearest rounding strategy with neuron-wise error norm and layer-wise activation preservation guidance, flipping the rounding strategies of neurons crucial for backdoor effects but with minimal impact on clean accuracy. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our EFRAP can defeat state-of-the-art QCB attacks under various settings. Code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Human preference alignment is critical in building powerful and reliable large language models (LLMs). However, current methods either ignore the multi-dimensionality of human preferences (e.g. helpfulness and harmlessness) or struggle with the complexity of managing multiple reward models. To address these issues, we propose Sequential Preference Optimization (SPO), a method that sequentially fine-tunes LLMs to align with multiple dimensions of human preferences. SPO avoids explicit reward modeling, directly optimizing the models to align with nuanced human preferences. We theoretically derive closed-form optimal SPO policy and loss function. Gradient analysis is conducted to show how SPO manages to fine-tune the LLMs while maintaining alignment on previously optimized dimensions. Empirical results on LLMs of different size and multiple evaluation datasets demonstrate that SPO successfully aligns LLMs across multiple dimensions of human preferences and significantly outperforms the baselines.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, privacy, attack, steal</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As a novel privacy-preserving paradigm aimed at reducing client computational costs and achieving data utility, split learning has garnered extensive attention and proliferated widespread applications across various fields, including smart health and smart transportation, among others. While recent studies have primarily concentrated on addressing privacy leakage concerns in split learning, such as inference attacks and data reconstruction, the exploration of security issues (e.g., backdoor attacks) within the framework of split learning has been comparatively limited. Nonetheless, the security vulnerability within the context of split learning is highly posing a threat and can give rise to grave security implications, such as the illegal impersonation in the face recognition model. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a stealthy backdoor attack strategy (namely SBAT) tailored to the without-label-sharing split learning architecture, which unveils the inherent security vulnerability of split learning. We posit the existence of a potential attacker on the server side aiming to introduce a backdoor into the training model, while exploring two scenarios: one with known client network architecture and the other with unknown architecture. Diverging from traditional backdoor attack methods that manipulate the training data and labels, we constructively conduct the backdoor attack by injecting the trigger embedding into the server network. Specifically, our SBAT achieves a higher level of attack stealthiness by refraining from modifying any intermediate parameters (e.g., gradients) during training and instead executing all malicious operations post-training.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vision-Language Instruction Tuning (VLIT) is a critical training phase for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). With the improving capabilities of open-source LVLMs, researchers have increasingly turned to generate VLIT data by using open-source LVLMs and achieved significant progress. However, such data generation approaches are bottlenecked by the following challenges: 1) Since multi-modal models tend to be influenced by prior language knowledge, directly using LVLMs to generate VLIT data would inevitably lead to low content relevance between generated data and images. 2) To improve the ability of the models to generate VLIT data, previous methods have incorporated an additional training phase to boost the generative capacity. This process hurts the generalization of the models to unseen inputs (i.e., "exposure bias" problem). In this paper, we propose a new Content Correlated VLIT data generation via Contrastive Learning (C3L). Specifically, we design a new content relevance module which enhances the content relevance between VLIT data and images by computing Image Instruction Correspondence Scores S(I2C). Moreover, a contrastive learning module is introduced to further boost the VLIT data generation capability of the LVLMs. A large number of automatic measures on four benchmarks show the effectiveness of our method.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The visual pathway of human brain includes two sub-pathways, ie, the ventral pathway and the dorsal pathway, which focus on object identification and dynamic information modeling, respectively. Both pathways comprise multi-layer structures, with each layer responsible for processing different aspects of visual information. Inspired by visual information processing mechanism of the human brain, we propose the Brain Inspired Masked Modeling (BIMM) framework, aiming to learn comprehensive representations from videos. Specifically, our approach consists of ventral and dorsal branches, which learn image and video representations, respectively. Both branches employ the Vision Transformer (ViT) as their backbone and are trained using masked modeling method. To achieve the goals of different visual cortices in the brain, we segment the encoder of each branch into three intermediate blocks and reconstruct progressive prediction targets with light weight decoders. Furthermore, drawing inspiration from the information-sharing mechanism in the visual pathways, we propose a partial parameter sharing strategy between the branches during training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BIMM achieves superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Unsupervised pre-training has emerged as a transformative paradigm, displaying remarkable advancements in various domains. However, the susceptibility to domain shift, where pre-training data distribution differs from fine-tuning, poses a significant obstacle. To address this, we augment the Swin Transformer to learn from different medical imaging modalities, enhancing downstream performance. Our model, dubbed SwinFUSE (Swin Multi-Modal Fusion for UnSupervised Enhancement), offers three key advantages: (i) it learns from both Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) during pre-training, resulting in complementary feature representations; (ii) a domain-invariance module (DIM) that effectively highlights salient input regions, enhancing adaptability; (iii) exhibits remarkable generalizability, surpassing the confines of tasks it was initially pre-trained on. Our experiments on two publicly available 3D segmentation datasets show a modest 1-2% performance trade-off compared to single-modality models, yet significant out-performance of up to 27% on out-of-distribution modality. This substantial improvement underscores our proposed approach's practical relevance and real-world applicability. Code is available at: this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Inpainting lesions within different normal backgrounds is a potential method of addressing the generalization problem, which is crucial for polyp segmentation models. However, seamlessly introducing polyps into complex endoscopic environments while simultaneously generating accurate pseudo-masks remains a challenge for current inpainting methods. To address these issues, we first leverage the pre-trained Stable Diffusion Inpaint and ControlNet, to introduce a robust generative model capable of inpainting polyps across different backgrounds. Secondly, we utilize the prior that synthetic polyps are confined to the inpainted region, to establish an inpainted region-guided pseudo-mask refinement network. We also propose a sample selection strategy that prioritizes well-aligned and hard synthetic cases for further model fine-tuning. Experiments demonstrate that our inpainting model outperformed baseline methods both qualitatively and quantitatively in inpainting quality. Moreover, our data augmentation strategy significantly enhances the performance of polyp segmentation models on external datasets, achieving or surpassing the level of fully supervised training benchmarks in that domain.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, attack, robust, steal</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Face Recognition Systems (FRS) have increasingly integrated into critical applications, including surveillance and user authentication, highlighting their pivotal role in modern security systems. Recent studies have revealed vulnerabilities in FRS to adversarial (e.g., adversarial patch attacks) and backdoor attacks (e.g., training data poisoning), raising significant concerns about their reliability and trustworthiness. Previous studies primarily focus on traditional adversarial or backdoor attacks, overlooking the resource-intensive or privileged-manipulation nature of such threats, thus limiting their practical generalization, stealthiness, universality and robustness. Correspondingly, in this paper, we delve into the inherent vulnerabilities in FRS through user studies and preliminary explorations. By exploiting these vulnerabilities, we identify a novel attack, facial identity backdoor attack dubbed FIBA, which unveils a potentially more devastating threat against FRS:an enrollment-stage backdoor attack. FIBA circumvents the limitations of traditional attacks, enabling broad-scale disruption by allowing any attacker donning a specific trigger to bypass these systems. This implies that after a single, poisoned example is inserted into the database, the corresponding trigger becomes a universal key for any attackers to spoof the FRS. This strategy essentially challenges the conventional attacks by initiating at the enrollment stage, dramatically transforming the threat landscape by poisoning the feature database rather than the training data.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generating customized content in videos has received increasing attention recently. However, existing works primarily focus on customized text-to-video generation for single subject, suffering from subject-missing and attribute-binding problems when the video is expected to contain multiple subjects. Furthermore, existing models struggle to assign the desired actions to the corresponding subjects (action-binding problem), failing to achieve satisfactory multi-subject generation performance. To tackle the problems, in this paper, we propose DisenStudio, a novel framework that can generate text-guided videos for customized multiple subjects, given few images for each subject. Specifically, DisenStudio enhances a pretrained diffusion-based text-to-video model with our proposed spatial-disentangled cross-attention mechanism to associate each subject with the desired action. Then the model is customized for the multiple subjects with the proposed motion-preserved disentangled finetuning, which involves three tuning strategies: multi-subject co-occurrence tuning, masked single-subject tuning, and multi-subject motion-preserved tuning. The first two strategies guarantee the subject occurrence and preserve their visual attributes, and the third strategy helps the model maintain the temporal motion-generation ability when finetuning on static images. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate our proposed DisenStudio significantly outperforms existing methods in various metrics. Additionally, we show that DisenStudio can be used as a powerful tool for various controllable generation applications.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper , we introduce Wav-KAN, an innovative neural network architecture that leverages the Wavelet Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (Wav-KAN) framework to enhance interpretability and performance. Traditional multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and even recent advancements like Spl-KAN face challenges related to interpretability, training speed, robustness, computational efficiency, and performance. Wav-KAN addresses these limitations by incorporating wavelet functions into the Kolmogorov-Arnold network structure, enabling the network to capture both high-frequency and low-frequency components of the input data efficiently. Wavelet-based approximations employ orthogonal or semi-orthogonal basis and also maintains a balance between accurately representing the underlying data structure and avoiding overfitting to the noise. Analogous to how water conforms to the shape of its container, Wav-KAN adapts to the data structure, resulting in enhanced accuracy, faster training speeds, and increased robustness compared to Spl-KAN and MLPs. Our results highlight the potential of Wav-KAN as a powerful tool for developing interpretable and high-performance neural networks, with applications spanning various fields. This work sets the stage for further exploration and implementation of Wav-KAN in frameworks such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, and also it makes wavelet in KAN in wide-spread usage like nowadays activation functions like ReLU, sigmoid in universal approximation theory (UAT).</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Automatic radiology report generation can alleviate the workload for physicians and minimize regional disparities in medical resources, therefore becoming an important topic in the medical image analysis field. It is a challenging task, as the computational model needs to mimic physicians to obtain information from multi-modal input data (i.e., medical images, clinical information, medical knowledge, etc.), and produce comprehensive and accurate reports. Recently, numerous works emerged to address this issue using deep learning-based methods, such as transformers, contrastive learning, and knowledge-base construction. This survey summarizes the key techniques developed in the most recent works and proposes a general workflow for deep learning-based report generation with five main components, including multi-modality data acquisition, data preparation, feature learning, feature fusion/interaction, and report generation. The state-of-the-art methods for each of these components are highlighted. Additionally, training strategies, public datasets, evaluation methods, current challenges, and future directions in this field are summarized. We have also conducted a quantitative comparison between different methods under the same experimental setting. This is the most up-to-date survey that focuses on multi-modality inputs and data fusion for radiology report generation. The aim is to provide comprehensive and rich information for researchers interested in automatic clinical report generation and medical image analysis, especially when using multimodal inputs, and assist them in developing new algorithms to advance the field.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Cyber deception techniques that are tightly intertwined with applications pose significant technical challenges in production systems. Security measures are usually the responsibility of a system operator, but they are typically limited to accessing built software artifacts, not their source code. This limitation makes it particularly challenging to deploy cyber deception techniques at application runtime and without full control over the software development lifecycle. This work reviews 19 technical methods to accomplish this and evaluates them based on technical, topological, operational, and efficacy properties. We find some novel techniques beyond honeypots and reverse proxies that seem to have received little research interest despite their promise for cyber deception. We believe that overcoming these technical challenges can drive the adoption of more dynamic and personalized cyber deception techniques, tailored to specific classes of applications.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Leveraging complementary relationships across modalities has recently drawn a lot of attention in multimodal emotion recognition. Most of the existing approaches explored cross-attention to capture the complementary relationships across the modalities. However, the modalities may also exhibit weak complementary relationships, which may deteriorate the cross-attended features, resulting in poor multimodal feature representations. To address this problem, we propose Inconsistency-Aware Cross-Attention (IACA), which can adaptively select the most relevant features on-the-fly based on the strong or weak complementary relationships across audio and visual modalities. Specifically, we design a two-stage gating mechanism that can adaptively select the appropriate relevant features to deal with weak complementary relationships. Extensive experiments are conducted on the challenging Aff-Wild2 dataset to show the robustness of the proposed model.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Computer vision techniques are on the rise for industrial applications, like process supervision and autonomous agents, e.g., in the healthcare domain and dangerous environments. While the general usability of these techniques is high, there are still challenging real-world use-cases. Especially transparent structures, which can appear in the form of glass doors, protective casings or everyday objects like glasses, pose a challenge for computer vision methods. This paper evaluates the combination of transparent objects in conjunction with (naturally occurring) contamination through environmental effects like hazing. We introduce a novel publicly available dataset containing 489 images incorporating three grades of water droplet contamination on transparent structures and examine the resulting influence on transparency handling. Our findings show, that contaminated transparent objects are easier to segment and that we are able to distinguish between different severity levels of contamination with a current state-of-the art machine-learning model. This in turn opens up the possibility to enhance computer vision systems regarding resilience against, e.g., datashifts through contaminated protection casings or implement an automated cleaning alert.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Semantic Image Segmentation facilitates a multitude of real-world applications ranging from autonomous driving over industrial process supervision to vision aids for human beings. These models are usually trained in a supervised fashion using example inputs. Distribution Shifts between these examples and the inputs in operation may cause erroneous segmentations. The robustness of semantic segmentation models against distribution shifts caused by differing camera or lighting setups, lens distortions, adversarial inputs and image corruptions has been topic of recent research. However, robustness against spatially varying radial distortion effects that can be caused by uneven glass structures (e.g. windows) or the chaotic refraction in heated air has not been addressed by the research community yet. We propose a method to synthetically augment existing datasets with spatially varying distortions. Our experiments show, that these distortion effects degrade the performance of state-of-the-art segmentation models. Pretraining and enlarged model capacities proof to be suitable strategies for mitigating performance degradation to some degree, while fine-tuning on distorted images only leads to marginal performance improvements.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Remote sensing image change captioning (RSICC) aims at generating human-like language to describe the semantic changes between bi-temporal remote sensing image pairs. It provides valuable insights into environmental dynamics and land management. Unlike conventional change captioning task, RSICC involves not only retrieving relevant information across different modalities and generating fluent captions, but also mitigating the impact of pixel-level differences on terrain change localization. The pixel problem due to long time span decreases the accuracy of generated caption. Inspired by the remarkable generative power of diffusion model, we propose a probabilistic diffusion model for RSICC to solve the aforementioned problems. In training process, we construct a noise predictor conditioned on cross modal features to learn the distribution from the real caption distribution to the standard Gaussian distribution under the Markov chain. Meanwhile, a cross-mode fusion and a stacking self-attention module are designed for noise predictor in the reverse process. In testing phase, the well-trained noise predictor helps to estimate the mean value of the distribution and generate change captions step by step. Extensive experiments on the LEVIR-CC dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our Diffusion-RSCC and its individual components. The quantitative results showcase superior performance over existing methods across both traditional and newly augmented metrics.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the current era of digital communication and widespread use of social media, it is crucial to develop an understanding of persuasive techniques employed in written text. This knowledge is essential for effectively discerning accurate information and making informed decisions. To address this need, this paper presents a comprehensive empirical study focused on identifying persuasive techniques in Arabic social media content. To achieve this objective, we utilize Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) and leverage the ArAlEval dataset, which encompasses two tasks: binary classification to determine the presence or absence of persuasion techniques, and multi-label classification to identify the specific types of techniques employed in the text. Our study explores three different learning approaches by harnessing the power of PLMs: feature extraction, fine-tuning, and prompt engineering techniques. Through extensive experimentation, we find that the fine-tuning approach yields the highest results on the aforementioned dataset, achieving an f1-micro score of 0.865 and an f1-weighted score of 0.861. Furthermore, our analysis sheds light on an interesting finding. While the performance of the GPT model is relatively lower compared to the other approaches, we have observed that by employing few-shot learning techniques, we can enhance its results by up to 20\%. This offers promising directions for future research and exploration in this topic\footnote{Upon Acceptance, the source code will be released on GitHub.}.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advancements in open-domain dialogue systems have been propelled by the emergence of high-quality large language models (LLMs) and various effective training methodologies. Nevertheless, the presence of toxicity within these models presents a significant challenge that can potentially diminish the user experience. In this study, we introduce an innovative training algorithm, an improvement upon direct preference optimization (DPO), called adversarial DPO (ADPO). The ADPO algorithm is designed to train models to assign higher probability distributions to preferred responses and lower distributions to unsafe responses, which are self-generated using the toxic control token. We demonstrate that ADPO enhances the model's resilience against harmful conversations while minimizing performance degradation. Furthermore, we illustrate that ADPO offers a more stable training procedure compared to the traditional DPO. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first adaptation of the DPO algorithm that directly incorporates harmful data into the generative model, thereby reducing the need to artificially create safe dialogue data.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper addresses a critical gap in legal analytics by developing and applying a novel taxonomy for topic modelling summary judgment cases in the United Kingdom. Using a curated dataset of summary judgment cases, we use the Large Language Model Claude 3 Opus to explore functional topics and trends. We find that Claude 3 Opus correctly classified the topic with an accuracy of 87.10%. The analysis reveals distinct patterns in the application of summary judgments across various legal domains. As case law in the United Kingdom is not originally labelled with keywords or a topic filtering option, the findings not only refine our understanding of the thematic underpinnings of summary judgments but also illustrate the potential of combining traditional and AI-driven approaches in legal classification. Therefore, this paper provides a new and general taxonomy for UK law. The implications of this work serve as a foundation for further research and policy discussions in the field of judicial administration and computational legal research methodologies.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>One critical prerequisite for faithful text-to-image generation is the accurate understanding of text inputs. Existing methods leverage the text encoder of the CLIP model to represent input prompts. However, the pre-trained CLIP model can merely encode English with a maximum token length of 77. Moreover, the model capacity of the text encoder from CLIP is relatively limited compared to Large Language Models (LLMs), which offer multilingual input, accommodate longer context, and achieve superior text representation. In this paper, we investigate LLMs as the text encoder to improve the language understanding in text-to-image generation. Unfortunately, training text-to-image generative model with LLMs from scratch demands significant computational resources and data. To this end, we introduce a three-stage training pipeline that effectively and efficiently integrates the existing text-to-image model with LLMs. Specifically, we propose a lightweight adapter that enables fast training of the text-to-image model using the textual representations from LLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model supports not only multilingual but also longer input context with superior image generation quality.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in general scenarios. Instruction finetuning empowers them to align with humans in various tasks. Nevertheless, the Diversity and Quality of the instruction data remain two main challenges for instruction finetuning. With regard to this, in this paper, we propose a novel gradient-based method to automatically select high-quality and diverse instruction finetuning data for machine translation. Our key innovation centers around analyzing how individual training examples influence the model during training. Specifically, we select training examples that exert beneficial influences on the model as high-quality ones by means of Influence Function plus a small high-quality seed dataset. Moreover, to enhance the diversity of the training data we maximize the variety of influences they have on the model by clustering on their gradients and resampling. Extensive experiments on WMT22 and FLORES translation tasks demonstrate the superiority of our methods, and in-depth analysis further validates their effectiveness and generalization.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we deal with bias mitigation techniques that remove specific data points from the training set to aim for a fair representation of the population in that set. Machine learning models are trained on these pre-processed datasets, and their predictions are expected to be fair. However, such approaches may exclude relevant data, making the attained subsets less trustworthy for further usage. To enhance the trustworthiness of prior methods, we propose additional requirements and objectives that the subsets must fulfill in addition to fairness: (1) group coverage, and (2) minimal data loss. While removing entire groups may improve the measured fairness, this practice is very problematic as failing to represent every group cannot be considered fair. In our second concern, we advocate for the retention of data while minimizing discrimination. By introducing a multi-objective optimization problem that considers fairness and data loss, we propose a methodology to find Pareto-optimal solutions that balance these objectives. By identifying such solutions, users can make informed decisions about the trade-off between fairness and data quality and select the most suitable subset for their application.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Code-mixed discourse combines multiple languages in a single text. It is commonly used in informal discourse in countries with several official languages, but also in many other countries in combination with English or neighboring languages. As recently large language models have dominated most natural language processing tasks, we investigated their performance in code-mixed settings for relevant tasks. We first created four new bilingual pre-trained masked language models for English-Hindi and English-Slovene languages, specifically aimed to support informal language. Then we performed an evaluation of monolingual, bilingual, few-lingual, and massively multilingual models on several languages, using two tasks that frequently contain code-mixed text, in particular, sentiment analysis and offensive language detection in social media texts. The results show that the most successful classifiers are fine-tuned bilingual models and multilingual models, specialized for social media texts, followed by non-specialized massively multilingual and monolingual models, while huge generative models are not competitive. For our affective problems, the models mostly perform slightly better on code-mixed data compared to non-code-mixed data.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advancements in Chain-of-Thought prompting have facilitated significant breakthroughs for Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex reasoning tasks. Current research enhances the reasoning performance of LLMs by sampling multiple reasoning chains and ensembling based on the answer frequency. However, this approach fails in scenarios where the correct answers are in the minority. We identify this as a primary factor constraining the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, a limitation that cannot be resolved solely based on the predicted answers. To address this shortcoming, we introduce a hierarchical reasoning aggregation framework AoR (Aggregation of Reasoning), which selects answers based on the evaluation of reasoning chains. Additionally, AoR incorporates dynamic sampling, adjusting the number of reasoning chains in accordance with the complexity of the task. Experimental results on a series of complex reasoning tasks show that AoR outperforms prominent ensemble methods. Further analysis reveals that AoR not only adapts various LLMs but also achieves a superior performance ceiling when compared to current methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multispectral pedestrian detection has been shown to be effective in improving performance within complex illumination scenarios. However, prevalent double-stream networks in multispectral detection employ two separate feature extraction branches for multi-modal data, leading to nearly double the inference time compared to single-stream networks utilizing only one feature extraction branch. This increased inference time has hindered the widespread employment of multispectral pedestrian detection in embedded devices for autonomous systems. To address this limitation, various knowledge distillation methods have been proposed. However, traditional distillation methods focus only on the fusion features and ignore the large amount of information in the original multi-modal features, thereby restricting the student network's performance. To tackle the challenge, we introduce the Adaptive Modal Fusion Distillation (AMFD) framework, which can fully utilize the original modal features of the teacher network. Specifically, a Modal Extraction Alignment (MEA) module is utilized to derive learning weights for student networks, integrating focal and global attention mechanisms. This methodology enables the student network to acquire optimal fusion strategies independent from that of teacher network without necessitating an additional feature fusion module. Furthermore, we present the SMOD dataset, a well-aligned challenging multispectral dataset for detection. Extensive experiments on the challenging KAIST, LLVIP and SMOD datasets are conducted to validate the effectiveness of AMFD. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both reducing log-average Miss Rate and improving mean Average Precision.

          Strategic Deployment of Honeypots in Blockchain-based IoT Systems(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper addresses the challenge of enhancing cybersecurity in Blockchain-based Internet of Things (BIoTs) systems, which are increasingly vulnerable to sophisticated cyberattacks. It introduces an AI-powered system model for the dynamic deployment of honeypots, utilizing an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) integrated with smart contract functionalities on IoT nodes. This model enables the transformation of regular nodes into decoys in response to suspicious activities, thereby strengthening the security of BIoT networks. The paper analyses strategic interactions between potential attackers and the AI-enhanced IDS through a game-theoretic model, specifically Bayesian games. The model focuses on understanding and predicting sophisticated attacks that may initially appear normal, emphasizing strategic decision-making, optimized honeypot deployment, and adaptive strategies in response to evolving attack patterns.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We provide faster randomized algorithms for computing an $\epsilon$-optimal policy in a discounted Markov decision process with $A_{\text{tot}}$-state-action pairs, bounded rewards, and discount factor $\gamma$. We provide an $\tilde{O}(A_{\text{tot}}[(1 - \gamma)^{-3}\epsilon^{-2} + (1 - \gamma)^{-2}])$-time algorithm in the sampling setting, where the probability transition matrix is unknown but accessible through a generative model which can be queried in $\tilde{O}(1)$-time, and an $\tilde{O}(s + (1-\gamma)^{-2})$-time algorithm in the offline setting where the probability transition matrix is known and $s$-sparse. These results improve upon the prior state-of-the-art which either ran in $\tilde{O}(A_{\text{tot}}[(1 - \gamma)^{-3}\epsilon^{-2} + (1 - \gamma)^{-3}])$ time [Sidford, Wang, Wu, Ye 2018] in the sampling setting, $\tilde{O}(s + A_{\text{tot}} (1-\gamma)^{-3})$ time [Sidford, Wang, Wu, Yang, Ye 2018] in the offline setting, or time at least quadratic in the number of states using interior point methods for linear programming. We achieve our results by building upon prior stochastic variance-reduced value iteration methods [Sidford, Wang, Wu, Yang, Ye 2018]. We provide a variant that carefully truncates the progress of its iterates to improve the variance of new variance-reduced sampling procedures that we introduce to implement the steps. Our method is essentially model-free and can be implemented in $\tilde{O}(A_{\text{tot}})$-space when given generative model access. Consequently, our results take a step in closing the sample-complexity gap between model-free and model-based methods.</li>

          A Method on Searching Better Activation Functions(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The success of artificial neural networks (ANNs) hinges greatly on the judicious selection of an activation function, introducing non-linearity into network and enabling them to model sophisticated relationships in data. However, the search of activation functions has largely relied on empirical knowledge in the past, lacking theoretical guidance, which has hindered the identification of more effective activation functions. In this work, we offer a proper solution to such issue. Firstly, we theoretically demonstrate the existence of the worst activation function with boundary conditions (WAFBC) from the perspective of information entropy. Furthermore, inspired by the Taylor expansion form of information entropy functional, we propose the Entropy-based Activation Function Optimization (EAFO) methodology. EAFO methodology presents a novel perspective for designing static activation functions in deep neural networks and the potential of dynamically optimizing activation during iterative training. Utilizing EAFO methodology, we derive a novel activation function from ReLU, known as Correction Regularized ReLU (CRReLU). Experiments conducted with vision transformer and its variants on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K datasets demonstrate the superiority of CRReLU over existing corrections of ReLU. Extensive empirical studies on task of large language model (LLM) fine-tuning, CRReLU exhibits superior performance compared to GELU, suggesting its broader potential for practical applications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, transformer, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Searching through chemical space is an exceptionally challenging problem because the number of possible molecules grows combinatorially with the number of atoms. Large, autoregressive models trained on databases of chemical compounds have yielded powerful generators, but we still lack robust strategies for generating molecules with desired properties. This molecular search problem closely resembles the "alignment" problem for large language models, though for many chemical tasks we have a specific and easily evaluable reward function. Here, we introduce an algorithm called energy rank alignment (ERA) that leverages an explicit reward function to produce a gradient-based objective that we use to optimize autoregressive policies. We show theoretically that this algorithm is closely related to proximal policy optimization (PPO) and direct preference optimization (DPO), but has a minimizer that converges to an ideal Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution with the reward playing the role of an energy function. Furthermore, this algorithm is highly scalable, does not require reinforcement learning, and performs well relative to DPO when the number of preference observations per pairing is small. We deploy this approach to align molecular transformers to generate molecules with externally specified properties and find that it does so robustly, searching through diverse parts of chemical space. While our focus here is on chemical search, we also obtain excellent results on an AI supervised task for LLM alignment, showing that the method is scalable and general.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Noisy labels significantly hinder the accuracy and generalization of machine learning models, particularly due to ambiguous instance features. Traditional techniques that attempt to correct noisy labels directly, such as those using transition matrices, often fail to address the inherent complexities of the problem sufficiently. In this paper, we introduce EchoAlign, a transformative paradigm shift in learning from noisy labels. Instead of focusing on label correction, EchoAlign treats noisy labels ($\tilde{Y}$) as accurate and modifies corresponding instance features ($X$) to achieve better alignment with $\tilde{Y}$. EchoAlign's core components are (1) EchoMod: Employing controllable generative models, EchoMod precisely modifies instances while maintaining their intrinsic characteristics and ensuring alignment with the noisy labels. (2) EchoSelect: Instance modification inevitably introduces distribution shifts between training and test sets. EchoSelect maintains a significant portion of clean original instances to mitigate these shifts. It leverages the distinct feature similarity distributions between original and modified instances as a robust tool for accurate sample selection. This integrated approach yields remarkable results. In environments with 30% instance-dependent noise, even at 99% selection accuracy, EchoSelect retains nearly twice the number of samples compared to the previous best method. Notably, on three datasets, EchoAlign surpasses previous state-of-the-art techniques with a substantial improvement.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Current face reenactment and swapping methods mainly rely on GAN frameworks, but recent focus has shifted to pre-trained diffusion models for their superior generation capabilities. However, training these models is resource-intensive, and the results have not yet achieved satisfactory performance levels. To address this issue, we introduce Face-Adapter, an efficient and effective adapter designed for high-precision and high-fidelity face editing for pre-trained diffusion models. We observe that both face reenactment/swapping tasks essentially involve combinations of target structure, ID and attribute. We aim to sufficiently decouple the control of these factors to achieve both tasks in one model. Specifically, our method contains: 1) A Spatial Condition Generator that provides precise landmarks and background; 2) A Plug-and-play Identity Encoder that transfers face embeddings to the text space by a transformer decoder. 3) An Attribute Controller that integrates spatial conditions and detailed attributes. Face-Adapter achieves comparable or even superior performance in terms of motion control precision, ID retention capability, and generation quality compared to fully fine-tuned face reenactment/swapping models. Additionally, Face-Adapter seamlessly integrates with various StableDiffusion models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Biomedical image analysis is fundamental for biomedical discovery in cell biology, pathology, radiology, and many other biomedical domains. Holistic image analysis comprises interdependent subtasks such as segmentation, detection, and recognition of relevant objects. Here, we propose BiomedParse, a biomedical foundation model for imaging parsing that can jointly conduct segmentation, detection, and recognition for 82 object types across 9 imaging modalities. Through joint learning, we can improve accuracy for individual tasks and enable novel applications such as segmenting all relevant objects in an image through a text prompt, rather than requiring users to laboriously specify the bounding box for each object. We leveraged readily available natural-language labels or descriptions accompanying those datasets and use GPT-4 to harmonize the noisy, unstructured text information with established biomedical object ontologies. We created a large dataset comprising over six million triples of image, segmentation mask, and textual description. On image segmentation, we showed that BiomedParse is broadly applicable, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on 102,855 test image-mask-label triples across 9 imaging modalities (everything). On object detection, which aims to locate a specific object of interest, BiomedParse again attained state-of-the-art performance, especially on objects with irregular shapes (everywhere). On object recognition, which aims to identify all objects in a given image along with their semantic types, we showed that BiomedParse can simultaneously segment and label all biomedical objects in an image (all at once). In summary, BiomedParse is an all-in-one tool for biomedical image analysis by jointly solving segmentation, detection, and recognition for all major biomedical image modalities, paving the path for efficient and accurate image-based biomedical discovery.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present personalized residuals and localized attention-guided sampling for efficient concept-driven generation using text-to-image diffusion models. Our method first represents concepts by freezing the weights of a pretrained text-conditioned diffusion model and learning low-rank residuals for a small subset of the model's layers. The residual-based approach then directly enables application of our proposed sampling technique, which applies the learned residuals only in areas where the concept is localized via cross-attention and applies the original diffusion weights in all other regions. Localized sampling therefore combines the learned identity of the concept with the existing generative prior of the underlying diffusion model. We show that personalized residuals effectively capture the identity of a concept in ~3 minutes on a single GPU without the use of regularization images and with fewer parameters than previous models, and localized sampling allows using the original model as strong prior for large parts of the image.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Key-value (KV) caching plays an essential role in accelerating decoding for transformer-based autoregressive large language models (LLMs). However, the amount of memory required to store the KV cache can become prohibitive at long sequence lengths and large batch sizes. Since the invention of the transformer, two of the most effective interventions discovered for reducing the size of the KV cache have been Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and its generalization, Grouped-Query Attention (GQA). MQA and GQA both modify the design of the attention block so that multiple query heads can share a single key/value head, reducing the number of distinct key/value heads by a large factor while only minimally degrading accuracy. In this paper, we show that it is possible to take Multi-Query Attention a step further by also sharing key and value heads between adjacent layers, yielding a new attention design we call Cross-Layer Attention (CLA). With CLA, we find that it is possible to reduce the size of the KV cache by another 2x while maintaining nearly the same accuracy as unmodified MQA. In experiments training 1B- and 3B-parameter models from scratch, we demonstrate that CLA provides a Pareto improvement over the memory/accuracy tradeoffs which are possible with traditional MQA, enabling inference with longer sequence lengths and larger batch sizes than would otherwise be possible</li>
