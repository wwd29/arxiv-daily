<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Memes are a popular element of modern web communication, used not only as static artifacts but also as interactive replies within conversations. While computational research has focused on analyzing the intrinsic properties of memes, the dynamic and contextual use of memes to create humor remains an understudied area of web science. To address this gap, we introduce the Meme Reply Selection task and present MaMe-Re (Manga Meme Reply Benchmark), a benchmark of 100,000 human-annotated pairs (500,000 total annotations from 2,325 unique annotators) consisting of openly licensed Japanese manga panels and social media posts. Our analysis reveals three key insights: (1) large language models (LLMs) show preliminary evidence of capturing complex social cues such as exaggeration, moving beyond surface-level semantic matching; (2) the inclusion of visual information does not improve performance, revealing a gap between understanding visual content and effectively using it for contextual humor; (3) while LLMs can match human judgments in controlled settings, they struggle to distinguish subtle differences in wit among semantically similar candidates. These findings suggest that selecting contextually humorous replies remains an open challenge for current models.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The Web is a rich source of structured data in the form of tables, from product catalogs and knowledge bases to scientific datasets. However, the heterogeneity of the structure and semantics of these tables makes it challenging to build a unified method that can effectively leverage the information they contain. Meanwhile, Large language models (LLMs) are becoming an increasingly integral component of web infrastructure for tasks like semantic search. This raises a crucial question: can we leverage these already-deployed LLMs to classify structured data in web-native tables (e.g., product catalogs, knowledge base exports, scientific data portals), avoiding the need for specialized models or extensive retraining? This work investigates a lightweight paradigm, $\textbf{Ta}$ble $\textbf{R}$epresentation with $\textbf{L}$anguage Model~($\textbf{TaRL}$), for few-shot tabular classification that directly utilizes semantic embeddings of individual table rows. We first show that naive application of these embeddings underperforms compared to specialized tabular models. We then demonstrate that their potentials can be unlocked with two key techniques: removing the common component from all embeddings and calibrating the softmax temperature. We show that a simple meta-learner, trained on handcrafted features, can learn to predict an appropriate temperature. This approach achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art models in low-data regimes ($k \leq 32$) of semantically-rich tables. Our findings demonstrate the viability of reusing existing LLM infrastructure for efficient semantics-driven pathway to reuse existing LLM infrastructure for Web table understanding.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, transformer, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Decoder-only large language models achieve strong broad performance but are brittle to minor grammatical perturbations, undermining reliability for downstream reasoning. However, directly injecting explicit syntactic structure into an existing checkpoint can interfere with its pretrained competence. We introduce a checkpoint-compatible gated tree cross-attention (GTCA) branch that reads precomputed constituency chunk memory while leaving backbone architecture unchanged. Our design uses a token update mask and staged training to control the scope and timing of structural updates. Across benchmarks and Transformer backbones, GTCA strengthens syntactic robustness beyond continued-training baselines without compromising Multiple-Choice QA performance or commonsense reasoning, providing a practical checkpoint-compatible route to more syntax-robust decoder-only LLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Personality steering in large language models (LLMs) commonly relies on injecting trait-specific steering vectors, implicitly assuming that personality traits can be controlled independently. In this work, we examine whether this assumption holds by analysing the geometric relationships between Big Five personality steering directions. We study steering vectors extracted from two model families (LLaMA-3-8B and Mistral-8B) and apply a range of geometric conditioning schemes, from unconstrained directions to soft and hard orthonormalisation. Our results show that personality steering directions exhibit substantial geometric dependence: steering one trait consistently induces changes in others, even when linear overlap is explicitly removed. While hard orthonormalisation enforces geometric independence, it does not eliminate cross-trait behavioural effects and can reduce steering strength. These findings suggest that personality traits in LLMs occupy a slightly coupled subspace, limiting fully independent trait control.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This study validates Large Language Models (LLMs) as a dynamic alternative to questionnaire-based personality assessment. Using a within-subjects experiment (N=33), we compared Big Five personality scores derived from guided LLM conversations against the gold-standard IPIP-50 questionnaire, while also measuring user-perceived accuracy. Results indicate moderate convergent validity (r=0.38-0.58), with Conscientiousness, Openness, and Neuroticism scores statistically equivalent between methods. Agreeableness and Extraversion showed significant differences, suggesting trait-specific calibration is needed. Notably, participants rated LLM-generated profiles as equally accurate as traditional questionnaire results. These findings suggest conversational AI offers a promising new approach to traditional psychometrics.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Peer review relies on substantive, evidence-based questions, yet existing LLM-based approaches often generate surface-level queries, drawing over 50\% of their question tokens from a paper's first page. To bridge this gap, we develop IntelliReward, a novel reward model built from a frozen autoregressive LLM with trainable multi-head transformers over the final 50 token states, which outperforms API-based SFT baselines in predicting expert-level human preferences. By applying Decoupled Clip and Dynamic Sampling Policy Optimization (DAPO) with IntelliReward, we train IntelliAsk, a question-generation model aligned with human standards of effort, evidence, and grounding. We find consistent improvements on reasoning and writing benchmarks, suggesting reviewer-question quality correlates with broader capabilities. Compared to the Qwen3-32B base model, IntelliAsk shows measurable gains across diverse benchmarks, specifically improving performance on reasoning tasks like MuSR (68.3 vs 64.7 Acc) and complex writing evaluations such as WritingBench (8.31 vs 8.07). We release our implementation, expert preference annotations, and the IntelliReward model to provide an automatic evaluation benchmark for grounding, effort, and evidence in LLM-generated review questions.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>American college applications require students to navigate fragmented admissions policies, repetitive and conditional forms, and ambiguous questions that often demand cross-referencing multiple sources. We present EZCollegeApp, a large language model (LLM)-powered system that assists high-school students by structuring application forms, grounding suggested answers in authoritative admissions documents, and maintaining full human control over final responses. The system introduces a mapping-first paradigm that separates form understanding from answer generation, enabling consistent reasoning across heterogeneous application portals. EZCollegeApp integrates document ingestion from official admissions websites, retrieval-augmented question answering, and a human-in-the-loop chatbot interface that presents suggestions alongside application fields without automated submission. We describe the system architecture, data pipeline, internal representations, security and privacy measures, and evaluation through automated testing and human quality assessment. Our source code is released on GitHub (this https URL) to facilitate the broader impact of this work.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Applications of narrative theories using large language models (LLMs) deliver promising use-cases in automatic story generation and understanding tasks. Our survey examines how natural language processing (NLP) research engages with fields of narrative studies, and proposes a taxonomy for ongoing efforts that reflect established distinctions in narratology. We discover patterns in the following: narrative datasets and tasks, narrative theories and NLP pipeline and methodological trends in prompting and fine-tuning. We highlight how LLMs enable easy connections of NLP pipelines with abstract narrative concepts and opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration. Challenges remain in attempts to work towards any unified definition or benchmark of narrative related tasks, making model comparison difficult. For future directions, instead of the pursuit of a single, generalised benchmark for 'narrative quality', we believe that progress benefits more from efforts that focus on the following: defining and improving theory-based metrics for individual narrative attributes to incrementally improve model performance; conducting large-scale, theory-driven literary/social/cultural analysis; and creating experiments where outputs can be used to validate or refine narrative theories. This work provides a contextual foundation for more systematic and theoretically informed narrative research in NLP by providing an overview to ongoing research efforts and the broader narrative studies landscape.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Clinical natural language processing (NLP) models have shown promise for supporting hospital discharge planning by leveraging narrative clinical documentation. However, note-based models are particularly vulnerable to temporal and lexical leakage, where documentation artifacts encode future clinical decisions and inflate apparent predictive performance. Such behavior poses substantial risks for real-world deployment, where overconfident or temporally invalid predictions can disrupt clinical workflows and compromise patient safety. This study focuses on system-level design choices required to build safe and deployable clinical NLP under temporal leakage constraints. We present a lightweight auditing pipeline that integrates interpretability into the model development process to identify and suppress leakage-prone signals prior to final training. Using next-day discharge prediction after elective spine surgery as a case study, we evaluate how auditing affects predictive behavior, calibration, and safety-relevant trade-offs. Results show that audited models exhibit more conservative and better-calibrated probability estimates, with reduced reliance on discharge-related lexical cues. These findings emphasize that deployment-ready clinical NLP systems should prioritize temporal validity, calibration, and behavioral robustness over optimistic performance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>explainability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose a lightweight explainable guardrail (LEG) method for the classification of unsafe prompts. LEG uses a multi-task learning architecture to jointly learn a prompt classifier and an explanation classifier, where the latter labels prompt words that explain the safe/unsafe overall decision. LEG is trained using synthetic data for explainability, which is generated using a novel strategy that counteracts the confirmation biases of LLMs. Lastly, LEG's training process uses a novel loss that captures global explanation signals and combines cross-entropy and focal losses with uncertainty-based weighting. LEG obtains equivalent or better performance than the state-of-the-art for both prompt classification and explainability, both in-domain and out-of-domain on three datasets, despite the fact that its model size is considerably smaller than current approaches. If accepted, we will release all models and the annotated dataset publicly.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models show potential in task-oriented dialogue systems, yet existing training methods often rely on token-level likelihood or preference optimization, which poorly align with long-horizon task success. To address this, we propose Goal-Oriented Preference Optimization (GOPO), a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that decouples strategy planning from response generation via an Expert Agent and a Customer Service Agent. The Expert Agent optimizes multi-turn goal preferences at the dialogue-trajectory level, while the Customer Service Agent generates responses strictly aligned with the selected strategy. We evaluate GOPO on public benchmarks and e-commerce customer service datasets, and introduce Task-focused Sequential Engagement (TSE), a sequence-level metric derived from real e-commerce interaction data. On the Mgshop dataset, GOPO improves TSE by 7.7% and 10.3% over PPO and Memento, with consistent gains in sequence-level reward and generation quality. Furthermore, a 14B model trained with GOPO achieves 2.7% and 1.5% higher TSE than Qwen-235B and GPT-5.2, respectively. Ablation studies confirm the Expert Agent's critical role in long-horizon optimization. GOPO demonstrates consistent improvements across other datasets as well. This work establishes a new paradigm for task-oriented dialogue systems in commercial scenarios, with code and datasets to be made public.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) effectively grounds Large Language Models (LLMs) with external knowledge and is widely applied to Web-related tasks. However, its scalability is hindered by excessive context length and redundant retrievals. Recent research on soft context compression aims to address this by encoding long documents into compact embeddings, yet they often underperform non-compressed RAG due to their reliance on auto-encoder-like full-compression that forces the encoder to compress all document information regardless of relevance to the input query. In this work, we conduct an analysis on this paradigm and reveal two fundamental limitations: (I) Infeasibility, full-compression conflicts with the LLM's downstream generation behavior; and (II) Non-necessity: full-compression is unnecessary and dilutes task-relevant information density. Motivated by these insights, we introduce SeleCom, a selector-based soft compression framework for RAG that redefines the encoder's role as query-conditioned information selector. The selector is decoder-only and is trained with a massive, diverse and difficulty-graded synthetic QA dataset with curriculum learning. Extensive experiments show that SeleCom significantly outperforms existing soft compression approaches and achieves competitive or superior performance to non-compression baselines, while reducing computation and latency by 33.8%~84.6%.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The analysis of public opinion from multiple heterogeneous sources presents significant challenges due to structural differences, semantic variations, and platform-specific biases. This paper introduces a novel Collaborative Reasoning and Adaptive Fusion (CRAF) framework that systematically integrates traditional feature-based methods with large language models (LLMs) through a structured multi-stage reasoning mechanism. Our approach features four key innovations: (1) a cross-platform collaborative attention module that aligns semantic representations while preserving source-specific characteristics, (2) a hierarchical adaptive fusion mechanism that dynamically weights features based on both data quality and task requirements, (3) a joint optimization strategy that simultaneously learns topic representations and sentiment distributions through shared latent spaces, and (4) a novel multimodal extraction capability that processes video content from platforms like Douyin and Kuaishou by integrating OCR, ASR, and visual sentiment analysis. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that CRAF achieves a tighter generalization bound with a reduction of O(sqrt(d log K / m)) compared to independent source modeling, where d is feature dimensionality, K is the number of sources, and m is sample size. Comprehensive experiments on three multi-platform datasets (Weibo-12, CrossPlatform-15, NewsForum-8) show that CRAF achieves an average topic clustering ARI of 0.76 (4.1% improvement over best baseline) and sentiment analysis F1-score of 0.84 (3.8% improvement). The framework exhibits strong cross-platform adaptability, reducing the labeled data requirement for new platforms by 75%.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As large language models (LLMs) move from static reasoning tasks toward dynamic environments, their success depends on the ability to navigate and respond to an environment that changes as they interact at inference time. An underexplored factor in these settings is the representation of the state. Holding model parameters fixed, we systematically vary three key aspects: (1) state granularity (long form versus summary), (2) structure (natural language versus symbolic), and (3) spatial grounding (text-only versus images or textual map encodings) across sequential decision-making benchmarks. We find that trajectory summarisation improves performance by reducing noise and stabilising long-horizon reasoning. Second, natural language representations are the most robust across models, whereas structured encodings help mainly for models with strong code or structured output priors, such as JSON schemas. Third, while image-inputs show some benefit, text-based spatial encodings prove most effective. This advantage stems not from the spatial information itself, but from the act of construction, which compels the model to perform the spatial reasoning that static input does not elicit. Overall, we demonstrate that design choices for representing state are a decisive factor in performance, distinct from the availability of information itself. We note, however, that even with improved representations, current LLMs and VLMs remain brittle over long horizons, particularly when they must synthesise information to manage multiple subtasks to reach a goal.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, robust, extraction, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Building reliable conversational AI assistants for customer-facing industries remains challenging due to noisy conversational data, fragmented knowledge, and the requirement for accurate human hand-off - particularly in domains that depend heavily on real-time information. This paper presents an end-to-end framework for constructing and evaluating a conversational AI assistant directly from historical call transcripts. Incoming transcripts are first graded using a simplified adaptation of the PIPA framework, focusing on observation alignment and appropriate response behavior, and are filtered to retain only high-quality interactions exhibiting coherent flow and effective human agent responses. Structured knowledge is then extracted from curated transcripts using large language models (LLMs) and deployed as the sole grounding source in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. Assistant behavior is governed through systematic prompt tuning, progressing from monolithic prompts to lean, modular, and governed designs that ensure consistency, safety, and controllable execution. Evaluation is conducted using a transcript-grounded user simulator, enabling quantitative measurement of call coverage, factual accuracy, and human escalation behavior. Additional red teaming assesses robustness against prompt injection, out-of-scope, and out-of-context attacks. Experiments are conducted in the Real Estate and Specialist Recruitment domains, which are intentionally challenging and currently suboptimal for automation due to their reliance on real-time data. Despite these constraints, the assistant autonomously handles approximately 30 percents of calls, achieves near-perfect factual accuracy and rejection behavior, and demonstrates strong robustness under adversarial testing.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Current neural reranking approaches for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) rely on cross-encoders or large language models (LLMs), requiring substantial computational resources and exhibiting latencies of 3-5 seconds per query. We propose Maniscope, a geometric reranking method that computes geodesic distances on k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) manifolds constructed over retrieved document candidates. This approach combines global cosine similarity with local manifold geometry to capture semantic structure that flat Euclidean metrics miss. Evaluating on eight BEIR benchmark datasets (1,233 queries), Maniscope outperforms HNSW graph-based baseline on the three hardest datasets (NFCorpus: +7.0%, TREC-COVID: +1.6%, AorB: +2.8% NDCG@3) while being 3.2x faster (4.7 ms vs 14.8 ms average). Compared to cross-encoder rerankers, Maniscope achieves within 2% accuracy at 10-45x lower latency. On TREC-COVID, LLM-Reranker provides only +0.5% NDCG@3 improvement over Maniscope at 840x higher latency, positioning Maniscope as a practical alternative for real-time RAG deployment. The method requires O(N D + M^2 D + M k log k) complexity where M << N , enabling sub-10 ms latency. We plan to release Maniscope as open-source software.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text analysis of tabular data relies on two core operations: \emph{summarization} for corpus-level theme extraction and \emph{tagging} for row-level labeling. A critical limitation of employing large language models (LLMs) for these tasks is their inability to meet the high standards of output stability demanded by data analytics. To address this challenge, we introduce \textbf{CAST} (\textbf{C}onsistency via \textbf{A}lgorithmic Prompting and \textbf{S}table \textbf{T}hinking), a framework that enhances output stability by constraining the model's latent reasoning path. CAST combines (i) Algorithmic Prompting to impose a procedural scaffold over valid reasoning transitions and (ii) Thinking-before-Speaking to enforce explicit intermediate commitments before final generation. To measure progress, we introduce \textbf{CAST-S} and \textbf{CAST-T}, stability metrics for bulleted summarization and tagging, and validate their alignment with human judgments. Experiments across publicly available benchmarks on multiple LLM backbones show that CAST consistently achieves the best stability among all baselines, improving Stability Score by up to 16.2\%, while maintaining or improving output quality.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLMMs) have enabled recipe generation from food images, yet outputs often contain semantically incorrect actions or ingredients despite high lexical scores (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE). To address this gap, we propose a semantically grounded framework that predicts and validates actions and ingredients as internal context for instruction generation. Our two-stage pipeline combines supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT): SFT builds foundational accuracy using an Action-Reasoning dataset and ingredient corpus, while RFT employs frequency-aware rewards to improve long-tail action prediction and ingredient generalization. A Semantic Confidence Scoring and Rectification (SCSR) module further filters and corrects predictions. Experiments on Recipe1M show state-of-the-art performance and markedly improved semantic fidelity.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent studies have shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) can improve their reasoning performance through self-generated few-shot examples, achieving results comparable to manually curated in-context examples. However, the underlying mechanism behind these gains remains unclear, making it hard to decide when and how to apply the technique effectively. In this work, we argue that the key benefit arises not from the generated examples themselves but from the act of creating them. To validate this, on reasoning-intensive tasks across diverse LLM architectures, we systematically evaluate three prompting strategies for in-context learning: (1) Zero-shot prompting; (2) Integrated prompting, where LLMs create and solve problems within a single, unified prompt; and (3) Decoupled prompting, where self-generated examples are reused as in-context examples, but the context of their creation itself is excluded. We conduct experiments across five widely used model architectures, demonstrating that Integrated prompting consistently outperforms both Zero-shot and Decoupled prompting. In contrast, Decoupled prompting offers only marginal gains over Zero-shot. Further, for a more in-depth analysis, we conduct an attention analysis and observe significant differences in attention patterns between Integrated and Decoupled prompting. These findings suggest that the advantage of self-generation prompting comes from the process of problem creation, not the examples themselves, providing valuable insights for designing more effective prompting strategies.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP) is integral to social media analytics but often processes content containing Personally Identifiable Information (PII), behavioral cues, and metadata raising privacy risks such as surveillance, profiling, and targeted advertising. To systematically assess these risks, we review 203 peer-reviewed papers and propose the NLP Privacy Risk Identification in Social Media (NLP-PRISM) framework, which evaluates vulnerabilities across six dimensions: data collection, preprocessing, visibility, fairness, computational risk, and regulatory compliance. Our analysis shows that transformer models achieve F1-scores ranging from 0.58-0.84, but incur a 1% - 23% drop under privacy-preserving fine-tuning. Using NLP-PRISM, we examine privacy coverage in six NLP tasks: sentiment analysis (16), emotion detection (14), offensive language identification (19), code-mixed processing (39), native language identification (29), and dialect detection (24) revealing substantial gaps in privacy research. We further found a (reduced by 2% - 9%) trade-off in model utility, MIA AUC (membership inference attacks) 0.81, AIA accuracy 0.75 (attribute inference attacks). Finally, we advocate for stronger anonymization, privacy-aware learning, and fairness-driven training to enable ethical NLP in social media contexts.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this positioning paper, we evaluate the problem-solving and reasoning capabilities of contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs) through their performance in Zork, the seminal text-based adventure game first released in 1977. The game's dialogue-based structure provides a controlled environment for assessing how LLM-based chatbots interpret natural language descriptions and generate appropriate action sequences to succeed in the game. We test the performance of leading proprietary models - ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini - under both minimal and detailed instructions, measuring game progress through achieved scores as the primary metric. Our results reveal that all tested models achieve less than 10% completion on average, with even the best-performing model (Claude Opus 4.5) reaching only approximately 75 out of 350 possible points. Notably, providing detailed game instructions offers no improvement, nor does enabling ''extended thinking''. Qualitative analysis of the models' reasoning processes reveals fundamental limitations: repeated unsuccessful actions suggesting an inability to reflect on one's own thinking, inconsistent persistence of strategies, and failure to learn from previous attempts despite access to conversation history. These findings suggest substantial limitations in current LLMs' metacognitive abilities and problem-solving capabilities within the domain of text-based games, raising questions about the nature and extent of their reasoning capabilities.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) exhibit failure modes on seemingly trivial tasks. We propose a formalisation of LLM interaction using a deterministic multi-tape Turing machine, where each tape represents a distinct component: input characters, tokens, vocabulary, model parameters, activations, probability distributions, and output text. The model enables precise localisation of failure modes to specific pipeline stages, revealing, e.g., how tokenisation obscures character-level structure needed for counting tasks. The model clarifies why techniques like chain-of-thought prompting help, by externalising computation on the output tape, while also revealing their fundamental limitations. This approach provides a rigorous, falsifiable alternative to geometric metaphors and complements empirical scaling laws with principled error analysis.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance on clinical de-identification, the task of identifying sensitive identifiers to protect privacy. However, previous work has not examined their generalizability between formats, cultures, and genders. In this work, we systematically evaluate fine-tuned transformer models (BERT, ClinicalBERT, ModernBERT), small LLMs (Llama 1-8B, Qwen 1.5-7B), and large LLMs (Llama-70B, Qwen-72B) at de-identification. We show that smaller models achieve comparable performance while substantially reducing inference cost, making them more practical for deployment. Moreover, we demonstrate that smaller models can be fine-tuned with limited data to outperform larger models in de-identifying identifiers drawn from Mandarin, Hindi, Spanish, French, Bengali, and regional variations of English, in addition to gendered names. To improve robustness in multi-cultural contexts, we introduce and publicly release BERT-MultiCulture-DEID, a set of de-identification models based on BERT, ClinicalBERT, and ModernBERT, fine-tuned on MIMIC with identifiers from multiple language variants. Our findings provide the first comprehensive quantification of the efficiency-generalizability trade-off in de-identification and establish practical pathways for fair and efficient clinical de-identification.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Autoregressive language models decode left-to-right with irreversible commitments, limiting revision during multi-step reasoning. We propose \textbf{VDLM}, a modular variable diffusion language model that separates semantic planning from text rendering. VDLM applies LLaDA-style masked diffusion over semantic variable embeddings to enable iterative refinement in latent space, then post-trains the planner with trajectory-aware optimization using embedding-space rewards and values, avoiding text decoding inside the RL loop. To convert planned embeddings back to text, we use a \textbf{Vec2Text} renderer and introduce \textbf{embedding perturbations} to robustify decoding under planner noise. Across nine benchmarks spanning general reasoning, math, and code, VDLM is competitive in pre-training and yields substantial post-training improvements on long-form generation tasks, outperforming other baselines. These results highlight the effectiveness of embedding-space post-training and robust latent-to-text rendering for diffusion language modeling.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) in academic workflows has introduced unprecedented challenges to bibliographic integrity, particularly through reference hallucination -- the generation of plausible but non-existent citations. Recent investigations have documented the presence of AI-hallucinated citations even in papers accepted at premier machine learning conferences such as NeurIPS and ICLR, underscoring the urgency of automated verification mechanisms. This paper presents "CheckIfExist", an open-source web-based tool designed to provide immediate verification of bibliographic references through multi-source validation against CrossRef, Semantic Scholar, and OpenAlex scholarly databases. While existing reference management tools offer bibliographic organization capabilities, they do not provide real-time validation of citation authenticity. Commercial hallucination detection services, though increasingly available, often impose restrictive usage limits on free tiers or require substantial subscription fees. The proposed tool fills this gap by employing a cascading validation architecture with string similarity algorithms to compute multi-dimensional match confidence scores, delivering instant feedback on reference authenticity. The system supports both single-reference verification and batch processing of BibTeX entries through a unified interface, returning validated APA citations and exportable BibTeX records within seconds.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities but remain limited by their reliance on static training data. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this constraint by retrieving external knowledge during inference, though it still depends heavily on knowledge base quality. To explore potential improvements, we evaluated three RAG variants-Standard RAG, DA-RAG, and our proposed Prompt-Enhanced Parametric RAG (P-RAG), a hybrid architecture that integrates parametric knowledge within the LLM and retrieved evidence, guided by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning-on both general and biomedical datasets. Using LLaMA-3.2-1B-Instruct fine-tuned via LoRA, we evaluate on PubMedQA and 2WikiMultihopQA. P-RAG outperforms Standard RAG on PubMedQA by 10.47 percentage points in F1 (93.33% vs. 82.86%; 12.64% relative). On 2WikiMultihopQA, P-RAG nearly doubles the overall score vs. Standard RAG (33.44% vs. 17.83%) and achieves 44.03% on the Compare subset (with 42.74% Bridge, 21.84% Inference, 8.60% Compose). CoT prompting substantially improves multi-hop reasoning but yields mixed results for simpler, single-hop queries. These findings underscore P-RAG's potential for accurate, scalable, and contextually adaptive biomedical question answering. Our contributions include: (1) LoRA-based fine-tuning of LLaMA-3.2-1B-Instruct for biomedical QA, (2) introduction of P-RAG with Chain-of-Thought prompting, and (3) state-of-the-art results on PubMedQA and 2WikiMultihopQA.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) balance predictive accuracy and interpretability, but manually configuring their structure is challenging. We propose using the multi-objective genetic algorithm NSGA-II to automatically optimize GAMs, jointly minimizing prediction error (RMSE) and a Complexity Penalty that captures sparsity, smoothness, and uncertainty. Experiments on the California Housing dataset show that NSGA-II discovers GAMs that outperform baseline LinearGAMs in accuracy or match performance with substantially lower complexity. The resulting models are simpler, smoother, and exhibit narrower confidence intervals, enhancing interpretability. This framework provides a general approach for automated optimization of transparent, high-performing models. The code can be found at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In industrial scenarios, data augmentation is an effective approach to improve model performance. However, its benefits are not unidirectionally beneficial. There is no theoretical research or established estimation for the optimal sample size (OSS) in augmentation, nor is there an established metric to evaluate the accuracy of OSS or its deviation from the ground truth. To address these issues, we propose an information-theoretic optimal sample size estimation (IT-OSE) to provide reliable OSS estimation for industrial data augmentation. An interval coverage and deviation (ICD) score is proposed to evaluate the estimated OSS intuitively. The relationship between OSS and dominant factors is theoretically analyzed and formulated, thereby enhancing the interpretability. Experiments show that, compared to empirical estimation, the IT-OSE increases accuracy in classification tasks across baseline models by an average of 4.38%, and reduces MAPE in regression tasks across baseline models by an average of 18.80%. The improvements in downstream model performance are more stable. ICDdev in the ICD score is also reduced by an average of 49.30%. The determinism of OSS is enhanced. Compared to exhaustive search, the IT-OSE achieves the same OSS while reducing computational and data costs by an average of 83.97% and 93.46%. Furthermore, practicality experiments demonstrate that the IT-OSE exhibits generality across representative sensor-based industrial scenarios.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Exercise recommendation focuses on personalized exercise selection conditioned on students' learning history, personal interests, and other individualized characteristics. Despite notable progress, most existing methods represent student learning solely as exercise sequences, overlooking rich behavioral interaction information. This limited representation often leads to biased and unreliable estimates of learning progress. Moreover, fixed-length sequence segmentation limits the incorporation of early learning experiences, thereby hindering the modeling of long-term dependencies and the accurate estimation of knowledge mastery. To address these limitations, we propose BamaER, a Behavior-aware memory-augmented Exercise Recommendation framework that comprises three core modules: (i) the learning progress prediction module that captures heterogeneous student interaction behaviors via a tri-directional hybrid encoding scheme; (ii) the memory-augmented knowledge tracing module that maintains a dynamic memory matrix to jointly model historical and current knowledge states for robust mastery estimation; and (iii) the exercise filtering module that formulates candidate selection as a diversity-aware optimization problem, solved via the Hippopotamus Optimization Algorithm to reduce redundancy and improve recommendation coverage. Experiments on five real-world educational datasets show that BamaER consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across a range of evaluation metrics.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) offer a powerful paradigm for flow reconstruction, seamlessly integrating sparse velocity measurements with the governing Navier-Stokes equations to recover complete velocity and latent pressure fields. However, scaling such models to large spatiotemporal domains is hindered by computational bottlenecks and optimization instabilities. In this work, we propose a robust distributed PINNs framework designed for efficient flow reconstruction via spatiotemporal domain decomposition. A critical challenge in such distributed solvers is pressure indeterminacy, where independent sub-networks drift into inconsistent local pressure baselines. We address this issue through a reference anchor normalization strategy coupled with decoupled asymmetric weighting. By enforcing a unidirectional information flow from designated master ranks where the anchor point lies to neighboring ranks, our approach eliminates gauge freedom and guarantees global pressure uniqueness while preserving temporal continuity. Furthermore, to mitigate the Python interpreter overhead associated with computing high-order physics residuals, we implement a high-performance training pipeline accelerated by CUDA graphs and JIT compilation. Extensive validation on complex flow benchmarks demonstrates that our method achieves near-linear strong scaling and high-fidelity reconstruction, establishing a scalable and physically rigorous pathway for flow reconstruction and understanding of complex hydrodynamics.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent research indicates that while alignment methods significantly improve the quality of large language model(LLM) outputs, they simultaneously reduce the diversity of the models' output. Although some methods have been proposed to enhance LLM output diversity, they often come at the cost of reduced performance. In this work, we first theoretically demonstrate that the alignment task can be decomposed into two distributions: quality and diversity. To enhance the diversity of LLM outputs while ensuring quality, we propose the Quality-constrained Entropy Maximization Policy Optimization (QEMPO). QEMPO aims to maximize the output entropy of the policy while ensuring output quality. By adding different constraints to QEMPO, we obtain different policies. To optimize policies, we propose both online and offline training methods. Experiments validate that QEMPO achieves performance comparable to or even better than RLHF while improving output diversity.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) effectively mitigates hallucinations in LLMs by incorporating external knowledge. However, the inherent discrete representation of text in existing frameworks often results in a loss of semantic integrity, leading to retrieval deviations. Inspired by the human episodic memory mechanism, we propose CogitoRAG, a RAG framework that simulates human cognitive memory processes. The core of this framework lies in the extraction and evolution of the Semantic Gist. During the offline indexing stage, CogitoRAG first deduces unstructured corpora into gist memory corpora, which are then transformed into a multi-dimensional knowledge graph integrating entities, relational facts, and memory nodes. In the online retrieval stage, the framework handles complex queries via Query Decomposition Module that breaks them into comprehensive sub-queries, mimicking the cognitive decomposition humans employ for complex information. Subsequently, Entity Diffusion Module performs associative retrieval across the graph, guided by structural relevance and an entity-frequency reward mechanism. Furthermore, we propose the CogniRank algorithm, which precisely reranks candidate passages by fusing diffusion-derived scores with semantic similarity. The final evidence is delivered to the generator in a passage-memory pairing format, providing high-density information support. Experimental results across five mainstream QA benchmarks and multi-task generation on GraphBench demonstrate that CogitoRAG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art RAG methods, showcasing superior capabilities in complex knowledge integration and reasoning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, protect, defense, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Training and fine-tuning large-scale language models largely benefit from collaborative learning, but the approach has been proven vulnerable to gradient inversion attacks (GIAs), which allow adversaries to reconstruct private training data from shared gradients. Existing defenses mainly employ gradient perturbation techniques, e.g., noise injection or gradient pruning, to disrupt GIAs' direct mapping from gradient space to token space. However, these methods often fall short due to the retention of semantics similarity across gradient, embedding, and token spaces. In this work, we propose a novel defense mechanism named GHOST (gradient shield with obfuscated tokens), a token-level obfuscation mechanism that neutralizes GIAs by decoupling the inherent connections across gradient, embedding, and token spaces. GHOST is built upon an important insight: due to the large scale of the token space, there exist semantically distinct yet embedding-proximate tokens that can serve as the shadow substitutes of the original tokens, which enables a semantic disconnection in the token space while preserving the connection in the embedding and gradient spaces. GHOST comprises a searching step, which identifies semantically distinct candidate tokens using a multi-criteria searching process, and a selection step, which selects optimal shadow tokens to ensure minimal disruption to features critical for training by preserving alignment with the internal outputs produced by original tokens. Evaluation across diverse model architectures (from BERT to Llama) and datasets demonstrates the remarkable effectiveness of GHOST in protecting privacy (as low as 1% in recovery rate) and preserving utility (up to 0.92 in classification F1 and 5.45 in perplexity), in both classification and generation tasks against state-of-the-art GIAs and adaptive attack scenarios.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>explainability, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multi-hop question answering (QA) necessitates multi-step reasoning and retrieval across interconnected subjects, attributes, and relations. Existing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods struggle to capture these structural semantics accurately, resulting in suboptimal performance. Graph-based RAGs structure such information in graphs, but the resulting graphs are often noisy and computationally expensive. Moreover, most methods rely on single-step retrieval, neglecting the need for multi-hop reasoning processes. Recent training-based approaches attempt to incentivize the large language models (LLMs) for iterative reasoning and retrieval, but their training processes are prone to unstable convergence and high computational overhead. To address these limitations, we devise an ontology-based cube structure with multiple and orthogonal dimensions to model structural subjects, attributes, and relations. Built on the cube structure, we propose MultiCube-RAG, a training-free method consisting of multiple cubes for multi-step reasoning and retrieval. Each cube specializes in modeling a class of subjects, so that MultiCube-RAG flexibly selects the most suitable cubes to acquire the relevant knowledge precisely. To enhance the query-based reasoning and retrieval, our method decomposes a complex multi-hop query into a set of simple subqueries along cube dimensions and conquers each of them sequentially. Experiments on four multi-hop QA datasets show that MultiCube-RAG improves response accuracy by 8.9% over the average performance of various baselines. Notably, we also demonstrate that our method performs with greater efficiency and inherent explainability.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Long input sequences are central to in-context learning, document understanding, and multi-step reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the quadratic attention cost of Transformers makes inference memory-intensive and slow. While context distillation (CD) can transfer information into model parameters, per-prompt distillation is impractical due to training costs and latency. To address these limitations, we propose Doc-to-LoRA (D2L), a lightweight hypernetwork that meta-learns to perform approximate CD within a single forward pass. Given an unseen prompt, D2L generates a LoRA adapter for a target LLM, enabling subsequent queries to be answered without re-consuming the original context, reducing latency and KV-cache memory consumption during inference of the target LLM. On a long-context needle-in-a-haystack task, D2L successfully learns to map contexts into adapters that store the needle information, achieving near-perfect zero-shot accuracy at sequence lengths exceeding the target LLM's native context window by more than 4x. On real-world QA datasets with limited compute, D2L outperforms standard CD while significantly reducing peak memory consumption and update latency. We envision that D2L can facilitate rapid adaptation of LLMs, opening up the possibility of frequent knowledge updates and personalized chat behavior.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The proliferation of highly realistic facial forgeries necessitates robust detection methods. However, existing approaches often suffer from limited accuracy and poor generalization due to significant distribution shifts among samples generated by diverse forgery techniques. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Multivariate and Soft Blending Augmentation with CLIP-guided Forgery Intensity Estimation (MSBA-CLIP) framework. Our method leverages the multimodal alignment capabilities of CLIP to capture subtle forgery traces. We introduce a Multivariate and Soft Blending Augmentation (MSBA) strategy that synthesizes images by blending forgeries from multiple methods with random weights, forcing the model to learn generalizable patterns. Furthermore, a dedicated Multivariate Forgery Intensity Estimation (MFIE) module is designed to explicitly guide the model in learning features related to varied forgery modes and intensities. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. On in-domain tests, our method improves Accuracy and AUC by 3.32\% and 4.02\%, respectively, over the best baseline. In cross-domain evaluations across five datasets, it achieves an average AUC gain of 3.27\%. Ablation studies confirm the efficacy of both proposed components. While the reliance on a large vision-language model entails higher computational cost, our work presents a significant step towards more generalizable and robust deepfake detection.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>LiDAR sensors are often considered essential for autonomous driving, but high-resolution sensors remain expensive while affordable low-resolution sensors produce sparse point clouds that miss critical details. LiDAR super-resolution addresses this challenge by using deep learning to enhance sparse point clouds, bridging the gap between different sensor types and enabling cross-sensor compatibility in real-world deployments. This paper presents the first comprehensive survey of LiDAR super-resolution methods for autonomous driving. Despite the importance of practical deployment, no systematic review has been conducted until now. We organize existing approaches into four categories: CNN-based architectures, model-based deep unrolling, implicit representation methods, and Transformer and Mamba-based approaches. We establish fundamental concepts including data representations, problem formulation, benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics. Current trends include the adoption of range image representation for efficient processing, extreme model compression and the development of resolution-flexible architectures. Recent research prioritizes real-time inference and cross-sensor generalization for practical deployment. We conclude by identifying open challenges and future research directions for advancing LiDAR super-resolution technology.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (KB-VQA) requires models to answer questions by integrating visual information with external knowledge. However, retrieved knowledge is often noisy, partially irrelevant, or misaligned with the visual content, while internal model knowledge is difficult to control and interpret. Naive aggregation of these sources limits reasoning effectiveness and reduces answer accuracy. To address this, we propose MaS-VQA, a selection-driven framework that tightly couples explicit knowledge filtering with implicit knowledge reasoning. MaS-VQA first retrieves candidate passages and applies a Mask-and-Select mechanism to jointly prune irrelevant image regions and weakly relevant knowledge fragments, producing compact, high-signal multimodal knowledge . This filtered knowledge then guides the activation of internal knowledge in a constrained semantic space, enabling complementary co-modeling of explicit and implicit knowledge for robust answer prediction. Experiments on Encyclopedic-VQA and InfoSeek demonstrate consistent performance gains across multiple MLLM backbones, and ablations verify that the selection mechanism effectively reduces noise and enhances knowledge utilization.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Benchmarking spatial reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has attracted growing interest in computer vision due to its importance for embodied AI and other agentic systems that require precise interaction with the physical world. However, spatial reasoning on Earth imagery has lagged behind, as it uniquely involves grounding objects in georeferenced images and quantitatively reasoning about distances, directions, and topological relations using both visual cues and vector geometry coordinates (e.g., 2D bounding boxes, polylines, and polygons). Existing benchmarks for Earth imagery primarily focus on 2D spatial grounding, image captioning, and coarse spatial relations (e.g., simple directional or proximity cues). They lack support for quantitative direction and distance reasoning, systematic topological relations, and complex object geometries beyond bounding boxes. To fill this gap, we propose \textbf{EarthSpatialBench}, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating spatial reasoning in MLLMs on Earth imagery. The benchmark contains over 325K question-answer pairs spanning: (1) qualitative and quantitative reasoning about spatial distance and direction; (2) systematic topological relations; (3) single-object queries, object-pair queries, and compositional aggregate group queries; and (4) object references expressed via textual descriptions, visual overlays, and explicit geometry coordinates, including 2D bounding boxes, polylines, and polygons. We conducted extensive experiments on both open-source and proprietary models to identify limitations in the spatial reasoning of MLLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative large vision-language models (LVLMs) have recently achieved impressive performance gains, and their user base is growing rapidly. However, the security of LVLMs, in particular in a long-context multi-turn setting, is largely underexplored. In this paper, we consider the realistic scenario in which an attacker uploads a manipulated image to the web/social media. A benign user downloads this image and uses it as input to the LVLM. Our novel stealthy Visual Memory Injection (VMI) attack is designed such that on normal prompts the LVLM exhibits nominal behavior, but once the user gives a triggering prompt, the LVLM outputs a specific prescribed target message to manipulate the user, e.g. for adversarial marketing or political persuasion. Compared to previous work that focused on single-turn attacks, VMI is effective even after a long multi-turn conversation with the user. We demonstrate our attack on several recent open-weight LVLMs. This article thereby shows that large-scale manipulation of users is feasible with perturbed images in multi-turn conversation settings, calling for better robustness of LVLMs against these attacks.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, defense, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Model Context Protocols (MCPs) provide a unified platform for agent systems to discover, select, and orchestrate tools across heterogeneous execution environments. As MCP-based systems scale to incorporate larger tool catalogs and multiple concurrently connected MCP servers, traditional tool-by-tool invocation increases coordination overhead, fragments state management, and limits support for wide-context operations. To address these scalability challenges, recent MCP designs have incorporated code execution as a first-class capability, an approach called Code Execution MCP (CE-MCP). This enables agents to consolidate complex workflows, such as SQL querying, file analysis, and multi-step data transformations, into a single program that executes within an isolated runtime environment. In this work, we formalize the architectural distinction between context-coupled (traditional) and context-decoupled (CE-MCP) models, analyzing their fundamental scalability trade-offs. Using the MCP-Bench framework across 10 representative servers, we empirically evaluate task behavior, tool utilization patterns, execution latency, and protocol efficiency as the scale of connected MCP servers and available tools increases, demonstrating that while CE-MCP significantly reduces token usage and execution latency, it introduces a vastly expanded attack surface. We address this security gap by applying the MAESTRO framework, identifying sixteen attack classes across five execution phases-including specific code execution threats such as exception-mediated code injection and unsafe capability synthesis. We validate these vulnerabilities through adversarial scenarios across multiple LLMs and propose a layered defense architecture comprising containerized sandboxing and semantic gating. Our findings provide a rigorous roadmap for balancing scalability and security in production-ready executable agent workflows.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Document understanding in real-world applications often requires processing heterogeneous, multi-page document packets containing multiple documents stitched together. Despite recent advances in visual document understanding, the fundamental task of document packet splitting, which involves separating a document packet into individual units, remains largely unaddressed. We present the first comprehensive benchmark dataset, DocSplit, along with novel evaluation metrics for assessing the document packet splitting capabilities of large language models. DocSplit comprises five datasets of varying complexity, covering diverse document types, layouts, and multimodal settings. We formalize the DocSplit task, which requires models to identify document boundaries, classify document types, and maintain correct page ordering within a document packet. The benchmark addresses real-world challenges, including out-of-order pages, interleaved documents, and documents lacking clear demarcations. We conduct extensive experiments evaluating multimodal LLMs on our datasets, revealing significant performance gaps in current models' ability to handle complex document splitting tasks. The DocSplit benchmark datasets and proposed novel evaluation metrics provide a systematic framework for advancing document understanding capabilities essential for legal, financial, healthcare, and other document-intensive domains. We release the datasets to facilitate future research in document packet processing.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>High-speed optical-resolution photoacoustic microscopy (OR-PAM) with bidirectional raster scanning doubles imaging speed but introduces coupled domain shift and geometric misalignment between forward and backward scan lines. Existing registration methods, constrained by brightness constancy assumptions, achieve limited alignment quality, while recent generative approaches address domain shift through complex architectures that lack temporal awareness across frames. We propose GPEReg-Net, a scene-appearance disentanglement framework that separates domain-invariant scene features from domain-specific appearance codes via Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN), enabling direct image-to-image registration without explicit deformation field estimation. To exploit temporal structure in sequential acquisitions, we introduce a Global Position Encoding (GPE) module that combines learnable position embeddings with sinusoidal encoding and cross-frame attention, allowing the network to leverage context from neighboring frames for improved temporal coherence. On the OR-PAM-Reg-4K benchmark (432 test samples), GPEReg-Net achieves NCC of 0.953, SSIM of 0.932, and PSNR of 34.49dB, surpassing the state-of-the-art by 3.8% in SSIM and 1.99dB in PSNR while maintaining competitive NCC.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, robust, fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid expansion of renewable energy, particularly wind and solar power, has made reliable forecasting critical for power system operations. While recent deep learning models have achieved strong average accuracy, the increasing frequency and intensity of climate-driven extreme weather events pose severe threats to grid stability and operational security. Consequently, developing robust forecasting models that can withstand volatile conditions has become a paramount challenge. In this paper, we present R$^2$Energy, a large-scale benchmark for NWP-assisted renewable energy forecasting. It comprises over 10.7 million high-fidelity hourly records from 902 wind and solar stations across four provinces in China, providing the diverse meteorological conditions necessary to capture the wide-ranging variability of renewable generation. We further establish a standardized, leakage-free forecasting paradigm that grants all models identical access to future Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) signals, enabling fair and reproducible comparison across state-of-the-art representative forecasting architectures. Beyond aggregate accuracy, we incorporate regime-wise evaluation with expert-aligned extreme weather annotations, uncovering a critical ``robustness gap'' typically obscured by average metrics. This gap reveals a stark robustness-complexity trade-off: under extreme conditions, a model's reliability is driven by its meteorological integration strategy rather than its architectural complexity. R$^2$Energy provides a principled foundation for evaluating and developing forecasting models for safety-critical power system applications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Continuous monitoring of vital signs in Pediatric Intensive Care Units (PICUs) is essential for early detection of clinical deterioration and effective clinical decision-making. However, contact-based sensors such as pulse oximeters may cause skin irritation, increase infection risk, and lead to patient discomfort. Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) offers a contactless alternative to monitor heart rate using facial video, but remains underutilized in PICUs due to motion artifacts, occlusions, variable lighting, and domain shifts between laboratory and clinical data. We introduce a self-supervised pretraining framework for rPPG estimation in the PICU setting, based on a progressive curriculum strategy. The approach leverages the VisionMamba architecture and integrates an adaptive masking mechanism, where a lightweight Mamba-based controller assigns spatiotemporal importance scores to guide probabilistic patch sampling. This strategy dynamically increases reconstruction difficulty while preserving physiological relevance. To address the lack of labeled clinical data, we adopt a teacher-student distillation setup. A supervised expert model, trained on public datasets, provides latent physiological guidance to the student. The curriculum progresses through three stages: clean public videos, synthetic occlusion scenarios, and unlabeled videos from 500 pediatric patients. Our framework achieves a 42% reduction in mean absolute error relative to standard masked autoencoders and outperforms PhysFormer by 31%, reaching a final MAE of 3.2 bpm. Without explicit region-of-interest extraction, the model consistently attends to pulse-rich areas and demonstrates robustness under clinical occlusions and noise.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Inspired by non-equilibrium thermodynamics, diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in generative modeling. However, their iterative sampling nature results in high inference latency. While recent distillation techniques accelerate sampling, they discard intermediate trajectory steps. This sparse supervision leads to a loss of structural information and introduces significant discretization errors. To mitigate this, we propose B-DENSE, a novel framework that leverages multi-branch trajectory alignment. We modify the student architecture to output $K$-fold expanded channels, where each subset corresponds to a specific branch representing a discrete intermediate step in the teacher's trajectory. By training these branches to simultaneously map to the entire sequence of the teacher's target timesteps, we enforce dense intermediate trajectory alignment. Consequently, the student model learns to navigate the solution space from the earliest stages of training, demonstrating superior image generation quality compared to baseline distillation frameworks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, defense, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As cyber threats grow in complexity and scale, many security incidents remain poorly managed due to the lack of proper training among C-level executives. Thus, there is a need for targeted cybersecurity education to enhance executive decision-making and crisis response. Traditional training methods, such as cyber wargames and Tabletop Exercises (TTX), aim to develop abilities to face critical incidents, however, they often lack the interactive and dynamic elements required to prepare individuals for real-world cyber incidents. This paper presents a novel approach to cybersecurity and cyberdefense education through the design of a specialized hybrid TTX for the maritime domain, which uses a framework to model mathematically how a cyberattack spreads along multiple nodes and impacts infrastructure. Our proposal was validated through exercises in Argentina and the United States, demonstrating a positive impact in developing the comprehension and projection levels of Cyber Situational Awareness (CSA), and reinforcing governance. Documentation about the Hybrid TTX, scenario, datasets and implementation of the SERDUX-MARCIM model, is available at the project repository at this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Flow and diffusion models are typically pre-trained on limited available data (e.g., molecular samples), covering only a fraction of the valid design space (e.g., the full molecular space). As a consequence, they tend to generate samples from only a narrow portion of the feasible domain. This is a fundamental limitation for scientific discovery applications, where one typically aims to sample valid designs beyond the available data distribution. To this end, we address the challenge of leveraging access to a verifier (e.g., an atomic bonds checker), to adapt a pre-trained flow model so that its induced density expands beyond regions of high data availability, while preserving samples validity. We introduce formal notions of strong and weak verifiers and propose algorithmic frameworks for global and local flow expansion via probability-space optimization. Then, we present Flow Expander (FE), a scalable mirror descent scheme that provably tackles both problems by verifier-constrained entropy maximization over the flow process noised state space. Next, we provide a thorough theoretical analysis of the proposed method, and state convergence guarantees under both idealized and general assumptions. Ultimately, we empirically evaluate our method on both illustrative, yet visually interpretable settings, and on a molecular design task showcasing the ability of FE to expand a pre-trained flow model increasing conformer diversity while preserving validity.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce SAM 3D Body (3DB), a promptable model for single-image full-body 3D human mesh recovery (HMR) that demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, with strong generalization and consistent accuracy in diverse in-the-wild conditions. 3DB estimates the human pose of the body, feet, and hands. It is the first model to use a new parametric mesh representation, Momentum Human Rig (MHR), which decouples skeletal structure and surface shape. 3DB employs an encoder-decoder architecture and supports auxiliary prompts, including 2D keypoints and masks, enabling user-guided inference similar to the SAM family of models. We derive high-quality annotations from a multi-stage annotation pipeline that uses various combinations of manual keypoint annotation, differentiable optimization, multi-view geometry, and dense keypoint detection. Our data engine efficiently selects and processes data to ensure data diversity, collecting unusual poses and rare imaging conditions. We present a new evaluation dataset organized by pose and appearance categories, enabling nuanced analysis of model behavior. Our experiments demonstrate superior generalization and substantial improvements over prior methods in both qualitative user preference studies and traditional quantitative analysis. Both 3DB and MHR are open-source.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in radiology report generation (RRG) have been driven by large paired image-text datasets; however, progress in neuro-oncology has been limited due to a lack of open paired image-report datasets. Here, we introduce BTReport, an open-source framework for brain tumor RRG that constructs natural language radiology reports using deterministically extracted imaging features. Unlike existing approaches that rely on large general-purpose or fine-tuned vision-language models for both image interpretation and report composition, BTReport performs deterministic feature extraction for image analysis and uses large language models only for syntactic structuring and narrative formatting. By separating RRG into a deterministic feature extraction step and a report generation step, the generated reports are completely interpretable and less prone to hallucinations. We show that the features used for report generation are predictive of key clinical outcomes, including survival and IDH mutation status, and reports generated by BTReport are more closely aligned with reference clinical reports than existing baselines for RRG. Finally, we introduce BTReport-BraTS, a companion dataset that augments BraTS imaging with synthetically generated radiology reports produced with BTReport.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vision-language foundation models have emerged as powerful general-purpose representation learners with strong potential for multimodal understanding, but their deterministic embeddings often fail to provide the reliability required for high-stakes biomedical applications. This work introduces MedProbCLIP, a probabilistic vision-language learning framework for chest X-ray and radiology report representation learning and bidirectional retrieval. MedProbCLIP models image and text representations as Gaussian embeddings through a probabilistic contrastive objective that explicitly captures uncertainty and many-to-many correspondences between radiographs and clinical narratives. A variational information bottleneck mitigates overconfident predictions, while MedProbCLIP employs multi-view radiograph encoding and multi-section report encoding during training to provide fine-grained supervision for clinically aligned correspondence, yet requires only a single radiograph and a single report at inference. Evaluated on the MIMIC-CXR dataset, MedProbCLIP outperforms deterministic and probabilistic baselines, including CLIP, CXR-CLIP, and PCME++, in both retrieval and zero-shot classification. Beyond accuracy, MedProbCLIP demonstrates superior calibration, risk-coverage behavior, selective retrieval reliability, and robustness to clinically relevant corruptions, underscoring the value of probabilistic vision-language modeling for improving the trustworthiness and safety of radiology image-text retrieval systems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Molecular crystal structure prediction represents a grand challenge in computational chemistry due to large sizes of constituent molecules and complex intra- and intermolecular interactions. While generative modeling has revolutionized structure discovery for molecules, inorganic solids, and metal-organic frameworks, extending such approaches to fully periodic molecular crystals is still elusive. Here, we present MolCrystalFlow, a flow-based generative model for molecular crystal structure prediction. The framework disentangles intramolecular complexity from intermolecular packing by embedding molecules as rigid bodies and jointly learning the lattice matrix, molecular orientations, and centroid positions. Centroids and orientations are represented on their native Riemannian manifolds, allowing geodesic flow construction and graph neural network operations that respects geometric symmetries. We benchmark our model against state-of-the-art generative models for large-size periodic crystals and rule-based structure generation methods on two open-source molecular crystal datasets. We demonstrate an integration of MolCrystalFlow model with universal machine learning potential to accelerate molecular crystal structure prediction, paving the way for data-driven generative discovery of molecular crystals.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Speculative decoding accelerates Large Language Model (LLM) inference by verifying multiple drafted tokens in parallel. However, for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, this parallelism introduces a severe bottleneck: large draft trees activate many unique experts, significantly increasing memory pressure and diminishing speedups from speculative decoding relative to autoregressive decoding. Prior methods reduce speculation depth when MoE verification becomes expensive. We propose MoE-Spec, a training-free verification-time expert budgeting method that decouples speculation depth from memory cost by enforcing a fixed expert capacity limit at each layer, loading only the experts that contribute most to verification and dropping the long tail of rarely used experts that drive bandwidth overhead. Experiments across multiple model scales and datasets show that this method yields 10--30\% higher throughput than state-of-the-art speculative decoding baselines (EAGLE-3) at comparable quality, with flexibility to trade accuracy for further latency reductions through tighter budgets.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), such as large language models (LLMs), has become a transformative force across science, industry, and society. As these systems grow in popularity, web data becomes increasingly interwoven with this AI-generated material and it is increasingly difficult to separate them from naturally generated content. As generative models are updated regularly, later models will inevitably be trained on mixtures of human-generated data and AI-generated data from earlier versions, creating a recursive training process with data contamination. Existing theoretical work has examined only highly simplified settings, where both the real data and the generative model are discrete or Gaussian, where it has been shown that such recursive training leads to model collapse. However, real data distributions are far more complex, and modern generative models are far more flexible than Gaussian and linear mechanisms. To fill this gap, we study recursive training in a general framework with minimal assumptions on the real data distribution and allow the underlying generative model to be a general universal approximator. In this framework, we show that contaminated recursive training still converges, with a convergence rate equal to the minimum of the baseline model's convergence rate and the fraction of real data used in each iteration. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first (positive) theoretical result on recursive training without distributional assumptions on the data. We further extend the analysis to settings where sampling bias is present in data collection and support all theoretical results with empirical studies.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Epilepsy affects over 50 million people worldwide, and one-third of patients suffer drug-resistant seizures where surgery offers the best chance of seizure freedom. Accurate localization of the epileptogenic zone (EZ) relies on intracranial EEG (iEEG). Clinical workflows, however, remain constrained by labor-intensive manual review. At the same time, existing data-driven approaches are typically developed on single-center datasets that are inconsistent in format and metadata, lack standardized benchmarks, and rarely release pathological event annotations, creating barriers to reproducibility, cross-center validation, and clinical relevance. With extensive efforts to reconcile heterogeneous iEEG formats, metadata, and recordings across publicly available sources, we present $\textbf{Omni-iEEG}$, a large-scale, pre-surgical iEEG resource comprising $\textbf{302 patients}$ and $\textbf{178 hours}$ of high-resolution recordings. The dataset includes harmonized clinical metadata such as seizure onset zones, resections, and surgical outcomes, all validated by board-certified epileptologists. In addition, Omni-iEEG provides over 36K expert-validated annotations of pathological events, enabling robust biomarker studies. Omni-iEEG serves as a bridge between machine learning and epilepsy research. It defines clinically meaningful tasks with unified evaluation metrics grounded in clinical priors, enabling systematic evaluation of models in clinically relevant settings. Beyond benchmarking, we demonstrate the potential of end-to-end modeling on long iEEG segments and highlight the transferability of representations pretrained on non-neurophysiological domains. Together, these contributions establish Omni-iEEG as a foundation for reproducible, generalizable, and clinically translatable epilepsy research.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Where should we intervene in a language model (LM) to control behaviors that are diffused across many tokens of a long-form response? We introduce Generative Causal Mediation (GCM), a procedure for selecting model components, e.g., attention heads, to steer a binary concept (e.g., talk in verse vs. talk in prose) from contrastive long-form responses. In GCM, we first construct a dataset of contrasting inputs and responses. Then, we quantify how individual model components mediate the contrastive concept and select the strongest mediators for steering. We evaluate GCM on three tasks--refusal, sycophancy, and style transfer--across three language models. GCM successfully localizes concepts expressed in long-form responses and consistently outperforms correlational probe-based baselines when steering with a sparse set of attention heads. Together, these results demonstrate that GCM provides an effective approach for localizing and controlling the long-form responses of LMs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Any-order autoregressive models (AO-ARMs) offer a promising path toward efficient masked diffusion by enabling native key-value caching, but competitive performance has so far required two-stream attention, typically motivated as a means of decoupling token content from position. In this work, we argue that two-stream attention may be serving a more subtle role. We identify a structural-semantic tradeoff in any-order generation: the hidden representation at each step must simultaneously attend to semantically informative tokens for prediction and structurally recent tokens for summarization, objectives that compete for attention capacity in a single stream but can specialize across two streams. To isolate this tradeoff from position-content separation, we propose Decoupled RoPE, a modification to rotary position embeddings that provides target position information without revealing target content. Decoupled RoPE performs competitively at short sequence lengths--where semantic and structural proximity coincide--but degrades as sequence length increases and the two orderings diverge. These results suggest that the success of two-stream attention stems not merely from separating position from content, but from circumventing the deeper structural-semantic tradeoff inherent to any-order generation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, attack, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT) relies on heterogeneous, bandwidth-constrained, and intermittently connected tactical networks that face rapidly evolving cyber threats. In this setting, intrusion detection cannot depend on continuous central collection of raw traffic due to disrupted links, latency, operational security limits, and non-IID traffic across zones. We present Zone-Adaptive Intrusion Detection (ZAID), a collaborative detection and model-improvement framework for unseen attack types, where "zero-day" refers to previously unobserved attack families and behaviours (not vulnerability disclosure timing). ZAID combines a universal convolutional model for generalisable traffic representations, an autoencoder-based reconstruction signal as an auxiliary anomaly score, and lightweight adapter modules for parameter-efficient zone adaptation. To support cross-zone generalisation under constrained connectivity, ZAID uses federated aggregation and pseudo-labelling to leverage locally observed, weakly labelled behaviours. We evaluate ZAID on ToN_IoT using a zero-day protocol that excludes MITM, DDoS, and DoS from supervised training and introduces them during zone-level deployment and adaptation. ZAID achieves up to 83.16% accuracy on unseen attack traffic and transfers to UNSW-NB15 under the same procedure, with a best accuracy of 71.64%. These results indicate that parameter-efficient, zone-personalised collaboration can improve the detection of previously unseen attacks in contested IoBT environments.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, attack, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Cross-border insider threats pose a critical challenge to government financial schemes, particularly when dealing with distributed, privacy-sensitive data across multiple jurisdictions. Existing approaches face fundamental limitations: they cannot effectively share intelligence across borders due to privacy constraints, lack reasoning capabilities to understand complex multi-step attack patterns, and fail to capture intricate graph-structured relationships in financial networks. We introduce FedGraph-AGI, a novel federated learning framework integrating Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) reasoning with graph neural networks for privacy-preserving cross-border insider threat detection. Our approach combines: (1) federated graph neural networks preserving data sovereignty; (2) Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) aggregation for heterogeneous jurisdictions; and (3) AGI-powered reasoning via Large Action Models (LAM) performing causal inference over graph data. Through experiments on a 50,000-transaction dataset across 10 jurisdictions, FedGraph-AGI achieves 92.3% accuracy, significantly outperforming federated baselines (86.1%) and centralized approaches (84.7%). Our ablation studies reveal AGI reasoning contributes 6.8% improvement, while MoE adds 4.4%. The system maintains epsilon = 1.0 differential privacy while achieving near-optimal performance and scales efficiently to 50+ clients. This represents the first integration of AGI reasoning with federated graph learning for insider threat detection, opening new directions for privacy-preserving cross-border intelligence sharing.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Computed Tomography (CT) is one of the most widely used and diagnostically information-dense imaging modalities, covering critical organs such as the heart, lungs, liver, and colon. Clinical interpretation relies on both slice-driven local features (e.g., sub-centimeter nodules, lesion boundaries) and volume-driven spatial representations (e.g., tumor infiltration, inter-organ anatomical relations). However, existing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) remain fragmented in CT slice versus volumetric understanding: slice-driven LVLMs show strong generalization but lack cross-slice spatial consistency, while volume-driven LVLMs explicitly capture volumetric semantics but suffer from coarse granularity and poor compatibility with slice inputs. The absence of a unified modeling paradigm constitutes a major bottleneck for the clinical translation of medical LVLMs. We present OmniCT, a powerful unified slice-volume LVLM for CT scenarios, which makes three contributions: (i) Spatial Consistency Enhancement (SCE): volumetric slice composition combined with tri-axial positional embedding that introduces volumetric consistency, and an MoE hybrid projection enables efficient slice-volume adaptation; (ii) Organ-level Semantic Enhancement (OSE): segmentation and ROI localization explicitly align anatomical regions, emphasizing lesion- and organ-level semantics; (iii) MedEval-CT: the largest slice-volume CT dataset and hybrid benchmark integrates comprehensive metrics for unified evaluation. OmniCT consistently outperforms existing methods with a substantial margin across diverse clinical tasks and satisfies both micro-level detail sensitivity and macro-level spatial reasoning. More importantly, it establishes a new paradigm for cross-modal medical imaging understanding.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper introduces and demonstrates a computational pipeline for the statistical analysis of shape graph datasets, namely geometric networks embedded in 2D or 3D spaces. Unlike traditional abstract graphs, our purpose is not only to retrieve and distinguish variations in the connectivity structure of the data but also geometric differences of the network branches. Our proposed approach relies on the extraction of a specifically curated and explicit set of topological, geometric and directional features, designed to satisfy key invariance properties. We leverage the resulting feature representation for tasks such as group comparison, clustering and classification on cohorts of shape graphs. The effectiveness of this representation is evaluated on several real-world datasets including urban road/street networks, neuronal traces and astrocyte imaging. These results are benchmarked against several alternative methods, both feature-based and not.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text-to-video diffusion models deliver impressive results but remain slow because of the sequential denoising of 3D latents. Existing approaches to speed up inference either require expensive model retraining or use heuristic-based step skipping, which struggles to maintain video quality as the number of denoising steps decreases. Our work, CHAI, aims to use cross-inference caching to reduce latency while maintaining video quality. We introduce Cache Attention as an effective method for attending to shared objects/scenes across cross-inference latents. This selective attention mechanism enables effective reuse of cached latents across semantically related prompts, yielding high cache hit rates. We show that it is possible to generate high-quality videos using Cache Attention with as few as 8 denoising steps. When integrated into the overall system, CHAI is 1.65x - 3.35x faster than baseline OpenSora 1.2 while maintaining video quality.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As multimodal systems increasingly process sensitive personal data, the ability to selectively revoke specific data modalities has become a critical requirement for privacy compliance and user autonomy. We present Missing-by-Design (MBD), a unified framework for revocable multimodal sentiment analysis that combines structured representation learning with a certifiable parameter-modification pipeline. Revocability is critical in privacy-sensitive applications where users or regulators may request removal of modality-specific information. MBD learns property-aware embeddings and employs generator-based reconstruction to recover missing channels while preserving task-relevant signals. For deletion requests, the framework applies saliency-driven candidate selection and a calibrated Gaussian update to produce a machine-verifiable Modality Deletion Certificate. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that MBD achieves strong predictive performance under incomplete inputs and delivers a practical privacy-utility trade-off, positioning surgical unlearning as an efficient alternative to full retraining.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Demographic bias in text-to-image (T2I) generation is well studied, yet demographic-conditioned failures in instruction-guided image-to-image (I2I) editing remain underexplored. We examine whether identical edit instructions yield systematically different outcomes across subject demographics in open-weight I2I editors. We formalize two failure modes: Soft Erasure, where edits are silently weakened or ignored in the output image, and Stereotype Replacement, where edits introduce unrequested, stereotype-consistent attributes. We introduce a controlled benchmark that probes demographic-conditioned behavior by generating and editing portraits conditioned on race, gender, and age using a diagnostic prompt set, and evaluate multiple editors with vision-language model (VLM) scoring and human evaluation. Our analysis shows that identity preservation failures are pervasive, demographically uneven, and shaped by implicit social priors, including occupation-driven gender inference. Finally, we demonstrate that a prompt-level identity constraint, without model updates, can substantially reduce demographic change for minority groups while leaving majority-group portraits largely unchanged, revealing asymmetric identity priors in current editors. Together, our findings establish identity preservation as a central and demographically uneven failure mode in I2I editing and motivate demographic-robust editing systems.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, interpretability, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning sometimes fails to faithfully reflect the true computation of a large language model (LLM), hampering its utility in explaining how LLMs arrive at their answers. Moreover, optimizing for faithfulness and interpretability in reasoning often degrades task performance. To address this tradeoff and improve CoT faithfulness, we propose Reasoning Execution by Multiple Listeners (REMUL), a multi-party reinforcement learning approach. REMUL builds on the hypothesis that reasoning traces which other parties can follow will be more faithful. A speaker model generates a reasoning trace, which is truncated and passed to a pool of listener models who "execute" the trace, continuing the trace to an answer. Speakers are rewarded for producing reasoning that is clear to listeners, with additional correctness regularization via masked supervised finetuning to counter the tradeoff between faithfulness and performance. On multiple reasoning benchmarks (BIG-Bench Extra Hard, MuSR, ZebraLogicBench, and FOLIO), REMUL consistently and substantially improves three measures of faithfulness -- hint attribution, early answering area over the curve (AOC), and mistake injection AOC -- while also improving accuracy. Our analysis finds that these gains are robust across training domains, translate to legibility gains, and are associated with shorter and more direct CoTs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Real-world deployments routinely face distribution shifts, group imbalances, and adversarial perturbations, under which the traditional Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) framework can degrade severely. Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) addresses this issue by optimizing the worst-case expected loss over an uncertainty set of distributions, offering a principled approach to robustness. Meanwhile, as training data in DRO always involves sensitive information, safeguarding it against leakage under Differential Privacy (DP) is essential. In contrast to classical DP-ERM, DP-DRO has received much less attention due to its minimax optimization structure with uncertainty constraint. To bridge the gap, we provide a comprehensive study of DP-(finite-sum)-DRO with $\psi$-divergence and non-convex loss. First, we study DRO with general $\psi$-divergence by reformulating it as a minimization problem, and develop a novel $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP optimization method, called DP Double-Spider, tailored to this structure. Under mild assumptions, we show that it achieves a utility bound of $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+ (\frac{\sqrt{d \log (1/\delta)}}{n \varepsilon})^{2/3})$ in terms of the gradient norm, where $n$ denotes the data size and $d$ denotes the model dimension. We further improve the utility rate for specific divergences. In particular, for DP-DRO with KL-divergence, by transforming the problem into a compositional finite-sum optimization problem, we develop a DP Recursive-Spider method and show that it achieves a utility bound of $\mathcal{O}((\frac{\sqrt{d \log(1/\delta)}}{n\varepsilon})^{2/3} )$, matching the best-known result for non-convex DP-ERM. Experimentally, we demonstrate that our proposed methods outperform existing approaches for DP minimax optimization.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Transformer-based single-object trackers achieve state-of-the-art accuracy but rely on fixed-depth inference, executing the full encoder--decoder stack for every frame regardless of visual complexity, thereby incurring unnecessary computational cost in long video sequences dominated by temporally coherent frames. We propose UncL-STARK, an architecture-preserving approach that enables dynamic, uncertainty-aware depth adaptation in transformer-based trackers without modifying the underlying network or adding auxiliary heads. The model is fine-tuned to retain predictive robustness at multiple intermediate depths using random-depth training with knowledge distillation, thus enabling safe inference-time truncation. At runtime, we derive a lightweight uncertainty estimate directly from the model's corner localization heatmaps and use it in a feedback-driven policy that selects the encoder and decoder depth for the next frame based on the prediction confidence by exploiting temporal coherence in video. Extensive experiments on GOT-10k and LaSOT demonstrate up to 12\% GFLOPs reduction, 8.9\% latency reduction, and 10.8\% energy savings while maintaining tracking accuracy within 0.2\% of the full-depth baseline across both short-term and long-term sequences.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Training LLMs as interactive agents for multi-turn decision-making remains challenging, particularly in long-horizon tasks with sparse and delayed rewards, where agents must execute extended sequences of actions before receiving meaningful feedback. Most existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches model LLM agents as flat policies operating at a single time scale, selecting one action at each turn. In sparse-reward settings, such flat policies must propagate credit across the entire trajectory without explicit temporal abstraction, which often leads to unstable optimization and inefficient credit assignment. We propose HiPER, a novel Hierarchical Plan-Execute RL framework that explicitly separates high-level planning from low-level execution. HiPER factorizes the policy into a high-level planner that proposes subgoals and a low-level executor that carries them out over multiple action steps. To align optimization with this structure, we introduce a key technique called hierarchical advantage estimation (HAE), which carefully assigns credit at both the planning and execution levels. By aggregating returns over the execution of each subgoal and coordinating updates across the two levels, HAE provides an unbiased gradient estimator and provably reduces variance compared to flat generalized advantage estimation. Empirically, HiPER achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging interactive benchmarks, reaching 97.4\% success on ALFWorld and 83.3\% on WebShop with Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct (+6.6\% and +8.3\% over the best prior method), with especially large gains on long-horizon tasks requiring multiple dependent subtasks. These results highlight the importance of explicit hierarchical decomposition for scalable RL training of multi-turn LLM agents.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Non-autoregressive (NAR) generation reduces decoding latency by predicting many tokens in parallel, but iterative refinement often suffers from error accumulation and distribution shift under self-generated drafts. Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) and their remasking samplers (e.g., ReMDM) can be viewed as modern NAR iterative refinement, where generation repeatedly revises a partially observed draft. In this work we show that \emph{training alone} can substantially improve the step-efficiency of MDLM/ReMDM sampling. We propose \textsc{DSL} (Discrete Stochastic Localization), which trains a single SNR-invariant denoiser across a continuum of corruption levels, bridging intermediate draft noise and mask-style endpoint corruption within one Diffusion Transformer. On OpenWebText, \textsc{DSL} fine-tuning yields large MAUVE gains at low step budgets, surpassing the MDLM+ReMDM baseline with \(\sim\)4$\times$ fewer denoiser evaluations, and matches autoregressive quality at high budgets. Analyses show improved self-correction and uncertainty calibration, making remasking markedly more compute-efficient.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Energy theft poses a significant threat to the stability and efficiency of smart grids, leading to substantial economic losses and operational challenges. Traditional centralized machine learning approaches for theft detection require aggregating user data, raising serious concerns about privacy and data security. These issues are further exacerbated in smart meter environments, where devices are often resource-constrained and lack the capacity to run heavy models. In this work, we propose a privacy-preserving federated learning framework for energy theft detection that addresses both privacy and computational constraints. Our approach leverages a lightweight multilayer perceptron (MLP) model, suitable for deployment on low-power smart meters, and integrates basic differential privacy (DP) by injecting Gaussian noise into local model updates before aggregation. This ensures formal privacy guarantees without compromising learning performance. We evaluate our framework on a real-world smart meter dataset under both IID and non-IID data distributions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC scores while maintaining privacy and efficiency. This makes the proposed solution practical and scalable for secure energy theft detection in next-generation smart grid infrastructures.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multimodal systems are vulnerable to partial or complete loss of input channels at deployment, which undermines reliability in real-world settings. This paper presents ModalImmune, a training framework that enforces modality immunity by intentionally and controllably collapsing selected modality information during training so the model learns joint representations that are robust to destructive modality influence. The framework combines a spectrum-adaptive collapse regularizer, an information-gain guided controller for targeted interventions, curvature-aware gradient masking to stabilize destructive updates, and a certified Neumann-truncated hyper-gradient procedure for automatic meta-parameter adaptation. Empirical evaluation on standard multimodal benchmarks demonstrates that ModalImmune improves resilience to modality removal and corruption while retaining convergence stability and reconstruction capacity.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Adaptation methods have been a workhorse for unlocking the transformative power of pre-trained diffusion models in diverse applications. Existing approaches often abstract adaptation objectives as a reward function and steer diffusion models to generate high-reward samples. However, these approaches can incur high computational overhead due to additional training, or rely on stringent assumptions on the reward such as differentiability. Moreover, despite their empirical success, theoretical justification and guarantees are seldom established. In this paper, we propose DOIT (Doob-Oriented Inference-time Transformation), a training-free and computationally efficient adaptation method that applies to generic, non-differentiable rewards. The key framework underlying our method is a measure transport formulation that seeks to transport the pre-trained generative distribution to a high-reward target distribution. We leverage Doob's $h$-transform to realize this transport, which induces a dynamic correction to the diffusion sampling process and enables efficient simulation-based computation without modifying the pre-trained model. Theoretically, we establish a high probability convergence guarantee to the target high-reward distribution via characterizing the approximation error in the dynamic Doob's correction. Empirically, on D4RL offline RL benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while preserving sampling efficiency.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, fair, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) are trained on web-scale corpora that exhibit steep power-law distributions, in which the distribution of knowledge is highly long-tailed, with most appearing infrequently. While scaling has improved average-case performance, persistent failures on low-frequency, domain-specific, cultural, and temporal knowledge remain poorly characterized. This paper develops a structured taxonomy and analysis of long-Tail Knowledge in large language models, synthesizing prior work across technical and sociotechnical perspectives. We introduce a structured analytical framework that synthesizes prior work across four complementary axes: how long-Tail Knowledge is defined, the mechanisms by which it is lost or distorted during training and inference, the technical interventions proposed to mitigate these failures, and the implications of these failures for fairness, accountability, transparency, and user trust. We further examine how existing evaluation practices obscure tail behavior and complicate accountability for rare but consequential failures. The paper concludes by identifying open challenges related to privacy, sustainability, and governance that constrain long-Tail Knowledge representation. Taken together, this paper provides a unifying conceptual framework for understanding how long-Tail Knowledge is defined, lost, evaluated, and manifested in deployed language model systems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep learning has improved automated electrocardiogram (ECG) classification, but limited insight into prediction reliability hinders its use in safety-critical settings. This paper proposes UCTECG-Net, an uncertainty-aware hybrid architecture that combines one-dimensional convolutions and Transformer encoders to process raw ECG signals and their spectrograms jointly. Evaluated on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia and PTB Diagnostic datasets, UCTECG-Net outperforms LSTM, CNN1D, and Transformer baselines in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score, achieving up to 98.58% accuracy on MIT-BIH and 99.14% on PTB. To assess predictive reliability, we integrate three uncertainty quantification methods (Monte Carlo Dropout, Deep Ensembles, and Ensemble Monte Carlo Dropout) into all models and analyze their behavior using an uncertainty-aware confusion matrix and derived metrics. The results show that UCTECG-Net, particularly with Ensemble or EMCD, provides more reliable and better-aligned uncertainty estimates than competing architectures, offering a stronger basis for risk-aware ECG decision support.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Surface extraction from implicit neural representations modelling a single class surface is a well-known task.

In this work, we lay the groundwork by introducing a 2D boundary extraction algorithm for the multi-class case focusing on topological consistency and water-tightness, which also allows for setting minimum detail restraint on the approximation. Finally, we evaluate our algorithm using geological modelling data, showcasing its adaptiveness and ability to honour complex topology.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automated annotators to scale dataset creation, yet their reliability as unbiased annotators--especially for low-resource and identity-sensitive settings--remains poorly understood. In this work, we study the behavior of LLMs as zero-shot annotators for Bangla hate speech, a task where even human agreement is challenging, and annotator bias can have serious downstream consequences. We conduct a systematic benchmark of 17 LLMs using a unified evaluation framework. Our analysis uncovers annotator bias and substantial instability in model judgments. Surprisingly, increased model scale does not guarantee improved annotation quality--smaller, more task-aligned models frequently exhibit more consistent behavior than their larger counterparts. These results highlight important limitations of current LLMs for sensitive annotation tasks in low-resource languages and underscore the need for careful evaluation before deployment.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multimodal fusion frameworks, which integrate diverse medical imaging modalities (e.g., MRI, CT), have shown great potential in applications such as skin cancer detection, dementia diagnosis, and brain tumor prediction. However, existing multimodal fusion methods face significant challenges. First, they often rely on computationally expensive models, limiting their applicability in low-resource environments. Second, they often employ cascaded attention modules, which potentially increase risk of information loss during inter-module transitions and hinder their capacity to effectively capture robust shared representations across modalities. This restricts their generalization in multi-disease analysis tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a Hybrid Parallel-Fusion Cascaded Attention Network (HyPCA-Net), composed of two core novel blocks: (a) a computationally efficient residual adaptive learning attention block for capturing refined modality-specific representations, and (b) a dual-view cascaded attention block aimed at learning robust shared representations across diverse modalities. Extensive experiments on ten publicly available datasets exhibit that HyPCA-Net significantly outperforms existing leading methods, with improvements of up to 5.2% in performance and reductions of up to 73.1% in computational cost.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Self-supervised pretraining has transformed computer vision by enabling data-efficient fine-tuning, yet high-resolution training typically requires server-scale infrastructure, limiting in-domain foundation model development for many research laboratories. Masked Autoencoders (MAE) reduce computation by encoding only visible tokens, but combining MAE with hierarchical downsampling architectures remains structurally challenging due to dense grid priors and mask-aware design compromises. We introduce AFFMAE, a masking-friendly hierarchical pretraining framework built on adaptive, off-grid token merging. By discarding masked tokens and performing dynamic merging exclusively over visible tokens, AFFMAE removes dense-grid assumptions while preserving hierarchical scalability. We developed numerically stable mixed-precision Flash-style cluster attention kernels, and mitigate sparse-stage representation collapse via deep supervision. On high-resolution electron microscopy segmentation, AFFMAE matches ViT-MAE performance at equal parameter count while reducing FLOPs by up to 7x, halving memory usage, and achieving faster training on a single RTX 5090.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this work, we develop, for the first time, a supervised classification framework with class-dependent rewards (CDR) to predict $\geq$MM flares within 24 hr. We construct multiple datasets, covering knowledge-informed features and line-of sight (LOS) magnetograms. We also apply three deep learning models (CNN, CNN-BiLSTM, and Transformer) and three CDR counterparts (CDR-CNN, CDR-CNN-BiLSTM, and CDR-Transformer). First, we analyze the importance of LOS magnetic field parameters with the Transformer, then compare its performance using LOS-only, vector-only, and combined magnetic field parameters. Second, we compare flare prediction performance based on CDR models versus deep learning counterparts. Third, we perform sensitivity analysis on reward engineering for CDR models. Fourth, we use the SHAP method for model interpretability. Finally, we conduct performance comparison between our models and NASA/CCMC. The main findings are: (1)Among LOS feature combinations, R_VALUE and AREA_ACR consistently yield the best results. (2)Transformer achieves better performance with combined LOS and vector magnetic field data than with either alone. (3)Models using knowledge-informed features outperform those using magnetograms. (4)While CNN and CNN-BiLSTM outperform their CDR counterparts on magnetograms, CDR-Transformer is slightly superior to its deep learning counterpart when using knowledge-informed features. Among all models, CDR-Transformer achieves the best performance. (5)The predictive performance of the CDR models is not overly sensitive to the reward choices.(6)Through SHAP analysis, the CDR model tends to regard TOTUSJH as more important, while the Transformer tends to prioritize R_VALUE more.(7)Under identical prediction time and active region (AR) number, the CDR-Transformer shows superior predictive capabilities compared to NASA/CCMC.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, security, extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Ring signatures are a powerful primitive that allows a member to sign on behalf of a group, without revealing their identity. Recently, ring signatures have received additional attention as an ingredient for post-quantum deniable authenticated key exchange, e.g., for a post-quantum version of the Signal protocol, employed by virtually all end-to-end-encrypted messenger services. While several ring signature constructions from post-quantum assumptions offer suitable security and efficiency for use in deniable key exchange, they are currently proven secure in the random oracle model (ROM) only, which is insufficient for post-quantum security. In this work, we provide four security reductions in the quantum-accessible random oracle model (QROM) for two generic ring signature constructions: two for the AOS framework and two for a construction paradigm based on ring trapdoors, whose generic backbone we formalize. The two security proofs for AOS ring signatures differ in their requirements on the underlying sigma protocol and their tightness. The two reductions for the ring-trapdoor-based ring signatures exhibit various differences in requirements and the security they provide. We employ the measure-and-reprogram technique, QROM straightline extraction tools based on the compressed oracle, history-free reductions and QROM reprogramming tools. To make use of Rényi divergence properties in the QROM, we study the behavior of quantum algorithms that interact with an oracle whose distribution is based on one of two different distributions over the set of outputs. We provide tight bounds for the statistical distance, show that the Rényi divergence can not be used to replace the entire oracle and provide a workaround.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present the first high-probability regret bound for classical online Q-learning in infinite-horizon discounted Markov decision processes, without relying on optimism or bonus terms. We first analyze Boltzmann Q-learning with decaying temperature and show that its regret depends critically on the suboptimality gap of the MDP: for sufficiently large gaps, the regret is sublinear, while for small gaps it deteriorates and can approach linear growth. To address this limitation, we study a Smoothed $\epsilon_n$-Greedy exploration scheme that combines $\epsilon_n$-greedy and Boltzmann exploration, for which we prove a gap-robust regret bound of near-$\tilde{O}(N^{9/10})$. To analyze these algorithms, we develop a high-probability concentration bound for contractive Markovian stochastic approximation with iterate- and time-dependent transition dynamics. This bound may be of independent interest as the contraction factor in our bound is governed by the mixing time and is allowed to converge to one asymptotically.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Eyeframe lens tracing is an important process in the optical industry that requires sub-millimeter precision to ensure proper lens fitting and optimal vision correction. Traditional frame tracers rely on mechanical tools that need precise positioning and calibration, which are time-consuming and require additional equipment, creating an inefficient workflow for opticians. This work presents a novel approach based on artificial vision that utilizes multi-view information. The proposed algorithm operates on images captured from an InVision system. The full pipeline includes image acquisition, frame segmentation to isolate the eyeframe from background, depth estimation to obtain 3D spatial information, and multi-view processing that integrates segmented RGB images with depth data for precise frame contour measurement. To this end, different configurations and variants are proposed and analyzed on real data, providing competitive measurements from still color images with respect to other solutions, while eliminating the need for specialized tracing equipment and reducing workflow complexity for optical technicians.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Arabic dialects have long been under-represented in Natural Language Processing (NLP) research due to their non-standardization and high variability, which pose challenges for computational modeling. Recent advances in the field, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), offer promising avenues to address this gap by enabling Arabic to be modeled as a pluricentric language rather than a monolithic system. This paper presents Aladdin-FTI, our submission to the AMIYA shared task. The proposed system is designed to both generate and translate dialectal Arabic (DA). Specifically, the model supports text generation in Moroccan, Egyptian, Palestinian, Syrian, and Saudi dialects, as well as bidirectional translation between these dialects, Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), and English. The code and trained model are publicly available.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) are beginning to reshape how media professionals verify information, yet automated support for detecting check-worthy claims a key step in the fact-checking process remains limited. We introduce the Multi-Check-Worthy (MultiCW) dataset, a balanced multilingual benchmark for check-worthy claim detection spanning 16 languages, 7 topical domains, and 2 writing styles. It consists of 123,722 samples, evenly distributed between noisy (informal) and structured (formal) texts, with balanced representation of check-worthy and non-check-worthy classes across all languages. To probe robustness, we also introduce an equally balanced out-of-distribution evaluation set of 27,761 samples in 4 additional languages. To provide baselines, we benchmark 3 common fine-tuned multilingual transformers against a diverse set of 15 commercial and open LLMs under zero-shot settings. Our findings show that fine-tuned models consistently outperform zero-shot LLMs on claim classification and show strong out-of-distribution generalization across languages, domains, and styles. MultiCW provides a rigorous multilingual resource for advancing automated fact-checking and enables systematic comparisons between fine-tuned models and cutting-edge LLMs on the check-worthy claim detection task.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, attack, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The prevalence of malicious packages in open-source repositories, such as PyPI, poses a critical threat to the software supply chain. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising tool for automated security tasks, their effectiveness in detecting malicious packages and indicators remains underexplored. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of 13 LLMs for detecting malicious software packages. Using a curated dataset of 4,070 packages (3,700 benign and 370 malicious), we evaluate model performance across two tasks: binary classification (package detection) and multi-label classification (identification of specific malicious indicators). We further investigate the impact of prompting strategies, temperature settings, and model specifications on detection accuracy. We find a significant "granularity gap" in LLMs' capabilities. While GPT-4.1 achieves near-perfect performance in binary detection (F1 $\approx$ 0.99), performance degrades by approximately 41\% when the task shifts to identifying specific malicious indicators. We observe that general models are best for filtering out the majority of threats, while specialized coder models are better at detecting attacks that follow a strict, predictable code structure. Our correlation analysis indicates that parameter size and context width have negligible explanatory power regarding detection accuracy. We conclude that while LLMs are powerful detectors at the package level, they lack the semantic depth required for precise identification at the granular indicator level.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Fault injection attacks on embedded neural network models have been shown as a potent threat. Numerous works studied resilience of models from various points of view. As of now, there is no comprehensive study that would evaluate the influence of number representations used for model parameters against electromagnetic fault injection (EMFI) attacks. In this paper, we investigate how four different number representations influence the success of an EMFI attack on embedded neural network models. We chose two common floating-point representations (32-bit, and 16-bit), and two integer representations (8-bit, and 4-bit). We deployed four common image classifiers, ResNet-18, ResNet-34, ResNet-50, and VGG-11, on an embedded memory chip, and utilized a low-cost EMFI platform to trigger faults. Our results show that while floating-point representations exhibit almost a complete degradation in accuracy (Top-1 and Top-5) after a single fault injection, integer representations offer better resistance overall. Especially, when considering the the 8-bit representation on a relatively large network (VGG-11), the Top-1 accuracies stay at around 70% and the Top-5 at around 90%.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the fast-evolving field of artificial intelligence, where models are increasingly growing in complexity and size, the availability of labeled data for training deep learning models has become a significant challenge. Addressing complex problems like object detection demands considerable time and resources for data labeling to achieve meaningful results. For companies developing such applications, this entails extensive investment in highly skilled personnel or costly outsourcing. This research work aims to demonstrate that enhancing feature extractors can substantially alleviate this challenge, enabling models to learn more effective representations with less labeled data. Utilizing a self-supervised learning strategy, we present a model trained on unlabeled data that outperforms state-of-the-art feature extractors pre-trained on ImageNet and particularly designed for object detection tasks. Moreover, the results demonstrate that our approach encourages the model to focus on the most relevant aspects of an object, thus achieving better feature representations and, therefore, reinforcing its reliability and robustness.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this work, we apply and compare two state-of-the-art eXplainability Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods, the Integrated Gradients (IG) and the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), that explain the fault diagnosis decisions of a highly accurate Long Short-Time Memory (LSTM) classifier. The classifier is trained to detect faults in a benchmark non-linear chemical process, the Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP). It is highlighted how XAI methods can help identify the subsystem of the process where the fault occurred. Using our knowledge of the process, we note that in most cases the same features are indicated as the most important for the decision, while insome cases the SHAP method seems to be more informative and closer to the root cause of the fault. Finally, since the used XAI methods are model-agnostic, the proposed approach is not limited to the specific process and can also be used in similar problems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>LLM-based agents execute real-world workflows via tools and memory. These affordances enable ill-intended adversaries to also use these agents to carry out complex misuse scenarios. Existing agent misuse benchmarks largely test single-prompt instructions, leaving a gap in measuring how agents end up helping with harmful or illegal tasks over multiple turns. We introduce STING (Sequential Testing of Illicit N-step Goal execution), an automated red-teaming framework that constructs a step-by-step illicit plan grounded in a benign persona and iteratively probes a target agent with adaptive follow-ups, using judge agents to track phase completion. We further introduce an analysis framework that models multi-turn red-teaming as a time-to-first-jailbreak random variable, enabling analysis tools like discovery curves, hazard-ratio attribution by attack language, and a new metric: Restricted Mean Jailbreak Discovery. Across AgentHarm scenarios, STING yields substantially higher illicit-task completion than single-turn prompting and chat-oriented multi-turn baselines adapted to tool-using agents. In multilingual evaluations across six non-English settings, we find that attack success and illicit-task completion do not consistently increase in lower-resource languages, diverging from common chatbot findings. Overall, STING provides a practical way to evaluate and stress-test agent misuse in realistic deployment settings, where interactions are inherently multi-turn and often multilingual.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce SCAR, a method for long-term auto-calibration refinement of aerial visual-inertial systems that exploits georeferenced satellite imagery as a persistent global reference. SCAR estimates both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters by aligning aerial images with 2D--3D correspondences derived from publicly available orthophotos and elevation models. In contrast to existing approaches that rely on dedicated calibration maneuvers or manually surveyed ground control points, our method leverages external geospatial data to detect and correct calibration degradation under field deployment conditions. We evaluate our approach on six large-scale aerial campaigns conducted over two years under diverse seasonal and environmental conditions. Across all sequences, SCAR consistently outperforms established baselines (Kalibr, COLMAP, VINS-Mono), reducing median reprojection error by a large margin, and translating these calibration gains into substantially lower visual localization rotation errors and higher pose accuracy. These results demonstrate that SCAR provides accurate, robust, and reproducible calibration over long-term aerial operations without the need for manual intervention.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose an agentic data augmentation method for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) that uses iterative generation and verification to produce high quality synthetic training examples. To isolate the effect of agentic structure, we also develop a closely matched prompting-based baseline using the same model and instructions. Both methods are evaluated across three ABSA subtasks (Aspect Term Extraction (ATE), Aspect Sentiment Classification (ATSC), and Aspect Sentiment Pair Extraction (ASPE)), four SemEval datasets, and two encoder-decoder models: T5-Base and Tk-Instruct. Our results show that the agentic augmentation outperforms raw prompting in label preservation of the augmented data, especially when the tasks require aspect term generation. In addition, when combined with real data, agentic augmentation provides higher gains, consistently outperforming prompting-based generation. These benefits are most pronounced for T5-Base, while the more heavily pretrained Tk-Instruct exhibits smaller improvements. As a result, augmented data helps T5-Base achieve comparable performance with its counterpart.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In indoor assistive perception for visually impaired users, 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) is expected to provide structurally coherent and semantically consistent occupancy under strictly monocular vision for safety-critical scene understanding. However, existing monocular SSC approaches often lack explicit modeling of voxel-feature reliability and regulated cross-scale information propagation during 2D-3D projection and multi-scale fusion, making them vulnerable to projection diffusion and feature entanglement and thus limiting structural this http URL address these challenges, this paper presents an Adaptive Multi-scale Attention Aggregation (AMAA) framework built upon the MonoScene pipeline. Rather than introducing a heavier backbone, AMAA focuses on reliability-oriented feature regulation within a monocular SSC framework. Specifically, lifted voxel features are jointly calibrated in semantic and spatial dimensions through parallel channel-spatial attention aggregation, while multi-scale encoder-decoder fusion is stabilized via a hierarchical adaptive feature-gating strategy that regulates information injection across this http URL on the NYUv2 benchmark demonstrate consistent improvements over MonoScene without significantly increasing system complexity: AMAA achieves 27.25% SSC mIoU (+0.31) and 43.10% SC IoU (+0.59). In addition, system-level deployment on an NVIDIA Jetson platform verifies that the complete AMAA framework can be executed stably on embedded hardware. Overall, AMAA improves monocular SSC quality and provides a reliable and deployable perception framework for indoor assistive systems targeting visually impaired users.</li>

We introduce a unified and extensible benchmarking suite that simplifies the evaluation of unlearning algorithms using the KLoM (KL divergence of Margins) metric. Our framework provides precomputed model ensembles, oracle outputs, and streamlined infrastructure for running evaluations out of the box. By standardizing setup and metrics, it enables reproducible, scalable, and fair comparison across unlearning methods.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable success across a wide range of tasks, long-form video understanding remains a significant challenge. In this study, we focus on video understanding by MLLMs. This task is challenging because processing a full stream of RGB frames is computationally intractable and highly redundant, as self-attention have quadratic complexity with sequence length. In this paper, we propose ReMoRa, a video MLLM that processes videos by operating directly on their compressed representations. A sparse set of RGB keyframes is retained for appearance, while temporal dynamics are encoded as a motion representation, removing the need for sequential RGB frames. These motion representations act as a compact proxy for optical flow, capturing temporal dynamics without full frame decoding. To refine the noise and low fidelity of block-based motions, we introduce a module to denoise and generate a fine-grained motion representation. Furthermore, our model compresses these features in a way that scales linearly with sequence length. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ReMoRa through extensive experiments across a comprehensive suite of long-video understanding benchmarks. ReMoRa outperformed baseline methods on multiple challenging benchmarks, including LongVideoBench, NExT-QA, and MLVU.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Agentic systems, AI architectures that autonomously execute multi-step workflows to achieve complex goals, are often built using repeated large language model (LLM) calls for closed-set decision tasks such as routing, shortlisting, gating, and verification. While convenient, this design makes deployments slow and expensive due to cumulative latency and token usage. We propose TabAgent, a framework for replacing generative decision components in closed-set selection tasks with a compact textual-tabular classifier trained on execution traces. TabAgent (i) extracts structured schema, state, and dependency features from trajectories (TabSchema), (ii) augments coverage with schema-aligned synthetic supervision (TabSynth), and (iii) scores candidates with a lightweight classifier (TabHead). On the long-horizon AppWorld benchmark, TabAgent maintains task-level success while eliminating shortlist-time LLM calls, reducing latency by approximately 95% and inference cost by 85-91%. Beyond tool shortlisting, TabAgent generalizes to other agentic decision heads, establishing a paradigm for learned discriminative replacements of generative bottlenecks in production agent architectures.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Releasing data once and for all under noninteractive Local Differential Privacy (LDP) enables complete data reusability, but the resulting noise may create bias in subsequent analyses. In this work, we leverage the Weierstrass transform to characterize this bias in binary classification. We prove that inverting this transform leads to a bias-correction method to compute unbiased estimates of nonlinear functions on examples released under LDP. We then build a novel stochastic gradient descent algorithm called Inverse Weierstrass Private SGD (IWP-SGD). It converges to the true population risk minimizer at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/n)$, with $n$ the number of examples. We empirically validate IWP-SGD on binary classification tasks using synthetic and real-world datasets.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Conventional large language model (LLM) fairness alignment largely focuses on mitigating bias along single sensitive attributes, overlooking fairness as an inherently multidimensional and context-specific value. This approach risks creating systems that achieve narrow fairness metrics while exacerbating disparities along untargeted attributes, a phenomenon known as bias spillover. While extensively studied in machine learning, bias spillover remains critically underexplored in LLM alignment. In this work, we investigate how targeted gender alignment affects fairness across nine sensitive attributes in three state-of-the-art LLMs (Mistral 7B, Llama 3.1 8B, Qwen 2.5 7B). Using Direct Preference Optimization and the BBQ benchmark, we evaluate fairness under ambiguous and disambiguous contexts. Our findings reveal noticeable bias spillover: while aggregate results show improvements, context-aware analysis exposes significant degradations in ambiguous contexts, particularly for physical appearance ($p< 0.001$ across all models), sexual orientation, and disability status. We demonstrate that improving fairness along one attribute can inadvertently worsen disparities in others under uncertainty, highlighting the necessity of context-aware, multi-attribute fairness evaluation frameworks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative model evaluation commonly relies on high-dimensional embedding spaces to compute distances between samples. We show that dataset representations in these spaces are affected by the hubness phenomenon, which distorts nearest neighbor relationships and biases distance-based metrics. Building on the classical Iterative Contextual Dissimilarity Measure (ICDM), we introduce Generative ICDM (GICDM), a method to correct neighborhood estimation for both real and generated data. We introduce a multi-scale extension to improve empirical behavior. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real benchmarks demonstrate that GICDM resolves hubness-induced failures, restores reliable metric behavior, and improves alignment with human judgment.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) necessitates evaluation frameworks that reflect real-world academic rigor and multilingual complexity. This paper introduces IndicEval, a scalable benchmarking platform designed to assess LLM performance using authentic high-stakes examination questions from UPSC, JEE, and NEET across STEM and humanities domains in both English and Hindi. Unlike synthetic benchmarks, IndicEval grounds evaluation in real examination standards, enabling realistic measurement of reasoning, domain knowledge, and bilingual adaptability. The framework automates assessment using Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting strategies and supports modular integration of new models and languages. Experiments conducted on Gemini 2.0 Flash, GPT-4, Claude, and LLaMA 3-70B reveal three major findings. First, CoT prompting consistently improves reasoning accuracy, with substantial gains across subjects and languages. Second, significant cross-model performance disparities persist, particularly in high-complexity examinations. Third, multilingual degradation remains a critical challenge, with marked accuracy drops in Hindi compared to English, especially under Zero-Shot conditions. These results highlight persistent gaps in bilingual reasoning and domain transfer. Overall, IndicEval provides a practice-oriented, extensible foundation for rigorous, equitable evaluation of LLMs in multilingual educational settings and offers actionable insights for improving reasoning robustness and language adaptability.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>C-RASP is a simple programming language that was recently shown to capture concepts expressible by transformers. In this paper, we develop new algorithmic techniques for automatically verifying C-RASPs. To this end, we establish a connection to the verification of synchronous dataflow programs in Lustre, which enables us to exploit state-of-the-art model checkers utilizing highly optimized SMT-solvers. Our second contribution addresses learning a C-RASP program in the first place. To this end, we provide a new algorithm for learning a C-RASP from examples using local search. We demonstrate efficacy of our implementation for benchmarks of C-RASPs in the literature, in particular in connection to the following applications: (1) transformer program optimization, and (2) constrained learning of transformer programs (based on a partial specification).</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without exposing clients' private data, and has been widely adopted in privacy-sensitive scenarios. However, FL faces two critical security threats: curious servers that may launch inference attacks to reconstruct clients' private data, and compromised clients that can launch poisoning attacks to disrupt model aggregation. Existing solutions mitigate these attacks by combining mainstream privacy-preserving techniques with defensive aggregation strategies. However, they either incur high computation and communication overhead or perform poorly under non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) data settings. To tackle these challenges, we propose SRFed, an efficient Byzantine-robust and privacy-preserving FL framework for Non-IID scenarios. First, we design a decentralized efficient functional encryption (DEFE) scheme to support efficient model encryption and non-interactive decryption. DEFE also eliminates third-party reliance and defends against server-side inference attacks. Second, we develop a privacy-preserving defensive model aggregation mechanism based on DEFE. This mechanism filters poisonous models under Non-IID data by layer-wise projection and clustering-based analysis. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments show that SRFed outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in privacy protection, Byzantine robustness, and efficiency.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) often struggle to learn from corrective feedback within a conversational context. They are rarely proactive in soliciting this feedback, even when faced with ambiguity, which can make their dialogues feel static, one-sided, and lacking the adaptive qualities of human conversation. To address these limitations, we draw inspiration from social meta-learning (SML) in humans - the process of learning how to learn from others. We formulate SML as a finetuning methodology, training LLMs to solicit and learn from language feedback in simulated pedagogical dialogues, where static tasks are converted into interactive social learning problems. SML effectively teaches models to use conversation to solve problems they are unable to solve in a single turn. This capability generalises across domains; SML on math problems produces models that better use feedback to solve coding problems and vice versa. Furthermore, despite being trained only on fully-specified problems, these models are better able to solve underspecified tasks where critical information is revealed over multiple turns. When faced with this ambiguity, SML-trained models make fewer premature answer attempts and are more likely to ask for the information they need. This work presents a scalable approach to developing AI systems that effectively learn from language feedback.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, security, privacy, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the rise of artificial intelligence and machine learning, a new wave of private information is being flushed into applications. This development raises privacy concerns, as private datasets can be stolen or abused for non-authorized purposes. Secure function computation aims to solve such problems by allowing a service provider to compute functions of datasets in the possession of a a data provider without reading the data itself. A foundational primitive for such tasks is Bit Commitment (BC), which is known to be impossible to realize without added assumptions. Given the pressing nature of the topic, it is thus important to develop BC systems and prove their security under reasonable assumptions. In this work, we provide a novel quantum optical BC protocol that uses the added assumption that the network provider will secure transmission lines against eavesdropping. Under this added assumption, we prove security of our protocol in the honest but curious setting and discuss the hardness of Mayer's attack in the context of our protocol.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, defense, attack, robust, fair, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Object detection models are critical components of automated systems, such as autonomous vehicles and perception-based robots, but their sensitivity to adversarial attacks poses a serious security risk. Progress in defending these models lags behind classification, hindered by a lack of standardized evaluation. It is nearly impossible to thoroughly compare attack or defense methods, as existing work uses different datasets, inconsistent efficiency metrics, and varied measures of perturbation cost. This paper addresses this gap by investigating three key questions: (1) How can we create a fair benchmark to impartially compare attacks? (2) How well do modern attacks transfer across different architectures, especially from Convolutional Neural Networks to Vision Transformers? (3) What is the most effective adversarial training strategy for robust defense? To answer these, we first propose a unified benchmark framework focused on digital, non-patch-based attacks. This framework introduces specific metrics to disentangle localization and classification errors and evaluates attack cost using multiple perceptual metrics. Using this benchmark, we conduct extensive experiments on state-of-the-art attacks and a wide range of detectors. Our findings reveal two major conclusions: first, modern adversarial attacks against object detection models show a significant lack of transferability to transformer-based architectures. Second, we demonstrate that the most robust adversarial training strategy leverages a dataset composed of a mix of high-perturbation attacks with different objectives (e.g., spatial and semantic), which outperforms training on any single attack.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability, diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Analytical diffusion models offer a mathematically transparent path to generative modeling by formulating the denoising score as an empirical-Bayes posterior mean. However, this interpretability comes at a prohibitive cost: the standard formulation necessitates a full-dataset scan at every timestep, scaling linearly with dataset size. In this work, we present the first systematic study addressing this scalability bottleneck. We challenge the prevailing assumption that the entire training data is necessary, uncovering the phenomenon of Posterior Progressive Concentration: the effective golden support of the denoising score is not static but shrinks asymptotically from the global manifold to a local neighborhood as the signal-to-noise ratio increases. Capitalizing on this, we propose Dynamic Time-Aware Golden Subset Diffusion (GoldDiff), a training-free framework that decouples inference complexity from dataset size. Instead of static retrieval, GoldDiff uses a coarse-to-fine mechanism to dynamically pinpoint the ''Golden Subset'' for inference. Theoretically, we derive rigorous bounds guaranteeing that our sparse approximation converges to the exact score. Empirically, GoldDiff achieves a $\bf 71 \times$ speedup on AFHQ while matching or achieving even better performance than full-scan baselines. Most notably, we demonstrate the first successful scaling of analytical diffusion to ImageNet-1K, unlocking a scalable, training-free paradigm for large-scale generative modeling.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Soft prompt tuning leverages continuous embeddings to capture task-specific information in large pre-trained language models (LLMs), achieving competitive performance in few-shot settings. However, soft prompts rely on high-dimensional, implicit representations and lack explicit semantics and traceable training behaviors, which limits their interpretability. To address this limitation, we propose a soft prompt tuning optimization method based on topological morphological evolution. Specifically, we employ persistent homology from topological data analysis (TDA) to quantify the structural representations of soft prompts in continuous parameter space and their training process evolution. Quantitative analysis shows that topologically stable and compact soft prompts achieve better downstream performance. Based on this empirical observation, we construct a loss function for optimizing soft prompt tuning, termed Topological Soft Prompt Loss (TSLoss). TSLoss guides the model to learn structurally stable adaptations by quantifying inter-parameter connectivity and redundancy. Extensive experiments show that training with TSLoss accelerates convergence and improves tuning performance, providing an interpretable method to understand and optimize soft prompt tuning from structural and topological perspectives.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in garment pattern generation have shown promising progress. However, existing feed-forward methods struggle with diverse poses and viewpoints, while optimization-based approaches are computationally expensive and difficult to scale. This paper focuses on sewing pattern generation for garment modeling and fabrication applications that demand editable, separable, and simulation-ready garments. We propose DressWild, a novel feed-forward pipeline that reconstructs physics-consistent 2D sewing patterns and the corresponding 3D garments from a single in-the-wild image. Given an input image, our method leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to normalize pose variations at the image level, then extract pose-aware, 3D-informed garment features. These features are fused through a transformer-based encoder and subsequently used to predict sewing pattern parameters, which can be directly applied to physical simulation, texture synthesis, and multi-layer virtual try-on. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach robustly recovers diverse sewing patterns and the corresponding 3D garments from in-the-wild images without requiring multi-view inputs or iterative optimization, offering an efficient and scalable solution for realistic garment simulation and animation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generalized additive models (GAMs) offer interpretability through independent univariate feature effects but underfit when interactions are present in data. GA$^2$Ms add selected pairwise interactions which improves accuracy, but sacrifices interpretability and limits model auditing. We propose \emph{Conditionally Additive Local Models} (CALMs), a new model class, that balances the interpretability of GAMs with the accuracy of GA$^2$Ms. CALMs allow multiple univariate shape functions per feature, each active in different regions of the input space. These regions are defined independently for each feature as simple logical conditions (thresholds) on the features it interacts with. As a result, effects remain locally additive while varying across subregions to capture interactions. We further propose a principled distillation-based training pipeline that identifies homogeneous regions with limited interactions and fits interpretable shape functions via region-aware backfitting. Experiments on diverse classification and regression tasks show that CALMs consistently outperform GAMs and achieve accuracy comparable with GA$^2$Ms. Overall, CALMs offer a compelling trade-off between predictive accuracy and interpretability.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper introduces ParlaCAP, a large-scale dataset for analyzing parliamentary agenda setting across Europe, and proposes a cost-effective method for building domain-specific policy topic classifiers. Applying the Comparative Agendas Project (CAP) schema to the multilingual ParlaMint corpus of over 8 million speeches from 28 parliaments of European countries and autonomous regions, we follow a teacher-student framework in which a high-performing large language model (LLM) annotates in-domain training data and a multilingual encoder model is fine-tuned on these annotations for scalable data annotation. We show that this approach produces a classifier tailored to the target domain. Agreement between the LLM and human annotators is comparable to inter-annotator agreement among humans, and the resulting model outperforms existing CAP classifiers trained on manually-annotated but out-of-domain data. In addition to the CAP annotations, the ParlaCAP dataset offers rich speaker and party metadata, as well as sentiment predictions coming from the ParlaSent multilingual transformer model, enabling comparative research on political attention and representation across countries. We illustrate the analytical potential of the dataset with three use cases, examining the distribution of parliamentary attention across policy topics, sentiment patterns in parliamentary speech, and gender differences in policy attention.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>defense, attack, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Jailbreak prompts are a practical and evolving threat to large language models (LLMs), particularly in agentic systems that execute tools over untrusted content. Many attacks exploit long-context hiding, semantic camouflage, and lightweight obfuscations that can evade single-pass guardrails. We present RLM-JB, an end-to-end jailbreak detection framework built on Recursive Language Models (RLMs), in which a root model orchestrates a bounded analysis program that transforms the input, queries worker models over covered segments, and aggregates evidence into an auditable decision. RLM-JB treats detection as a procedure rather than a one-shot classification: it normalizes and de-obfuscates suspicious inputs, chunks text to reduce context dilution and guarantee coverage, performs parallel chunk screening, and composes cross-chunk signals to recover split-payload attacks. On AutoDAN-style adversarial inputs, RLM-JB achieves high detection effectiveness across three LLM backends (ASR/Recall 92.5-98.0%) while maintaining very high precision (98.99-100%) and low false positive rates (0.0-2.0%), highlighting a practical sensitivity-specificity trade-off as the screening backend changes.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as a compelling alternative to multilayer perceptrons, offering enhanced interpretability via functional decomposition. However, existing KAN architectures, including spline-, wavelet-, radial-basis variants, etc., suffer from high computational cost and slow convergence, limiting scalability and practical applicability. Here, we introduce Feature-Enriched Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (FEKAN), a simple yet effective extension that preserves all the advantages of KAN while improving computational efficiency and predictive accuracy through feature enrichment, without increasing the number of trainable parameters. By incorporating these additional features, FEKAN accelerates convergence, increases representation capacity, and substantially mitigates the computational overhead characteristic of state-of-the-art KAN architectures. We investigate FEKAN across a comprehensive set of benchmarks, including function-approximation tasks, physics-informed formulations for diverse partial differential equations (PDEs), and neural operator settings that map between input and output function spaces. For function approximation, we systematically compare FEKAN against a broad family of KAN variants, FastKAN, WavKAN, ReLUKAN, HRKAN, ChebyshevKAN, RBFKAN, and the original SplineKAN. Across all tasks, FEKAN demonstrates substantially faster convergence and consistently higher approximation accuracy than the underlying baseline architectures. We also establish the theoretical foundations for FEKAN, showing its superior representation capacity compared to KAN, which contributes to improved accuracy and efficiency.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Safe reinforcement learning (Safe RL) aims to ensure policy performance while satisfying safety constraints. However, most existing Safe RL methods assume benign environments, making them vulnerable to adversarial perturbations commonly encountered in real-world settings. In addition, existing gradient-based adversarial attacks typically require access to the policy's gradient information, which is often impractical in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose an adversarial attack framework to reveal vulnerabilities of Safe RL policies. Using expert demonstrations and black-box environment interaction, our framework learns a constraint model and a surrogate (learner) policy, enabling gradient-based attack optimization without requiring the victim policy's internal gradients or the ground-truth safety constraints. We further provide theoretical analysis establishing feasibility and deriving perturbation bounds. Experiments on multiple Safe RL benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach under limited privileged access.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The inverse design of RNA three-dimensional (3D) structures is crucial for engineering functional RNAs in synthetic biology and therapeutics. While recent deep learning approaches have advanced this field, they are typically optimized and evaluated using native sequence recovery, which is a limited surrogate for structural fidelity, since different sequences can fold into similar 3D structures and high recovery does not necessarily indicate correct folding. To address this limitation, we propose RIDER, an RNA Inverse DEsign framework with Reinforcement learning that directly optimizes for 3D structural similarity. First, we develop and pre-train a GNN-based generative diffusion model conditioned on the target 3D structure, achieving a 9% improvement in native sequence recovery over state-of-the-art methods. Then, we fine-tune the model with an improved policy gradient algorithm using four task-specific reward functions based on 3D self-consistency metrics. Experimental results show that RIDER improves structural similarity by over 100% across all metrics and discovers designs that are distinct from native sequences.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce MetaDOAR, a lightweight meta-controller that augments the Double Oracle / PSRO paradigm with a learned, partition-aware filtering layer and Q-value caching to enable scalable multi-agent reinforcement learning on very large cyber-network environments. MetaDOAR learns a compact state projection from per node structural embeddings to rapidly score and select a small subset of devices (a top-k partition) on which a conventional low-level actor performs focused beam search utilizing a critic agent. Selected candidate actions are evaluated with batched critic forwards and stored in an LRU cache keyed by a quantized state projection and local action identifiers, dramatically reducing redundant critic computation while preserving decision quality via conservative k-hop cache invalidation. Empirically, MetaDOAR attains higher player payoffs than SOTA baselines on large network topologies, without significant scaling issues in terms of memory usage or training time. This contribution provide a practical, theoretically motivated path to efficient hierarchical policy learning for large-scale networked decision problems.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Face morphing attacks are widely recognized as one of the most challenging threats to face recognition systems used in electronic identity documents. These attacks exploit a critical vulnerability in passport enrollment procedures adopted by many countries, where the facial image is often acquired without a supervised live capture process. In this paper, we propose a novel face morphing technique based on Arc2Face, an identity-conditioned face foundation model capable of synthesizing photorealistic facial images from compact identity representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach by comparing the morphing attack potential metric on two large-scale sequestered face morphing attack detection datasets against several state-of-the-art morphing methods, as well as on two novel morphed face datasets derived from FEI and ONOT. Experimental results show that the proposed deep learning-based approach achieves a morphing attack potential comparable to that of landmark-based techniques, which have traditionally been regarded as the most challenging. These findings confirm the ability of the proposed method to effectively preserve and manage identity information during the morph generation process.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Inference-time algorithms are an emerging paradigm in which pre-trained models are used as subroutines to solve downstream tasks. Such algorithms have been proposed for tasks ranging from inverse problems and guided image generation to reasoning. However, the methods currently deployed in practice are heuristics with a variety of failure modes -- and we have very little understanding of when these heuristics can be efficiently improved. In this paper, we consider the task of sampling from a reward-tilted diffusion model -- that is, sampling from $p^{\star}(x) \propto p(x) \exp(r(x))$ -- given a reward function $r$ and pre-trained diffusion oracle for $p$. We provide a fine-grained analysis of the computational tractability of this task for quadratic rewards $r(x) = x^\top A x + b^\top x$. We show that linear-reward tilts are always efficiently sampleable -- a simple result that seems to have gone unnoticed in the literature. We use this as a building block, along with a conceptually new ingredient -- the Hubbard-Stratonovich transform -- to provide an efficient algorithm for sampling from low-rank positive-definite quadratic tilts, i.e. $r(x) = x^\top A x$ where $A$ is positive-definite and of rank $O(1)$. For negative-definite tilts, i.e. $r(x) = - x^\top A x$ where $A$ is positive-definite, we prove that the problem is intractable even if $A$ is of rank 1 (albeit with exponentially-large entries).</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large-scale sharing of dialogue-based data is instrumental for advancing the science of teaching and learning, yet rigorous de-identification remains a major barrier. In mathematics tutoring transcripts, numeric expressions frequently resemble structured identifiers (e.g., dates or IDs), leading generic Personally Identifiable Information (PII) detection systems to over-redact core instructional content and reduce dataset utility. This work asks how PII can be detected in math tutoring transcripts while preserving their educational utility. To address this challenge, we investigate the "numeric ambiguity" problem and introduce MathEd-PII, the first benchmark dataset for PII detection in math tutoring dialogues, created through a human-in-the-loop LLM workflow that audits upstream redactions and generates privacy-preserving surrogates. The dataset contains 1,000 tutoring sessions (115,620 messages; 769,628 tokens) with validated PII annotations. Using a density-based segmentation method, we show that false PII redactions are disproportionately concentrated in math-dense regions, confirming numeric ambiguity as a key failure mode. We then compare four detection strategies: a Presidio baseline and LLM-based approaches with basic, math-aware, and segment-aware prompting. Math-aware prompting substantially improves performance over the baseline (F1: 0.821 vs. 0.379) while reducing numeric false positives, demonstrating that de-identification must incorporate domain context to preserve analytic utility. This work provides both a new benchmark and evidence that utility-preserving de-identification for tutoring data requires domain-aware modeling.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Urban demand forecasting plays a critical role in optimizing routing, dispatching, and congestion management within Intelligent Transportation Systems. By leveraging data fusion and analytics techniques, traffic demand forecasting serves as a key intermediate measure for identifying emerging spatial and temporal demand patterns. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by proposing two gradient boosting model variations, one for classiffication and one for regression, both capable of generating demand forecasts at various temporal horizons, from 5 minutes up to one hour. Our overall approach effectively integrates temporal and contextual features, enabling accurate predictions that are essential for improving the efficiency of shared (micro-) mobility services. To evaluate its effectiveness, we utilize open shared mobility data derived from e-scooter and e-bike networks in five metropolitan areas. These real-world datasets allow us to compare our approach with state-of-the-art methods as well as a Generative AI-based model, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing the complexities of modern urban mobility. Ultimately, our methodology offers novel insights on urban micro-mobility management, helping to tackle the challenges arising from rapid urbanization and thus, contributing to more sustainable, efficient, and livable cities.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Reliable global streamflow forecasting is essential for flood preparedness and water resource management, yet data-driven models often suffer from a performance gap when transitioning from historical reanalysis to operational forecast products. This paper introduces AIFL (Artificial Intelligence for Floods), a deterministic LSTM-based model designed for global daily streamflow forecasting. Trained on 18,588 basins curated from the CARAVAN dataset, AIFL utilises a novel two-stage training strategy to bridge the reanalysis-to-forecast domain shift. The model is first pre-trained on 40 years of ERA5-Land reanalysis (1980-2019) to capture robust hydrological processes, then fine-tuned on operational Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) control forecasts (2016-2019) to adapt to the specific error structures and biases of operational numerical weather prediction. To our knowledge, this is the first global model trained end-to-end within the CARAVAN ecosystem. On an independent temporal test set (2021-2024), AIFL achieves high predictive skill with a median modified Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE') of 0.66 and a median Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) of 0.53. Benchmarking results show that AIFL is highly competitive with current state-of-the-art global systems, achieving comparable accuracy while maintaining a transparent and reproducible forcing pipeline. The model demonstrates exceptional reliability in extreme-event detection, providing a streamlined and operationally robust baseline for the global hydrological community.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Modern AI models are not static. They go through multiple updates in their lifecycles. Thus, exploiting the model dynamics to create stronger Membership Inference (MI) attacks and tighter privacy audits are timely questions. Though the literature empirically shows that using a sequence of model updates can increase the power of MI attacks, rigorous analysis of the `optimal' MI attacks is limited to static models with infinite samples. Hence, we develop an `optimal' MI attack, SeMI*, that uses the sequence of model updates to identify the presence of a target inserted at a certain update step. For the empirical mean computation, we derive the optimal power of SeMI*, while accessing a finite number of samples with or without privacy. Our results retrieve the existing asymptotic analysis. We observe that having access to the model sequence avoids the dilution of MI signals unlike the existing attacks on the final model, where the MI signal vanishes as training data accumulates. Furthermore, an adversary can use SeMI* to tune both the insertion time and the canary to yield tighter privacy audits. Finally, we conduct experiments across data distributions and models trained or fine-tuned with DP-SGD demonstrating that practical variants of SeMI* lead to tighter privacy audits than the baselines.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Cops and Robbers is a pursuit evasion game played on a graph, first introduced independently by Quilliot \cite{quilliot1978jeux} and Nowakowski and Winkler \cite{NOWAKOWSKI1983235} over four decades ago. A main interest in recent the literature is identifying the cop number of graph families. The cop number of a graph, $c(G)$, is defined as the minimum number of cops required to guarantee capture of the robber. Determining the cop number is computationally difficult and exact algorithms for this are typically restricted to small graph families. This paper investigates whether classical machine learning methods and graph neural networks can accurately predict a graph's cop number from its structural properties and identify which properties most strongly influence this prediction. Of the classical machine learning models, tree-based models achieve high accuracy in prediction despite class imbalance, whereas graph neural networks achieve comparable results without explicit feature engineering. The interpretability analysis shows that the most predictive features are related to node connectivity, clustering, clique structure, and width parameters, which aligns with known theoretical results. Our findings suggest that machine learning approaches can be used in complement with existing cop number algorithms by offering scalable approximations where computation is infeasible.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Municipal meeting minutes are formal records documenting the discussions and decisions of local government, yet their content is often lengthy, dense, and difficult for citizens to navigate. Automatic summarization can help address this challenge by producing concise summaries for each discussion subject. Despite its potential, research on summarizing discussion subjects in municipal meeting minutes remains largely unexplored, especially in low-resource languages, where the inherent complexity of these documents adds further challenges. A major bottleneck is the scarcity of datasets containing high-quality, manually crafted summaries, which limits the development and evaluation of effective summarization models for this domain. In this paper, we present CitiLink-Summ, a new corpus of European Portuguese municipal meeting minutes, comprising 100 documents and 2,322 manually hand-written summaries, each corresponding to a distinct discussion subject. Leveraging this dataset, we establish baseline results for automatic summarization in this domain, employing state-of-the-art generative models (e.g., BART, PRIMERA) as well as large language models (LLMs), evaluated with both lexical and semantic metrics such as ROUGE, BLEU, METEOR, and BERTScore. CitiLink-Summ provides the first benchmark for municipal-domain summarization in European Portuguese, offering a valuable resource for advancing NLP research on complex administrative texts.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability, explainability, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Transformer models achieve state-of-the-art performance across domains and tasks, yet their deeply layered representations make their predictions difficult to interpret. Existing explainability methods rely on final-layer attributions, capture either local token-level attributions or global attention patterns without unification, and lack context-awareness of inter-token dependencies and structural components. They also fail to capture how relevance evolves across layers and how structural components shape decision-making. To address these limitations, we proposed the \textbf{Context-Aware Layer-wise Integrated Gradients (CA-LIG) Framework}, a unified hierarchical attribution framework that computes layer-wise Integrated Gradients within each Transformer block and fuses these token-level attributions with class-specific attention gradients. This integration yields signed, context-sensitive attribution maps that capture supportive and opposing evidence while tracing the hierarchical flow of relevance through the Transformer layers. We evaluate the CA-LIG Framework across diverse tasks, domains, and transformer model families, including sentiment analysis and long and multi-class document classification with BERT, hate speech detection in a low-resource language setting with XLM-R and AfroLM, and image classification with Masked Autoencoder vision Transformer model. Across all tasks and architectures, CA-LIG provides more faithful attributions, shows stronger sensitivity to contextual dependencies, and produces clearer, more semantically coherent visualizations than established explainability methods. These results indicate that CA-LIG provides a more comprehensive, context-aware, and reliable explanation of Transformer decision-making, advancing both the practical interpretability and conceptual understanding of deep neural models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied as automatic evaluators for natural language generation assessment often using pairwise comparative judgements. Existing approaches typically rely on single judges or aggregate multiple judges assuming equal reliability. In practice, LLM judges vary substantially in performance across tasks and aspects, and their judgment probabilities may be biased and inconsistent. Furthermore, human-labelled supervision for judge calibration may be unavailable. We first empirically demonstrate that inconsistencies in LLM comparison probabilities exist and show that it limits the effectiveness of direct probability-based ranking. To address this, we study the LLM-as-a-jury setting and propose BT-sigma, a judge-aware extension of the Bradley-Terry model that introduces a discriminator parameter for each judge to jointly infer item rankings and judge reliability from pairwise comparisons alone. Experiments on benchmark NLG evaluation datasets show that BT-sigma consistently outperforms averaging-based aggregation methods, and that the learned discriminator strongly correlates with independent measures of the cycle consistency of LLM judgments. Further analysis reveals that BT-sigma can be interpreted as an unsupervised calibration mechanism that improves aggregation by modelling judge reliability.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent success in natural language processing has motivated growing interest in large-scale foundation models for neuroimaging data. Such models often require discretization of continuous neural time series data, a process referred to as 'tokenization'. However, the impact of different tokenization strategies for neural data is currently poorly understood. In this work, we present a systematic evaluation of sample-level tokenization strategies for transformer-based large neuroimaging models (LNMs) applied to magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. We compare learnable and non-learnable tokenizers by examining their signal reconstruction fidelity and their impact on subsequent foundation modeling performance (token prediction, biological plausibility of generated data, preservation of subject-specific information, and performance on downstream tasks). For the learnable tokenizer, we introduce a novel approach based on an autoencoder. Experiments were conducted on three publicly available MEG datasets spanning different acquisition sites, scanners, and experimental paradigms. Our results show that both learnable and non-learnable discretization schemes achieve high reconstruction accuracy and broadly comparable performance across most evaluation criteria, suggesting that simple fixed sample-level tokenization strategies can be used in the development of neural foundation models.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>defense, extraction, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Evaluating the social intelligence of Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly requires moving beyond static text generation toward dynamic, adversarial interaction. We introduce the Adversarial Resource Extraction Game (AREG), a benchmark that operationalizes persuasion and resistance as a multi-turn, zero-sum negotiation over financial resources. Using a round-robin tournament across frontier models, AREG enables joint evaluation of offensive (persuasion) and defensive (resistance) capabilities within a single interactional framework. Our analysis provides evidence that these capabilities are weakly correlated ($\rho = 0.33$) and empirically dissociated: strong persuasive performance does not reliably predict strong resistance, and vice versa. Across all evaluated models, resistance scores exceed persuasion scores, indicating a systematic defensive advantage in adversarial dialogue settings. Further linguistic analysis suggests that interaction structure plays a central role in these outcomes. Incremental commitment-seeking strategies are associated with higher extraction success, while verification-seeking responses are more prevalent in successful defenses than explicit refusal. Together, these findings indicate that social influence in LLMs is not a monolithic capability and that evaluation frameworks focusing on persuasion alone may overlook asymmetric behavioral vulnerabilities.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized Natural Language Processing (NLP) but has simultaneously created a "resource divide." State-of-the-art legal intelligence systems typically rely on massive parameter counts (7B+) and cloud-based inference, rendering them inaccessible to practitioners in resource-constrained environments and posing significant data sovereignty risks. This paper introduces Quecto-V1, a domain-specific Small Language Model (SLM) engineered to democratize access to Indian legal intelligence. Built upon a custom configuration of the GPT-2 architecture (124 million parameters), Quecto-V1 was trained from scratch exclusively on a corpus of Indian statutes, including the Indian Penal Code (IPC), the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), and the Constitution of India. Unlike generalist models, which prioritize broad world knowledge, our approach maximizes "lexical density" within the legal domain. Furthermore, we address the deployment bottleneck by applying post-training 8-bit quantization (GGUF format), compressing the model to a memory footprint of under 150 MB. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that Quecto-V1 achieves high fidelity in retrieving statutory definitions and penal provisions, outperforming general-purpose SLMs in domain-specific exact match tasks while running entirely offline on consumer-grade CPUs. We further present an ablation study showing that 8-bit quantization yields a 74% reduction in model size with less than 3.5% degradation in retrieval accuracy compared to full-precision baselines. These findings suggest that for specialized, high-stakes domains like law, domain-specific training coupled with aggressive quantization offers a viable, privacy-preserving alternative to monolithic cloud models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The widespread deployment of large language models (LLMs) across linguistic communities necessitates reliable multilingual safety alignment. However, recent efforts to extend alignment to other languages often require substantial resources, either through large-scale, high-quality supervision in the target language or through pairwise alignment with high-resource languages, which limits scalability. In this work, we propose a resource-efficient method for improving multilingual safety alignment. We introduce a plug-and-play Multi-Lingual Consistency (MLC) loss that can be integrated into existing monolingual alignment pipelines. By improving collinearity between multilingual representation vectors, our method encourages directional consistency at the multilingual semantic level in a single update. This allows simultaneous alignment across multiple languages using only multilingual prompt variants without requiring additional response-level supervision in low-resource languages. We validate the proposed method across different model architectures and alignment paradigms, and demonstrate its effectiveness in enhancing multilingual safety with limited impact on general model utility. Further evaluation across languages and tasks indicates improved cross-lingual generalization, suggesting the proposed approach as a practical solution for multilingual consistency alignment under limited supervision.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Adversarial diffusion and diffusion-inversion methods have advanced unpaired image-to-image translation, but each faces key limitations. Adversarial approaches require target-domain adversarial loss during training, which can limit generalization to unseen data, while diffusion-inversion methods often produce low-fidelity translations due to imperfect inversion into noise-latent representations. In this work, we propose the Self-Supervised Semantic Bridge (SSB), a versatile framework that integrates external semantic priors into diffusion bridge models to enable spatially faithful translation without cross-domain supervision. Our key idea is to leverage self-supervised visual encoders to learn representations that are invariant to appearance changes but capture geometric structure, forming a shared latent space that conditions the diffusion bridges. Extensive experiments show that SSB outperforms strong prior methods for challenging medical image synthesis in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings, and extends easily to high-quality text-guided editing.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Compositional generalization, the ability to reason about novel combinations of familiar concepts, is fundamental to human cognition and a critical challenge for machine learning. Object-centric (OC) representations, which encode a scene as a set of objects, are often argued to support such generalization, but systematic evidence in visually rich settings is limited. We introduce a Visual Question Answering benchmark across three controlled visual worlds (CLEVRTex, Super-CLEVR, and MOVi-C) to measure how well vision encoders, with and without object-centric biases, generalize to unseen combinations of object properties. To ensure a fair and comprehensive comparison, we carefully account for training data diversity, sample size, representation size, downstream model capacity, and compute. We use DINOv2 and SigLIP2, two widely used vision encoders, as the foundation models and their OC counterparts. Our key findings reveal that (1) OC approaches are superior in harder compositional generalization settings; (2) original dense representations surpass OC only on easier settings and typically require substantially more downstream compute; and (3) OC models are more sample efficient, achieving stronger generalization with fewer images, whereas dense encoders catch up or surpass them only with sufficient data and diversity. Overall, object-centric representations offer stronger compositional generalization when any one of dataset size, training data diversity, or downstream compute is constrained.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, security, privacy, protect, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Machine unlearning aims to remove specific data points from a trained model, often striving to emulate "perfect retraining", i.e., producing the model that would have been obtained had the deleted data never been included. We demonstrate that this approach, and security definitions that enable it, carry significant privacy risks for the remaining (undeleted) data points. We present a reconstruction attack showing that for certain tasks, which can be computed securely without deletions, a mechanism adhering to perfect retraining allows an adversary controlling merely $\omega(1)$ data points to reconstruct almost the entire dataset merely by issuing deletion requests. We survey existing definitions for machine unlearning, showing they are either susceptible to such attacks or too restrictive to support basic functionalities like exact summation. To address this problem, we propose a new security definition that specifically safeguards undeleted data against leakage caused by the deletion of other points. We show that our definition permits several essential functionalities, such as bulletin boards, summations, and statistical learning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Interpretability research on large language models (LLMs) has yielded important insights into model behaviour, yet recurring pitfalls persist: findings that do not generalise, and causal interpretations that outrun the evidence. Our position is that causal inference specifies what constitutes a valid mapping from model activations to invariant high-level structures, the data or assumptions needed to achieve it, and the inferences it can support. Specifically, Pearl's causal hierarchy clarifies what an interpretability study can justify. Observations establish associations between model behaviour and internal components. Interventions (e.g., ablations or activation patching) support claims how these edits affect a behavioural metric (\eg, average change in token probabilities) over a set of prompts. However, counterfactual claims -- i.e., asking what the model output would have been for the same prompt under an unobserved intervention -- remain largely unverifiable without controlled supervision. We show how causal representation learning (CRL) operationalises this hierarchy, specifying which variables are recoverable from activations and under what assumptions. Together, these motivate a diagnostic framework that helps practitioners select methods and evaluations matching claims to evidence such that findings generalise.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>data-free, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vision-language models (VLMs) aim to reason by jointly leveraging visual and textual modalities. While allocating additional inference-time computation has proven effective for large language models (LLMs), achieving similar scaling in VLMs remains challenging. A key obstacle is that visual inputs are typically provided only once at the start of generation, while textual reasoning (e.g., early visual summaries) is generated autoregressively, causing reasoning to become increasingly text-dominated and allowing early visual grounding errors to accumulate. Moreover, vanilla guidance for visual grounding during inference is often coarse and noisy, making it difficult to steer reasoning over long texts. To address these challenges, we propose \emph{Saliency-Aware Principle} (SAP) selection. SAP operates on high-level reasoning principles rather than token-level trajectories, which enable stable control over discrete generation under noisy feedback while allowing later reasoning steps to re-consult visual evidence when renewed grounding is required. In addition, SAP supports multi-route inference, enabling parallel exploration of diverse reasoning behaviors. SAP is model-agnostic and data-free, requiring no additional training. Empirical results show that SAP achieves competitive performance, especially in reducing object hallucination, under comparable token-generation budgets while yielding more stable reasoning and lower response latency than CoT-style long sequential reasoning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Fast weight architectures offer a promising alternative to attention-based transformers for long-context modeling by maintaining constant memory overhead regardless of context length. However, their potential is limited by the next-token prediction (NTP) training paradigm. NTP optimizes single-token predictions and ignores semantic coherence across multiple tokens following a prefix. Consequently, fast weight models, which dynamically update their parameters to store contextual information, learn suboptimal representations that fail to capture long-range dependencies. We introduce REFINE (Reinforced Fast weIghts with Next sEquence prediction), a reinforcement learning framework that trains fast weight models under the next-sequence prediction (NSP) objective. REFINE selects informative token positions based on prediction entropy, generates multi-token rollouts, assigns self-supervised sequence-level rewards, and optimizes the model with group relative policy optimization (GRPO). REFINE is applicable throughout the training lifecycle of pre-trained language models: mid-training, post-training, and test-time training. Our experiments on LaCT-760M and DeltaNet-1.3B demonstrate that REFINE consistently outperforms supervised fine-tuning with NTP across needle-in-a-haystack retrieval, long-context question answering, and diverse tasks in LongBench. REFINE provides an effective and versatile framework for improving long-context modeling in fast weight architectures.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, security, defense</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>LLM-based agents are increasingly being deployed in contexts requiring complex authorization policies: customer service protocols, approval workflows, data access restrictions, and regulatory compliance. Embedding these policies in prompts provides no enforcement guarantees. We present PCAS, a Policy Compiler for Agentic Systems that provides deterministic policy enforcement. Enforcing such policies requires tracking information flow across agents, which linear message histories cannot capture. Instead, PCAS models the agentic system state as a dependency graph capturing causal relationships among events such as tool calls, tool results, and messages. Policies are expressed in a Datalog-derived language, as declarative rules that account for transitive information flow and cross-agent provenance. A reference monitor intercepts all actions and blocks violations before execution, providing deterministic enforcement independent of model reasoning. PCAS takes an existing agent implementation and a policy specification, and compiles them into an instrumented system that is policy-compliant by construction, with no security-specific restructuring required. We evaluate PCAS on three case studies: information flow policies for prompt injection defense, approval workflows in a multi-agent pharmacovigilance system, and organizational policies for customer service. On customer service tasks, PCAS improves policy compliance from 48% to 93% across frontier models, with zero policy violations in instrumented runs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Latent space models are widely used for analyzing high-dimensional discrete data matrices, such as patient-feature matrices in electronic health records (EHRs), by capturing complex dependence structures through low-dimensional embeddings. However, estimation becomes challenging in the imbalanced regime, where one matrix dimension is much larger than the other. In EHR applications, cohort sizes are often limited by disease prevalence or data availability, whereas the feature space remains extremely large due to the breadth of medical coding system. Motivated by the increasing availability of external semantic embeddings, such as pre-trained embeddings of clinical concepts in EHRs, we propose a knowledge-embedded latent projection model that leverages semantic side information to regularize representation learning. Specifically, we model column embeddings as smooth functions of semantic embeddings via a mapping in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We develop a computationally efficient two-step estimation procedure that combines semantically guided subspace construction via kernel principal component analysis with scalable projected gradient descent. We establish estimation error bounds that characterize the trade-off between statistical error and approximation error induced by the kernel projection. Furthermore, we provide local convergence guarantees for our non-convex optimization procedure. Extensive simulation studies and a real-world EHR application demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</li>
