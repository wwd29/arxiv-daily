<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Shadow-affected images often exhibit pronounced spatial discrepancies in color and illumination, consequently degrading various vision applications including object detection and segmentation systems. To effectively eliminate shadows in real-world images while preserving intricate details and producing visually compelling outcomes, we introduce a mask-free Shadow Removal and Refinement network (ShadowRefiner) via Fast Fourier Transformer. Specifically, the Shadow Removal module in our method aims to establish effective mappings between shadow-affected and shadow-free images via spatial and frequency representation learning. To mitigate the pixel misalignment and further improve the image quality, we propose a novel Fast-Fourier Attention based Transformer (FFAT) architecture, where an innovative attention mechanism is designed for meticulous refinement. Our method wins the championship in the Perceptual Track and achieves the second best performance in the Fidelity Track of NTIRE 2024 Image Shadow Removal Challenge. Besides, comprehensive experiment result also demonstrate the compelling effectiveness of our proposed method. The code is publicly available: this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent studies reveal that integrating new modalities into Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Vision-Language Models (VLMs), creates a new attack surface that bypasses existing safety training techniques like Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF). While further SFT and RLHF-based safety training can be conducted in multi-modal settings, collecting multi-modal training datasets poses a significant challenge. Inspired by the structural design of recent multi-modal models, where, regardless of the combination of input modalities, all inputs are ultimately fused into the language space, we aim to explore whether unlearning solely in the textual domain can be effective for cross-modality safety alignment. Our evaluation across six datasets empirically demonstrates the transferability -- textual unlearning in VLMs significantly reduces the Attack Success Rate (ASR) to less than 8\% and in some cases, even as low as nearly 2\% for both text-based and vision-text-based attacks, alongside preserving the utility. Moreover, our experiments show that unlearning with a multi-modal dataset offers no potential benefits but incurs significantly increased computational demands, possibly up to 6 times higher.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Numerous algorithms have been proposed to $\textit{align}$ language models to remove undesirable behaviors. However, the challenges associated with a very large state space and creating a proper reward function often result in various jailbreaks. Our paper aims to examine this effect of reward in the controlled setting of positive sentiment language generation. Instead of online training of a reward model based on human feedback, we employ a statically learned sentiment classifier. We also consider a setting where our model's weights and activations are exposed to an end-user after training. We examine a pretrained GPT-2 through the lens of mechanistic interpretability before and after proximal policy optimization (PPO) has been applied to promote positive sentiment responses. Using these insights, we (1) attempt to "hack" the PPO-ed model to generate negative sentiment responses and (2) add a term to the reward function to try and alter `negative' weights.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Ubiquitous mobile devices are generating vast amounts of location-based service data that reveal how individuals navigate and utilize urban spaces in detail. In this study, we utilize these extensive, unlabeled sequences of user trajectories to develop a foundation model for understanding urban space and human mobility. We introduce the \textbf{P}retrained \textbf{M}obility \textbf{T}ransformer (PMT), which leverages the transformer architecture to process user trajectories in an autoregressive manner, converting geographical areas into tokens and embedding spatial and temporal information within these representations. Experiments conducted in three U.S. metropolitan areas over a two-month period demonstrate PMT's ability to capture underlying geographic and socio-demographic characteristics of regions. The proposed PMT excels across various downstream tasks, including next-location prediction, trajectory imputation, and trajectory generation. These results support PMT's capability and effectiveness in decoding complex patterns of human mobility, offering new insights into urban spatial functionality and individual mobility preferences.</li>

          Constrained or Unconstrained? Neural-Network-Based Equation Discovery from Data(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Throughout many fields, practitioners often rely on differential equations to model systems. Yet, for many applications, the theoretical derivation of such equations and/or accurate resolution of their solutions may be intractable. Instead, recently developed methods, including those based on parameter estimation, operator subset selection, and neural networks, allow for the data-driven discovery of both ordinary and partial differential equations (PDEs), on a spectrum of interpretability. The success of these strategies is often contingent upon the correct identification of representative equations from noisy observations of state variables and, as importantly and intertwined with that, the mathematical strategies utilized to enforce those equations. Specifically, the latter has been commonly addressed via unconstrained optimization strategies. Representing the PDE as a neural network, we propose to discover the PDE by solving a constrained optimization problem and using an intermediate state representation similar to a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN). The objective function of this constrained optimization problem promotes matching the data, while the constraints require that the PDE is satisfied at several spatial collocation points. We present a penalty method and a widely used trust-region barrier method to solve this constrained optimization problem, and we compare these methods on numerical examples. Our results on the Burgers' and the Korteweg-De Vreis equations demonstrate that the latter constrained method outperforms the penalty method, particularly for higher noise levels or fewer collocation points. For both methods, we solve these discovered neural network PDEs with classical methods, such as finite difference methods, as opposed to PINNs-type methods relying on automatic differentiation. We briefly highlight other small, yet crucial, implementation details.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Transformers have revolutionized machine learning across diverse domains, yet understanding their behavior remains crucial, particularly in high-stakes applications. This paper introduces the contextual counting task, a novel toy problem aimed at enhancing our understanding of Transformers in quantitative and scientific contexts. This task requires precise localization and computation within datasets, akin to object detection or region-based scientific analysis. We present theoretical and empirical analysis using both causal and non-causal Transformer architectures, investigating the influence of various positional encodings on performance and interpretability. In particular, we find that causal attention is much better suited for the task, and that no positional embeddings lead to the best accuracy, though rotary embeddings are competitive and easier to train. We also show that out of distribution performance is tightly linked to which tokens it uses as a bias term.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Adapting to the changing climate requires accurate local climate information, a computationally challenging problem. Recent studies have used Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), a type of deep learning, to learn complex distributions and downscale climate variables efficiently. Capturing variability while downscaling is crucial for estimating uncertainty and characterising extreme events - critical information for climate adaptation. Since downscaling is an undetermined problem, many fine-scale states are physically consistent with the coarse-resolution state. To quantify this ill-posed problem, downscaling techniques should be stochastic, able to sample realisations from a high-resolution distribution conditioned on low-resolution input. Previous stochastic downscaling attempts have found substantial underdispersion, with models failing to represent the full distribution. We propose approaches to improve the stochastic calibration of GANs in three ways: a) injecting noise inside the network, b) adjusting the training process to explicitly account for the stochasticity, and c) using a probabilistic loss metric. We tested our models first on a synthetic dataset with known distributional properties, and then on a realistic downscaling scenario, predicting high-resolution wind components from low-resolution climate covariates. Injecting noise, on its own, substantially improved the quality of conditional and full distributions in tests with synthetic data, but performed less well for wind field downscaling, where models remained underdispersed. For wind downscaling, we found that adjusting the training method and including the probabilistic loss improved calibration. The best model, with all three changes, showed much improved skill at capturing the full variability of the high-resolution distribution and thus at characterising extremes.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Creation of nanomaterials with specific morphology remains a complex experimental process, even though there is a growing demand for these materials in various industry sectors. This study explores the potential of AI to predict the morphology of nanoparticles within the data availability constraints. For that, we first generated a new multi-modal dataset that is double the size of analogous studies.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Neural operators extend data-driven models to map between infinite-dimensional functional spaces. While these operators perform effectively in either the time or frequency domain, their performance may be limited when applied to non-stationary spatial or temporal signals whose frequency characteristics change with time. Here, we introduce Complex Neural Operator (CoNO) that parameterizes the integral kernel using Fractional Fourier Transform (FrFT), better representing non-stationary signals in a complex-valued domain. Theoretically, we prove the universal approximation capability of CoNO. We perform an extensive empirical evaluation of CoNO on seven challenging partial differential equations (PDEs), including regular grids, structured meshes, and point clouds. Empirically, CoNO consistently attains state-of-the-art performance, showcasing an average relative gain of 10.9%. Further, CoNO exhibits superior performance, outperforming all other models in additional tasks such as zero-shot super-resolution and robustness to noise. CoNO also exhibits the ability to learn from small amounts of data -- giving the same performance as the next best model with just 60% of the training data. Altogether, CoNO presents a robust and superior model for modeling continuous dynamical systems, providing a fillip to scientific machine learning.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Pathfinding problems are found throughout robotics, computational science, and natural sciences. Traditional methods to solve these require training deep neural networks (DNNs) for each new problem domain, consuming substantial time and resources. This study introduces a novel foundation model, leveraging deep reinforcement learning to train heuristic functions that seamlessly adapt to new domains without further fine-tuning. Building upon DeepCubeA, we enhance the model by providing the heuristic function with the domain's state transition information, improving its adaptability. Utilizing a puzzle generator for the 15-puzzle action space variation domains, we demonstrate our model's ability to generalize and solve unseen domains. We achieve a strong correlation between learned and ground truth heuristic values across various domains, as evidenced by robust R-squared and Concordance Correlation Coefficient metrics. These results underscore the potential of foundation models to establish new standards in efficiency and adaptability for AI-driven solutions in complex pathfinding problems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Differential privacy mechanisms such as the Gaussian or Laplace mechanism have been widely used in data analytics for preserving individual privacy. However, they are mostly designed for continuous outputs and are unsuitable for scenarios where discrete values are necessary. Although various quantization mechanisms were proposed recently to generate discrete outputs under differential privacy, the outcomes are either biased or have an inferior accuracy-privacy trade-off. In this paper, we propose a family of quantization mechanisms that is unbiased and differentially private. It has a high degree of freedom and we show that some existing mechanisms can be considered as special cases of ours. To find the optimal mechanism, we formulate a linear optimization that can be solved efficiently using linear programming tools. Experiments show that our proposed mechanism can attain a better privacy-accuracy trade-off compared to baselines.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Data-driven Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems trained using Machine Learning (ML) are shaping an ever-increasing (in size and importance) portion of our lives, including, but not limited to, recommendation systems, autonomous driving technologies, healthcare diagnostics, financial services, and personalized marketing. On the one hand, the outsized influence of these systems imposes a high standard of quality, particularly in the data used to train them. On the other hand, establishing and maintaining standards of Data Quality (DQ) becomes more challenging due to the proliferation of Edge Computing and Internet of Things devices, along with their increasing adoption for training and deploying ML models. The nature of the edge environment -- characterized by limited resources, decentralized data storage, and processing -- exacerbates data-related issues, making them more frequent, severe, and difficult to detect and mitigate. From these observations, it follows that DQ research for edge ML is a critical and urgent exploration track for the safety and robust usefulness of present and future AI systems. Despite this fact, DQ research for edge ML is still in its infancy. The literature on this subject remains fragmented and scattered across different research communities, with no comprehensive survey to date. Hence, this paper aims to fill this gap by providing a global view of the existing literature from multiple disciplines that can be grouped under the umbrella of DQ for edge ML. Specifically, we present a tentative definition of data quality in Edge computing, which we use to establish a set of DQ dimensions. We explore each dimension in detail, including existing solutions for mitigation.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Cognitive Language Processing (CLP), situated at the intersection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and cognitive science, plays a progressively pivotal role in the domains of artificial intelligence, cognitive intelligence, and brain science. Among the essential areas of investigation in CLP, Cognitive Signal Decoding (CSD) has made remarkable achievements, yet there still exist challenges related to insufficient global dynamic representation capability and deficiencies in multi-domain feature integration. In this paper, we introduce a novel paradigm for CLP referred to as Disentangled Frequency-Spatial-Temporal Attention(D-FaST). Specifically, we present an novel cognitive signal decoder that operates on disentangled frequency-space-time domain attention. This decoder encompasses three key components: frequency domain feature extraction employing multi-view attention, spatial domain feature extraction utilizing dynamic brain connection graph attention, and temporal feature extraction relying on local time sliding window attention. These components are integrated within a novel disentangled framework. Additionally, to encourage advancements in this field, we have created a new CLP dataset, MNRED. Subsequently, we conducted an extensive series of experiments, evaluating D-FaST's performance on MNRED, as well as on publicly available datasets including ZuCo, BCIC IV-2A, and BCIC IV-2B. Our experimental results demonstrate that D-FaST outperforms existing methods significantly on both our datasets and traditional CSD datasets including establishing a state-of-the-art accuracy score 78.72% on MNRED, pushing the accuracy score on ZuCo to 78.35%, accuracy score on BCIC IV-2A to 74.85% and accuracy score on BCIC IV-2B to 76.81%.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>watermark</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Language model (LM) watermarking techniques inject a statistical signal into LM-generated content by substituting the random sampling process with pseudo-random sampling, using watermark keys as the random seed. Among these statistical watermarking approaches, distortion-free watermarks are particularly crucial because they embed watermarks into LM-generated content without compromising generation quality. However, one notable limitation of pseudo-random sampling compared to true-random sampling is that, under the same watermark keys (i.e., key collision), the results of pseudo-random sampling exhibit correlations. This limitation could potentially undermine the distortion-free property. Our studies reveal that key collisions are inevitable due to the limited availability of watermark keys, and existing distortion-free watermarks exhibit a significant distribution bias toward the original LM distribution in the presence of key collisions. Moreover, achieving a perfect distortion-free watermark is impossible as no statistical signal can be embedded under key collisions. To reduce the distribution bias caused by key collisions, we introduce a new family of distortion-free watermarks--beta-watermark. Experimental results support that the beta-watermark can effectively reduce the distribution bias under key collisions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>defense, attack, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent attacks on federated learning (FL) can introduce malicious model updates that circumvent widely adopted Euclidean distance-based detection methods. This paper proposes a novel defense strategy, referred to as LayerCAM-AE, designed to counteract model poisoning in federated learning. The LayerCAM-AE puts forth a new Layer Class Activation Mapping (LayerCAM) integrated with an autoencoder (AE), significantly enhancing detection capabilities. Specifically, LayerCAM-AE generates a heat map for each local model update, which is then transformed into a more compact visual format. The autoencoder is designed to process the LayerCAM heat maps from the local model updates, improving their distinctiveness and thereby increasing the accuracy in spotting anomalous maps and malicious local models. To address the risk of misclassifications with LayerCAM-AE, a voting algorithm is developed, where a local model update is flagged as malicious if its heat maps are consistently suspicious over several rounds of communication. Extensive tests of LayerCAM-AE on the SVHN and CIFAR-100 datasets are performed under both Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) and non-IID settings in comparison with existing ResNet-50 and REGNETY-800MF defense models. Experimental results show that LayerCAM-AE increases detection rates (Recall: 1.0, Precision: 1.0, FPR: 0.0, Accuracy: 1.0, F1 score: 1.0, AUC: 1.0) and test accuracy in FL, surpassing the performance of both the ResNet-50 and REGNETY-800MF.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the rapidly evolving digital content landscape, media firms and news publishers require automated and efficient methods to enhance user engagement. This paper introduces the LLM-Assisted Online Learning Algorithm (LOLA), a novel framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with adaptive experimentation to optimize content delivery. Leveraging a large-scale dataset from Upworthy, which includes 17,681 headline A/B tests aimed at evaluating the performance of various headlines associated with the same article content, we first investigate three broad pure-LLM approaches: prompt-based methods, embedding-based classification models, and fine-tuned open-source LLMs. Our findings indicate that prompt-based approaches perform poorly, achieving no more than 65% accuracy in identifying the catchier headline among two options. In contrast, OpenAI-embedding-based classification models and fine-tuned Llama-3-8b models achieve comparable accuracy, around 82-84%, though still falling short of the performance of experimentation with sufficient traffic. We then introduce LOLA, which combines the best pure-LLM approach with the Upper Confidence Bound algorithm to adaptively allocate traffic and maximize clicks. Our numerical experiments on Upworthy data show that LOLA outperforms the standard A/B testing method (the current status quo at Upworthy), pure bandit algorithms, and pure-LLM approaches, particularly in scenarios with limited experimental traffic or numerous arms. Our approach is both scalable and broadly applicable to content experiments across a variety of digital settings where firms seek to optimize user engagement, including digital advertising and social media recommendations.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Measuring the value of individual samples is critical for many data-driven tasks, e.g., the training of a deep learning model. Recent literature witnesses the substantial efforts in developing data valuation methods. The primary data valuation methodology is based on the Shapley value from game theory, and various methods are proposed along this path. {Even though Shapley value-based valuation has solid theoretical basis, it is entirely an experiment-based approach and no valuation model has been constructed so far.} In addition, current data valuation methods ignore the interpretability of the output values, despite an interptable data valuation method is of great helpful for applications such as data pricing. This study aims to answer an important question: is data valuation learnable and interpretable? A learned valuation model have several desirable merits such as fixed number of parameters and knowledge reusability. An intrepretable data valuation model can explain why a sample is valuable or invaluable. To this end, two new data value modeling frameworks are proposed, in which a multi-layer perception~(MLP) and a new regression tree are utilized as specific base models for model training and interpretability, respectively. Extensive experiments are conducted on benchmark datasets. {The experimental results provide a positive answer for the question.} Our study opens up a new technical path for the assessing of data values. Large data valuation models can be built across many different data-driven tasks, which can promote the widespread application of data valuation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>federate, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Training Large Language Models (LLMs) relies heavily on distributed implementations, employing multiple GPUs to compute stochastic gradients on model replicas in parallel. However, synchronizing gradients in data parallel settings induces a communication overhead increasing with the number of distributed workers, which can impede the efficiency gains of parallelization. To address this challenge, optimization algorithms reducing inter-worker communication have emerged, such as local optimization methods used in Federated Learning. While effective in minimizing communication overhead, these methods incur significant memory costs, hindering scalability: in addition to extra momentum variables, if communications are only allowed between multiple local optimization steps, then the optimizer's states cannot be sharded among workers. In response, we propose $\textbf{AC}$cumulate while $\textbf{CO}$mmunicate ($\texttt{ACCO}$), a memory-efficient optimization algorithm tailored for distributed training of LLMs. $\texttt{ACCO}$ allows to shard optimizer states across workers, overlaps gradient computations and communications to conceal communication costs, and accommodates heterogeneous hardware. Our method relies on a novel technique to mitigate the one-step delay inherent in parallel execution of gradient computations and communications, eliminating the need for warmup steps and aligning with the training dynamics of standard distributed optimization while converging faster in terms of wall-clock time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of $\texttt{ACCO}$ on several LLMs training and fine-tuning tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Optimizing the deployment of large language models (LLMs) in edge computing environments is critical for enhancing privacy and computational efficiency. Toward efficient wireless LLM inference in edge computing, this study comprehensively analyzes the impact of different splitting points in mainstream open-source LLMs. On this basis, this study introduces a framework taking inspiration from model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) to determine the optimal splitting point across the edge and user equipment (UE). By incorporating a reward surrogate model, our approach significantly reduces the computational cost of frequent performance evaluations.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, attack, robust, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid proliferation of open-source language models significantly increases the risks of downstream backdoor attacks. These backdoors can introduce dangerous behaviours during model deployment and can evade detection by conventional cybersecurity monitoring systems. In this paper, we introduce a novel class of backdoors in autoregressive transformer models, that, in contrast to prior art, are unelicitable in nature. Unelicitability prevents the defender from triggering the backdoor, making it impossible to evaluate or detect ahead of deployment even if given full white-box access and using automated techniques, such as red-teaming or certain formal verification methods. We show that our novel construction is not only unelicitable thanks to using cryptographic techniques, but also has favourable robustness properties. We confirm these properties in empirical investigations, and provide evidence that our backdoors can withstand state-of-the-art mitigation strategies. Additionally, we expand on previous work by showing that our universal backdoors, while not completely undetectable in white-box settings, can be harder to detect than some existing designs. By demonstrating the feasibility of seamlessly integrating backdoors into transformer models, this paper fundamentally questions the efficacy of pre-deployment detection strategies. This offers new insights into the offence-defence balance in AI safety and security.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the burgeoning field of Large Language Models (LLMs), developing a robust safety mechanism, colloquially known as "safeguards" or "guardrails", has become imperative to ensure the ethical use of LLMs within prescribed boundaries. This article provides a systematic literature review on the current status of this critical mechanism. It discusses its major challenges and how it can be enhanced into a comprehensive mechanism dealing with ethical issues in various contexts. First, the paper elucidates the current landscape of safeguarding mechanisms that major LLM service providers and the open-source community employ. This is followed by the techniques to evaluate, analyze, and enhance some (un)desirable properties that a guardrail might want to enforce, such as hallucinations, fairness, privacy, and so on. Based on them, we review techniques to circumvent these controls (i.e., attacks), to defend the attacks, and to reinforce the guardrails. While the techniques mentioned above represent the current status and the active research trends, we also discuss several challenges that cannot be easily dealt with by the methods and present our vision on how to implement a comprehensive guardrail through the full consideration of multi-disciplinary approach, neural-symbolic method, and systems development lifecycle.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recently, a novel method known as Page Spray emerges, focusing on page-level exploitation for kernel vulnerabilities. Despite the advantages it offers in terms of exploitability, stability, and compatibility, comprehensive research on Page Spray remains scarce. Questions regarding its root causes, exploitation model, comparative benefits over other exploitation techniques, and possible mitigation strategies have largely remained unanswered. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation into Page Spray, providing an in-depth understanding of this exploitation technique. We introduce a comprehensive exploit model termed the \sys model, elucidating its fundamental principles. Additionally, we conduct a thorough analysis of the root causes underlying Page Spray occurrences within the Linux Kernel. We design an analyzer based on the Page Spray analysis model to identify Page Spray callsites. Subsequently, we evaluate the stability, exploitability, and compatibility of Page Spray through meticulously designed experiments. Finally, we propose mitigation principles for addressing Page Spray and introduce our own lightweight mitigation approach. This research aims to assist security researchers and developers in gaining insights into Page Spray, ultimately enhancing our collective understanding of this emerging exploitation technique and making improvements to the community.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper proposes Progressive Inference - a framework to compute input attributions to explain the predictions of decoder-only sequence classification models. Our work is based on the insight that the classification head of a decoder-only Transformer model can be used to make intermediate predictions by evaluating them at different points in the input sequence. Due to the causal attention mechanism, these intermediate predictions only depend on the tokens seen before the inference point, allowing us to obtain the model's prediction on a masked input sub-sequence, with negligible computational overheads. We develop two methods to provide sub-sequence level attributions using this insight. First, we propose Single Pass-Progressive Inference (SP-PI), which computes attributions by taking the difference between consecutive intermediate predictions. Second, we exploit a connection with Kernel SHAP to develop Multi Pass-Progressive Inference (MP-PI). MP-PI uses intermediate predictions from multiple masked versions of the input to compute higher quality attributions. Our studies on a diverse set of models trained on text classification tasks show that SP-PI and MP-PI provide significantly better attributions compared to prior work.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, security, privacy, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As privacy-preserving becomes a pivotal aspect of deep learning (DL) development, multi-party computation (MPC) has gained prominence for its efficiency and strong security. However, the practice of current MPC frameworks is limited, especially when dealing with large neural networks, exemplified by the prolonged execution time of 25.8 seconds for secure inference on ResNet-152. The primary challenge lies in the reliance of current MPC approaches on additive secret sharing, which incurs significant communication overhead with non-linear operations such as comparisons. Furthermore, additive sharing suffers from poor scalability on party size. In contrast, the evolving landscape of MPC necessitates accommodating a larger number of compute parties and ensuring robust performance against malicious activities or computational failures. In light of these challenges, we propose SSNet, which for the first time, employs Shamir's secret sharing (SSS) as the backbone of MPC-based ML framework. We meticulously develop all framework primitives and operations for secure DL models tailored to seamlessly integrate with the SSS scheme. SSNet demonstrates the ability to scale up party numbers straightforwardly and embeds strategies to authenticate the computation correctness without incurring significant performance overhead. Additionally, SSNet introduces masking strategies designed to reduce communication overhead associated with non-linear operations. We conduct comprehensive experimental evaluations on commercial cloud computing infrastructure from Amazon AWS, as well as across diverse prevalent DNN models and datasets. SSNet demonstrates a substantial performance boost, achieving speed-ups ranging from 3x to 14x compared to SOTA MPC frameworks. Moreover, SSNet also represents the first framework that is evaluated on a five-party computation setup, in the context of secure DL inference.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>An Artificial Intelligence (AI) agent is a software entity that autonomously performs tasks or makes decisions based on pre-defined objectives and data inputs. AI agents, capable of perceiving user inputs, reasoning and planning tasks, and executing actions, have seen remarkable advancements in algorithm development and task performance. However, the security challenges they pose remain under-explored and unresolved. This survey delves into the emerging security threats faced by AI agents, categorizing them into four critical knowledge gaps: unpredictability of multi-step user inputs, complexity in internal executions, variability of operational environments, and interactions with untrusted external entities. By systematically reviewing these threats, this paper highlights both the progress made and the existing limitations in safeguarding AI agents. The insights provided aim to inspire further research into addressing the security threats associated with AI agents, thereby fostering the development of more robust and secure AI agent applications.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks pose an increasingly substantial cybersecurity threat to organizations across the globe. In this paper, we introduce a new deep learning-based technique for detecting DDoS attacks, a paramount cybersecurity challenge with evolving complexity and scale. Specifically, we propose a new dual-space prototypical network that leverages a unique dual-space loss function to enhance detection accuracy for various attack patterns through geometric and angular similarity measures. This approach capitalizes on the strengths of representation learning within the latent space (a lower-dimensional representation of data that captures complex patterns for machine learning analysis), improving the model's adaptability and sensitivity towards varying DDoS attack vectors. Our comprehensive evaluation spans multiple training environments, including offline training, simulated online training, and prototypical network scenarios, to validate the model's robustness under diverse data abundance and scarcity conditions. The Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) with Attention, trained with our dual-space prototypical design over a reduced training set, achieves an average accuracy of 94.85% and an F1-Score of 94.71% across our tests, showcasing its effectiveness in dynamic and constrained real-world scenarios.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, robust, watermark</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Motivated by the problem of detecting AI-generated text, we consider the problem of watermarking the output of language models with provable guarantees. We aim for watermarks which satisfy: (a) undetectability, a cryptographic notion introduced by Christ, Gunn & Zamir (2024) which stipulates that it is computationally hard to distinguish watermarked language model outputs from the model's actual output distribution; and (b) robustness to channels which introduce a constant fraction of adversarial insertions, substitutions, and deletions to the watermarked text. Earlier schemes could only handle stochastic substitutions and deletions, and thus we are aiming for a more natural and appealing robustness guarantee that holds with respect to edit distance. Our main result is a watermarking scheme which achieves both undetectability and robustness to edits when the alphabet size for the language model is allowed to grow as a polynomial in the security parameter. To derive such a scheme, we follow an approach introduced by Christ & Gunn (2024), which proceeds via first constructing pseudorandom codes satisfying undetectability and robustness properties analogous to those above; our key idea is to handle adversarial insertions and deletions by interpreting the symbols as indices into the codeword, which we call indexing pseudorandom codes. Additionally, our codes rely on weaker computational assumptions than used in previous work. Then we show that there is a generic transformation from such codes over large alphabets to watermarking schemes for arbitrary language models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) aims to adapt a model pre-trained on a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain without access to source data, preserving the source domain's privacy. While SFDA is prevalent in computer vision, it remains largely unexplored in time series analysis. Existing SFDA methods, designed for visual data, struggle to capture the inherent temporal dynamics of time series, hindering adaptation performance. This paper proposes MAsk And imPUte (MAPU), a novel and effective approach for time series SFDA. MAPU addresses the critical challenge of temporal consistency by introducing a novel temporal imputation task. This task involves randomly masking time series signals and leveraging a dedicated temporal imputer to recover the original signal within the learned embedding space, bypassing the complexities of noisy raw data. Notably, MAPU is the first method to explicitly address temporal consistency in the context of time series SFDA. Additionally, it offers seamless integration with existing SFDA methods, providing greater flexibility. We further introduce E-MAPU, which incorporates evidential uncertainty estimation to address the overconfidence issue inherent in softmax predictions. To achieve that, we leverage evidential deep learning to obtain a better-calibrated pre-trained model and adapt the target encoder to map out-of-support target samples to a new feature representation closer to the source domain's support. This fosters better alignment, ultimately enhancing adaptation performance. Extensive experiments on five real-world time series datasets demonstrate that both MAPU and E-MAPU achieve significant performance gains compared to existing methods. These results highlight the effectiveness of our proposed approaches for tackling various time series domain adaptation problems.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The Internet of Things (IoT) has been introduced as a breakthrough technology that integrates intelligence into everyday objects, enabling high levels of connectivity between them. As the IoT networks grow and expand, they become more susceptible to cybersecurity attacks. A significant challenge in current intrusion detection systems for IoT includes handling imbalanced datasets where labeled data are scarce, particularly for new and rare types of cyber attacks. Existing literature often fails to detect such underrepresented attack classes. This paper introduces a novel intrusion detection approach designed to address these challenges. By integrating Self Supervised Learning (SSL), Few Shot Learning (FSL), and Random Forest (RF), our approach excels in learning from limited and imbalanced data and enhancing detection capabilities. The approach starts with a Deep Infomax model trained to extract key features from the dataset. These features are then fed into a prototypical network to generate discriminate embedding. Subsequently, an RF classifier is employed to detect and classify potential malware, including a range of attacks that are frequently observed in IoT networks. The proposed approach was evaluated through two different datasets, MaleVis and WSN-DS, which demonstrate its superior performance with accuracies of 98.60% and 99.56%, precisions of 98.79% and 99.56%, recalls of 98.60% and 99.56%, and F1-scores of 98.63% and 99.56%, respectively.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Sequential recommendation aims to estimate dynamic user preferences and sequential dependencies among historical user behaviors. Attention-based models have proven effective for sequential recommendation, but they suffer from inference inefficiency due to the quadratic computational complexity of attention mechanisms, particularly for long-range behavior sequences. Inspired by the recent success of state space models (SSMs) in control theory, which provide a robust framework for modeling and controlling dynamic systems, we present EchoMamba4Rec. Control theory emphasizes the use of SSMs for managing long-range dependencies and maintaining inferential efficiency through structured state matrices. EchoMamba4Rec leverages these control relationships in sequential recommendation and integrates bi-directional processing with frequency-domain filtering to capture complex patterns and dependencies in user interaction data more effectively. Our model benefits from the ability of state space models (SSMs) to learn and perform parallel computations, significantly enhancing computational efficiency and scalability. It features a bi-directional Mamba module that incorporates both forward and reverse Mamba components, leveraging information from both past and future interactions. Additionally, a filter layer operates in the frequency domain using learnable Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and learnable filters, followed by an inverse FFT to refine item embeddings and reduce noise. We also integrate Gate Linear Units (GLU) to dynamically control information flow, enhancing the model's expressiveness and training stability. Experimental results demonstrate that EchoMamba significantly outperforms existing models, providing more accurate and personalized recommendations.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In-context learning (ICL) achieves remarkable performance in various domains such as knowledge acquisition, commonsense reasoning, and semantic understanding. However, its performance significantly deteriorates for emotion detection tasks, especially fine-grained emotion recognition. The underlying reasons for this remain unclear. In this paper, we identify the reasons behind ICL's poor performance from the perspective of prototype theory and propose a method to address this issue. Specifically, we conduct extensive pilot experiments and find that ICL conforms to the prototype theory on fine-grained emotion recognition. Based on this theory, we uncover the following deficiencies in ICL: (1) It relies on prototypes (example-label pairs) that are semantically similar but emotionally inaccurate to predict emotions. (2) It is prone to interference from irrelevant categories, affecting the accuracy and robustness of the predictions. To address these issues, we propose an Emotion Context Learning method (E-ICL) on fine-grained emotion recognition. E-ICL relies on more emotionally accurate prototypes to predict categories by referring to emotionally similar examples with dynamic labels. Simultaneously, E-ICL employs an exclusionary emotion prediction strategy to avoid interference from irrelevant categories, thereby increasing its accuracy and robustness. Note that the entire process is accomplished with the assistance of a plug-and-play emotion auxiliary model, without additional training. Experiments on the fine-grained emotion datasets EDOS, Empathetic-Dialogues, EmpatheticIntent, and GoEmotions show that E-ICL achieves superior emotion prediction performance. Furthermore, even when the emotion auxiliary model used is lower than 10% of the LLMs, E-ICL can still boost the performance of LLMs by over 4% on multiple datasets.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Stochastic block models (SBMs) are a very commonly studied network model for community detection algorithms. In the standard form of an SBM, the $n$ vertices (or nodes) of a graph are generally divided into multiple pre-determined communities (or clusters). Connections between pairs of vertices are generated randomly and independently with pre-defined probabilities, which depend on the communities containing the two nodes. A fundamental problem in SBMs is the recovery of the community structure, and sharp information-theoretic bounds are known for recoverability for many versions of SBMs. Our focus here is the recoverability problem in SBMs when the network is private. Under the edge differential privacy model, we derive conditions for exact recoverability in three different versions of SBMs, namely Asymmetric SBM (when communities have non-uniform sizes), General Structure SBM (with outliers), and Censored SBM (with edge features). Our private algorithms have polynomial running time w.r.t. the input graph's size, and match the recovery thresholds of the non-private setting when $\epsilon\rightarrow\infty$. In contrast, the previous best results for recoverability in SBMs only hold for the symmetric case (equal size communities), and run in quasi-polynomial time, or in polynomial time with recovery thresholds being tight up to some constants from the non-private settings.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the rapidly evolving landscape of eCommerce, Artificial Intelligence (AI) based pricing algorithms, particularly those utilizing Reinforcement Learning (RL), are becoming increasingly prevalent. This rise has led to an inextricable pricing situation with the potential for market collusion. Our research employs an experimental oligopoly model of repeated price competition, systematically varying the environment to cover scenarios from basic economic theory to subjective consumer demand preferences. We also introduce a novel demand framework that enables the implementation of various demand models, allowing for a weighted blending of different models. In contrast to existing research in this domain, we aim to investigate the strategies and emerging pricing patterns developed by the agents, which may lead to a collusive outcome. Furthermore, we investigate a scenario where agents cannot observe their competitors' prices. Finally, we provide a comprehensive legal analysis across all scenarios. Our findings indicate that RL-based AI agents converge to a collusive state characterized by the charging of supracompetitive prices, without necessarily requiring inter-agent communication. Implementing alternative RL algorithms, altering the number of agents or simulation settings, and restricting the scope of the agents' observation space does not significantly impact the collusive market outcome behavior.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Feature resolution impacts the ability of classifiers to make explainable inferences when applied to malware classification. We explore classification based on features constructed from data dependency graphs, and present results from k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) classifiers. Our study demonstrates that classification based on a novel feature representation not only yields high accuracy, but also increases explainability in inference, as features of data dependency are directly representative of program behavior. We present classification results using the Microsoft Kaggle 2015 malware dataset which was processed with a novel approach to feature extraction and representation. We show that non-parametric approaches to classification in the metric space are able to obtain classification accuracy of 87.5\% when applied to multi-class classification in the Kaggle malware dataset. Additionally, similarity in the metric space can be calculated directly without prior training. Our results provide evidence that data dependency graphs accurately capture both semantic and structural information.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper presents the Block Transformer architecture which adopts hierarchical global-to-local modeling to autoregressive transformers to mitigate the inference bottlenecks of self-attention. To apply self-attention, the key-value (KV) cache of all previous sequences must be retrieved from memory at every decoding step. Thereby, this KV cache IO becomes a significant bottleneck in batch inference. We notice that these costs stem from applying self-attention on the global context, therefore we isolate the expensive bottlenecks of global modeling to lower layers and apply fast local modeling in upper layers. To mitigate the remaining costs in the lower layers, we aggregate input tokens into fixed size blocks and then apply self-attention at this coarse level. Context information is aggregated into a single embedding to enable upper layers to decode the next block of tokens, without global attention. Free of global attention bottlenecks, the upper layers can fully utilize the compute hardware to maximize inference throughput. By leveraging global and local modules, the Block Transformer architecture demonstrates 10-20x gains in inference throughput compared to vanilla transformers with equivalent perplexity. Our work introduces a new approach to optimize language model inference through novel application of global-to-local modeling. Code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Electrocardiogram (ECG) delineation plays a crucial role in assisting cardiologists with accurate diagnoses. Prior research studies have explored various methods, including the application of deep learning techniques, to achieve precise delineation. However, existing approaches face limitations primarily related to dataset size and robustness. In this paper, we introduce a dataset for ECG delineation and propose a novel self-trained method aimed at leveraging a vast amount of unlabeled ECG data. Our approach involves the pseudolabeling of unlabeled data using a neural network trained on our dataset. Subsequently, we train the model on the newly labeled samples to enhance the quality of delineation. We conduct experiments demonstrating that our dataset is a valuable resource for training robust models and that our proposed self-trained method improves the prediction quality of ECG delineation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The most common algorithms for differentially private (DP) machine learning (ML) are all based on stochastic gradient descent, for example, DP-SGD. These algorithms achieve DP by treating each gradient as an independent private query. However, this independence can cause us to overpay in privacy loss because we don't analyze the entire gradient trajectory. In this work, we propose a new DP algorithm, which we call Accelerated-DP-SRGD (DP stochastic recursive gradient descent), that enables us to break this independence and only pay for privacy in the gradient difference, i.e., in the new information at the current step. Our algorithm achieves the optimal DP-stochastic convex optimization (DP-SCO) error (up to polylog factors) using only a single epoch over the dataset, and converges at the Nesterov's accelerated rate. Our algorithm can be run in at most $\sqrt{n}$ batch gradient steps with batch size at least $\sqrt{n}$, unlike prior work which required $O(n)$ queries with mostly constant batch sizes. To achieve this, our algorithm combines three key ingredients, a variant of stochastic recursive gradients (SRG), accelerated gradient descent, and correlated noise generation from DP continual counting. Finally, we also show that our algorithm improves over existing SoTA on multi-class logistic regression on MNIST and CIFAR-10.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose Self-Control, a novel method utilizing suffix gradients to control the behavior of large language models (LLMs) without explicit human annotations. Given a guideline expressed in suffix string and the model's self-assessment of adherence, Self-Control computes the gradient of this self-judgment concerning the model's hidden states, directly influencing the auto-regressive generation process towards desired behaviors. To enhance efficiency, we introduce Self-Control_{prefix}, a compact module that encapsulates the learned representations from suffix gradients into a Prefix Controller, facilitating inference-time control for various LLM behaviors. Our experiments demonstrate Self-Control's efficacy across multiple domains, including emotional modulation, ensuring harmlessness, and enhancing complex reasoning. Especially, Self-Control_{prefix} enables a plug-and-play control and jointly controls multiple attributes, improving model outputs without altering model parameters or increasing inference-time costs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Accurate traffic flow forecasting is a crucial research topic in transportation management. However, it is a challenging problem due to rapidly changing traffic conditions, high nonlinearity of traffic flow, and complex spatial and temporal correlations of road networks. Most existing studies either try to capture the spatial dependencies between roads using the same semantic graph over different time steps, or assume all sensors on the roads are equally likely to be connected regardless of the distance between them. However, we observe that the spatial dependencies between roads indeed change over time, and two distant roads are not likely to be helpful to each other when predicting the traffic flow, both of which limit the performance of existing studies. In this paper, we propose Temporal Graph Learning Recurrent Neural Network (TGLRN) to address these problems. More precisely, to effectively model the nature of time series, we leverage Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to dynamically construct a graph at each time step, thereby capturing the time-evolving spatial dependencies between roads (i.e., microscopic view). Simultaneously, we provide the Adaptive Structure Information to the model, ensuring that close and consecutive sensors are considered to be more important for predicting the traffic flow (i.e., macroscopic view). Furthermore, to endow TGLRN with robustness, we introduce an edge sampling strategy when constructing the graph at each time step, which eventually leads to further improvements on the model performance. Experimental results on four commonly used real-world benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of TGLRN.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we propose a textless acoustic model with a self-supervised distillation strategy for noise-robust expressive speech-to-speech translation (S2ST). Recently proposed expressive S2ST systems have achieved impressive expressivity preservation performances by cascading unit-to-speech (U2S) generator to the speech-to-unit translation model. However, these systems are vulnerable to the presence of noise in input speech, which is an assumption in real-world translation scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a U2S generator that incorporates a distillation with no label (DINO) self-supervised training strategy into it's pretraining process. Because the proposed method captures noise-agnostic expressivity representation, it can generate qualified speech even in noisy environment. Objective and subjective evaluation results verified that the proposed method significantly improved the performance of the expressive S2ST system in noisy environments while maintaining competitive performance in clean environments.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multiple synthetic data generation models have emerged, among which deep learning models have become the vanguard due to their ability to capture the underlying characteristics of the original data. However, the resemblance of the synthetic to the original data raises important questions on the protection of individuals' privacy. As synthetic data is perceived as a means to fully protect personal information, most current related work disregards the impact of re-identification risk. In particular, limited attention has been given to exploring outliers, despite their privacy relevance. In this work, we analyze the privacy of synthetic data w.r.t the outliers. Our main findings suggest that outliers re-identification via linkage attack is feasible and easily achieved. Furthermore, additional safeguards such as differential privacy can prevent re-identification, albeit at the expense of the data utility.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The heap is a critical and widely used component of many applications. Due to its dynamic nature, combined with the complexity of heap management algorithms, it is also a frequent target for security exploits. To enhance the heap's security, various heap protection techniques have been introduced, but they either introduce significant runtime overhead or have limited protection. We present CAMP, a new sanitizer for detecting and capturing heap memory corruption. CAMP leverages a compiler and a customized memory allocator. The compiler adds boundary-checking and escape-tracking instructions to the target program, while the memory allocator tracks memory ranges, coordinates with the instrumentation, and neutralizes dangling pointers. With the novel error detection scheme, CAMP enables various compiler optimization strategies and thus eliminates redundant and unnecessary check instrumentation. This design minimizes runtime overhead without sacrificing security guarantees. Our evaluation and comparison of CAMP with existing tools, using both real-world applications and SPEC CPU benchmarks, show that it provides even better heap corruption detection capability with lower runtime overhead.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, protect</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Differentially Private Stochastic Gradients Descent (DP-SGD) is a prominent paradigm for preserving privacy in deep learning. It ensures privacy by perturbing gradients with random noise calibrated to their entire norm at each training step. However, this perturbation suffers from a sub-optimal performance: it repeatedly wastes privacy budget on the general converging direction shared among gradients from different batches, which we refer as common knowledge, yet yields little information gain. Motivated by this, we propose a differentially private training framework with early gradient decomposition and reconstruction (DPDR), which enables more efficient use of the privacy budget. In essence, it boosts model utility by focusing on incremental information protection and recycling the privatized common knowledge learned from previous gradients at early training steps. Concretely, DPDR incorporates three steps. First, it disentangles common knowledge and incremental information in current gradients by decomposing them based on previous noisy gradients. Second, most privacy budget is spent on protecting incremental information for higher information gain. Third, the model is updated with the gradient reconstructed from recycled common knowledge and noisy incremental information. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments show that DPDR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on both convergence rate and accuracy.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) gain substantial reasoning and decision-making capabilities from thought structures. However, existing methods such as Tree of Thought and Retrieval Augmented Thoughts often fall short in complex tasks due to the limitations of insufficient local retrieval of factual knowledge and inadequate global selection of strategies. These limitations make it challenging for these methods to balance factual accuracy and comprehensive logical optimization effectively. To address these limitations, we introduce the Retrieval Augmented Thought Tree (RATT), a novel thought structure that considers both overall logical soundness and factual correctness at each step of the thinking process. Specifically, at every point of a thought branch, RATT performs planning and lookahead to explore and evaluate multiple potential reasoning steps, and integrate the fact-checking ability of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LLM's ability to assess overall strategy. Through this combination of factual knowledge and strategic feasibility, the RATT adjusts and integrates the thought tree structure to search for the most promising branches within the search space. This thought structure significantly enhances the model's coherence in logical inference and efficiency in decision-making, and thus increases the limit of the capacity of LLM to generate reliable inferences and decisions based on thought structures. A broad range of experiments on different types of tasks showcases that the RATT structure significantly outperforms existing methods in factual correctness and logical coherence.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Pre-trained large-scale language models (LLMs) excel at producing coherent articles, yet their outputs may be untruthful, toxic, or fail to align with user expectations. Current approaches focus on using reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to improve model alignment, which works by transforming coarse human preferences of LLM outputs into a feedback signal that guides the model learning process. However, because this approach operates on sequence-level feedback, it lacks the precision to identify the exact parts of the output affecting user preferences. To address this gap, we propose a method to enhance LLM alignment through fine-grained token-level supervision. Specifically, we ask annotators to minimally edit less preferred responses within the standard reward modeling dataset to make them more favorable, ensuring changes are made only where necessary while retaining most of the original content. The refined dataset is used to train a token-level reward model, which is then used for training our fine-grained Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) model. Our experiment results demonstrate that this approach can achieve up to an absolute improvement of $5.1\%$ in LLM performance, in terms of win rate against the reference model, compared with the traditional PPO model.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While the Self-Attention mechanism in the Transformer model has proven to be effective in many domains, we observe that it is less effective in more diverse settings (e.g. multimodality) due to the varying granularity of each token and the high computational demands of lengthy sequences. To address the challenges, we introduce the Learnable Attention Mask (LAM), strategically designed to globally regulate attention maps and prioritize critical tokens within the sequence. Leveraging the Self-Attention module in a BERT-like transformer network, our approach adeptly captures associations between tokens. The extension of the LAM to a multi-layer version accommodates the varied information aspects embedded at each layer of the Transformer network. Comprehensive experimental validation on various datasets, such as MADv2, QVHighlights, ImageNet 1K, and MSRVTT, demonstrates the efficacy of the LAM, exemplifying its ability to enhance model performance while mitigating redundant computations. This pioneering approach presents a significant advancement in enhancing the understanding of complex scenarios, such as in movie understanding.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a prevalent approach to align AI systems with human values by learning rewards from human preference data. Due to various reasons, however, such data typically takes the form of rankings over pairs of trajectory segments, which fails to capture the varying strengths of preferences across different pairs. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive preference loss, underpinned by distributionally robust optimization (DRO), designed to address this uncertainty in preference strength. By incorporating an adaptive scaling parameter into the loss for each pair, our method increases the flexibility of the reward function. Specifically, it assigns small scaling parameters to pairs with ambiguous preferences, leading to more comparable rewards, and large scaling parameters to those with clear preferences for more distinct rewards. Computationally, our proposed loss function is strictly convex and univariate with respect to each scaling parameter, enabling its efficient optimization through a simple second-order algorithm. Our method is versatile and can be readily adapted to various preference optimization frameworks, including direct preference optimization (DPO). Our experiments with robotic control and natural language generation with large language models (LLMs) show that our method not only improves policy performance but also aligns reward function selection more closely with policy optimization, simplifying the hyperparameter tuning process.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Autonomous transportation systems such as road vehicles or vessels require the consideration of the static and dynamic environment to dislocate without collision. Anticipating the behavior of an agent in a given situation is required to adequately react to it in time. Developing deep learning-based models has become the dominant approach to motion prediction recently. The social environment is often considered through a CNN-LSTM-based sub-module processing a $\textit{social tensor}$ that includes information of the past trajectory of surrounding agents. For the proposed transformer-based trajectory prediction model, an alternative, computationally more efficient social tensor definition and processing is suggested. It considers the interdependencies between target and surrounding agents at each time step directly instead of relying on information of last hidden LSTM states of individually processed agents. A transformer-based sub-module, the Social Tensor Transformer, is integrated into the overall prediction model. It is responsible for enriching the target agent's dislocation features with social interaction information obtained from the social tensor. For the awareness of spatial limitations, dislocation features are defined in relation to the navigable area. This replaces additional, computationally expensive map processing sub-modules. An ablation study shows, that for longer prediction horizons, the deviation of the predicted trajectory from the ground truth is lower compared to a spatially and socially agnostic model. Even if the performance gain from a spatial-only to a spatial and social context-sensitive model is small in terms of common error measures, by visualizing the results it can be shown that the proposed model in fact is able to predict reactions to surrounding agents and explicitely allows an interpretable behavior.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) have played a significant role in detecting and preventing cyber-attacks within traditional computing systems. It is not surprising that the same technology is being applied to secure Internet of Things (IoT) networks from cyber threats. The limited computational resources available on IoT devices make it challenging to deploy conventional computing-based IDSs. The IDSs designed for IoT environments must also demonstrate high classification performance, utilize low-complexity models, and be of a small size. Despite significant progress in IoT-based intrusion detection, developing models that both achieve high classification performance and maintain reduced complexity remains challenging. In this study, we propose a hybrid CNN architecture composed of a lightweight CNN and bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) to enhance the performance of IDS on the UNSW-NB15 dataset. The proposed model is specifically designed to run onboard resource-constrained IoT devices and meet their computation capability requirements. Despite the complexity of designing a model that fits the requirements of IoT devices and achieves higher accuracy, our proposed model outperforms the existing research efforts in the literature by achieving an accuracy of 97.28\% for binary classification and 96.91\% for multiclassification.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Accurate vessel trajectory prediction is necessary for save and efficient navigation. Deep learning-based prediction models, esp. encoder-decoders, are rarely applied to inland navigation specifically. Approaches from the maritime domain cannot directly be transferred to river navigation due to specific driving behavior influencing factors. Different encoder-decoder architectures, including a transformer encoder-decoder, are compared herein for predicting the next positions of inland vessels, given not only spatio-temporal information from AIS, but also river specific features. The results show that the reformulation of the regression task as classification problem and the inclusion of river specific features yield the lowest displacement errors. The standard LSTM encoder-decoder outperforms the transformer encoder-decoder for the data considered, but is computationally more expensive. In this study for the first time a transformer-based encoder-decoder model is applied to the problem of predicting the ship trajectory. Here, a feature vector using the river-specific context of navigation input parameters is established. Future studies can built on the proposed models, investigate the improvement of the computationally more efficient transformer, e.g. through further hyper-parameter optimization, and use additional river-specific information in the context representation to further increase prediction accuracy.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Physics-related and model-based vessel trajectory prediction is highly accurate but requires specific knowledge of the vessel under consideration which is not always practical. Machine learning-based trajectory prediction models do not require expert knowledge, but rely on the implicit knowledge extracted from massive amounts of data. Several deep learning (DL) methods for vessel trajectory prediction have recently been suggested. The DL models developed typically only process information about the (dis)location of vessels defined with respect to a global reference system. In the context of inland navigation, this can be problematic, since without knowledge of the limited navigable space, irrealistic trajectories are likely to be determined. If spatial constraintes are introduced, e.g., by implementing an additional submodule to process map data, however, overall complexity increases. Instead of processing the vessel displacement information on the one hand and the spatial information on the other hand, the paper proposes the merging of both information. Here, fairway-related and navigation-related displacement information are used directly. In this way, the previously proposed context-sensitive Classification Transformer (CSCT) shows an improved spatial awareness. Additionally, the CSCT is adapted to assess the model uncertainty by enabling dropout during inference. This approach is trained on different inland waterways to analyze its generalizability. As the improved CSCT obtains lower prediction errors and enables to estimate the trustworthiness of each prediction, it is more suitable for safety-critical applications in inland navigation than previously developed models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Training gaze following models requires a large number of images with gaze target coordinates annotated by human annotators, which is a laborious and inherently ambiguous process. We propose the first semi-supervised method for gaze following by introducing two novel priors to the task. We obtain the first prior using a large pretrained Visual Question Answering (VQA) model, where we compute Grad-CAM heatmaps by `prompting' the VQA model with a gaze following question. These heatmaps can be noisy and not suited for use in training. The need to refine these noisy annotations leads us to incorporate a second prior. We utilize a diffusion model trained on limited human annotations and modify the reverse sampling process to refine the Grad-CAM heatmaps. By tuning the diffusion process we achieve a trade-off between the human annotation prior and the VQA heatmap prior, which retains the useful VQA prior information while exhibiting similar properties to the training data distribution. Our method outperforms simple pseudo-annotation generation baselines on the GazeFollow image dataset. More importantly, our pseudo-annotation strategy, applied to a widely used supervised gaze following model (VAT), reduces the annotation need by 50%. Our method also performs the best on the VideoAttentionTarget dataset.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This study intends to systematically disentangle pure logic reasoning and text understanding by investigating the contrast across abstract and contextualized logical problems from a comprehensive set of domains. We explore whether LLMs demonstrate genuine reasoning capabilities across various domains when the underlying logical structure remains constant. We focus on two main questions (1) Can abstract logical problems alone accurately benchmark an LLM's reasoning ability in real-world scenarios, disentangled from contextual support in practical settings? (2) Does fine-tuning LLMs on abstract logic problem generalize to contextualized logic problems and vice versa? To investigate these questions, we focus on standard propositional logic, specifically propositional deductive and abductive logic reasoning. In particular, we construct instantiated datasets for deductive and abductive reasoning with 4 levels of difficulty, encompassing 12 distinct categories or domains based on the categorization of Wikipedia. Our experiments aim to provide insights into disentangling context in logical reasoning and the true reasoning capabilities of LLMs and their generalization potential.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Public models offer predictions to a variety of downstream tasks and have played a crucial role in various AI applications, showcasing their proficiency in accurate predictions. However, the exclusive emphasis on prediction accuracy may not align with the diverse end objectives of downstream agents. Recognizing the public model's predictions as a service, we advocate for integrating the objectives of downstream agents into the optimization process. Concretely, to address performance disparities and foster fairness among heterogeneous agents in training, we propose a novel Equitable Objective. This objective, coupled with a policy gradient algorithm, is crafted to train the public model to produce a more equitable/uniform performance distribution across downstream agents, each with their unique concerns. Both theoretical analysis and empirical case studies have proven the effectiveness of our method in advancing performance equity across diverse downstream agents utilizing the public model for their decision-making.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose reconstruction advantage measures to audit label privatization mechanisms. A reconstruction advantage measure quantifies the increase in an attacker's ability to infer the true label of an unlabeled example when provided with a private version of the labels in a dataset (e.g., aggregate of labels from different users or noisy labels output by randomized response), compared to an attacker that only observes the feature vectors, but may have prior knowledge of the correlation between features and labels. We consider two such auditing measures: one additive, and one multiplicative. These incorporate previous approaches taken in the literature on empirical auditing and differential privacy. The measures allow us to place a variety of proposed privatization schemes -- some differentially private, some not -- on the same footing. We analyze these measures theoretically under a distributional model which encapsulates reasonable adversarial settings. We also quantify their behavior empirically on real and simulated prediction tasks. Across a range of experimental settings, we find that differentially private schemes dominate or match the privacy-utility tradeoff of more heuristic approaches.</li>

This novel approach has many implications in machine learning, including training neural networks to global optimality via convex optimization. Additionally, we consider fine-tuning large language model (LLM) embeddings as a key application area, exploring the intersection of geometric algebra and modern AI techniques. In particular, we conduct a comparative analysis of the robustness of transfer learning via embeddings, such as OpenAI GPT models and BERT, using traditional methods versus our novel approach based on convex optimization. We test our convex optimization transfer learning method across a variety of case studies, employing different embeddings (GPT-4 and BERT embeddings) and different text classification datasets (IMDb, Amazon Polarity Dataset, and GLUE) with a range of hyperparameter settings. Our results demonstrate that convex optimization and geometric algebra not only enhances the performance of LLMs but also offers a more stable and reliable method of transfer learning via embeddings.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Addressing the challenge of effectively processing long contexts has become a critical issue for Large Language Models (LLMs). Two common strategies have emerged: 1) reducing the input length, such as retrieving relevant chunks by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and 2) expanding the context window limit of LLMs. However, both strategies have drawbacks: input reduction has no guarantee of covering the part with needed information, while window extension struggles with focusing on the pertinent information for solving the task. To mitigate these limitations, we propose Chain-of-Agents (CoA), a novel framework that harnesses multi-agent collaboration through natural language to enable information aggregation and context reasoning across various LLMs over long-context tasks. CoA consists of multiple worker agents who sequentially communicate to handle different segmented portions of the text, followed by a manager agent who synthesizes these contributions into a coherent final output. CoA processes the entire input by interleaving reading and reasoning, and it mitigates long context focus issues by assigning each agent a short context. We perform comprehensive evaluation of CoA on a wide range of long-context tasks in question answering, summarization, and code completion, demonstrating significant improvements by up to 10% over strong baselines of RAG, Full-Context, and multi-agent LLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text-to-image diffusion models have recently taken center stage as pivotal tools in promoting visual creativity across an array of domains such as comic book artistry, children's literature, game development, and web design. These models harness the power of artificial intelligence to convert textual descriptions into vivid images, thereby enabling artists and creators to bring their imaginative concepts to life with unprecedented ease. However, one of the significant hurdles that persist is the challenge of maintaining consistency in character generation across diverse contexts. Variations in textual prompts, even if minor, can yield vastly different visual outputs, posing a considerable problem in projects that require a uniform representation of characters throughout. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework designed to produce consistent character representations from a single text prompt across diverse settings. Through both quantitative and qualitative analyses, we demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing methods in generating characters with consistent visual identities, underscoring its potential to transform creative industries. By addressing the critical challenge of character consistency, we not only enhance the practical utility of these models but also broaden the horizons for artistic and creative expression.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Summarizing medical conversations poses unique challenges due to the specialized domain and the difficulty of collecting in-domain training data. In this study, we investigate the performance of state-of-the-art doctor-patient conversation generative summarization models on the out-of-domain data. We divide the summarization model of doctor-patient conversation into two configurations: (1) a general model, without specifying subjective (S), objective (O), and assessment (A) and plan (P) notes; (2) a SOAP-oriented model that generates a summary with SOAP sections. We analyzed the limitations and strengths of the fine-tuning language model-based methods and GPTs on both configurations. We also conducted a Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count analysis to compare the SOAP notes from different datasets. The results exhibit a strong correlation for reference notes across different datasets, indicating that format mismatch (i.e., discrepancies in word distribution) is not the main cause of performance decline on out-of-domain data. Lastly, a detailed analysis of SOAP notes is included to provide insights into missing information and hallucinations introduced by the models.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent innovations in diffusion probabilistic models have paved the way for significant progress in image, text and audio generation, leading to their applications in generative time series forecasting. However, leveraging such abilities to model highly stochastic time series data remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel Stochastic Diffusion (StochDiff) model which learns data-driven prior knowledge at each time step by utilizing the representational power of the stochastic latent spaces to model the variability of the multivariate time series data. The learnt prior knowledge helps the model to capture complex temporal dynamics and the inherent uncertainty of the data. This improves its ability to model highly stochastic time series data. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model on stochastic time series forecasting. Additionally, we showcase an application of our model for real-world surgical guidance, highlighting its potential to benefit the medical community.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As artificial neural networks grow in complexity, understanding their inner workings becomes increasingly challenging, which is particularly important in healthcare applications. The intrinsic evaluation metrics of autoregressive neural language models (NLMs), perplexity (PPL), can reflect how "surprised" an NLM model is at novel input. PPL has been widely used to understand the behavior of NLMs. Previous findings show that changes in PPL when masking attention layers in pre-trained transformer-based NLMs reflect linguistic anomalies associated with Alzheimer's disease dementia. Building upon this, we explore a novel bidirectional attention head ablation method that exhibits properties attributed to the concepts of cognitive and brain reserve in human brain studies, which postulate that people with more neurons in the brain and more efficient processing are more resilient to neurodegeneration. Our results show that larger GPT-2 models require a disproportionately larger share of attention heads to be masked/ablated to display degradation of similar magnitude to masking in smaller models. These results suggest that the attention mechanism in transformer models may present an analogue to the notions of cognitive and brain reserve and could potentially be used to model certain aspects of the progression of neurodegenerative disorders and aging.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, protect, robust, watermark</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Identifying the origin of data is crucial for data provenance, with applications including data ownership protection, media forensics, and detecting AI-generated content. A standard approach involves embedding-based retrieval techniques that match query data with entries in a reference dataset. However, this method is not robust against benign and malicious edits. To address this, we propose Data Retrieval with Error-corrected codes and Watermarking (DREW). DREW randomly clusters the reference dataset, injects unique error-controlled watermark keys into each cluster, and uses these keys at query time to identify the appropriate cluster for a given sample. After locating the relevant cluster, embedding vector similarity retrieval is performed within the cluster to find the most accurate matches. The integration of error control codes (ECC) ensures reliable cluster assignments, enabling the method to perform retrieval on the entire dataset in case the ECC algorithm cannot detect the correct cluster with high confidence. This makes DREW maintain baseline performance, while also providing opportunities for performance improvements due to the increased likelihood of correctly matching queries to their origin when performing retrieval on a smaller subset of the dataset. Depending on the watermark technique used, DREW can provide substantial improvements in retrieval accuracy (up to 40\% for some datasets and modification types) across multiple datasets and state-of-the-art embedding models (e.g., DinoV2, CLIP), making our method a promising solution for secure and reliable source identification.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose Conditional Idempotent Generative Networks (CIGN), a novel approach that expands upon Idempotent Generative Networks (IGN) to enable conditional generation. While IGNs offer efficient single-pass generation, they lack the ability to control the content of the generated data. CIGNs address this limitation by incorporating conditioning mechanisms, allowing users to steer the generation process towards specific types of data. We establish the theoretical foundations for CIGNs, outlining their scope, loss function design, and evaluation metrics. We then present two potential architectures for implementing CIGNs: channel conditioning and filter conditioning. Finally, we discuss experimental results on the MNIST dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of both approaches. Our findings pave the way for further exploration of CIGNs on larger datasets and with more powerful computing resources to determine the optimal implementation strategy.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Foundation models have emerged as powerful tools across various domains including language, vision, and multimodal tasks. While prior works have addressed unsupervised image segmentation, they significantly lag behind supervised models. In this paper, we use a diffusion UNet encoder as a foundation vision encoder and introduce DiffCut, an unsupervised zero-shot segmentation method that solely harnesses the output features from the final self-attention block. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that the utilization of these diffusion features in a graph based segmentation algorithm, significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on zero-shot segmentation. Specifically, we leverage a recursive Normalized Cut algorithm that softly regulates the granularity of detected objects and produces well-defined segmentation maps that precisely capture intricate image details. Our work highlights the remarkably accurate semantic knowledge embedded within diffusion UNet encoders that could then serve as foundation vision encoders for downstream tasks.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In-Context Learning (ICL) has been a powerful emergent property of large language models that has attracted increasing attention in recent years. In contrast to regular gradient-based learning, ICL is highly interpretable and does not require parameter updates. In this paper, we show that, for linearized transformer networks, ICL can be made explicit and permanent through the inclusion of bias terms. We mathematically demonstrate the equivalence between a model with ICL demonstration prompts and the same model with the additional bias terms. Our algorithm (ICLCA) allows for exact conversion in an inexpensive manner. Existing methods are not exact and require expensive parameter updates. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through experiments that show the exact incorporation of ICL tokens into a linear transformer. We further suggest how our method can be adapted to achieve cheap approximate conversion of ICL tokens, even in regular transformer networks that are not linearized. Our experiments on GPT-2 show that, even though the conversion is only approximate, the model still gains valuable context from the included bias terms.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This research investigates the effect of prompt design on dialogue evaluation using large language models (LLMs). While LLMs are increasingly used for scoring various inputs, creating effective prompts for dialogue evaluation remains challenging due to model sensitivity and subjectivity in dialogue assessments. Our study experimented with different prompt structures, altering the sequence of output instructions and including explanatory reasons. We found that the order of presenting reasons and scores significantly influences LLMs' scoring, with a "reason-first" approach yielding more comprehensive evaluations. This insight is crucial for enhancing the accuracy and consistency of LLM-based evaluations.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Numeral systems and units of measurement are two conjoined topics in activities of human beings and have mutual effects with the languages expressing them. Currently, the evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) often involves mathematical reasoning, yet little attention is given to how minor changes in numbers or units can drastically alter the complexity of problems and the performance of LLMs. In this paper, we scrutinize existing LLMs on processing of numerals and units of measurement by constructing datasets with perturbations. We first anatomize the reasoning of math word problems to different sub-procedures like numeral conversions from language to numbers and measurement conversions based on units. Then we further annotate math word problems from ancient Chinese arithmetic works which are challenging in numerals and units of measurement. Experiments on perturbed datasets demonstrate that LLMs still encounter difficulties in handling numeral and measurement conversions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Reservoir computing, a machine learning framework used for modeling the brain, can predict temporal data with little observations and minimal computational resources. However, it is difficult to accurately reproduce the long-term target time series because the reservoir system becomes unstable. This predictive capability is required for a wide variety of time-series processing, including predictions of motor timing and chaotic dynamical systems. This study proposes oscillation-driven reservoir computing (ODRC) with feedback, where oscillatory signals are fed into a reservoir network to stabilize the network activity and induce complex reservoir dynamics. The ODRC can reproduce long-term target time series more accurately than conventional reservoir computing methods in a motor timing and chaotic time-series prediction tasks. Furthermore, it generates a time series similar to the target in the unexperienced period, that is, it can learn the abstract generative rules from limited observations. Given these significant improvements made by the simple and computationally inexpensive implementation, the ODRC would serve as a practical model of various time series data. Moreover, we will discuss biological implications of the ODRC, considering it as a model of neural oscillations and their cerebellar processors.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, federate, fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated Learning (FL) endeavors to harness decentralized data while preserving privacy, facing challenges of performance, scalability, and collaboration. Asynchronous Federated Learning (AFL) methods have emerged as promising alternatives to their synchronous counterparts bounded by the slowest agent, yet they add additional challenges in convergence guarantees, fairness with respect to compute heterogeneity, and incorporation of staleness in aggregated updates. Specifically, AFL biases model training heavily towards agents who can produce updates faster, leaving slower agents behind, who often also have differently distributed data which is not learned by the global model. Naively upweighting introduces incentive issues, where true fast updating agents may falsely report updates at a slower speed to increase their contribution to model training. We introduce FedStaleWeight, an algorithm addressing fairness in aggregating asynchronous client updates by employing average staleness to compute fair re-weightings. FedStaleWeight reframes asynchronous federated learning aggregation as a mechanism design problem, devising a weighting strategy that incentivizes truthful compute speed reporting without favoring faster update-producing agents by upweighting agent updates based on staleness. Leveraging only observed agent update staleness, FedStaleWeight results in more equitable aggregation on a per-agent basis. We both provide theoretical convergence guarantees in the smooth, non-convex setting and empirically compare FedStaleWeight against the commonly used asynchronous FedBuff with gradient averaging, demonstrating how it achieves stronger fairness, expediting convergence to a higher global model accuracy. Finally, we provide an open-source test bench to facilitate exploration of buffered AFL aggregation strategies, fostering further research in asynchronous federated learning paradigms.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The remarkable advancement in text-to-image generation models significantly boosts the research in ID customization generation. However, existing personalization methods cannot simultaneously satisfy high fidelity and high-efficiency requirements. Their main bottleneck lies in the prompt image encoder, which produces weak alignment signals with the text-to-image model and significantly increased model size. Towards this end, we propose a lightweight Inv-Adapter, which first extracts diffusion-domain representations of ID images utilizing a pre-trained text-to-image model via DDIM image inversion, without additional image encoder. Benefiting from the high alignment of the extracted ID prompt features and the intermediate features of the text-to-image model, we then embed them efficiently into the base text-to-image model by carefully designing a lightweight attention adapter. We conduct extensive experiments to assess ID fidelity, generation loyalty, speed, and training parameters, all of which show that the proposed Inv-Adapter is highly competitive in ID customization generation and model scale.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Automated scraping stands out as a common method for collecting data in deep learning models without the authorization of data owners. Recent studies have begun to tackle the privacy concerns associated with this data collection method. Notable approaches include Deepconfuse, error-minimizing, error-maximizing (also known as adversarial poisoning), Neural Tangent Generalization Attack, synthetic, autoregressive, One-Pixel Shortcut, Self-Ensemble Protection, Entangled Features, Robust Error-Minimizing, Hypocritical, and TensorClog. The data generated by those approaches, called "unlearnable" examples, are prevented "learning" by deep learning models. In this research, we investigate and devise an effective nonlinear transformation framework and conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that a deep neural network can effectively learn from the data/examples traditionally considered unlearnable produced by the above twelve approaches. The resulting approach improves the ability to break unlearnable data compared to the linear separable technique recently proposed by researchers. Specifically, our extensive experiments show that the improvement ranges from 0.34% to 249.59% for the unlearnable CIFAR10 datasets generated by those twelve data protection approaches, except for One-Pixel Shortcut. Moreover, the proposed framework achieves over 100% improvement of test accuracy for Autoregressive and REM approaches compared to the linear separable technique. Our findings suggest that these approaches are inadequate in preventing unauthorized uses of data in machine learning models. There is an urgent need to develop more robust protection mechanisms that effectively thwart an attacker from accessing data without proper authorization from the owners.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Layout generation is the keystone in achieving automated graphic design, requiring arranging the position and size of various multi-modal design elements in a visually pleasing and constraint-following manner. Previous approaches are either inefficient for large-scale applications or lack flexibility for varying design requirements. Our research introduces a unified framework for automated graphic layout generation, leveraging the multi-modal large language model (MLLM) to accommodate diverse design tasks. In contrast, our data-driven method employs structured text (JSON format) and visual instruction tuning to generate layouts under specific visual and textual constraints, including user-defined natural language specifications. We conducted extensive experiments and achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on public multi-modal layout generation benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method. Moreover, recognizing existing datasets' limitations in capturing the complexity of real-world graphic designs, we propose two new datasets for much more challenging tasks (user-constrained generation and complicated poster), further validating our model's utility in real-life settings. Marking by its superior accessibility and adaptability, this approach further automates large-scale graphic design tasks. The code and datasets will be publicly available on this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities in various tasks, yet their vast parameter sizes restrict their applicability in resource-constrained settings. Knowledge distillation (KD) offers a viable solution by transferring expertise from large teacher models to compact student models. However, traditional KD techniques face specific challenges when applied to LLMs, including restricted access to LLM outputs, significant teacher-student capacity gaps, and the inherited mis-calibration issue. In this work, we present PLaD, a novel preference-based LLM distillation framework. PLaD exploits the teacher-student capacity discrepancy to generate pseudo-preference pairs where teacher outputs are preferred over student outputs. Then, PLaD leverages a ranking loss to re-calibrate student's estimation of sequence likelihood, which steers the student's focus towards understanding the relative quality of outputs instead of simply imitating the teacher. PLaD bypasses the need for access to teacher LLM's internal states, tackles the student's expressivity limitations, and mitigates the student mis-calibration issue. Through extensive experiments on two sequence generation tasks and with various LLMs, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed PLaD framework.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Personalization has emerged as a critical research area in modern intelligent systems, focusing on mining users' behavioral history and adapting to their preferences for delivering tailored experiences. Despite the remarkable few-shot capabilities exhibited by black-box large language models (LLMs), the inherent opacity of their model parameters presents significant challenges in aligning the generated output with individual expectations. Existing solutions have primarily focused on prompt design to incorporate user-specific profiles and behaviors; however, such approaches often struggle to generalize effectively due to their inability to capture shared knowledge among all users. To address these challenges, we propose HYDRA, a model factorization framework that captures both user-specific behavior patterns from historical data and shared general knowledge among all users to deliver personalized generation. In order to capture user-specific behavior patterns, we first train a reranker to prioritize the most useful information from top-retrieved relevant historical records. By combining the prioritized history with the corresponding query, we train an adapter to align the output with individual user-specific preferences, eliminating the reliance on access to inherent model parameters of black-box LLMs. Both the reranker and the adapter can be decomposed into a base model with multiple user-specific heads, resembling a hydra. The base model maintains shared knowledge across users, while the multiple personal heads capture user-specific preferences. Experimental results demonstrate that HYDRA outperforms existing state-of-the-art prompt-based methods by an average relative improvement of 9.01% across five diverse personalization tasks in the LaMP benchmark.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Dataset bias is a significant problem in training fair classifiers. When attributes unrelated to classification exhibit strong biases towards certain classes, classifiers trained on such dataset may overfit to these bias attributes, substantially reducing the accuracy for minority groups. Mitigation techniques can be categorized according to the availability of bias information (\ie, prior knowledge). Although scenarios with unknown biases are better suited for real-world settings, previous work in this field often suffers from a lack of interpretability regarding biases and lower performance. In this study, we propose a framework to identify potential biases as keywords without prior knowledge based on the partial occurrence in the captions. We further propose two debiasing methods: (a) handing over to an existing debiasing approach which requires prior knowledge by assigning pseudo-labels, and (b) employing data augmentation via text-to-image generative models, using acquired bias keywords as prompts. Despite its simplicity, experimental results show that our framework not only outperforms existing methods without prior knowledge, but also is even comparable with a method that assumes prior knowledge.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Knowledge Tracing (KT) is a critical task in online learning for modeling student knowledge over time. Despite the success of deep learning-based KT models, which rely on sequences of numbers as data, most existing approaches fail to leverage the rich semantic information in the text of questions and concepts. This paper proposes Language model-based Knowledge Tracing (LKT), a novel framework that integrates pre-trained language models (PLMs) with KT methods. By leveraging the power of language models to capture semantic representations, LKT effectively incorporates textual information and significantly outperforms previous KT models on large benchmark datasets. Moreover, we demonstrate that LKT can effectively address the cold-start problem in KT by leveraging the semantic knowledge captured by PLMs. Interpretability of LKT is enhanced compared to traditional KT models due to its use of text-rich data. We conducted the local interpretable model-agnostic explanation technique and analysis of attention scores to interpret the model performance further. Our work highlights the potential of integrating PLMs with KT and paves the way for future research in KT domain.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has been crucial to the recent success of Large Language Models (LLMs), however, it is often a complex and brittle process. In the classical RLHF framework, a reward model is first trained to represent human preferences, which is in turn used by an online reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to optimize the LLM. A prominent issue with such methods is \emph{reward over-optimization} or \emph{reward hacking}, where performance as measured by the learned proxy reward model increases, but true quality plateaus or even deteriorates. Direct Alignment Algorithms (DDAs) like Direct Preference Optimization have emerged as alternatives to the classical RLHF pipeline by circumventing the reward modeling phase. However, although DAAs do not use a separate proxy reward model, they still commonly deteriorate from over-optimization. While the so-called reward hacking phenomenon is not well-defined for DAAs, we still uncover similar trends: at higher KL budgets, DAA algorithms exhibit similar degradation patterns to their classic RLHF counterparts. In particular, we find that DAA methods deteriorate not only across a wide range of KL budgets but also often before even a single epoch of the dataset is completed. Through extensive empirical experimentation, this work formulates and formalizes the reward over-optimization or hacking problem for DAAs and explores its consequences across objectives, training regimes, and model scales.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has increasingly drawn attention to the use of LLMs for human-like planning. Existing work on LLM-based planning either focuses on leveraging the inherent language generation capabilities of LLMs to produce free-style plans, or employs reinforcement learning approaches to learn decision-making for a limited set of actions within restricted environments. However, both approaches exhibit significant discrepancies from the open and executable requirements in real-world planning. In this paper, we propose a new planning task--open grounded planning. The primary objective of open grounded planning is to ask the model to generate an executable plan based on a variable action set, thereby ensuring the executability of the produced plan. To this end, we establishes a benchmark for open grounded planning spanning a wide range of domains. Then we test current state-of-the-art LLMs along with five planning approaches, revealing that existing LLMs and methods still struggle to address the challenges posed by grounded planning in open domains. The outcomes of this paper define and establish a foundational dataset for open grounded planning, and shed light on the potential challenges and future directions of LLM-based planning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved promising results in sentiment analysis through the in-context learning (ICL) paradigm. However, their ability to distinguish subtle sentiments still remains a challenge. Inspired by the human ability to adjust understanding via feedback, this paper enhances ICL by incorporating prior predictions and feedback, aiming to rectify sentiment misinterpretation of LLMs. Specifically, the proposed framework consists of three steps: (1) acquiring prior predictions of LLMs, (2) devising predictive feedback based on correctness, and (3) leveraging a feedback-driven prompt to refine sentiment understanding. Experimental results across nine sentiment analysis datasets demonstrate the superiority of our framework over conventional ICL methods, with an average F1 improvement of 5.95%.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Zeroth-order optimization (ZO) is a memory-efficient strategy for fine-tuning Large Language Models using only forward passes. However, the application of ZO fine-tuning in memory-constrained settings such as mobile phones and laptops is still challenging since full precision forward passes are infeasible. In this study, we address this limitation by integrating sparsity and quantization into ZO fine-tuning of LLMs. Specifically, we investigate the feasibility of fine-tuning an extremely small subset of LLM parameters using ZO. This approach allows the majority of un-tuned parameters to be quantized to accommodate the constraint of limited device memory. Our findings reveal that the pre-training process can identify a set of "sensitive parameters" that can guide the ZO fine-tuning of LLMs on downstream tasks. Our results demonstrate that fine-tuning 0.1% sensitive parameters in the LLM with ZO can outperform the full ZO fine-tuning performance, while offering wall-clock time speedup. Additionally, we show that ZO fine-tuning targeting these 0.1% sensitive parameters, combined with 4 bit quantization, enables efficient ZO fine-tuning of an Llama2-7B model on a GPU device with less than 8 GiB of memory and notably reduced latency.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>It has recently been discovered that using a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM), e.g., CLIP, to align a whole query image with several finer text descriptions generated by a large language model can significantly enhance zero-shot performance. However, in this paper, we empirically find that the finer descriptions tend to align more effectively with local areas of the query image rather than the whole image, and then we theoretically validate this finding. Thus, we present a method called weighted visual-text cross alignment (WCA). This method begins with a localized visual prompting technique, designed to identify local visual areas within the query image. The local visual areas are then cross-aligned with the finer descriptions by creating a similarity matrix using the pre-trained VLM. To determine how well a query image aligns with each category, we develop a score function based on the weighted similarities in this matrix. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves zero-shot performance across various datasets, achieving results that are even comparable to few-shot learning methods.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) were recently introduced as an alternative representation model to MLP. Herein, we employ KANs to construct physics-informed machine learning models (PIKANs) and deep operator models (DeepOKANs) for solving differential equations for forward and inverse problems. In particular, we compare them with physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and deep operator networks (DeepONets), which are based on the standard MLP representation. We find that although the original KANs based on the B-splines parameterization lack accuracy and efficiency, modified versions based on low-order orthogonal polynomials have comparable performance to PINNs and DeepONet although they still lack robustness as they may diverge for different random seeds or higher order orthogonal polynomials. We visualize their corresponding loss landscapes and analyze their learning dynamics using information bottleneck theory. Our study follows the FAIR principles so that other researchers can use our benchmarks to further advance this emerging topic.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) have excelled across domains, also delivering notable performance on the medical evaluation benchmarks, such as MedQA. However, there still exists a significant gap between the reported performance and the practical effectiveness in real-world medical scenarios. In this paper, we aim to explore the causes of this gap by employing a multifaceted examination schema to systematically probe the actual mastery of medical knowledge by current LLMs. Specifically, we develop a novel evaluation framework MultifacetEval to examine the degree and coverage of LLMs in encoding and mastering medical knowledge at multiple facets (comparison, rectification, discrimination, and verification) concurrently. Based on the MultifacetEval framework, we construct two multifaceted evaluation datasets: MultiDiseK (by producing questions from a clinical disease knowledge base) and MultiMedQA (by rephrasing each question from a medical benchmark MedQA into multifaceted questions). The experimental results on these multifaceted datasets demonstrate that the extent of current LLMs in mastering medical knowledge is far below their performance on existing medical benchmarks, suggesting that they lack depth, precision, and comprehensiveness in mastering medical knowledge. Consequently, current LLMs are not yet ready for application in real-world medical tasks. The codes and datasets are available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Despite the remarkable capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) face deployment challenges due to their extensive size. Pruning methods drop a subset of weights to accelerate, but many of them require retraining, which is prohibitively expensive and computationally demanding. Recently, post-training pruning approaches introduced novel metrics, enabling the pruning of LLMs without retraining. However, these metrics require the involvement of human experts and tedious trial and error. To efficiently identify superior pruning metrics, we develop an automatic framework for searching symbolic pruning metrics using genetic programming. In particular, we devise an elaborate search space encompassing the existing pruning metrics to discover the potential symbolic pruning metric. We propose an opposing operation simplification strategy to increase the diversity of the population. In this way, Pruner-Zero allows auto-generation of symbolic pruning metrics. Based on the searched results, we explore the correlation between pruning metrics and performance after pruning and summarize some principles. Extensive experiments on LLaMA and LLaMA-2 on language modeling and zero-shot tasks demonstrate that our Pruner-Zero obtains superior performance than SOTA post-training pruning methods.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) aims to enable classifiers to identify unseen classes by enhancing data efficiency at the class level. This is achieved by generating image features from pre-defined semantics of unseen classes. However, most current approaches heavily depend on the number of samples from seen classes, i.e. they do not consider instance-level effectiveness. In this paper, we demonstrate that limited seen examples generally result in deteriorated performance of generative models. To overcome these challenges, we propose ZeroDiff, a Diffusion-based Generative ZSL model. This unified framework incorporates diffusion models to improve data efficiency at both the class and instance levels. Specifically, for instance-level effectiveness, ZeroDiff utilizes a forward diffusion chain to transform limited data into an expanded set of noised data. For class-level effectiveness, we design a two-branch generation structure that consists of a Diffusion-based Feature Generator (DFG) and a Diffusion-based Representation Generator (DRG). DFG focuses on learning and sampling the distribution of cross-entropy-based features, whilst DRG learns the supervised contrastive-based representation to boost the zero-shot capabilities of DFG. Additionally, we employ three discriminators to evaluate generated features from various aspects and introduce a Wasserstein-distance-based mutual learning loss to transfer knowledge among discriminators, thereby enhancing guidance for generation. Demonstrated through extensive experiments on three popular ZSL benchmarks, our ZeroDiff not only achieves significant improvements over existing ZSL methods but also maintains robust performance even with scarce training data. Code will be released upon acceptance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, transformer, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Extracting building contours from remote sensing imagery is a significant challenge due to buildings' complex and diverse shapes, occlusions, and noise. Existing methods often struggle with irregular contours, rounded corners, and redundancy points, necessitating extensive post-processing to produce regular polygonal building contours. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel, streamlined pipeline that generates regular building contours without post-processing. Our approach begins with the segmentation of generic geometric primitives (which can include vertices, lines, and corners), followed by the prediction of their sequence. This allows for the direct construction of regular building contours by sequentially connecting the segmented primitives. Building on this pipeline, we developed P2PFormer, which utilizes a transformer-based architecture to segment geometric primitives and predict their order. To enhance the segmentation of primitives, we introduce a unique representation called group queries. This representation comprises a set of queries and a singular query position, which improve the focus on multiple midpoints of primitives and their efficient linkage. Furthermore, we propose an innovative implicit update strategy for the query position embedding aimed at sharpening the focus of queries on the correct positions and, consequently, enhancing the quality of primitive segmentation. Our experiments demonstrate that P2PFormer achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the WHU, CrowdAI, and WHU-Mix datasets, surpassing the previous SOTA PolyWorld by a margin of 2.7 AP and 6.5 AP75 on the largest CrowdAI dataset. We intend to make the code and trained weights publicly available to promote their use and facilitate further research.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, federate, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>On-device training is currently the most common approach for training machine learning (ML) models on private, distributed user data. Despite this, on-device training has several drawbacks: (1) most user devices are too small to train large models on-device, (2) on-device training is communication- and computation-intensive, and (3) on-device training can be difficult to debug and deploy. To address these problems, we propose Private Evolution-Text (PrE-Text), a method for generating differentially private (DP) synthetic textual data. First, we show that across multiple datasets, training small models (models that fit on user devices) with PrE-Text synthetic data outperforms small models trained on-device under practical privacy regimes ($\epsilon=1.29$, $\epsilon=7.58$). We achieve these results while using 9$\times$ fewer rounds, 6$\times$ less client computation per round, and 100$\times$ less communication per round. Second, finetuning large models on PrE-Text's DP synthetic data improves large language model (LLM) performance on private data across the same range of privacy budgets. Altogether, these results suggest that training on DP synthetic data can be a better option than training a model on-device on private distributed data. Code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Knowledge distillation (KD) has been shown to be highly effective in guiding a student model with a larger teacher model and achieving practical benefits in improving the computational and memory efficiency for large language models (LLMs). State-of-the-art KD methods for LLMs mostly rely on minimizing explicit distribution distance between teacher and student probability predictions. Instead of optimizing these mandatory behaviour cloning objectives, we explore an imitation learning strategy for KD of LLMs. In particular, we minimize the imitation gap by matching the action-value moments of the teacher's behavior from both on- and off-policy perspectives. To achieve this action-value moment-matching goal, we propose an adversarial training algorithm to jointly estimate the moment-matching distance and optimize the student policy to minimize it. Results from both task-agnostic instruction-following experiments and task-specific experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Even for a conservative estimate, 80% of enterprise data reside in unstructured files, stored in data lakes that accommodate heterogeneous formats. Classical search engines can no longer meet information seeking needs, especially when the task is to browse and explore for insight formulation. In other words, there are no obvious search keywords to use. Knowledge graphs, due to their natural visual appeals that reduce the human cognitive load, become the winning candidate for heterogeneous data integration and knowledge representation. In this paper, we introduce Docs2KG, a novel framework designed to extract multimodal information from diverse and heterogeneous unstructured documents, including emails, web pages, PDF files, and Excel files. Dynamically generates a unified knowledge graph that represents the extracted key information, Docs2KG enables efficient querying and exploration of document data lakes. Unlike existing approaches that focus on domain-specific data sources or pre-designed schemas, Docs2KG offers a flexible and extensible solution that can adapt to various document structures and content types. The proposed framework unifies data processing supporting a multitude of downstream tasks with improved domain interpretability.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The concept of negative prompts, emerging from conditional generation models like Stable Diffusion, allows users to specify what to exclude from the generated images.%, demonstrating significant practical efficacy. Despite the widespread use of negative prompts, their intrinsic mechanisms remain largely unexplored. This paper presents the first comprehensive study to uncover how and when negative prompts take effect. Our extensive empirical analysis identifies two primary behaviors of negative prompts. Delayed Effect: The impact of negative prompts is observed after positive prompts render corresponding content. Deletion Through Neutralization: Negative prompts delete concepts from the generated image through a mutual cancellation effect in latent space with positive prompts. These insights reveal significant potential real-world applications; for example, we demonstrate that negative prompts can facilitate object inpainting with minimal alterations to the background via a simple adaptive algorithm. We believe our findings will offer valuable insights for the community in capitalizing on the potential of negative prompts.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Most advances in 3D Generative Adversarial Networks (3D GANs) largely depend on ray casting-based volume rendering, which incurs demanding rendering costs. One promising alternative is rasterization-based 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS), providing a much faster rendering speed and explicit 3D representation. In this paper, we exploit Gaussian as a 3D representation for 3D GANs by leveraging its efficient and explicit characteristics. However, in an adversarial framework, we observe that a naïve generator architecture suffers from training instability and lacks the capability to adjust the scale of Gaussians. This leads to model divergence and visual artifacts due to the absence of proper guidance for initialized positions of Gaussians and densification to manage their scales adaptively. To address these issues, we introduce a generator architecture with a hierarchical multi-scale Gaussian representation that effectively regularizes the position and scale of generated Gaussians. Specifically, we design a hierarchy of Gaussians where finer-level Gaussians are parameterized by their coarser-level counterparts; the position of finer-level Gaussians would be located near their coarser-level counterparts, and the scale would monotonically decrease as the level becomes finer, modeling both coarse and fine details of the 3D scene. Experimental results demonstrate that ours achieves a significantly faster rendering speed (x100) compared to state-of-the-art 3D consistent GANs with comparable 3D generation capability.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose MoE-F -- a formalised mechanism for combining $N$ pre-trained expert Large Language Models (LLMs) in online time-series prediction tasks by adaptively forecasting the best weighting of LLM predictions at every time step. Our mechanism leverages the conditional information in each expert's running performance to forecast the best combination of LLMs for predicting the time series in its next step. Diverging from static (learned) Mixture of Experts (MoE) methods, MoE-F employs time-adaptive stochastic filtering techniques to combine experts. By framing the expert selection problem as a finite state-space, continuous-time Hidden Markov model (HMM), we can leverage the Wohman-Shiryaev filter. Our approach first constructs $N$ parallel filters corresponding to each of the $N$ individual LLMs. Each filter proposes its best combination of LLMs, given the information that they have access to. Subsequently, the $N$ filter outputs are aggregated to optimize a lower bound for the loss of the aggregated LLMs, which can be optimized in closed-form, thus generating our ensemble predictor. Our contributions here are: (I) the MoE-F algorithm -- deployable as a plug-and-play filtering harness, (II) theoretical optimality guarantees of the proposed filtering-based gating algorithm, and (III) empirical evaluation and ablative results using state of the art foundational and MoE LLMs on a real-world Financial Market Movement task where MoE-F attains a remarkable 17% absolute and 48.5% relative F1 measure improvement over the next best performing individual LLM expert.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Cooperation between temporal convolutional networks (TCN) and graph convolutional networks (GCN) as a processing module has shown promising results in skeleton-based video anomaly detection (SVAD). However, to maintain a lightweight model with low computational and storage complexity, shallow GCN and TCN blocks are constrained by small receptive fields and a lack of cross-dimension interaction capture. To tackle this limitation, we propose a lightweight module called the Dual Attention Module (DAM) for capturing cross-dimension interaction relationships in spatio-temporal skeletal data. It employs the frame attention mechanism to identify the most significant frames and the skeleton attention mechanism to capture broader relationships across fixed partitions with minimal parameters and flops. Furthermore, the proposed Dual Attention Normalizing Flow (DA-Flow) integrates the DAM as a post-processing unit after GCN within the normalizing flow framework. Simulations show that the proposed model is robust against noise and negative samples. Experimental results show that DA-Flow reaches competitive or better performance than the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in terms of the micro AUC metric with the fewest number of parameters. Moreover, we found that even without training, simply using random projection without dimensionality reduction on skeleton data enables substantial anomaly detection capabilities.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Self-supervised learning (SSL), which aims to learn meaningful prior representations from unlabeled data, has been proven effective for label-efficient skeleton-based action understanding. Different from the image domain, skeleton data possesses sparser spatial structures and diverse representation forms, with the absence of background clues and the additional temporal dimension. This presents the new challenges for the pretext task design of spatial-temporal motion representation learning. Recently, many endeavors have been made for skeleton-based SSL and remarkable progress has been achieved. However, a systematic and thorough review is still lacking. In this paper, we conduct, for the first time, a comprehensive survey on self-supervised skeleton-based action representation learning, where various literature is organized according to their pre-training pretext task methodologies. Following the taxonomy of context-based, generative learning, and contrastive learning approaches, we make a thorough review and benchmark of existing works and shed light on the future possible directions. Our investigation demonstrates that most SSL works rely on the single paradigm, learning representations of a single level, and are evaluated on the action recognition task solely, which leaves the generalization power of skeleton SSL models under-explored. To this end, a novel and effective SSL method for skeleton is further proposed, which integrates multiple pretext tasks to jointly learn versatile representations of different granularity, substantially boosting the generalization capacity for different downstream tasks. Extensive experiments under three large-scale datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the superior generalization performance on various downstream tasks, including recognition, retrieval, detection, and few-shot learning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Additive models can be used for interpretable machine learning for their clarity and simplicity. However, In the classical models for high-order data, the vectorization operation disrupts the data structure, which may lead to degenerated accuracy and increased computational complexity. To deal with these problems, we propose the tensor polynomial addition model (TPAM). It retains the multidimensional structure information of high-order inputs with tensor representation. The model parameter compression is achieved using a hierarchical and low-order symmetric tensor approximation. In this way, complex high-order feature interactions can be captured with fewer parameters. Moreover, The TPAM preserves the inherent interpretability of additive models, facilitating transparent decision-making and the extraction of meaningful feature values. Additionally, leveraging TPAM's transparency and ability to handle higher-order features, it is used as a post-processing module for other interpretation models by introducing two variants for class activation maps. Experimental results on a series of datasets demonstrate that TPAM can enhance accuracy by up to 30\%, and compression rate by up to 5 times, while maintaining a good interpretability.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability, explainability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The local and global interpretability of various ML models has been studied extensively in recent years. However, despite significant progress in the field, many known results remain informal or lack sufficient mathematical rigor. We propose a framework for bridging this gap, by using computational complexity theory to assess local and global perspectives of interpreting ML models. We begin by proposing proofs for two novel insights that are essential for our analysis: (1) a duality between local and global forms of explanations; and (2) the inherent uniqueness of certain global explanation forms. We then use these insights to evaluate the complexity of computing explanations, across three model types representing the extremes of the interpretability spectrum: (1) linear models; (2) decision trees; and (3) neural networks. Our findings offer insights into both the local and global interpretability of these models. For instance, under standard complexity assumptions such as P != NP, we prove that selecting global sufficient subsets in linear models is computationally harder than selecting local subsets. Interestingly, with neural networks and decision trees, the opposite is true: it is harder to carry out this task locally than globally. We believe that our findings demonstrate how examining explainability through a computational complexity lens can help us develop a more rigorous grasp of the inherent interpretability of ML models.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved SOTA performance in various visual language tasks by fusing the visual representations with LLMs leveraging some visual adapters. In this paper, we first establish that adapters using query-based Transformers such as Q-former is a simplified Multi-instance Learning method without considering instance heterogeneity/correlation. We then propose a general component termed Multi-instance Visual Prompt Generator (MIVPG) to incorporate enriched visual representations into LLMs by taking advantage of instance correlation between images or patches for the same sample. Quantatitive evaluation on three public vision-language (VL) datasets from different scenarios shows that the proposed MIVPG improves Q-former in main VL tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Predicting genetic mutations from whole slide images is indispensable for cancer diagnosis. However, existing work training multiple binary classification models faces two challenges: (a) Training multiple binary classifiers is inefficient and would inevitably lead to a class imbalance problem. (b) The biological relationships among genes are overlooked, which limits the prediction performance. To tackle these challenges, we innovatively design a Biological-knowledge enhanced PathGenomic multi-label Transformer to improve genetic mutation prediction performances. BPGT first establishes a novel gene encoder that constructs gene priors by two carefully designed modules: (a) A gene graph whose node features are the genes' linguistic descriptions and the cancer phenotype, with edges modeled by genes' pathway associations and mutation consistencies. (b) A knowledge association module that fuses linguistic and biomedical knowledge into gene priors by transformer-based graph representation learning, capturing the intrinsic relationships between different genes' mutations. BPGT then designs a label decoder that finally performs genetic mutation prediction by two tailored modules: (a) A modality fusion module that firstly fuses the gene priors with critical regions in WSIs and obtains gene-wise mutation logits. (b) A comparative multi-label loss that emphasizes the inherent comparisons among mutation status to enhance the discrimination capabilities. Sufficient experiments on The Cancer Genome Atlas benchmark demonstrate that BPGT outperforms the state-of-the-art.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Emotion semantic inconsistency is an ubiquitous challenge in multi-modal sentiment analysis (MSA). MSA involves analyzing sentiment expressed across various modalities like text, audio, and videos. Each modality may convey distinct aspects of sentiment, due to subtle and nuanced expression of human beings, leading to inconsistency, which may hinder the prediction of artificial agents. In this work, we introduce a modality conflicting test set and assess the performance of both traditional multi-modal sentiment analysis models and multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). Our findings reveal significant performance degradation across traditional models when confronted with semantically conflicting data and point out the drawbacks of MLLMs when handling multi-modal emotion analysis. Our research presents a new challenge and offer valuable insights for the future development of sentiment analysis systems.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the prosperity of large language models (LLMs), powerful LLM-based intelligent agents have been developed to provide customized services with a set of user-defined tools. State-of-the-art methods for constructing LLM agents adopt trained LLMs and further fine-tune them on data for the agent task. However, we show that such methods are vulnerable to our proposed backdoor attacks named BadAgent on various agent tasks, where a backdoor can be embedded by fine-tuning on the backdoor data. At test time, the attacker can manipulate the deployed LLM agents to execute harmful operations by showing the trigger in the agent input or environment. To our surprise, our proposed attack methods are extremely robust even after fine-tuning on trustworthy data. Though backdoor attacks have been studied extensively in natural language processing, to the best of our knowledge, we could be the first to study them on LLM agents that are more dangerous due to the permission to use external tools. Our work demonstrates the clear risk of constructing LLM agents based on untrusted LLMs or data. Our code is public at this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we investigate the phenomena of "selection biases" in Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing on problems where models are tasked with choosing the optimal option from an ordered sequence. We delve into biases related to option order and token usage, which significantly impact LLMs' decision-making processes. We also quantify the impact of these biases through an extensive empirical analysis across multiple models and tasks. Furthermore, we propose mitigation strategies to enhance model performance. Our key contributions are threefold: 1) Precisely quantifying the influence of option order and token on LLMs, 2) Developing strategies to mitigate the impact of token and order sensitivity to enhance robustness, and 3) Offering a detailed analysis of sensitivity across models and tasks, which informs the creation of more stable and reliable LLM applications for selection problems.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>EXplainable AI (XAI) constitutes a popular method to analyze the reasoning of AI systems by explaining their decision-making, e.g. providing a counterfactual explanation of how to achieve recourse. However, in cases such as unexpected explanations, the user might be interested in learning about the cause of this explanation -- e.g. properties of the utilized training data that are responsible for the observed explanation. Under the umbrella of data valuation, first approaches have been proposed that estimate the influence of data samples on a given model. In this work, we take a slightly different stance, as we are interested in the influence of single samples on a model explanation rather than the model itself. Hence, we propose the novel problem of identifying training data samples that have a high influence on a given explanation (or related quantity) and investigate the particular case of differences in the cost of the recourse between protected groups. For this, we propose an algorithm that identifies such influential training samples.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This work investigates efficient score-based black-box adversarial attacks with a high Attack Success Rate (ASR) and good generalizability. We design a novel attack method based on a \textit{Hierarchical} \textbf{Di}sentangled \textbf{F}eature space and \textit{cross domain}, called \textbf{DifAttack++}, which differs significantly from the existing ones operating over the entire feature space. Specifically, DifAttack++ firstly disentangles an image's latent feature into an \textit{adversarial feature} (AF) and a \textit{visual feature} (VF) via an autoencoder equipped with our specially designed \textbf{H}ierarchical \textbf{D}ecouple-\textbf{F}usion (HDF) module, where the AF dominates the adversarial capability of an image, while the VF largely determines its visual appearance. We train such autoencoders for the clean and adversarial image domains respectively, meanwhile realizing feature disentanglement, by using pairs of clean images and their Adversarial Examples (AEs) generated from available surrogate models via white-box attack methods. Eventually, in the black-box attack stage, DifAttack++ iteratively optimizes the AF according to the query feedback from the victim model until a successful AE is generated, while keeping the VF unaltered. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior ASR and query efficiency than SOTA methods, meanwhile exhibiting much better visual quality of AEs.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Oracle Bone Inscriptions is one of the oldest existing forms of writing in the world. However, due to the great antiquity of the era, a large number of Oracle Bone Inscriptions (OBI) remain undeciphered, making it one of the global challenges in the field of paleography today. This paper introduces a novel approach, namely Puzzle Pieces Picker (P$^3$), to decipher these enigmatic characters through radical reconstruction. We deconstruct OBI into foundational strokes and radicals, then employ a Transformer model to reconstruct them into their modern (conterpart)\textcolor{blue}{counterparts}, offering a groundbreaking solution to ancient script analysis. To further this endeavor, a new Ancient Chinese Character Puzzles (ACCP) dataset was developed, comprising an extensive collection of character images from seven key historical stages, annotated with detailed radical sequences. The experiments have showcased considerable promising insights, underscoring the potential and effectiveness of our approach in deciphering the intricacies of ancient Chinese scripts. Through this novel dataset and methodology, we aim to bridge the gap between traditional philology and modern document analysis techniques, offering new insights into the rich history of Chinese linguistic heritage.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We study the problem of controlling the difficulty level of text generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) for contexts where end-users are not fully proficient, such as language learners. Using a novel framework, we evaluate the effectiveness of several key approaches for this task, including few-shot prompting, supervised finetuning, and reinforcement learning (RL), utilising both GPT-4 and open source alternatives like LLama2-7B and Mistral-7B. Our findings reveal a large performance gap between GPT-4 and the open source models when using prompt-based strategies. However, we show how to bridge this gap with a careful combination of finetuning and RL alignment. Our best model, CALM (CEFR-Aligned Language Model), surpasses the performance of GPT-4 and other strategies, at only a fraction of the cost. We further validate the quality of our results through a small-scale human study.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Pose-controllable character video generation is in high demand with extensive applications for fields such as automatic advertising and content creation on social media platforms. While existing character image animation methods using pose sequences and reference images have shown promising performance, they tend to struggle with incoherent animation in complex scenarios, such as multiple character animation and body occlusion. Additionally, current methods request large-scale high-quality videos with stable backgrounds and temporal consistency as training datasets, otherwise, their performance will greatly deteriorate. These two issues hinder the practical utilization of character image animation tools. In this paper, we propose a practical and robust framework Follow-Your-Pose v2, which can be trained on noisy open-sourced videos readily available on the internet. Multi-condition guiders are designed to address the challenges of background stability, body occlusion in multi-character generation, and consistency of character appearance. Moreover, to fill the gap of fair evaluation of multi-character pose animation, we propose a new benchmark comprising approximately 4,000 frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a margin of over 35\% across 2 datasets and on 7 metrics. Meanwhile, qualitative assessments reveal a significant improvement in the quality of generated video, particularly in scenarios involving complex backgrounds and body occlusion of multi-character, suggesting the superiority of our approach.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present a self-supervised framework that learns population-level codes for intracranial neural recordings at scale, unlocking the benefits of representation learning for a key neuroscience recording modality. The Population Transformer (PopT) lowers the amount of data required for decoding experiments, while increasing accuracy, even on never-before-seen subjects and tasks. We address two key challenges in developing PopT: sparse electrode distribution and varying electrode location across patients. PopT stacks on top of pretrained representations and enhances downstream tasks by enabling learned aggregation of multiple spatially-sparse data channels. Beyond decoding, we interpret the pretrained PopT and fine-tuned models to show how it can be used to provide neuroscience insights learned from massive amounts of data. We release a pretrained PopT to enable off-the-shelf improvements in multi-channel intracranial data decoding and interpretability, and code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has become increasingly important as foundation models continue to grow in both popularity and size. Adapter has been particularly well-received due to their potential for parameter reduction and adaptability across diverse tasks. However, striking a balance between high efficiency and robust generalization across tasks remains a challenge for adapter-based methods. We analyze existing methods and find that: 1) parameter sharing is the key to reducing redundancy; 2) more tunable parameters, dynamic allocation, and block-specific design are keys to improving performance. Unfortunately, no previous work considers all these factors. Inspired by this insight, we introduce a novel framework named Adapter-X. First, a Sharing Mixture of Adapters (SMoA) module is proposed to fulfill token-level dynamic allocation, increased tunable parameters, and inter-block sharing at the same time. Second, some block-specific designs like Prompt Generator (PG) are introduced to further enhance the ability of adaptation. Extensive experiments across 2D image and 3D point cloud modalities demonstrate that Adapter-X represents a significant milestone as it is the first to outperform full fine-tuning in both 2D image and 3D point cloud modalities with significantly fewer parameters, i.e., only 0.20% and 1.88% of original trainable parameters for 2D and 3D classification tasks.

          Are Your Models Still Fair? Fairness Attacks on Graph Neural Networks via Node Injections(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>defense, attack, fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Despite the remarkable capabilities demonstrated by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in graph-related tasks, recent research has revealed the fairness vulnerabilities in GNNs when facing malicious adversarial attacks. However, all existing fairness attacks require manipulating the connectivity between existing nodes, which may be prohibited in reality. To this end, we introduce a Node Injection-based Fairness Attack (NIFA), exploring the vulnerabilities of GNN fairness in such a more realistic setting. In detail, NIFA first designs two insightful principles for node injection operations, namely the uncertainty-maximization principle and homophily-increase principle, and then optimizes injected nodes' feature matrix to further ensure the effectiveness of fairness attacks. Comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets consistently demonstrate that NIFA can significantly undermine the fairness of mainstream GNNs, even including fairness-aware GNNs, by injecting merely 1% of nodes. We sincerely hope that our work can stimulate increasing attention from researchers on the vulnerability of GNN fairness, and encourage the development of corresponding defense mechanisms.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Radiology report summarization is a crucial task that can help doctors quickly identify clinically significant findings without the need to review detailed sections of reports. This study proposes RadBARTsum, a domain-specific and ontology facilitated adaptation of the BART model for abstractive radiology report summarization. The approach involves two main steps: 1) re-training the BART model on a large corpus of radiology reports using a novel entity masking strategy to improving biomedical domain knowledge learning, and 2) fine-tuning the model for the summarization task using the Findings and Background sections to predict the Impression section. Experiments are conducted using different masking strategies. Results show that the re-training process with domain knowledge facilitated masking improves performances consistently across various settings. This work contributes a domain-specific generative language model for radiology report summarization and a method for utilising medical knowledge to realise entity masking language model. The proposed approach demonstrates a promising direction of enhancing the efficiency of language models by deepening its understanding of clinical knowledge in radiology reports.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Cognitive Diagnosis~(CD), which leverages students and exercise data to predict students' proficiency levels on different knowledge concepts, is one of fundamental components in Intelligent Education. Due to the scarcity of student-exercise interaction data, most existing methods focus on making the best use of available data, such as exercise content and student information~(e.g., educational context). Despite the great progress, the abuse of student sensitive information has not been paid enough attention. Due to the important position of CD in Intelligent Education, employing sensitive information when making diagnosis predictions will cause serious social issues. Moreover, data-driven neural networks are easily misled by the shortcut between input data and output prediction, exacerbating this problem. Therefore, it is crucial to eliminate the negative impact of sensitive information in CD models. In response, we argue that sensitive attributes of students can also provide useful information, and only the shortcuts directly related to the sensitive information should be eliminated from the diagnosis process. Thus, we employ causal reasoning and design a novel Path-Specific Causal Reasoning Framework (PSCRF) to achieve this goal. Specifically, we first leverage an encoder to extract features and generate embeddings for general information and sensitive information of students. Then, we design a novel attribute-oriented predictor to decouple the sensitive attributes, in which fairness-related sensitive features will be eliminated and other useful information will be retained. Finally, we designed a multi-factor constraint to ensure the performance of fairness and diagnosis performance simultaneously. Extensive experiments over real-world datasets (e.g., PISA dataset) demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed PSCRF.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In addition to the ability to generate fluent text in various languages, large language models have been successful at tasks that involve basic forms of logical "reasoning" over their context. Recent work found that selectively removing certain components from weight matrices in pre-trained models can improve such reasoning capabilities. We investigate this phenomenon further by carefully studying how certain global associations tend to be stored in specific weight components or Transformer blocks, in particular feed-forward layers. Such associations may hurt predictions in reasoning tasks, and removing the corresponding components may then improve performance. We analyze how this arises during training, both empirically and theoretically, on a two-layer Transformer trained on a basic reasoning task with noise, a toy associative memory model, and on the Pythia family of pre-trained models tested on simple reasoning tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>How to accurately and efficiently assess AI-generated images (AIGIs) remains a critical challenge for generative models. Given the high costs and extensive time commitments required for user studies, many researchers have turned towards employing large multi-modal models (LMMs) as AIGI evaluators, the precision and validity of which are still questionable. Furthermore, traditional benchmarks often utilize mostly natural-captured content rather than AIGIs to test the abilities of LMMs, leading to a noticeable gap for AIGIs. Therefore, we introduce A-Bench in this paper, a benchmark designed to diagnose whether LMMs are masters at evaluating AIGIs. Specifically, A-Bench is organized under two key principles: 1) Emphasizing both high-level semantic understanding and low-level visual quality perception to address the intricate demands of AIGIs. 2) Various generative models are utilized for AIGI creation, and various LMMs are employed for evaluation, which ensures a comprehensive validation scope. Ultimately, 2,864 AIGIs from 16 text-to-image models are sampled, each paired with question-answers annotated by human experts, and tested across 18 leading LMMs. We hope that A-Bench will significantly enhance the evaluation process and promote the generation quality for AIGIs.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In recent years, transformer-based models have revolutionized deep learning, particularly in sequence modeling. To better understand this phenomenon, there is a growing interest in using Markov input processes to study transformers. However, our current understanding in this regard remains limited with many fundamental questions about how transformers learn Markov chains still unanswered. In this paper, we address this by focusing on first-order Markov chains and single-layer transformers, providing a comprehensive characterization of the learning dynamics in this context. Specifically, we prove that transformer parameters trained on next-token prediction loss can either converge to global or local minima, contingent on the initialization and the Markovian data properties, and we characterize the precise conditions under which this occurs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result of its kind highlighting the role of initialization. We further demonstrate that our theoretical findings are corroborated by empirical evidence. Based on these insights, we provide guidelines for the initialization of transformer parameters and demonstrate their effectiveness. Finally, we outline several open problems in this arena.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The advent of large language models (LLMs) has facilitated the development of natural language text generation. It also poses unprecedented challenges, with content hallucination emerging as a significant concern. Existing solutions often involve expensive and complex interventions during the training process. Moreover, some approaches emphasize problem disassembly while neglecting the crucial validation process, leading to performance degradation or limited applications. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Markov Chain-based multi-agent debate verification framework to enhance hallucination detection accuracy in concise claims. Our method integrates the fact-checking process, including claim detection, evidence retrieval, and multi-agent verification. In the verification stage, we deploy multiple agents through flexible Markov Chain-based debates to validate individual claims, ensuring meticulous verification outcomes. Experimental results across three generative tasks demonstrate that our approach achieves significant improvements over baselines.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated Learning (FL) has evolved as a powerful tool for collaborative model training across multiple entities, ensuring data privacy in sensitive sectors such as healthcare and finance. However, the introduction of the Right to Be Forgotten (RTBF) poses new challenges, necessitating federated unlearning to delete data without full model retraining. Traditional FL unlearning methods, not originally designed with domain specificity in mind, inadequately address the complexities of multi-domain scenarios, often affecting the accuracy of models in non-targeted domains or leading to uniform forgetting across all domains. Our work presents the first comprehensive empirical study on Federated Domain Unlearning, analyzing the characteristics and challenges of current techniques in multi-domain contexts. We uncover that these methods falter, particularly because they neglect the nuanced influences of domain-specific data, which can lead to significant performance degradation and inaccurate model behavior. Our findings reveal that unlearning disproportionately affects the model's deeper layers, erasing critical representational subspaces acquired during earlier training phases. In response, we propose novel evaluation methodologies tailored for Federated Domain Unlearning, aiming to accurately assess and verify domain-specific data erasure without compromising the model's overall integrity and performance. This investigation not only highlights the urgent need for domain-centric unlearning strategies in FL but also sets a new precedent for evaluating and implementing these techniques effectively.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in the field of large language models (LLMs), particularly the ChatGPT family, have given rise to a powerful and versatile machine interlocutor, packed with knowledge and challenging our understanding of learning. This interlocutor is a double-edged sword: it can be harnessed for a wide variety of beneficial tasks, but it can also be used to cause harm. This study explores the complicated interaction between ChatGPT and the growing problem of cryptocurrency fraud. Although ChatGPT is known for its adaptability and ethical considerations when used for harmful purposes, we highlight the deep connection that may exist between ChatGPT and fraudulent actions in the volatile cryptocurrency ecosystem. Based on our categorization of cryptocurrency frauds, we show how to influence outputs, bypass ethical terms, and achieve specific fraud goals by manipulating ChatGPT prompts. Furthermore, our findings emphasize the importance of realizing that ChatGPT could be a valuable instructor even for novice fraudsters, as well as understanding and safely deploying complex language models, particularly in the context of cryptocurrency frauds. Finally, our study underlines the importance of using LLMs responsibly and ethically in the digital currency sector, identifying potential risks and resolving ethical issues. It should be noted that our work is not intended to encourage and promote fraud, but rather to raise awareness of the risks of fraud associated with the use of ChatGPT.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) aims to mine and transfer users' sequential preferences across different domains to alleviate the long-standing cold-start issue. Traditional CDSR models capture collaborative information through user and item modeling while overlooking valuable semantic information. Recently, Large Language Model (LLM) has demonstrated powerful semantic reasoning capabilities, motivating us to introduce them to better capture semantic information. However, introducing LLMs to CDSR is non-trivial due to two crucial issues: seamless information integration and domain-specific generation. To this end, we propose a novel framework named URLLM, which aims to improve the CDSR performance by exploring the User Retrieval approach and domain grounding on LLM simultaneously. Specifically, we first present a novel dual-graph sequential model to capture the diverse information, along with an alignment and contrastive learning method to facilitate domain knowledge transfer. Subsequently, a user retrieve-generation model is adopted to seamlessly integrate the structural information into LLM, fully harnessing its emergent inferencing ability. Furthermore, we propose a domain-specific strategy and a refinement module to prevent out-of-domain generation. Extensive experiments on Amazon demonstrated the information integration and domain-specific generation ability of URLLM in comparison to state-of-the-art baselines.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>To process contexts with unlimited length using Large Language Models (LLMs), recent studies explore hierarchically managing the long text. Only several text fragments are taken from the external memory and passed into the temporary working memory, i.e., LLM's context window. However, existing approaches isolatedly handle the text fragments without considering their structural connections, thereby suffering limited capability on texts with intensive inter-relations, e.g., coherent stories and code repositories. This work attempts to resolve this by exploiting the fragment-level relations in external memory. First, we formulate the fragment-level relations and present several instantiations for different text types. Next, we introduce a relation-aware fragment assessment criteria upon previous independent fragment assessment. Finally, we present the fragment-connected Hierarchical Memory based LLM. We validate the benefits of involving these relations on long story understanding, repository-level code generation, and long-term chatting.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been extensively employed in node classification. Nevertheless, recent studies indicate that GNNs are vulnerable to topological perturbations, such as adversarial attacks and edge disruptions. Considerable efforts have been devoted to mitigating these challenges. For example, pioneering Bayesian methodologies, including GraphSS and LlnDT, incorporate Bayesian label transitions and topology-based label sampling to strengthen the robustness of GNNs. However, GraphSS is hindered by slow convergence, while LlnDT faces challenges in sparse graphs. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel label inference framework, TraTopo, which combines topology-driven label propagation, Bayesian label transitions, and link analysis via random walks. TraTopo significantly surpasses its predecessors on sparse graphs by utilizing random walk sampling, specifically targeting isolated nodes for link prediction, thus enhancing its effectiveness in topological sampling contexts. Additionally, TraTopo employs a shortest-path strategy to refine link prediction, thereby reducing predictive overhead and improving label inference accuracy. Empirical evaluations highlight TraTopo's superiority in node classification, significantly exceeding contemporary GCN models in accuracy.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Classic reinforcement learning (RL) frequently confronts challenges in tasks involving delays, which cause a mismatch between received observations and subsequent actions, thereby deviating from the Markov assumption. Existing methods usually tackle this issue with end-to-end solutions using state augmentation. However, these black-box approaches often involve incomprehensible processes and redundant information in the information states, causing instability and potentially undermining the overall performance. To alleviate the delay challenges in RL, we propose $\textbf{DEER (Delay-resilient Encoder-Enhanced RL)}$, a framework designed to effectively enhance the interpretability and address the random delay issues. DEER employs a pretrained encoder to map delayed states, along with their variable-length past action sequences resulting from different delays, into hidden states, which is trained on delay-free environment datasets. In a variety of delayed scenarios, the trained encoder can seamlessly integrate with standard RL algorithms without requiring additional modifications and enhance the delay-solving capability by simply adapting the input dimension of the original algorithms. We evaluate DEER through extensive experiments on Gym and Mujoco environments. The results confirm that DEER is superior to state-of-the-art RL algorithms in both constant and random delay settings.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>3D lane detection and topology reasoning are essential tasks in autonomous driving scenarios, requiring not only detecting the accurate 3D coordinates on lane lines, but also reasoning the relationship between lanes and traffic elements. Current vision-based methods, whether explicitly constructing BEV features or not, all establish the lane anchors/queries in 3D space while ignoring the 2D lane priors. In this study, we propose Topo2D, a novel framework based on Transformer, leveraging 2D lane instances to initialize 3D queries and 3D positional embeddings. Furthermore, we explicitly incorporate 2D lane features into the recognition of topology relationships among lane centerlines and between lane centerlines and traffic elements. Topo2D achieves 44.5% OLS on multi-view topology reasoning benchmark OpenLane-V2 and 62.6% F-Socre on single-view 3D lane detection benchmark OpenLane, exceeding the performance of existing state-of-the-art methods.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have become a promising paradigm when developing Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) applications. However, DNN applications are vulnerable to fake data that are crafted with adversarial attack algorithms. Under adversarial attacks, the prediction accuracy of DNN applications suffers, making them unreliable. In order to defend against adversarial attacks, we introduce a novel noise-reduction procedure, Vector Quantization U-Net (VQUNet), to reduce adversarial noise and reconstruct data with high fidelity. VQUNet features a discrete latent representation learning through a multi-scale hierarchical structure for both noise reduction and data reconstruction. The empirical experiments show that the proposed VQUNet provides better robustness to the target DNN models, and it outperforms other state-of-the-art noise-reduction-based defense methods under various adversarial attacks for both Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets. When there is no adversarial attack, the defense method has less than 1% accuracy degradation for both datasets.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>New Intent Discovery (NID) aims at detecting known and previously undefined categories of user intent by utilizing limited labeled and massive unlabeled data. Most prior works often operate under the unrealistic assumption that the distribution of both familiar and new intent classes is uniform, overlooking the skewed and long-tailed distributions frequently encountered in real-world scenarios. To bridge the gap, our work introduces the imbalanced new intent discovery (i-NID) task, which seeks to identify familiar and novel intent categories within long-tailed distributions. A new benchmark (ImbaNID-Bench) comprised of three datasets is created to simulate the real-world long-tail distributions. ImbaNID-Bench ranges from broad cross-domain to specific single-domain intent categories, providing a thorough representation of practical use cases. Besides, a robust baseline model ImbaNID is proposed to achieve cluster-friendly intent representations. It includes three stages: model pre-training, generation of reliable pseudo-labels, and robust representation learning that strengthens the model performance to handle the intricacies of real-world data distributions. Our extensive experiments on previous benchmarks and the newly established benchmark demonstrate the superior performance of ImbaNID in addressing the i-NID task, highlighting its potential as a powerful baseline for uncovering and categorizing user intents in imbalanced and long-tailed distributions\footnote{\url{this https URL}}.</li>

          Enhanced Automotive Object Detection via RGB-D Fusion in a DiffusionDet Framework(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vision-based autonomous driving requires reliable and efficient object detection. This work proposes a DiffusionDet-based framework that exploits data fusion from the monocular camera and depth sensor to provide the RGB and depth (RGB-D) data. Within this framework, ground truth bounding boxes are randomly reshaped as part of the training phase, allowing the model to learn the reverse diffusion process of noise addition. The system methodically enhances a randomly generated set of boxes at the inference stage, guiding them toward accurate final detections. By integrating the textural and color features from RGB images with the spatial depth information from the LiDAR sensors, the proposed framework employs a feature fusion that substantially enhances object detection of automotive targets. The $2.3$ AP gain in detecting automotive targets is achieved through comprehensive experiments using the KITTI dataset. Specifically, the improved performance of the proposed approach in detecting small objects is demonstrated.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Availability is a major concern in the design of DNSSEC. To ensure availability, DNSSEC follows Postel's Law [RFC1123]: "Be liberal in what you accept, and conservative in what you send." Hence, nameservers should send not just one matching key for a record set, but all the relevant cryptographic material, e.g., all the keys for all the ciphers that they support and all the corresponding signatures. This ensures that validation succeeds, and hence availability, even if some of the DNSSEC keys are misconfigured, incorrect or correspond to unsupported ciphers. We show that this design of DNSSEC is flawed. Exploiting vulnerable recommendations in the DNSSEC standards, we develop a new class of DNSSEC-based algorithmic complexity attacks on DNS, we dub KeyTrap attacks. All popular DNS implementations and services are vulnerable. With just a single DNS packet, the KeyTrap attacks lead to a 2.000.000x spike in CPU instruction count in vulnerable DNS resolvers, stalling some for as long as 16 hours. This devastating effect prompted major DNS vendors to refer to KeyTrap as the worst attack on DNS ever discovered. Exploiting KeyTrap, an attacker could effectively disable Internet access in any system utilizing a DNSSEC-validating resolver. We disclosed KeyTrap to vendors and operators on November 2, 2023, confidentially reporting the vulnerabilities to a closed group of DNS experts, operators and developers from the industry. Since then we have been working with all major vendors to mitigate KeyTrap, repeatedly discovering and assisting in closing weaknesses in proposed patches. Following our disclosure, the industry-wide umbrella CVE-2023-50387 has been assigned, covering the DNSSEC protocol vulnerabilities we present in this work.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We study the computational limits of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) update for finetuning transformer-based models using fine-grained complexity theory. Our key observation is that the existence of low-rank decompositions within the gradient computation of LoRA adaptation leads to possible algorithmic speedup. This allows us to (i) identify a phase transition behavior and (ii) prove the existence of nearly linear algorithms by controlling the LoRA update computation term by term, assuming the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH). For the former, we identify a sharp transition in the efficiency of all possible rank-$r$ LoRA update algorithms for transformers, based on specific norms resulting from the multiplications of the input sequence $\mathbf{X}$, pretrained weights $\mathbf{W^\star}$, and adapter matrices $\alpha \mathbf{B} \mathbf{A} / r$. Specifically, we derive a shared upper bound threshold for such norms and show that efficient (sub-quadratic) approximation algorithms of LoRA exist only below this threshold. For the latter, we prove the existence of nearly linear approximation algorithms for LoRA adaptation by utilizing the hierarchical low-rank structures of LoRA gradients and approximating the gradients with a series of chained low-rank approximations. To showcase our theory, we consider two practical scenarios: partial (e.g., only $\mathbf{W}_V$ and $\mathbf{W}_Q$) and full adaptations (e.g., $\mathbf{W}_Q$, $\mathbf{W}_V$, and $\mathbf{W}_K$) of weights in attention heads.</li>

          On the Power of Randomization in Fair Classification and Representation(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Fair classification and fair representation learning are two important problems in supervised and unsupervised fair machine learning, respectively. Fair classification asks for a classifier that maximizes accuracy on a given data distribution subject to fairness constraints. Fair representation maps a given data distribution over the original feature space to a distribution over a new representation space such that all classifiers over the representation satisfy fairness. In this paper, we examine the power of randomization in both these problems to minimize the loss of accuracy that results when we impose fairness constraints. Previous work on fair classification has characterized the optimal fair classifiers on a given data distribution that maximize accuracy subject to fairness constraints, e.g., Demographic Parity (DP), Equal Opportunity (EO), and Predictive Equality (PE). We refine these characterizations to demonstrate when the optimal randomized fair classifiers can surpass their deterministic counterparts in accuracy. We also show how the optimal randomized fair classifier that we characterize can be obtained as a solution to a convex optimization problem. Recent work has provided techniques to construct fair representations for a given data distribution such that any classifier over this representation satisfies DP. However, the classifiers on these fair representations either come with no or weak accuracy guarantees when compared to the optimal fair classifier on the original data distribution. Extending our ideas for randomized fair classification, we improve on these works, and construct DP-fair, EO-fair, and PE-fair representations that have provably optimal accuracy and suffer no accuracy loss compared to the optimal DP-fair, EO-fair, and PE-fair classifiers respectively on the original data distribution.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>defense, attack, robust, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Adversarial purification is a kind of defense technique that can defend various unseen adversarial attacks without modifying the victim classifier. Existing methods often depend on external generative models or cooperation between auxiliary functions and victim classifiers. However, retraining generative models, auxiliary functions, or victim classifiers relies on the domain of the fine-tuned dataset and is computation-consuming. In this work, we suppose that adversarial images are outliers of the natural image manifold and the purification process can be considered as returning them to this manifold. Following this assumption, we present a simple adversarial purification method without further training to purify adversarial images, called ZeroPur. ZeroPur contains two steps: given an adversarial example, Guided Shift obtains the shifted embedding of the adversarial example by the guidance of its blurred counterparts; after that, Adaptive Projection constructs a directional vector by this shifted embedding to provide momentum, projecting adversarial images onto the manifold adaptively. ZeroPur is independent of external models and requires no retraining of victim classifiers or auxiliary functions, relying solely on victim classifiers themselves to achieve purification. Extensive experiments on three datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-1K) using various classifier architectures (ResNet, WideResNet) demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art robust performance. The code will be publicly available.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Few-shot image classification involves classifying images using very few training examples. Recent vision foundation models show excellent few-shot transfer abilities, but are large and slow at inference. Using knowledge distillation, the capabilities of high-performing but slow models can be transferred to tiny, efficient models. However, common distillation methods require a large set of unlabeled data, which is not available in the few-shot setting. To overcome this lack of data, there has been a recent interest in using synthetic data. We expand on this work by presenting a novel diffusion model inversion technique (TINT) combining the diversity of textual inversion with the specificity of null-text inversion. Using this method in a few-shot distillation pipeline leads to state-of-the-art accuracy among small student models on popular benchmarks, while being significantly faster than prior work. This allows us to push even tiny models to high accuracy using only a tiny application-specific dataset, albeit relying on extra data for pre-training. Popular few-shot benchmarks involve evaluation over a large number of episodes, which is computationally cumbersome for methods involving synthetic data generation. Therefore, we also present a theoretical analysis on how the variance of the accuracy estimator depends on the number of episodes and query examples, and use these results to lower the computational effort required for method evaluation. In addition, to further motivate the use of generative models in few-shot distillation, we demonstrate that our method performs better compared to training on real data mined from the dataset used to train the diffusion model.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Graph neural network architectures aligned with the $k$-dimensional Weisfeiler--Leman ($k$-WL) hierarchy offer theoretically well-understood expressive power. However, these architectures often fail to deliver state-of-the-art predictive performance on real-world graphs, limiting their practical utility. While recent works aligning graph transformer architectures with the $k$-WL hierarchy have shown promising empirical results, employing transformers for higher orders of $k$ remains challenging due to a prohibitive runtime and memory complexity of self-attention as well as impractical architectural assumptions, such as an infeasible number of attention heads. Here, we advance the alignment of transformers with the $k$-WL hierarchy, showing stronger expressivity results for each $k$, making them more feasible in practice. In addition, we develop a theoretical framework that allows the study of established positional encodings such as Laplacian PEs and SPE. We evaluate our transformers on the large-scale PCQM4Mv2 dataset, showing competitive predictive performance with the state-of-the-art and demonstrating strong downstream performance when fine-tuning them on small-scale molecular datasets.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the recent advances of large language models (LLMs), it is no longer infeasible to build an automated debate system that helps people to synthesise persuasive arguments. Previous work attempted this task by integrating multiple components. In our work, we introduce an argument mining dataset that captures the end-to-end process of preparing an argumentative essay for a debate, which covers the tasks of claim and evidence identification (Task 1 ED), evidence convincingness ranking (Task 2 ECR), argumentative essay summarisation and human preference ranking (Task 3 ASR) and metric learning for automated evaluation of resulting essays, based on human feedback along argument quality dimensions (Task 4 SQE). Our dataset contains 14k examples of claims that are fully annotated with the various properties supporting the aforementioned tasks. We evaluate multiple generative baselines for each of these tasks, including representative LLMs. We find, that while they show promising results on individual tasks in our benchmark, their end-to-end performance on all four tasks in succession deteriorates significantly, both in automated measures as well as in human-centred evaluation. This challenge presented by our proposed dataset motivates future research on end-to-end argument mining and summarisation. The repository of this project is available at this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Despite the impressive capability of large language models (LLMs), knowing when to trust their generations remains an open challenge. The recent literature on uncertainty quantification of natural language generation (NLG) utilises a conventional natural language inference (NLI) classifier to measure the semantic dispersion of LLMs responses. These studies employ logits of NLI classifier for semantic clustering to estimate uncertainty. However, logits represent the probability of the predicted class and barely contain feature information for potential clustering. Alternatively, CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) performs impressively in extracting image-text pair features and measuring their similarity. To extend its usability, we propose Contrastive Semantic Similarity, the CLIP-based feature extraction module to obtain similarity features for measuring uncertainty for text pairs. We apply this method to selective NLG, which detects and rejects unreliable generations for better trustworthiness of LLMs. We conduct extensive experiments with three LLMs on several benchmark question-answering datasets with comprehensive evaluation metrics. Results show that our proposed method performs better in estimating reliable responses of LLMs than comparable baselines.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The potential for improvements brought by Large Language Models (LLMs) in Text-to-SQL systems is mostly assessed on monolingual English datasets. However, LLMs' performance for other languages remains vastly unexplored. In this work, we release the StatBot.Swiss dataset, the first bilingual benchmark for evaluating Text-to-SQL systems based on real-world applications. The StatBot.Swiss dataset contains 455 natural language/SQL-pairs over 35 big databases with varying level of complexity for both English and German. We evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-3.5-Turbo and mixtral-8x7b-instruct for the Text-to-SQL translation task using an in-context learning approach. Our experimental analysis illustrates that current LLMs struggle to generalize well in generating SQL queries on our novel bilingual dataset.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Prohibited Item detection in X-ray images is one of the most effective security inspection methods.However, differing from natural light images, the unique overlapping phenomena in X-ray images lead to the coupling of foreground and background features, thereby lowering the accuracy of general object detectors.Therefore, we propose a Multi-Class Min-Margin Contrastive Learning (MMCL) method that, by clarifying the category semantic information of content queries under the deformable DETR architecture, aids the model in extracting specific category foreground information from coupled features.Specifically, after grouping content queries by the number of categories, we employ the Multi-Class Inter-Class Exclusion (MIE) loss to push apart content queries from different groups. Concurrently, the Intra-Class Min-Margin Clustering (IMC) loss is utilized to attract content queries within the same group, while ensuring the preservation of necessary disparity. As training, the inherent Hungarian matching of the model progressively strengthens the alignment between each group of queries and the semantic features of their corresponding category of objects. This evolving coherence ensures a deep-seated grasp of category characteristics, consequently bolstering the anti-overlapping detection capabilities of models.MMCL is versatile and can be easily plugged into any deformable DETR-based model with dozens of lines of code. Extensive experiments on the PIXray and OPIXray datasets demonstrate that MMCL significantly enhances the performance of various state-of-the-art models without increasing complexity.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Health-related misinformation on social networks can lead to poor decision-making and real-world dangers. Such misinformation often misrepresents scientific publications and cites them as "proof" to gain perceived credibility. To effectively counter such claims automatically, a system must explain how the claim was falsely derived from the cited publication. Current methods for automated fact-checking or fallacy detection neglect to assess the (mis)used evidence in relation to misinformation claims, which is required to detect the mismatch between them. To address this gap, we introduce Missci, a novel argumentation theoretical model for fallacious reasoning together with a new dataset for real-world misinformation detection that misrepresents biomedical publications. Unlike previous fallacy detection datasets, Missci (i) focuses on implicit fallacies between the relevant content of the cited publication and the inaccurate claim, and (ii) requires models to verbalize the fallacious reasoning in addition to classifying it. We present Missci as a dataset to test the critical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), that are required to reconstruct real-world fallacious arguments, in a zero-shot setting. We evaluate two representative LLMs and the impact of different levels of detail about the fallacy classes provided to the LLM via prompts. Our experiments and human evaluation show promising results for GPT 4, while also demonstrating the difficulty of this task.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Document understanding models are increasingly employed by companies to supplant humans in processing sensitive documents, such as invoices, tax notices, or even ID cards. However, the robustness of such models to privacy attacks remains vastly unexplored. This paper presents CDMI, the first reconstruction attack designed to extract sensitive fields from the training data of these models. We attack LayoutLM and BROS architectures, demonstrating that an adversary can perfectly reconstruct up to 4.1% of the fields of the documents used for fine-tuning, including some names, dates, and invoice amounts up to six-digit numbers. When our reconstruction attack is combined with a membership inference attack, our attack accuracy escalates to 22.5%. In addition, we introduce two new end-to-end metrics and evaluate our approach under various conditions: unimodal or bimodal data, LayoutLM or BROS backbones, four fine-tuning tasks, and two public datasets (FUNSD and SROIE). We also investigate the interplay between overfitting, predictive performance, and susceptibility to our attack. We conclude with a discussion on possible defenses against our attack and potential future research directions to construct robust document understanding models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Existing single image-to-3D creation methods typically involve a two-stage process, first generating multi-view images, and then using these images for 3D reconstruction. However, training these two stages separately leads to significant data bias in the inference phase, thus affecting the quality of reconstructed results. We introduce a unified 3D generation framework, named Ouroboros3D, which integrates diffusion-based multi-view image generation and 3D reconstruction into a recursive diffusion process. In our framework, these two modules are jointly trained through a self-conditioning mechanism, allowing them to adapt to each other's characteristics for robust inference. During the multi-view denoising process, the multi-view diffusion model uses the 3D-aware maps rendered by the reconstruction module at the previous timestep as additional conditions. The recursive diffusion framework with 3D-aware feedback unites the entire process and improves geometric consistency.Experiments show that our framework outperforms separation of these two stages and existing methods that combine them at the inference phase.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In IoT-based critical sectors, 5G can provide more rapid connection speeds, lower latency, faster downloads, and capability to connect more devices due to the introduction of new dynamics such as softwarization and virtualization. 5G-enabled IoT networks increase systems vulnerabilities to security threats due to these dynamics. Consequently, adaptive cybersecurity solutions need to be developed for 5G-enabled IoT applications to protect them against potential cyber-attacks. This task specifies new adaptive strategies of security intelligence with associated scenarios to meet the challenges of 5G-IoT characteristics. In this task we have also developed an autonomous adaptive security framework which can protect 5G-enabaled IoT dynamically and autonomously.

          Ariadne: a Privacy-Preserving Communication Protocol(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, protect</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this article, we present Ariadne, a privacy-preserving communication network layer protocol that uses a source routing approach to avoid relying on trusted third parties. In Ariadne, a source node willing to send anonymized network traffic to a destination uses a path consisting in nodes with which it has pre-shared symmetric keys. Temporary keys derived from those pre-shared keys to protect communication privacy using onion routing techniques, ensuring session unlinkability for packets following the same path. Ariadne enhances previous approaches to preserve communication privacy by introducing two novelties. First, the source route is encoded in a fixed size, sequentially encrypted vector of routing information elements, in which the elements' positions in the vector are pseudo-randomly permuted. Second, the temporary keys used to process the packets on the path are referenced using mutually known encrypted patterns. This avoids the use of an explicit key reference that could be used to de-anonymize the communications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce Situation Monitor, a novel zero-shot Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection approach for transformer-based object detection models to enhance reliability in safety-critical machine learning applications such as autonomous driving. The Situation Monitor utilizes the Diversity-based Budding Ensemble Architecture (DBEA) and increases the OOD performance by integrating a diversity loss into the training process on top of the budding ensemble architecture, detecting Far-OOD samples and minimizing false positives on Near-OOD samples. Moreover, utilizing the resulting DBEA increases the model's OOD performance and improves the calibration of confidence scores, particularly concerning the intersection over union of the detected objects. The DBEA model achieves these advancements with a 14% reduction in trainable parameters compared to the vanilla model. This signifies a substantial improvement in efficiency without compromising the model's ability to detect OOD instances and calibrate the confidence scores accurately.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Explainable Graph Neural Network (GNN) has emerged recently to foster the trust of using GNNs. Existing GNN explainers are developed from various perspectives to enhance the explanation performance. We take the first step to study GNN explainers under adversarial attack--We found that an adversary slightly perturbing graph structure can ensure GNN model makes correct predictions, but the GNN explainer yields a drastically different explanation on the perturbed graph. Specifically, we first formulate the attack problem under a practical threat model (i.e., the adversary has limited knowledge about the GNN explainer and a restricted perturbation budget). We then design two methods (i.e., one is loss-based and the other is deduction-based) to realize the attack. We evaluate our attacks on various GNN explainers and the results show these explainers are fragile.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The need for fair AI is increasingly clear in the era of general-purpose systems such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and other large language models (LLMs). However, the increasing complexity of human-AI interaction and its social impacts have raised questions of how fairness standards could be applied. Here, we review the technical frameworks that machine learning researchers have used to evaluate fairness, such as group fairness and fair representations, and find that their application to LLMs faces inherent limitations. We show that each framework either does not logically extend to LLMs or presents a notion of fairness that is intractable for LLMs, primarily due to the multitudes of populations affected, sensitive attributes, and use cases. To address these challenges, we develop guidelines for the more realistic goal of achieving fairness in particular use cases: the criticality of context, the responsibility of LLM developers, and the need for stakeholder participation in an iterative process of design and evaluation. Moreover, it may eventually be possible and even necessary to use the general-purpose capabilities of AI systems to address fairness challenges as a form of scalable AI-assisted alignment.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Advances in large language models raise the question of how alignment techniques will adapt as models become increasingly complex and humans will only be able to supervise them weakly. Weak-to-Strong mimics such a scenario where weak model supervision attempts to harness the full capabilities of a much stronger model. This work extends Weak-to-Strong to WeakS-to-Strong by exploring an ensemble of weak models which simulate the variability in human opinions. Confidence scores are estimated using a Bayesian approach to guide the WeakS-to-Strong generalization. Furthermore, we extend the application of WeakS-to-Strong from text classification tasks to text generation tasks where more advanced strategies are investigated for supervision. Moreover, direct preference optimization is applied to advance the student model's preference learning, beyond the basic learning framework of teacher forcing. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for the reliability of a strong student model, showing potential for superalignment.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Significant advancements in video diffusion models have brought substantial progress to the field of text-to-video (T2V) synthesis. However, existing T2V synthesis model struggle to accurately generate complex motion dynamics, leading to a reduction in video realism. One possible solution is to collect massive data and train the model on it, but this would be extremely expensive. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we reformulate the typical T2V generation process as a search-based generation pipeline. Instead of scaling up the model training, we employ existing videos as the motion prior database. Specifically, we divide T2V generation process into two steps: (i) For a given prompt input, we search existing text-video datasets to find videos with text labels that closely match the prompt motions. We propose a tailored search algorithm that emphasizes object motion features. (ii) Retrieved videos are processed and distilled into motion priors to fine-tune a pre-trained base T2V model, followed by generating desired videos using input prompt. By utilizing the priors gleaned from the searched videos, we enhance the realism of the generated videos' motion. All operations can be finished on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU. We validate our method against state-of-the-art T2V models across diverse prompt inputs. The code will be public.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent Continual Learning (CL) methods have combined pretrained Transformers with prompt tuning, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) technique. We argue that the choice of prompt tuning in prior works was an undefended and unablated decision, which has been uncritically adopted by subsequent research, but warrants further research to understand its implications. In this paper, we conduct this research and find that the choice of prompt tuning as a PEFT method hurts the overall performance of the CL system. To illustrate this, we replace prompt tuning with LoRA in two state-of-the-art continual learning methods: Learning to Prompt and S-Prompts. These variants consistently achieve higher accuracy across a wide range of domain-incremental and class-incremental benchmarks, while being competitive in inference speed. Our work highlights a crucial argument: unexamined choices can hinder progress in the field, and rigorous ablations, such as the PEFT method, are required to drive meaningful adoption of CL techniques in real-world applications.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Medical image segmentation is a relevant problem, with deep learning being an exponent. However, the necessity of a high volume of fully annotated images for training massive models can be a problem, especially for applications whose images present a great diversity, such as brain tumors, which can occur in different sizes and shapes. In contrast, a recent methodology, Feature Learning from Image Markers (FLIM), has involved an expert in the learning loop, producing small networks that require few images to train the convolutional layers. In this work, We employ an interactive method for image selection and training based on FLIM, exploring the user's knowledge. The results demonstrated that with our methodology, we could choose a small set of images to train the encoder of a U-shaped network, obtaining performance equal to manual selection and even surpassing the same U-shaped network trained with backpropagation and all training images.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As transformer-based object detection models progress, their impact in critical sectors like autonomous vehicles and aviation is expected to grow. Soft errors causing bit flips during inference have significantly impacted DNN performance, altering predictions. Traditional range restriction solutions for CNNs fall short for transformers. This study introduces the Global Clipper and Global Hybrid Clipper, effective mitigation strategies specifically designed for transformer-based models. It significantly enhances their resilience to soft errors and reduces faulty inferences to ~ 0\%. We also detail extensive testing across over 64 scenarios involving two transformer models (DINO-DETR and Lite-DETR) and two CNN models (YOLOv3 and SSD) using three datasets, totalling approximately 3.3 million inferences, to assess model robustness comprehensively. Moreover, the paper explores unique aspects of attention blocks in transformers and their operational differences from CNNs.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), exemplified by OpenAI's ChatGPT, brings to the forefront the imperative to defend against adversarial threats on these models. These attacks, which manipulate an LLM's output by introducing malicious inputs, undermine the model's integrity and the trust users place in its outputs. In response to this challenge, our paper presents an innovative defensive strategy, given white box access to an LLM, that harnesses residual activation analysis between transformer layers of the LLM. We apply an established methodology for analyzing distinctive activation patterns in the residual streams for a novel result of attack prompt classification. We curate multiple datasets to demonstrate how this method of classification has high accuracy across multiple types of attack scenarios, including our newly-created attack dataset. Furthermore, we enhance the model's resilience by integrating safety fine-tuning techniques for LLMs in order to measure its effect on our capability to detect attacks. The results underscore the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing the detection and mitigation of adversarial inputs, advancing the security framework within which LLMs operate.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Causal dynamics learning has recently emerged as a promising approach to enhancing robustness in reinforcement learning (RL). Typically, the goal is to build a dynamics model that makes predictions based on the causal relationships among the entities. Despite the fact that causal connections often manifest only under certain contexts, existing approaches overlook such fine-grained relationships and lack a detailed understanding of the dynamics. In this work, we propose a novel dynamics model that infers fine-grained causal structures and employs them for prediction, leading to improved robustness in RL. The key idea is to jointly learn the dynamics model with a discrete latent variable that quantizes the state-action space into subgroups. This leads to recognizing meaningful context that displays sparse dependencies, where causal structures are learned for each subgroup throughout the training. Experimental results demonstrate the robustness of our method to unseen states and locally spurious correlations in downstream tasks where fine-grained causal reasoning is crucial. We further illustrate the effectiveness of our subgroup-based approach with quantization in discovering fine-grained causal relationships compared to prior methods.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Selecting which claims to check is a time-consuming task for human fact-checkers, especially from documents consisting of multiple sentences and containing multiple claims. However, existing claim extraction approaches focus more on identifying and extracting claims from individual sentences, e.g., identifying whether a sentence contains a claim or the exact boundaries of the claim within a sentence. In this paper, we propose a method for document-level claim extraction for fact-checking, which aims to extract check-worthy claims from documents and decontextualise them so that they can be understood out of context. Specifically, we first recast claim extraction as extractive summarization in order to identify central sentences from documents, then rewrite them to include necessary context from the originating document through sentence decontextualisation. Evaluation with both automatic metrics and a fact-checking professional shows that our method is able to extract check-worthy claims from documents more accurately than previous work, while also improving evidence retrieval.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Reconstructing jets, which provide vital insights into the properties and histories of subatomic particles produced in high-energy collisions, is a main problem in data analyses in collider physics. This intricate task deals with estimating the latent structure of a jet (binary tree) and involves parameters such as particle energy, momentum, and types. While Bayesian methods offer a natural approach for handling uncertainty and leveraging prior knowledge, they face significant challenges due to the super-exponential growth of potential jet topologies as the number of observed particles increases. To address this, we introduce a Combinatorial Sequential Monte Carlo approach for inferring jet latent structures. As a second contribution, we leverage the resulting estimator to develop a variational inference algorithm for parameter learning. Building on this, we introduce a variational family using a pseudo-marginal framework for a fully Bayesian treatment of all variables, unifying the generative model with the inference process. We illustrate our method's effectiveness through experiments using data generated with a collider physics generative model, highlighting superior speed and accuracy across a range of tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Overfitting in RL has become one of the main obstacles to applications in reinforcement learning(RL). Existing methods do not provide explicit semantic constrain for the feature extractor, hindering the agent from learning a unified cross-domain representation and resulting in performance degradation on unseen domains. Besides, abundant data from multiple domains are needed. To address these issues, in this work, we propose prompt-based visual alignment (PVA), a robust framework to mitigate the detrimental domain bias in the image for zero-shot policy transfer. Inspired that Visual-Language Model (VLM) can serve as a bridge to connect both text space and image space, we leverage the semantic information contained in a text sequence as an explicit constraint to train a visual aligner. Thus, the visual aligner can map images from multiple domains to a unified domain and achieve good generalization performance. To better depict semantic information, prompt tuning is applied to learn a sequence of learnable tokens. With explicit constraints of semantic information, PVA can learn unified cross-domain representation under limited access to cross-domain data and achieves great zero-shot generalization ability in unseen domains. We verify PVA on a vision-based autonomous driving task with CARLA simulator. Experiments show that the agent generalizes well on unseen domains under limited access to multi-domain data.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Fairness has become a crucial aspect in the development of trustworthy machine learning algorithms. Current fairness metrics to measure the violation of demographic parity have the following drawbacks: (i) the average difference of model predictions on two groups cannot reflect their distribution disparity, and (ii) the overall calculation along all possible predictions conceals the extreme local disparity at or around certain predictions. In this work, we propose a novel fairness metric called Maximal Cumulative ratio Disparity along varying Predictions' neighborhood (MCDP), for measuring the maximal local disparity of the fairness-aware classifiers. To accurately and efficiently calculate the MCDP, we develop a provably exact and an approximate calculation algorithm that greatly reduces the computational complexity with low estimation error. We further propose a bi-level optimization algorithm using a differentiable approximation of the MCDP for improving the algorithmic fairness. Extensive experiments on both tabular and image datasets validate that our fair training algorithm can achieve superior fairness-accuracy trade-offs.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Visual anomaly detection aims to identify anomalous regions in images through unsupervised learning paradigms, with increasing application demand and value in fields such as industrial inspection and medical lesion detection. Despite significant progress in recent years, there is a lack of comprehensive benchmarks to adequately evaluate the performance of various mainstream methods across different datasets under the practical multi-class setting. The absence of standardized experimental setups can lead to potential biases in training epochs, resolution, and metric results, resulting in erroneous conclusions. This paper addresses this issue by proposing a comprehensive visual anomaly detection benchmark, \textbf{\textit{ADer}}, which is a modular framework that is highly extensible for new methods. The benchmark includes multiple datasets from industrial and medical domains, implementing fifteen state-of-the-art methods and nine comprehensive metrics. Additionally, we have open-sourced the GPU-assisted \href{this https URL}{ADEval} package to address the slow evaluation problem of metrics like time-consuming mAU-PRO on large-scale data, significantly reducing evaluation time by more than \textit{1000-fold}. Through extensive experimental results, we objectively reveal the strengths and weaknesses of different methods and provide insights into the challenges and future directions of multi-class visual anomaly detection. We hope that \textbf{\textit{ADer}} will become a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field, promoting the development of more robust and generalizable anomaly detection systems.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Simulating detector responses is a crucial part of understanding the inner-workings of particle collisions in the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. The current reliance on statistical Monte-Carlo simulations strains CERN's computational grid, underscoring the urgency for more efficient alternatives. Addressing these challenges, recent proposals advocate for generative machine learning methods. In this study, we present an innovative deep learning simulation approach tailored for the proton Zero Degree Calorimeter in the ALICE experiment. Leveraging a Generative Adversarial Network model with Selective Diversity Increase loss, we directly simulate calorimeter responses. To enhance its capabilities in modeling a broad range of calorimeter response intensities, we expand the SDI-GAN architecture with additional regularization. Moreover, to improve the spatial fidelity of the generated data, we introduce an auxiliary regressor network. Our method offers a significant speedup when comparing to the traditional Monte-Carlo based approaches.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Image copy-move is an operation that replaces one part of the image with another part of the same image, which can be used for illegal purposes due to the potential semantic changes. Recent studies have shown that keypoint-based algorithms achieved excellent and robust localization performance even when small or smooth tampered areas were involved. However, when the input image is low-resolution, most existing keypoint-based algorithms are difficult to generate sufficient keypoints, resulting in more missed detections. In addition, existing algorithms are usually unable to distinguish between Similar but Genuine Objects (SGO) images and tampered images, resulting in more false alarms. This is mainly due to the lack of further verification of local homography matrix in forgery localization stage. To tackle these problems, this paper firstly proposes an excessive keypoint extraction strategy to overcome missed detection. Subsequently, a group matching algorithm is used to speed up the matching of excessive keypoints. Finally, a new iterative forgery localization algorithm is introduced to quickly form pixel-level localization results while ensuring a lower false alarm. Extensive experimental results show that our scheme has superior performance than state-of-the-art algorithms in overcoming missed detection and false alarm.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools to accurately predict materials and molecular properties in computational discovery pipelines. In this article, we exploit the invertible nature of these neural networks to directly generate molecular structures with desired electronic properties. Starting from a random graph or an existing molecule, we perform a gradient ascent while holding the GNN weights fixed in order to optimize its input, the molecular graph, towards the target property. Valence rules are enforced strictly through a judicious graph construction. The method relies entirely on the property predictor; no additional training is required on molecular structures. We demonstrate the application of this method by generating molecules with specific DFT-verified energy gaps and octanol-water partition coefficients (logP). Our approach hits target properties with rates comparable to or better than state-of-the-art generative models while consistently generating more diverse molecules.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep model fusion is an emerging technique that unifies the predictions or parameters of several deep neural networks into a single model in a cost-effective and data-efficient manner. This enables the unified model to take advantage of the original models' strengths, potentially exceeding their performance. Although a variety of deep model fusion techniques have been introduced, their evaluations tend to be inconsistent and often inadequate to validate their effectiveness and robustness against distribution shifts. To address this issue, we introduce FusionBench, which is the first comprehensive benchmark dedicated to deep model fusion. FusionBench covers a wide range of tasks, including open-vocabulary image classification, text classification, and text-to-text generation. Each category includes up to eight tasks with corresponding task-specific models, featuring both full fine-tuning and LoRA fine-tuning, as well as models of different sizes, to ensure fair and balanced comparisons of various multi-task model fusion techniques across different tasks, model scales, and fine-tuning strategies. We implement and evaluate a broad spectrum of deep model fusion techniques. These techniques range from model ensemble methods, which combine the predictions to improve the overall performance, to model merging, which integrates different models into a single one, and model mixing methods, which upscale or recombine the components of the original models. FusionBench now contains 26 distinct tasks, 74 fine-tuned models, and 16 fusion techniques, and we are committed to consistently expanding the benchmark with more tasks, models, and fusion techniques. In addition, we offer a well-documented set of resources and guidelines to aid researchers in understanding and replicating the benchmark results. Homepage this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>GFlowNets are a promising alternative to MCMC sampling for discrete compositional random variables. Training GFlowNets requires repeated evaluations of the unnormalized target distribution or reward function. However, for large-scale posterior sampling, this may be prohibitive since it incurs traversing the data several times. Moreover, if the data are distributed across clients, employing standard GFlowNets leads to intensive client-server communication. To alleviate both these issues, we propose embarrassingly parallel GFlowNet (EP-GFlowNet). EP-GFlowNet is a provably correct divide-and-conquer method to sample from product distributions of the form $R(\cdot) \propto R_1(\cdot) ... R_N(\cdot)$ -- e.g., in parallel or federated Bayes, where each $R_n$ is a local posterior defined on a data partition. First, in parallel, we train a local GFlowNet targeting each $R_n$ and send the resulting models to the server. Then, the server learns a global GFlowNet by enforcing our newly proposed \emph{aggregating balance} condition, requiring a single communication step. Importantly, EP-GFlowNets can also be applied to multi-objective optimization and model reuse. Our experiments illustrate the EP-GFlowNets's effectiveness on many tasks, including parallel Bayesian phylogenetics, multi-objective multiset, sequence generation, and federated Bayesian structure learning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large-scale diffusion models have achieved remarkable performance in generative tasks. Beyond their initial training applications, these models have proven their ability to function as versatile plug-and-play priors. For instance, 2D diffusion models can serve as loss functions to optimize 3D implicit models. Rectified flow, a novel class of generative models, enforces a linear progression from the source to the target distribution and has demonstrated superior performance across various domains. Compared to diffusion-based methods, rectified flow approaches surpass in terms of generation quality and efficiency, requiring fewer inference steps. In this work, we present theoretical and experimental evidence demonstrating that rectified flow based methods offer similar functionalities to diffusion models - they can also serve as effective priors. Besides the generative capabilities of diffusion priors, motivated by the unique time-symmetry properties of rectified flow models, a variant of our method can additionally perform image inversion. Experimentally, our rectified flow-based priors outperform their diffusion counterparts - the SDS and VSD losses - in text-to-3D generation. Our method also displays competitive performance in image inversion and editing.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Point cloud registration is a prerequisite for many applications in computer vision and robotics. Most existing methods focus on pairwise registration of two point clouds with high overlap. Although there have been some methods for low overlap cases, they struggle in degraded scenarios. This paper introduces a novel framework named L-PR, designed to register unordered low overlap multiview point clouds leveraging LiDAR fiducial markers. We refer to them as LiDAR fiducial markers, but they are the same as the popular AprilTag and ArUco markers, thin sheets of paper that do not affect the 3D geometry of the environment. We first propose an improved adaptive threshold marker detection method to provide robust detection results when the viewpoints among point clouds change dramatically. Then, we formulate the unordered multiview point cloud registration problem as a maximum a-posteriori (MAP) problem and develop a framework consisting of two levels of graphs to address it. The first-level graph, constructed as a weighted graph, is designed to efficiently and optimally infer initial values of scan poses from the unordered set. The second-level graph is constructed as a factor graph. By globally optimizing the variables on the graph, including scan poses, marker poses, and marker corner positions, we tackle the MAP problem. We conduct qualitative and quantitative experiments to demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits superiority over competitors in four aspects: registration accuracy, instance reconstruction quality, localization accuracy, and robustness to the degraded scene.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Visual prompting infuses visual information into the input image to adapt models toward specific predictions and tasks. Recently, manually crafted markers such as red circles are shown to guide the model to attend to a target region on the image. However, these markers only work on models trained with data containing those markers. Moreover, finding these prompts requires guesswork or prior knowledge of the domain on which the model is trained. This work circumvents manual design constraints by proposing to learn the visual prompts for guiding the attention of vision transformers. The learned visual prompt, added to any input image would redirect the attention of the pre-trained vision transformer to its spatial location on the image. Specifically, the prompt is learned in a self-supervised manner without requiring annotations and without fine-tuning the vision transformer. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed optimization-based visual prompting strategy across various pre-trained vision encoders.</li>

This paper suggests that the results of the original paper are reproducible and thus, the claims hold. However, the claim that FairAC is a generic framework for many downstream tasks is very broad and could therefore only be partially tested. Moreover, we show that FairAC is generalizable to various datasets and sensitive attributes and show evidence that the improvement in group fairness of the FairAC framework does not come at the expense of individual fairness. Lastly, the codebase of FairAC has been refactored and is now easily applicable for various datasets and models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>A cyber security organisation needs to ensure that its workforce possesses the necessary knowledge to fulfil its cyber security business functions. Similarly, where an organisation chooses to delegate their cyber security tasks to a third party provider, they must ensure that the chosen entity possesses robust knowledge capabilities to effectively carry out the assigned tasks. Building a comprehensive cyber security knowledge profile is a distinct challenge; the field is ever evolving with a range of professional certifications, academic qualifications and on-the-job training. So far, there has been a lack of a well-defined methodology for systematically evaluating an organisation's cyber security knowledge, specifically derived from its workforce, against a standardised reference point. Prior research on knowledge profiling across various disciplines has predominantly utilised established frameworks such as SWEBOK. However, within the domain of cyber security, the absence of a standardised reference point is notable. In this paper, we advance a framework leveraging CyBOK, to construct an organisation's knowledge profile. The framework enables a user to identify areas of coverage and where gaps may lie, so that an organisation can consider targeted recruitment or training or, where such expertise may be outsourced, drawing in knowledge capability from third parties. In the latter case, the framework can also be used as a basis for assessing the knowledge capability of such a third party. We present the knowledge profiling framework, discussing three case studies in organisational teams underpinning its initial development, followed by its refinement through workshops with cyber security practitioners.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Semantic segmentation is an essential component of medical image analysis research, with recent deep learning algorithms offering out-of-the-box applicability across diverse datasets. Despite these advancements, segmentation failures remain a significant concern for real-world clinical applications, necessitating reliable detection mechanisms. This paper introduces a comprehensive benchmarking framework aimed at evaluating failure detection methodologies within medical image segmentation. Through our analysis, we identify the strengths and limitations of current failure detection metrics, advocating for the risk-coverage analysis as a holistic evaluation approach. Utilizing a collective dataset comprising five public 3D medical image collections, we assess the efficacy of various failure detection strategies under realistic test-time distribution shifts. Our findings highlight the importance of pixel confidence aggregation and we observe superior performance of the pairwise Dice score (Roy et al., 2019) between ensemble predictions, positioning it as a simple and robust baseline for failure detection in medical image segmentation. To promote ongoing research, we make the benchmarking framework available to the community.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The Mean Square Error (MSE) is commonly utilized to estimate the solution of the optimal value function in the vast majority of offline reinforcement learning (RL) models and has achieved outstanding performance. However, we find that its principle can lead to overestimation phenomenon for the value function. In this paper, we first theoretically analyze overestimation phenomenon led by MSE and provide the theoretical upper bound of the overestimated error. Furthermore, to address it, we propose a novel Bellman underestimated operator to counteract overestimation phenomenon and then prove its contraction characteristics. At last, we propose the offline RL algorithm based on underestimated operator and diffusion policy model. Extensive experimental results on D4RL tasks show that our method can outperform state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms, which demonstrates that our theoretical analysis and underestimation way are effective for offline RL tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Current approximate posteriors in Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) exhibit a crucial limitation: they fail to maintain invariance under reparameterization, i.e. BNNs assign different posterior densities to different parametrizations of identical functions. This creates a fundamental flaw in the application of Bayesian principles as it breaks the correspondence between uncertainty over the parameters with uncertainty over the parametrized function. In this paper, we investigate this issue in the context of the increasingly popular linearized Laplace approximation. Specifically, it has been observed that linearized predictives alleviate the common underfitting problems of the Laplace approximation. We develop a new geometric view of reparametrizations from which we explain the success of linearization. Moreover, we demonstrate that these reparameterization invariance properties can be extended to the original neural network predictive using a Riemannian diffusion process giving a straightforward algorithm for approximate posterior sampling, which empirically improves posterior fit.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This work aims to improve generalization and interpretability of dynamical systems by recovering the underlying lower-dimensional latent states and their time evolutions. Previous work on disentangled representation learning within the realm of dynamical systems focused on the latent states, possibly with linear transition approximations. As such, they cannot identify nonlinear transition dynamics, and hence fail to reliably predict complex future behavior. Inspired by the advances in nonlinear ICA, we propose a state-space modeling framework in which we can identify not just the latent states but also the unknown transition function that maps the past states to the present. We introduce a practical algorithm based on variational auto-encoders and empirically demonstrate in realistic synthetic settings that we can (i) recover latent state dynamics with high accuracy, (ii) correspondingly achieve high future prediction accuracy, and (iii) adapt fast to new environments.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Chatbots have been an interesting application of natural language generation since its inception. With novel transformer based Generative AI methods, building chatbots have become trivial. Chatbots which are targeted at specific domains such as medicine, psychology, and general information retrieval are implemented rapidly. This, however, should not distract from the need to evaluate the chatbot responses. Especially because the natural language generation community does not entirely agree upon how to effectively evaluate such applications. With this work we discuss the issue further with the increasingly popular LLM based evaluations and how they correlate with human evaluations. Additionally, we introduce a comprehensive factored evaluation mechanism that can be utilized in conjunction with both human and LLM-based evaluations. We present the results of an experimental evaluation conducted using this scheme in one of our chatbot implementations, and subsequently compare automated, traditional human evaluation, factored human evaluation, and factored LLM evaluation. Results show that factor based evaluation produces better insights on which aspects need to be improved in LLM applications and further strengthens the argument to use human evaluation in critical spaces where main functionality is not direct retrieval.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>protect, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid progress of generative AI technology has sparked significant copyright concerns, leading to numerous lawsuits filed against AI developers. While some studies explore methods to mitigate copyright risks by steering the outputs of generative models away from those resembling copyrighted data, little attention has been paid to the question of how much of a resemblance is undesirable; more original or unique data are afforded stronger protection, and the threshold level of resemblance for constituting infringement correspondingly lower. Here, leveraging this principle, we propose a genericization method that modifies the outputs of a generative model to make them more generic and less likely to infringe copyright. To achieve this, we introduce a metric for quantifying the level of originality of data in a manner that is consistent with the legal framework. This metric can be practically estimated by drawing samples from a generative model, which is then used for the genericization process. Experiments demonstrate that our genericization method successfully modifies the output of a text-to-image generative model so that it produces more generic, copyright-compliant images.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Learning representations that generalize under distribution shifts is critical for building robust machine learning models. However, despite significant efforts in recent years, algorithmic advances in this direction have been limited. In this work, we seek to understand the fundamental difficulty of out-of-distribution generalization with deep neural networks. We first empirically show that perhaps surprisingly, even allowing a neural network to explicitly fit the representations obtained from a teacher network that can generalize out-of-distribution is insufficient for the generalization of the student network. Then, by a theoretical study of two-layer ReLU networks optimized by stochastic gradient descent (SGD) under a structured feature model, we identify a fundamental yet unexplored feature learning proclivity of neural networks, feature contamination: neural networks can learn uncorrelated features together with predictive features, resulting in generalization failure under distribution shifts. Notably, this mechanism essentially differs from the prevailing narrative in the literature that attributes the generalization failure to spurious correlations. Overall, our results offer new insights into the non-linear feature learning dynamics of neural networks and highlight the necessity of considering inductive biases in out-of-distribution generalization.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Ensuring that online discussions are civil and productive is a major challenge for social media platforms. Such platforms usually rely both on users and on automated detection tools to flag inappropriate arguments of other users, which moderators then review. However, this kind of post-hoc moderation is expensive and time-consuming, and moderators are often overwhelmed by the amount and severity of flagged content. Instead, a promising alternative is to prevent negative behavior during content creation. This paper studies how inappropriate language in arguments can be computationally mitigated. We propose a reinforcement learning-based rewriting approach that balances content preservation and appropriateness based on existing classifiers, prompting an instruction-finetuned large language model (LLM) as our initial policy. Unlike related style transfer tasks, rewriting inappropriate arguments allows deleting and adding content permanently. It is therefore tackled on document level rather than sentence level. We evaluate different weighting schemes for the reward function in both absolute and relative human assessment studies. Systematic experiments on non-parallel data provide evidence that our approach can mitigate the inappropriateness of arguments while largely preserving their content. It significantly outperforms competitive baselines, including few-shot learning, prompting, and humans.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Despite the widespread adoption of Large language models (LLMs), their remarkable capabilities remain limited to a few high-resource languages. Additionally, many low-resource languages (e.g. African languages) are often evaluated only on basic text classification tasks due to the lack of appropriate or comprehensive benchmarks outside of high-resource languages. In this paper, we introduce IrokoBench -- a human-translated benchmark dataset for 16 typologically-diverse low-resource African languages covering three tasks: natural language inference~(AfriXNLI), mathematical reasoning~(AfriMGSM), and multi-choice knowledge-based QA~(AfriMMLU). We use IrokoBench to evaluate zero-shot, few-shot, and translate-test settings~(where test sets are translated into English) across 10 open and four proprietary LLMs. Our evaluation reveals a significant performance gap between high-resource languages~(such as English and French) and low-resource African languages. We observe a significant performance gap between open and proprietary models, with the highest performing open model, Aya-101 only at 58\% of the best-performing proprietary model GPT-4o performance. Machine translating the test set to English before evaluation helped to close the gap for larger models that are English-centric, like LLaMa 3 70B. These findings suggest that more efforts are needed to develop and adapt LLMs for African languages.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs), while excelling at capturing local relationships, often struggle with long-range dependencies on graphs. Conversely, graph transformers (GTs) enable information exchange between all nodes but oversimplify the graph structure by treating them as a set of fixed-length vectors. This work proposes a novel architecture, NeuralWalker, that overcomes the limitations of both methods by combining random walks with message passing. NeuralWalker achieves this by treating random walks as sequences, allowing for the application of recent advances in sequence models in order to capture long-range dependencies within these walks. Based on this concept, we propose a framework that offers (1) more expressive graph representations through random walk sequences, (2) the ability to utilize any sequence model for capturing long-range dependencies, and (3) the flexibility by integrating various GNN and GT architectures. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that NeuralWalker achieves significant performance improvements on 19 graph and node benchmark datasets, notably outperforming existing methods by up to 13% on the PascalVoc-SP and COCO-SP datasets.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Data visualization via dimensionality reduction is an important tool in exploratory data analysis. However, when the data are noisy, many existing methods fail to capture the underlying structure of the data. The method called Empirical Intrinsic Geometry (EIG) was previously proposed for performing dimensionality reduction on high dimensional dynamical processes while theoretically eliminating all noise. However, implementing EIG in practice requires the construction of high-dimensional histograms, which suffer from the curse of dimensionality. Here we propose a new data visualization method called Functional Information Geometry (FIG) for dynamical processes that adapts the EIG framework while using approaches from functional data analysis to mitigate the curse of dimensionality. We experimentally demonstrate that the resulting method outperforms a variant of EIG designed for visualization in terms of capturing the true structure, hyperparameter robustness, and computational speed. We then use our method to visualize EEG brain measurements of sleep activity.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Crafting quizzes from educational content is a pivotal activity that benefits both teachers and students by reinforcing learning and evaluating understanding. In this study, we introduce a novel approach to generate quizzes from Turkish educational texts, marking a pioneering endeavor in educational technology specifically tailored to the Turkish educational context. We present a specialized dataset, named the Turkish-Quiz-Instruct, comprising an extensive collection of Turkish educational texts accompanied by multiple-choice and short-answer quizzes. This research leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), including GPT-4-Turbo, GPT-3.5-Turbo, Llama-2-7b-chat-hf, and Llama-2-13b-chat-hf, to automatically generate quiz questions and answers from the Turkish educational content. Our work delineates the methodology for employing these LLMs in the context of Turkish educational material, thereby opening new avenues for automated Turkish quiz generation. The study not only demonstrates the efficacy of using such models for generating coherent and relevant quiz content but also sets a precedent for future research in the domain of automated educational content creation for languages other than English. The Turkish-Quiz-Instruct dataset is introduced as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners aiming to explore the boundaries of educational technology and language-specific applications of LLMs in Turkish. By addressing the challenges of quiz generation in a non-English context specifically Turkish, this study contributes significantly to the field of Turkish educational technology, providing insights into the potential of leveraging LLMs for educational purposes across diverse linguistic landscapes.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Over-the-Air Federated Learning (OTA-FL) has been extensively investigated as a privacy-preserving distributed learning mechanism. Realistic systems will see FL clients with diverse size, weight, and power configurations. A critical research gap in existing OTA-FL research is the assumption of homogeneous client computational bit precision. Indeed, many clients may exploit approximate computing (AxC) where bit precisions are adjusted for energy and computational efficiency. The dynamic distribution of bit precision updates amongst FL clients poses an open challenge for OTA-FL, as is is incompatible in the wireless modulation superposition space. Here, we propose an AxC-based OTA-FL framework of clients with multiple precisions, demonstrating the following innovations: (i) optimize the quantization-performance trade-off for both server and clients within the constraints of varying edge computing capabilities and learning accuracy requirements, and (ii) develop heterogeneous gradient resolution OTA-FL modulation schemes to ensure compatibility with physical layer OTA aggregation. Our findings indicate that we can design modulation schemes that enable AxC based OTA-FL, which can achieve 50\% faster and smoother server convergence and a performance enhancement for the lowest precision clients compared to a homogeneous precision approach. This demonstrates the great potential of our AxC-based OTA-FL approach in heterogeneous edge computing environments.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Currently, the field of structure-based drug design is dominated by three main types of algorithms: search-based algorithms, deep generative models, and reinforcement learning. While existing works have typically focused on comparing models within a single algorithmic category, cross-algorithm comparisons remain scarce. In this paper, to fill the gap, we establish a benchmark to evaluate the performance of sixteen models across these different algorithmic foundations by assessing the pharmaceutical properties of the generated molecules and their docking affinities with specified target proteins. We highlight the unique advantages of each algorithmic approach and offer recommendations for the design of future SBDD models. We emphasize that 1D/2D ligand-centric drug design methods can be used in SBDD by treating the docking function as a black-box oracle, which is typically neglected. The empirical results show that 1D/2D methods achieve competitive performance compared with 3D-based methods that use the 3D structure of the target protein explicitly. Also, AutoGrow4, a 2D molecular graph-based genetic algorithm, dominates SBDD in terms of optimization ability. The relevant code is available in this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Spatiotemporal data is prevalent in a wide range of edge devices, such as those used in personal communication and financial transactions. Recent advancements have sparked a growing interest in integrating spatiotemporal analysis with large-scale language models. However, spatiotemporal data often contains sensitive information, making it unsuitable for open third-party access. To address this challenge, we propose a Graph-GAN-based model for generating privacy-protected spatiotemporal data. Our approach incorporates spatial and temporal attention blocks in the discriminator and a spatiotemporal deconvolution structure in the generator. These enhancements enable efficient training under Gaussian noise to achieve differential privacy. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world spatiotemporal datasets validate the efficacy of our model. Our method provides a privacy guarantee while maintaining the data utility. The prediction model trained on our generated data maintains a competitive performance compared to the model trained on the original data.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Training a proprietary Neural Network (NN) model with a proprietary dataset on the cloud comes at the risk of exposing the model architecture and the dataset to the cloud service provider. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we present an NN obfuscation framework, called Amalgam, to train NN models in a privacy-preserving manner in existing cloud-based environments. Amalgam achieves that by augmenting NN models and the datasets to be used for training with well-calibrated noise to "hide" both the original model architectures and training datasets from the cloud. After training, Amalgam extracts the original models from the augmented models and returns them to users. Our evaluation results with different computer vision and natural language processing models and datasets demonstrate that Amalgam: (i) introduces modest overheads into the training process without impacting its correctness, and (ii) does not affect the model's accuracy.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Benefiting from well-trained deep neural networks (DNNs), model compression have captured special attention for computing resource limited equipment, especially edge devices. Knowledge distillation (KD) is one of the widely used compression techniques for edge deployment, by obtaining a lightweight student model from a well-trained teacher model released on public platforms. However, it has been empirically noticed that the backdoor in the teacher model will be transferred to the student model during the process of KD. Although numerous KD methods have been proposed, most of them focus on the distillation of a high-performing student model without robustness consideration. Besides, some research adopts KD techniques as effective backdoor mitigation tools, but they fail to perform model compression at the same time. Consequently, it is still an open problem to well achieve two objectives of robust KD, i.e., student model's performance and backdoor mitigation. To address these issues, we propose RobustKD, a robust knowledge distillation that compresses the model while mitigating backdoor based on feature variance. Specifically, RobustKD distinguishes the previous works in three key aspects: (1) effectiveness: by distilling the feature map of the teacher model after detoxification, the main task performance of the student model is comparable to that of the teacher model; (2) robustness: by reducing the characteristic variance between the teacher model and the student model, it mitigates the backdoor of the student model under backdoored teacher model scenario; (3) generic: RobustKD still has good performance in the face of multiple data models (e.g., WRN 28-4, Pyramid-200) and diverse DNNs (e.g., ResNet50, MobileNet).</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we primarily address the issue of dialogue-form context query within the interactive text-to-image retrieval task. Our methodology, PlugIR, actively utilizes the general instruction-following capability of LLMs in two ways. First, by reformulating the dialogue-form context, we eliminate the necessity of fine-tuning a retrieval model on existing visual dialogue data, thereby enabling the use of any arbitrary black-box model. Second, we construct the LLM questioner to generate non-redundant questions about the attributes of the target image, based on the information of retrieval candidate images in the current context. This approach mitigates the issues of noisiness and redundancy in the generated questions. Beyond our methodology, we propose a novel evaluation metric, Best log Rank Integral (BRI), for a comprehensive assessment of the interactive retrieval system. PlugIR demonstrates superior performance compared to both zero-shot and fine-tuned baselines in various benchmarks. Additionally, the two methodologies comprising PlugIR can be flexibly applied together or separately in various situations. Our codes are available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>explainability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Post-hoc explainability methods such as Grad-CAM are popular because they do not influence the performance of a trained model. However, they mainly reveal "where" a model looks at for a given input, fail to explain "what" the model looks for (e.g., what is important to classify a bird image to a Scott Oriole?). Existing part-prototype networks leverage part-prototypes (e.g., characteristic Scott Oriole's wing and head) to answer both "where" and "what", but often under-perform their black box counterparts in the accuracy. Therefore, a natural question is: can one construct a network that answers both "where" and "what" in a post-hoc manner to guarantee the model's performance? To this end, we propose the first post-hoc part-prototype network via decomposing the classification head of a trained model into a set of interpretable part-prototypes. Concretely, we propose an unsupervised prototype discovery and refining strategy to obtain prototypes that can precisely reconstruct the classification head, yet being interpretable. Besides guaranteeing the performance, we show that our network offers more faithful explanations qualitatively and yields even better part-prototypes quantitatively than prior part-prototype networks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Event cameras are advantageous for tasks that require vision sensors with low-latency and sparse output responses. However, the development of deep network algorithms using event cameras has been slow because of the lack of large labelled event camera datasets for network training. This paper reports a method for creating new labelled event datasets by using a text-to-X model, where X is one or multiple output modalities, in the case of this work, events. Our proposed text-to-events model produces synthetic event frames directly from text prompts. It uses an autoencoder which is trained to produce sparse event frames representing event camera outputs. By combining the pretrained autoencoder with a diffusion model architecture, the new text-to-events model is able to generate smooth synthetic event streams of moving objects. The autoencoder was first trained on an event camera dataset of diverse scenes. In the combined training with the diffusion model, the DVS gesture dataset was used. We demonstrate that the model can generate realistic event sequences of human gestures prompted by different text statements. The classification accuracy of the generated sequences, using a classifier trained on the real dataset, ranges between 42% to 92%, depending on the gesture group. The results demonstrate the capability of this method in synthesizing event datasets.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In many high-risk machine learning applications it is essential for a model to indicate when it is uncertain about a prediction. While large language models (LLMs) can reach and even surpass human-level accuracy on a variety of benchmarks, their overconfidence in incorrect responses is still a well-documented failure mode. Traditional methods for ML uncertainty quantification can be difficult to directly adapt to LLMs due to the computational cost of implementation and closed-source nature of many models. A variety of black-box methods have recently been proposed, but these often rely on heuristics such as self-verbalized confidence. We instead propose a framework for measuring an LLM's uncertainty with respect to the distribution of generated explanations for an answer. While utilizing explanations is not a new idea in and of itself, by interpreting each possible model+explanation pair as a test-time classifier we can calculate a posterior answer distribution over the most likely of these classifiers. We demonstrate how a specific instance of this framework using explanation entailment as our classifier likelihood improves confidence score metrics (in particular AURC and AUROC) over baselines across five different datasets. We believe these results indicate that our framework is both a well-principled and effective way of quantifying uncertainty in LLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive mathematical reasoning capabilities, yet how they compute basic arithmetic, such as addition, remains unclear. This paper shows that pre-trained LLMs add numbers using Fourier features -- dimensions in the hidden state that represent numbers via a set of features sparse in the frequency domain. Within the model, MLP and attention layers use Fourier features in complementary ways: MLP layers primarily approximate the magnitude of the answer using low-frequency features, while attention layers primarily perform modular addition (e.g., computing whether the answer is even or odd) using high-frequency features. Pre-training is crucial for this mechanism: models trained from scratch to add numbers only exploit low-frequency features, leading to lower accuracy. Introducing pre-trained token embeddings to a randomly initialized model rescues its performance. Overall, our analysis demonstrates that appropriate pre-trained representations (e.g., Fourier features) can unlock the ability of Transformers to learn precise mechanisms for algorithmic tasks.</li>

          What is the Best Way for ChatGPT to Translate Poetry?(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Machine translation (MT) has historically faced significant challenges when applied to literary works, particularly in the domain of poetry translation. The advent of Large Language Models such as ChatGPT holds potential for innovation in this field. This study examines ChatGPT's capabilities in English-Chinese poetry translation tasks, utilizing targeted prompts and small sample scenarios to ascertain optimal performance. Despite promising outcomes, our analysis reveals persistent issues in the translations generated by ChatGPT that warrant attention. To address these shortcomings, we propose an Explanation-Assisted Poetry Machine Translation (EAPMT) method, which leverages monolingual poetry explanation as a guiding information for the translation process. Furthermore, we refine existing evaluation criteria to better suit the nuances of modern poetry translation. We engaged a panel of professional poets for assessments, complemented evaluations by using GPT-4. The results from both human and machine evaluations demonstrate that our EAPMT method outperforms traditional translation methods of ChatGPT and the existing online systems. This paper validates the efficacy of our method and contributes a novel perspective to machine-assisted literary translation.</li>

          Distributional Adversarial Loss(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>defense, attack, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>A major challenge in defending against adversarial attacks is the enormous space of possible attacks that even a simple adversary might perform. To address this, prior work has proposed a variety of defenses that effectively reduce the size of this space. These include randomized smoothing methods that add noise to the input to take away some of the adversary's impact. Another approach is input discretization which limits the adversary's possible number of actions. Motivated by these two approaches, we introduce a new notion of adversarial loss which we call distributional adversarial loss, to unify these two forms of effectively weakening an adversary. In this notion, we assume for each original example, the allowed adversarial perturbation set is a family of distributions (e.g., induced by a smoothing procedure), and the adversarial loss over each example is the maximum loss over all the associated distributions. The goal is to minimize the overall adversarial loss. We show generalization guarantees for our notion of adversarial loss in terms of the VC-dimension of the hypothesis class and the size of the set of allowed adversarial distributions associated with each input. We also investigate the role of randomness in achieving robustness against adversarial attacks in the methods described above. We show a general derandomization technique that preserves the extent of a randomized classifier's robustness against adversarial attacks. We corroborate the procedure experimentally via derandomizing the Random Projection Filters framework of \cite{dong2023adversarial}. Our procedure also improves the robustness of the model against various adversarial attacks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we present a light-weight detection transformer, LW-DETR, which outperforms YOLOs for real-time object detection. The architecture is a simple stack of a ViT encoder, a projector, and a shallow DETR decoder. Our approach leverages recent advanced techniques, such as training-effective techniques, e.g., improved loss and pretraining, and interleaved window and global attentions for reducing the ViT encoder complexity. We improve the ViT encoder by aggregating multi-level feature maps, and the intermediate and final feature maps in the ViT encoder, forming richer feature maps, and introduce window-major feature map organization for improving the efficiency of interleaved attention computation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is superior over existing real-time detectors, e.g., YOLO and its variants, on COCO and other benchmark datasets.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Due to the impressive capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), recent works have focused on employing MLLM-based agents for autonomous driving in large-scale and dynamic environments. However, prevalent approaches often directly translate high-level instructions into low-level vehicle control signals, which deviates from the inherent language generation paradigm of MLLMs and fails to fully harness their emergent powers. As a result, the generalizability of these methods is highly restricted by autonomous driving datasets used during fine-tuning. To tackle this challenge, we propose to connect high-level instructions and low-level control signals with mid-level language-driven commands, which are more fine-grained than high-level instructions but more universal and explainable than control signals, and thus can effectively bridge the gap in between. We implement this idea through a hierarchical multi-agent driving system named AD-H, including a MLLM planner for high-level reasoning and a lightweight controller for low-level execution. The hierarchical design liberates the MLLM from low-level control signal decoding and therefore fully releases their emergent capability in high-level perception, reasoning, and planning. We build a new dataset with action hierarchy annotations. Comprehensive closed-loop evaluations demonstrate several key advantages of our proposed AD-H system. First, AD-H can notably outperform state-of-the-art methods in achieving exceptional driving performance, even exhibiting self-correction capabilities during vehicle operation, a scenario not encountered in the training dataset. Second, AD-H demonstrates superior generalization under long-horizon instructions and novel environmental conditions, significantly surpassing current state-of-the-art methods.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Pretraining datasets for large language models (LLMs) have grown to trillions of tokens composed of large amounts of CommonCrawl (CC) web scrape along with smaller, domain-specific datasets. It is expensive to understand the impact of these domain-specific datasets on model capabilities as training at large FLOP scales is required to reveal significant changes to difficult and emergent benchmarks. Given the increasing cost of experimenting with pretraining data, how does one determine the optimal balance between the diversity in general web scrapes and the information density of domain specific data? In this work, we show how to leverage the smaller domain specific datasets by upsampling them relative to CC at the end of training to drive performance improvements on difficult benchmarks. This simple technique allows us to improve up to 6.90 pp on MMLU, 8.26 pp on GSM8K, and 6.17 pp on HumanEval relative to the base data mix for a 7B model trained for 1 trillion (T) tokens, thus rivaling Llama-2 (7B)$\unicode{x2014}$a model trained for twice as long. We experiment with ablating the duration of domain upsampling from 5% to 30% of training and find that 10% to 20% percent is optimal for navigating the tradeoff between general language modeling capabilities and targeted benchmarks. We also use domain upsampling to characterize at scale the utility of individual datasets for improving various benchmarks by removing them during this final phase of training. This tool opens up the ability to experiment with the impact of different pretraining datasets at scale, but at an order of magnitude lower cost compared to full pretraining runs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Our review explores the comparative analysis between Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) in the domain of image classification, with a particular focus on clothing classification within the e-commerce sector. Utilizing the Fashion MNIST dataset, we delve into the unique attributes of CNNs and ViTs. While CNNs have long been the cornerstone of image classification, ViTs introduce an innovative self-attention mechanism enabling nuanced weighting of different input data components. Historically, transformers have primarily been associated with Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Through a comprehensive examination of existing literature, our aim is to unveil the distinctions between ViTs and CNNs in the context of image classification. Our analysis meticulously scrutinizes state-of-the-art methodologies employing both architectures, striving to identify the factors influencing their performance. These factors encompass dataset characteristics, image dimensions, the number of target classes, hardware infrastructure, and the specific architectures along with their respective top results. Our key goal is to determine the most appropriate architecture between ViT and CNN for classifying images in the Fashion MNIST dataset within the e-commerce industry, while taking into account specific conditions and needs. We highlight the importance of combining these two architectures with different forms to enhance overall performance. By uniting these architectures, we can take advantage of their unique strengths, which may lead to more precise and reliable models for e-commerce applications. CNNs are skilled at recognizing local patterns, while ViTs are effective at grasping overall context, making their combination a promising strategy for boosting image classification performance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have a great potential to serve as readily available and cost-efficient Conversational Intelligent Tutoring Systems (CITS) for teaching L2 learners of English. Existing CITS, however, are designed to teach only simple concepts or lack the pedagogical depth necessary to address diverse learning strategies. To develop a more pedagogically informed CITS capable of teaching complex concepts, we construct a BIlingual PEDagogically-informed Tutoring Dataset (BIPED) of one-on-one, human-to-human English tutoring interactions. Through post-hoc analysis of the tutoring interactions, we come up with a lexicon of dialogue acts (34 tutor acts and 9 student acts), which we use to further annotate the collected dataset. Based on a two-step framework of first predicting the appropriate tutor act then generating the corresponding response, we implemented two CITS models using GPT-4 and SOLAR-KO, respectively. We experimentally demonstrate that the implemented models not only replicate the style of human teachers but also employ diverse and contextually appropriate pedagogical strategies.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have considerably advanced the capabilities of summarization systems. However, they continue to face concerns about hallucinations. While prior work has evaluated LLMs extensively in news domains, most evaluation of dialogue summarization has focused on BART-based models, leaving a gap in our understanding of their faithfulness. Our work benchmarks the faithfulness of LLMs for dialogue summarization, using human annotations and focusing on identifying and categorizing span-level inconsistencies. Specifically, we focus on two prominent LLMs: GPT-4 and Alpaca-13B. Our evaluation reveals subtleties as to what constitutes a hallucination: LLMs often generate plausible inferences, supported by circumstantial evidence in the conversation, that lack direct evidence, a pattern that is less prevalent in older models. We propose a refined taxonomy of errors, coining the category of "Circumstantial Inference" to bucket these LLM behaviors and release the dataset. Using our taxonomy, we compare the behavioral differences between LLMs and older fine-tuned models. Additionally, we systematically assess the efficacy of automatic error detection methods on LLM summaries and find that they struggle to detect these nuanced errors. To address this, we introduce two prompt-based approaches for fine-grained error detection that outperform existing metrics, particularly for identifying "Circumstantial Inference."</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs), initiated with a trained LLM, first align images with text and then fine-tune on multimodal mixed inputs. However, the MLLM catastrophically forgets the text-only instructions, which do not include images and can be addressed within the initial LLM. In this paper, we present Wings, a novel MLLM that excels in both text-only dialogues and multimodal comprehension. Analyzing MLLM attention in multimodal instructions reveals that text-only forgetting is related to the attention shifts from pre-image to post-image text. From that, we construct extra modules that act as the boosted learner to compensate for the attention shift. The complementary visual and textual learners, like "wings" on either side, are connected in parallel within each layer's attention block. Initially, image and text inputs are aligned with visual learners operating alongside the main attention, balancing focus on visual elements. Textual learners are later collaboratively integrated with attention-based routing to blend the outputs of the visual and textual learners. We design the Low-Rank Residual Attention (LoRRA) to guarantee high efficiency for learners. Our experimental results demonstrate that Wings outperforms equally-scaled MLLMs in both text-only and visual question-answering tasks. On a newly constructed Interleaved Image-Text (IIT) benchmark, Wings exhibits superior performance from text-only-rich to multimodal-rich question-answering tasks.</li>
