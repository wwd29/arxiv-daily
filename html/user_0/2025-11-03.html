<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) continually evolve through pre-training on ever-expanding web data, but this adaptive process also exposes them to subtle forms of misinformation. While prior work has explored data poisoning during static pre-training, the effects of such manipulations under continual pre-training remain largely unexplored. Drawing inspiration from the illusory truth effect in human cognition - where repeated exposure to falsehoods increases belief in their accuracy - we ask whether LLMs exhibit a similar vulnerability. We investigate whether repeated exposure to false but confidently stated facts can shift a model's internal representation away from the truth. We introduce Layer of Truth, a framework and dataset for probing belief dynamics in continually trained LLMs. By injecting controlled amounts of poisoned data and probing intermediate representations across checkpoints, model scales, and question types, we quantify when and how factual beliefs shift. Our findings reveal that even minimal exposure can induce persistent representational drift in well-established facts, with susceptibility varying across layers and model sizes. These results highlight an overlooked vulnerability of continually updated LLMs: their capacity to internalize misinformation analogously to humans, underscoring the need for robust monitoring of factual integrity during model updates.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>defense, attack, robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive performance across diverse tasks by jointly reasoning over textual and visual inputs. Despite their success, these models remain highly vulnerable to adversarial manipulations, raising concerns about their safety and reliability in deployment. In this work, we first generalize an approach for generating adversarial images within the HuggingFace ecosystem and then introduce SmoothGuard, a lightweight and model-agnostic defense framework that enhances the robustness of MLLMs through randomized noise injection and clustering-based prediction aggregation. Our method perturbs continuous modalities (e.g., images and audio) with Gaussian noise, generates multiple candidate outputs, and applies embedding-based clustering to filter out adversarially influenced predictions. The final answer is selected from the majority cluster, ensuring stable responses even under malicious perturbations. Extensive experiments on POPE, LLaVA-Bench (In-the-Wild), and MM-SafetyBench demonstrate that SmoothGuard improves resilience to adversarial attacks while maintaining competitive utility. Ablation studies further identify an optimal noise range (0.1-0.2) that balances robustness and utility.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present VISAT, a novel open dataset and benchmarking suite for evaluating model robustness in the task of traffic sign recognition with the presence of visual attributes. Built upon the Mapillary Traffic Sign Dataset (MTSD), our dataset introduces two benchmarks that respectively emphasize robustness against adversarial attacks and distribution shifts. For our adversarial attack benchmark, we employ the state-of-the-art Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) method to generate adversarial inputs and evaluate their impact on popular models. Additionally, we investigate the effect of adversarial attacks on attribute-specific multi-task learning (MTL) networks, revealing spurious correlations among MTL tasks. The MTL networks leverage visual attributes (color, shape, symbol, and text) that we have created for each traffic sign in our dataset. For our distribution shift benchmark, we utilize ImageNet-C's realistic data corruption and natural variation techniques to perform evaluations on the robustness of both base and MTL models. Moreover, we further explore spurious correlations among MTL tasks through synthetic alterations of traffic sign colors using color quantization techniques. Our experiments focus on two major backbones, ResNet-152 and ViT-B/32, and compare the performance between base and MTL models. The VISAT dataset and benchmarking framework contribute to the understanding of model robustness for traffic sign recognition, shedding light on the challenges posed by adversarial attacks and distribution shifts. We believe this work will facilitate advancements in developing more robust models for real-world applications in autonomous driving and cyber-physical systems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, protect, federate, fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without data sharing, yet participants face a fundamental challenge, e.g., simultaneously ensuring fairness across demographic groups while protecting sensitive client data. We introduce a differentially private fair FL algorithm (\textit{FedPF}) that transforms this multi-objective optimization into a zero-sum game where fairness and privacy constraints compete against model utility. Our theoretical analysis reveals a surprising inverse relationship, i.e., stricter privacy protection fundamentally limits the system's ability to detect and correct demographic biases, creating an inherent tension between privacy and fairness. Counterintuitively, we prove that moderate fairness constraints initially improve model generalization before causing performance degradation, where a non-monotonic relationship that challenges conventional wisdom about fairness-utility tradeoffs. Experimental validation demonstrates up to 42.9 % discrimination reduction across three datasets while maintaining competitive accuracy, but more importantly, reveals that the privacy-fairness tension is unavoidable, i.e., achieving both objectives simultaneously requires carefully balanced compromises rather than optimization of either in isolation.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Speculative decoding has become a widely adopted as an effective technique for lossless inference acceleration when deploying large language models (LLMs). While on-the-fly self-speculative methods offer seamless integration and broad utility, they often fall short of the speed gains achieved by methods relying on specialized training. Cascading a hierarchy of draft models promises further acceleration and flexibility, but the high cost of training multiple models has limited its practical application. In this paper, we propose a novel Cascade Adaptive Self-Speculative Decoding (CAS-Spec) method which constructs speculative draft models by leveraging dynamically switchable inference acceleration (DSIA) strategies, including layer sparsity and activation quantization. Furthermore, traditional vertical and horizontal cascade algorithms are inefficient when applied to self-speculative decoding methods. We introduce a Dynamic Tree Cascade (DyTC) algorithm that adaptively routes the multi-level draft models and assigns the draft lengths, based on the heuristics of acceptance rates and latency prediction. Our CAS-Spec method achieves state-of-the-art acceleration compared to existing on-the-fly speculative decoding methods, with an average speedup from $1.1\times$ to $2.3\times$ over autoregressive decoding across various LLMs and datasets. DyTC improves the average speedup by $47$\% and $48$\% over cascade-based baseline and tree-based baseline algorithms, respectively. CAS-Spec can be easily integrated into most existing LLMs and holds promising potential for further acceleration as self-speculative decoding techniques continue to evolve.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>defense, attack, robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) are susceptible to jailbreak attacks where malicious prompts are disguised using ciphers and character-level encodings to bypass safety guardrails. While these guardrails often fail to interpret the encoded content, the underlying models can still process the harmful instructions. We introduce CPT-Filtering, a novel, model-agnostic with negligible-costs and near-perfect accuracy guardrail technique that aims to mitigate these attacks by leveraging the intrinsic behavior of Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizers. Our method is based on the principle that tokenizers, trained on natural language, represent out-of-distribution text, such as ciphers, using a significantly higher number of shorter tokens. Our technique uses a simple yet powerful artifact of using language models: the average number of Characters Per Token (CPT) in the text. This approach is motivated by the high compute cost of modern methods - relying on added modules such as dedicated LLMs or perplexity models. We validate our approach across a large dataset of over 100,000 prompts, testing numerous encoding schemes with several popular tokenizers. Our experiments demonstrate that a simple CPT threshold robustly identifies encoded text with high accuracy, even for very short inputs. CPT-Filtering provides a practical defense layer that can be immediately deployed for real-time text filtering and offline data curation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are proficient at generating synthetic data but continue to suffer from mode collapse, where the generator produces a narrow range of outputs that fool the discriminator but fail to capture the full data distribution. This limitation is particularly problematic, as generative models are increasingly deployed in real-world applications that demand both diversity and uncertainty awareness. In response, we introduce BI-DCGAN, a Bayesian extension of DCGAN that incorporates model uncertainty into the generative process while maintaining computational efficiency. BI-DCGAN integrates Bayes by Backprop to learn a distribution over network weights and employs mean-field variational inference to efficiently approximate the posterior distribution during GAN training. We establishes the first theoretical proof, based on covariance matrix analysis, that Bayesian modeling enhances sample diversity in GANs. We validate this theoretical result through extensive experiments on standard generative benchmarks, demonstrating that BI-DCGAN produces more diverse and robust outputs than conventional DCGANs, while maintaining training efficiency. These findings position BI-DCGAN as a scalable and timely solution for applications where both diversity and uncertainty are critical, and where modern alternatives like diffusion models remain too resource-intensive.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This work presents an ontology-integrated large language model (LLM) framework for chemical engineering that unites structured domain knowledge with generative reasoning. The proposed pipeline aligns model training and inference with the COPE ontology through a sequence of data acquisition, semantic preprocessing, information extraction, and ontology mapping steps, producing templated question-answer pairs that guide fine-tuning. A control-focused decoding stage and citation gate enforce syntactic and factual grounding by constraining outputs to ontology-linked terms, while evaluation metrics quantify both linguistic quality and ontological accuracy. Feedback and future extensions, including semantic retrieval and iterative validation, further enhance the system's interpretability and reliability. This integration of symbolic structure and neural generation provides a transparent, auditable approach for applying LLMs to process control, safety analysis, and other critical engineering contexts.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Quantitative computed tomography (QCT) plays a crucial role in assessing bone strength and fracture risk by enabling volumetric analysis of bone density distribution in the proximal femur. However, deploying automated segmentation models in practice remains difficult because deep networks trained on one dataset often fail when applied to another. This failure stems from domain shift, where scanners, reconstruction settings, and patient demographics vary across institutions, leading to unstable predictions and unreliable quantitative metrics. Overcoming this barrier is essential for multi-center osteoporosis research and for ensuring that radiomics and structural finite element analysis results remain reproducible across sites. In this work, we developed a domain-adaptive transformer segmentation framework tailored for multi-institutional QCT. Our model is trained and validated on one of the largest hip fracture related research cohorts to date, comprising 1,024 QCT images scans from Tulane University and 384 scans from Rochester, Minnesota for proximal femur segmentation. To address domain shift, we integrate two complementary strategies within a 3D TransUNet backbone: adversarial alignment via Gradient Reversal Layer (GRL), which discourages the network from encoding site-specific cues, and statistical alignment via Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), which explicitly reduces distributional mismatches between institutions. This dual mechanism balances invariance and fine-grained alignment, enabling scanner-agnostic feature learning while preserving anatomical detail.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The decarbonization of transportation relies on the widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs), which requires an accurate understanding of charging behavior to ensure cost-effective, grid-resilient infrastructure. Existing work is constrained by small-scale datasets, simple proximity-based modeling of temporal dependencies, and weak generalization to sites with limited operational history. To overcome these limitations, this work proposes a framework that integrates clustering with few-shot forecasting to uncover site archetypes using a novel large-scale dataset of charging demand. The results demonstrate that archetype-specific expert models outperform global baselines in forecasting demand at unseen sites. By establishing forecast performance as a basis for infrastructure segmentation, we generate actionable insights that enable operators to lower costs, optimize energy and pricing strategies, and support grid resilience critical to climate goals.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Hybrid models that combine state space models (SSMs) with attention mechanisms have shown strong performance by leveraging the efficiency of SSMs and the high recall ability of attention. However, the architectural design choices behind these hybrid models remain insufficiently understood. In this work, we analyze hybrid architectures through the lens of memory utilization and overall performance, and propose a complementary method to further enhance their effectiveness. We first examine the distinction between sequential and parallel integration of SSM and attention layers. Our analysis reveals several interesting findings, including that sequential hybrids perform better on shorter contexts, whereas parallel hybrids are more effective for longer contexts. We also introduce a data-centric approach of continually training on datasets augmented with paraphrases, which further enhances recall while preserving other capabilities. It generalizes well across different base models and outperforms architectural modifications aimed at enhancing recall. Our findings provide a deeper understanding of hybrid SSM-attention models and offer practical guidance for designing architectures tailored to various use cases.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Lung nodule detection in chest CT is crucial for early lung cancer diagnosis, yet existing deep learning approaches face challenges when deployed in clinical settings with limited annotated data. While curriculum learning has shown promise in improving model training, traditional static curriculum strategies fail in data-scarce scenarios. We propose Scale Adaptive Curriculum Learning (SACL), a novel training strategy that dynamically adjusts curriculum design based on available data scale. SACL introduces three key mechanisms:(1) adaptive epoch scheduling, (2) hard sample injection, and (3) scale-aware optimization. We evaluate SACL on the LUNA25 dataset using YOLOv11 as the base detector. Experimental results demonstrate that while SACL achieves comparable performance to static curriculum learning on the full dataset in mAP50, it shows significant advantages under data-limited conditions with 4.6%, 3.5%, and 2.0% improvements over baseline at 10%, 20%, and 50% of training data respectively. By enabling robust training across varying data scales without architectural modifications, SACL provides a practical solution for healthcare institutions to develop effective lung nodule detection systems despite limited annotation resources.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Next location prediction underpins a growing number of mobility, retail, and public-health applications, yet its societal impacts remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we audit state-of-the-art mobility prediction models trained on a large-scale dataset, highlighting hidden disparities based on user demographics. Drawing from aggregate census data, we compute the difference in predictive performance on racial and ethnic user groups and show a systematic disparity resulting from the underlying dataset, resulting in large differences in accuracy based on location and user groups. To address this, we propose Fairness-Guided Incremental Sampling (FGIS), a group-aware sampling strategy designed for incremental data collection settings. Because individual-level demographic labels are unavailable, we introduce Size-Aware K-Means (SAKM), a clustering method that partitions users in latent mobility space while enforcing census-derived group proportions. This yields proxy racial labels for the four largest groups in the state: Asian, Black, Hispanic, and White. Built on these labels, our sampling algorithm prioritizes users based on expected performance gains and current group representation. This method incrementally constructs training datasets that reduce demographic performance gaps while preserving overall accuracy. Our method reduces total disparity between groups by up to 40\% with minimal accuracy trade-offs, as evaluated on a state-of-art MetaPath2Vec model and a transformer-encoder model. Improvements are most significant in early sampling stages, highlighting the potential for fairness-aware strategies to deliver meaningful gains even in low-resource settings. Our findings expose structural inequities in mobility prediction pipelines and demonstrate how lightweight, data-centric interventions can improve fairness with little added complexity, especially for low-data applications.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The Internet of Things has expanded rapidly, transforming communication and operations across industries but also increasing the attack surface and security breaches. Artificial Intelligence plays a key role in securing IoT, enabling attack detection, attack behavior analysis, and mitigation suggestion. Despite advancements, evaluations remain purely qualitative, and the lack of a standardized, objective benchmark for quantitatively measuring AI-based attack analysis and mitigation hinders consistent assessment of model effectiveness. In this work, we propose a hybrid framework combining Machine Learning (ML) for multi-class attack detection with Large Language Models (LLMs) for attack behavior analysis and mitigation suggestion. After benchmarking several ML and Deep Learning (DL) classifiers on the Edge-IIoTset and CICIoT2023 datasets, we applied structured role-play prompt engineering with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to guide ChatGPT-o3 and DeepSeek-R1 in producing detailed, context-aware responses. We introduce novel evaluation metrics for quantitative assessment to guide us and an ensemble of judge LLMs, namely ChatGPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, Mixtral 8x7B Instruct, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Meta Llama 4, TII Falcon H1 34B Instruct, xAI Grok 3, and Claude 4 Sonnet, to independently evaluate the responses. Results show that Random Forest has the best detection model, and ChatGPT-o3 outperformed DeepSeek-R1 in attack analysis and mitigation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Monitoring household water use in rapidly urbanizing regions is hampered by costly, time-intensive enumeration methods and surveys. We investigate whether publicly available imagery-satellite tiles, Google Street View (GSV) segmentation-and simple geospatial covariates (nightlight intensity, population density) can be utilized to predict household water consumption in Hubballi-Dharwad, India. We compare four approaches: survey features (benchmark), CNN embeddings (satellite, GSV, combined), and GSV semantic maps with auxiliary data. Under an ordinal classification framework, GSV segmentation plus remote-sensing covariates achieves 0.55 accuracy for water use, approaching survey-based models (0.59 accuracy). Error analysis shows high precision at extremes of the household water consumption distribution, but confusion among middle classes is due to overlapping visual proxies. We also compare and contrast our estimates for household water consumption to that of household subjective income. Our findings demonstrate that open-access imagery, coupled with minimal geospatial data, offers a promising alternative to obtaining reliable household water consumption estimates using surveys in urban analytics.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, transformer, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Automated segmentation of heterogeneous brain lesions from multi-modal MRI remains a critical challenge in clinical neuroimaging. Current deep learning models are typically specialized `point solutions' that lack generalization and high performance variance, limiting their clinical reliability. To address these gaps, we propose the Unified Multi-Stream SYNAPSE-Net, an adaptive framework designed for both generalization and robustness. The framework is built on a novel hybrid architecture integrating multi-stream CNN encoders, a Swin Transformer bottleneck for global context, a dynamic cross-modal attention fusion (CMAF) mechanism, and a hierarchical gated decoder for high-fidelity mask reconstruction. The architecture is trained with a variance reduction strategy that combines pathology specific data augmentation and difficulty-aware sampling method. The model was evaluated on three different challenging public datasets: the MICCAI 2017 WMH Challenge, the ISLES 2022 Challenge, and the BraTS 2020 Challenge. Our framework attained a state-of-the-art DSC value of 0.831 with the HD95 value of 3.03 in the WMH dataset. For ISLES 2022, it achieved the best boundary accuracy with a statistically significant difference (HD95 value of 9.69). For BraTS 2020, it reached the highest DSC value for the tumor core region (0.8651). These experimental findings suggest that our unified adaptive framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple brain pathologies, providing a robust and clinically feasible solution for automated segmentation.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce a methodology for the identification of notifiable events in the domain of healthcare. The methodology harnesses semantic frames to define fine-grained patterns and search them in unstructured data, namely, open-text fields in e-medical records. We apply the methodology to the problem of underreporting of gender-based violence (GBV) in e-medical records produced during patients' visits to primary care units. A total of eight patterns are defined and searched on a corpus of 21 million sentences in Brazilian Portuguese extracted from e-SUS APS. The results are manually evaluated by linguists and the precision of each pattern measured. Our findings reveal that the methodology effectively identifies reports of violence with a precision of 0.726, confirming its robustness. Designed as a transparent, efficient, low-carbon, and language-agnostic pipeline, the approach can be easily adapted to other health surveillance contexts, contributing to the broader, ethical, and explainable use of NLP in public health systems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Live commenting on video streams has surged in popularity on platforms like Twitch, enhancing viewer engagement through dynamic interactions. However, automatically generating contextually appropriate comments remains a challenging and exciting task. Video streams can contain a vast amount of data and extraneous content. Existing approaches tend to overlook an important aspect of prioritizing video frames that are most relevant to ongoing viewer interactions. This prioritization is crucial for producing contextually appropriate comments. To address this gap, we introduce a novel Semantic Frame Aggregation-based Transformer (SFAT) model for live video comment generation. This method not only leverages CLIP's visual-text multimodal knowledge to generate comments but also assigns weights to video frames based on their semantic relevance to ongoing viewer conversation. It employs an efficient weighted sum of frames technique to emphasize informative frames while focusing less on irrelevant ones. Finally, our comment decoder with a cross-attention mechanism that attends to each modality ensures that the generated comment reflects contextual cues from both chats and video. Furthermore, to address the limitations of existing datasets, which predominantly focus on Chinese-language content with limited video categories, we have constructed a large scale, diverse, multimodal English video comments dataset. Extracted from Twitch, this dataset covers 11 video categories, totaling 438 hours and 3.2 million comments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our SFAT model by comparing it to existing methods for generating comments from live video and ongoing dialogue contexts.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This work tackles a critical challenge in AI safety research under limited compute: given a fixed computation budget, how can one maximize the strength of iterative adversarial attacks? Coarsely reducing the number of attack iterations lowers cost but substantially weakens effectiveness. To fulfill the attainable attack efficacy within a constrained budget, we propose a fine-grained control mechanism that selectively recomputes layer activations across both iteration-wise and layer-wise levels. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently outperforms existing baselines at equal cost. Moreover, when integrated into adversarial training, it attains comparable performance with only 30% of the original budget.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) promise more effective information extraction for review-based recommender systems, yet current methods still (i) mine free-form reviews without scope control, producing redundant and noisy representations, (ii) lack principled metrics that link LLM hallucination to downstream effectiveness, and (iii) leave the cost-quality trade-off across model scales largely unexplored. We address these gaps with the Hyper-Adaptive Dual-Stage Semantic Framework (HADSF), a two-stage approach that first induces a compact, corpus-level aspect vocabulary via adaptive selection and then performs vocabulary-guided, explicitly constrained extraction of structured aspect-opinion triples. To assess the fidelity of the resulting representations, we introduce Aspect Drift Rate (ADR) and Opinion Fidelity Rate (OFR) and empirically uncover a nonmonotonic relationship between hallucination severity and rating prediction error. Experiments on approximately 3 million reviews across LLMs spanning 1.5B-70B parameters show that, when integrated into standard rating predictors, HADSF yields consistent reductions in prediction error and enables smaller models to achieve competitive performance in representative deployment scenarios. We release code, data pipelines, and metric implementations to support reproducible research on hallucination-aware, LLM-enhanced explainable recommendation. Code is available at this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this study, we propose MoME, a Mixture of Visual Language Medical Experts, for Medical Image Segmentation. MoME adapts the successful Mixture of Experts (MoE) paradigm, widely used in Large Language Models (LLMs), for medical vision-language tasks. The architecture enables dynamic expert selection by effectively utilizing multi-scale visual features tailored to the intricacies of medical imagery, enriched with textual embeddings. This work explores a novel integration of vision-language models for this domain. Utilizing an assembly of 10 datasets, encompassing 3,410 CT scans, MoME demonstrates strong performance on a comprehensive medical imaging segmentation benchmark. Our approach explores the integration of foundation models for medical imaging, benefiting from the established efficacy of MoE in boosting model performance by incorporating textual information. Demonstrating competitive precision across multiple datasets, MoME explores a novel architecture for achieving robust results in medical image analysis.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multi-armed bandit (MAB) problems serve as a fundamental building block for more complex reinforcement learning algorithms. However, evaluating and comparing MAB algorithms remains challenging due to the lack of standardized conditions and replicability. This is particularly problematic for variance-aware extensions of classical methods like UCB, whose performance can heavily depend on the underlying environment. In this study, we address how performance differences between bandit algorithms can be reliably observed, and under what conditions variance-aware algorithms outperform classical ones. We present a reproducible evaluation designed to systematically compare eight classical and variance-aware MAB algorithms. The evaluation framework, implemented in our Bandit Playground codebase, features clearly defined experimental setups, multiple performance metrics (reward, regret, reward distribution, value-at-risk, and action optimality), and an interactive evaluation interface that supports consistent and transparent analysis. We show that variance-aware algorithms can offer advantages in settings with high uncertainty where the difficulty arises from subtle differences between arm rewards. In contrast, classical algorithms often perform equally well or better in more separable scenarios or if fine-tuned extensively. Our contributions are twofold: (1) a framework for systematic evaluation of MAB algorithms, and (2) insights into the conditions under which variance-aware approaches outperform their classical counterparts.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models improve transformer efficiency but lack a unified theoretical explanation, especially when both feed-forward and attention layers are allowed to specialize. To this end, we study the Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT), a tractable theoretical framework in which each transformer block acts as an expert governed by a continuously trained gating network. This design allows us to isolate and study the core learning dynamics of expert specialization and attention alignment. In particular, we develop a three-stage training algorithm with continuous training of the gating network, and show that each transformer expert specializes in a distinct class of tasks and that the gating network accurately routes data samples to the correct expert. Our analysis shows how expert specialization reduces gradient conflicts and makes each subtask strongly convex. We prove that the training drives the expected prediction loss to near zero in $O(\log(\epsilon^{-1}))$ iteration steps, significantly improving over the $O(\epsilon^{-1})$ rate for a single transformer. We further validate our theoretical findings through extensive real-data experiments, demonstrating the practical effectiveness of MoT. Together, these results offer the first unified theoretical account of transformer-level specialization and learning dynamics, providing practical guidance for designing efficient large-scale models.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper presents a novel approach to sentiment classification using the application of Combinatorial Fusion Analysis (CFA) to integrate an ensemble of diverse machine learning models, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on the IMDB sentiment analysis dataset of 97.072\%. CFA leverages the concept of cognitive diversity, which utilizes rank-score characteristic functions to quantify the dissimilarity between models and strategically combine their predictions. This is in contrast to the common process of scaling the size of individual models, and thus is comparatively efficient in computing resource use. Experimental results also indicate that CFA outperforms traditional ensemble methods by effectively computing and employing model diversity. The approach in this paper implements the combination of a transformer-based model of the RoBERTa architecture with traditional machine learning models, including Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We study the problem of length generalization (LG) in transformers: the ability of a model trained on shorter sequences to maintain performance when evaluated on much longer, previously unseen inputs. Prior work by Huang et al. (2025) established that transformers eventually achieve length generalization once the training sequence length exceeds some finite threshold, but left open the question of how large it must be. In this work, we provide the first quantitative bounds on the required training length for length generalization to occur. Motivated by previous empirical and theoretical work, we analyze LG in several distinct problem settings: $\ell_\infty$ error control vs. average error control over an input distribution, infinite-precision softmax attention vs. finite-precision attention (which reduces to an argmax) in the transformer, and one- vs. two-layer transformers. In all scenarios, we prove that LG occurs when the internal behavior of the transformer on longer sequences can be "simulated" by its behavior on shorter sequences seen during training. Our bounds give qualitative estimates for the length of training data required for a transformer to generalize, and we verify these insights empirically. These results sharpen our theoretical understanding of the mechanisms underlying extrapolation in transformers, and formalize the intuition that richer training data is required for generalization on more complex tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, privacy, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the increasing use of conversational AI systems, there is growing concern over privacy leaks, especially when users share sensitive personal data in interactions with Large Language Models (LLMs). Conversations shared with these models may contain Personally Identifiable Information (PII), which, if exposed, could lead to security breaches or identity theft. To address this challenge, we present the Local Optimizations for Pseudonymization with Semantic Integrity Directed Entity Detection (LOPSIDED) framework, a semantically-aware privacy agent designed to safeguard sensitive PII data when using remote LLMs. Unlike prior work that often degrade response quality, our approach dynamically replaces sensitive PII entities in user prompts with semantically consistent pseudonyms, preserving the contextual integrity of conversations. Once the model generates its response, the pseudonyms are automatically depseudonymized, ensuring the user receives an accurate, privacy-preserving output. We evaluate our approach using real-world conversations sourced from ShareGPT, which we further augment and annotate to assess whether named entities are contextually relevant to the model's response. Our results show that LOPSIDED reduces semantic utility errors by a factor of 5 compared to baseline techniques, all while enhancing privacy.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Several previous works concluded that the largest part of generation capabilities of large language models (LLM) are learned (early) during pre-training. However, LLMs still require further alignment to adhere to downstream task requirements and stylistic preferences, among other desired properties. As LLMs continue to scale in terms of size, the computational cost of alignment procedures increase prohibitively. In this work, we propose a novel approach to circumvent these costs via proxy-based test-time alignment, i.e. using guidance from a small aligned model. Our approach can be described as token-specific cascading method, where the token-specific deferral rule is reduced to 0-1 knapsack problem. In this setting, we derive primal and dual approximations of the optimal deferral decision. We experimentally show the benefits of our method both in task performance and speculative decoding speed.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In open-world environments, human-object interactions (HOIs) evolve continuously, challenging conventional closed-world HOI detection models. Inspired by humans' ability to progressively acquire knowledge, we explore incremental HOI detection (IHOID) to develop agents capable of discerning human-object relations in such dynamic environments. This setup confronts not only the common issue of catastrophic forgetting in incremental learning but also distinct challenges posed by interaction drift and detecting zero-shot HOI combinations with sequentially arriving data. Therefore, we propose a novel exemplar-free incremental relation distillation (IRD) framework. IRD decouples the learning of objects and relations, and introduces two unique distillation losses for learning invariant relation features across different HOI combinations that share the same relation. Extensive experiments on HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines in mitigating forgetting, strengthening robustness against interaction drift, and generalization on zero-shot HOIs.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This report introduces VitalLens 2.0, a new deep learning model for estimating physiological signals from face video. This new model demonstrates a significant leap in accuracy for remote photoplethysmography (rPPG), enabling the robust estimation of not only heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR) but also Heart Rate Variability (HRV) metrics. This advance is achieved through a combination of a new model architecture and a substantial increase in the size and diversity of our training data, now totaling 1,413 unique individuals. We evaluate VitalLens 2.0 on a new, combined test set of 422 unique individuals from four public and private datasets. When averaging results by individual, VitalLens 2.0 achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.57 bpm for HR, 1.08 bpm for RR, 10.18 ms for HRV-SDNN, and 16.45 ms for HRV-RMSSD. These results represent a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming previous methods. This model is now available to developers via the VitalLens API at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As large pre-trained language models become increasingly critical to natural language understanding (NLU) tasks, their substantial computational and memory requirements have raised significant economic and environmental concerns. Addressing these challenges, this paper introduces the Elastic Language Model (ELM), a novel neural architecture search (NAS) method optimized for compact language models. ELM extends existing NAS approaches by introducing a flexible search space with efficient transformer blocks and dynamic modules for dimension and head number adjustment. These innovations enhance the efficiency and flexibility of the search process, which facilitates more thorough and effective exploration of model architectures. We also introduce novel knowledge distillation losses that preserve the unique characteristics of each block, in order to improve the discrimination between architectural choices during the search process. Experiments on masked language modeling and causal language modeling tasks demonstrate that models discovered by ELM significantly outperform existing methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Mathematical reasoning is a central challenge for large language models (LLMs), requiring not only correct answers but also faithful reasoning processes. Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising approach for enhancing such capabilities; however, its ability to foster genuine reasoning remains unclear. We investigate RLVR on two combinatorial problems with fully verifiable solutions: \emph{Activity Scheduling} and the \emph{Longest Increasing Subsequence}, using carefully curated datasets with unique optima. Across multiple reward designs, we find that RLVR improves evaluation metrics but often by reinforcing superficial heuristics rather than acquiring new reasoning strategies. These findings highlight the limits of RLVR generalization, emphasizing the importance of benchmarks that disentangle genuine mathematical reasoning from shortcut exploitation and provide faithful measures of progress.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper presents the Autonomous Driving Segment Anything Model (AD-SAM), a fine-tuned vision foundation model for semantic segmentation in autonomous driving (AD). AD-SAM extends the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with a dual-encoder and deformable decoder tailored to spatial and geometric complexity of road scenes. The dual-encoder produces multi-scale fused representations by combining global semantic context from SAM's pretrained Vision Transformer (ViT-H) with local spatial detail from a trainable convolutional deep learning backbone (i.e., ResNet-50). A deformable fusion module aligns heterogeneous features across scales and object geometries. The decoder performs progressive multi-stage refinement using deformable attention. Training is guided by a hybrid loss that integrates Focal, Dice, Lovasz-Softmax, and Surface losses, improving semantic class balance, boundary precision, and optimization stability. Experiments on the Cityscapes and Berkeley DeepDrive 100K (BDD100K) benchmarks show that AD-SAM surpasses SAM, Generalized SAM (G-SAM), and a deep learning baseline (DeepLabV3) in segmentation accuracy. It achieves 68.1 mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) on Cityscapes and 59.5 mIoU on BDD100K, outperforming SAM, G-SAM, and DeepLabV3 by margins of up to +22.9 and +19.2 mIoU in structured and diverse road scenes, respectively. AD-SAM demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization with a 0.87 retention score (vs. 0.76 for SAM), and faster, more stable learning dynamics, converging within 30-40 epochs, enjoying double the learning speed of benchmark models. It maintains 0.607 mIoU with only 1000 samples, suggesting data efficiency critical for reducing annotation costs. These results confirm that targeted architectural and optimization enhancements to foundation models enable reliable and scalable AD perception.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Hallucination--defined here as generating statements unsupported or contradicted by available evidence or conversational context--remains a major obstacle to deploying conversational AI systems in settings that demand factual reliability. Existing metrics either evaluate isolated responses or treat unverifiable content as errors, limiting their use for multi-turn dialogue. We introduce VISTA (Verification In Sequential Turn-based Assessment), a framework for evaluating conversational factuality through claim-level verification and sequential consistency tracking. VISTA decomposes each assistant turn into atomic factual claims, verifies them against trusted sources and dialogue history, and categorizes unverifiable statements (subjective, contradicted, lacking evidence, or abstaining). Across eight large language models and four dialogue factuality benchmarks (AIS, BEGIN, FAITHDIAL, and FADE), VISTA substantially improves hallucination detection over FACTSCORE and LLM-as-Judge baselines. Human evaluation confirms that VISTA's decomposition improves annotator agreement and reveals inconsistencies in existing benchmarks. By modeling factuality as a dynamic property of conversation, VISTA offers a more transparent, human-aligned measure of truthfulness in dialogue systems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper addresses the issues of insufficient coverage, unstable results, and limited reliability in retrieval-augmented generation under complex knowledge environments, and proposes a confidence control method that integrates multi-granularity memory indexing with uncertainty estimation. The method builds a hierarchical memory structure that divides knowledge representations into different levels of granularity, enabling dynamic indexing and retrieval from local details to global context, and thus establishing closer semantic connections between retrieval and generation. On this basis, an uncertainty estimation mechanism is introduced to explicitly constrain and filter low-confidence paths during the generation process, allowing the model to maintain information coverage while effectively suppressing noise and false content. The overall optimization objective consists of generation loss, entropy constraints, and variance regularization, forming a unified confidence control framework. In the experiments, comprehensive sensitivity tests and comparative analyses were designed, covering hyperparameters, environmental conditions, and data structures, to verify the stability and robustness of the proposed method across different scenarios. The results show that the method achieves superior performance over existing models in QA accuracy, retrieval recall, ranking quality, and factual consistency, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining multi-granularity indexing with confidence control. This study not only provides a new technical pathway for retrieval-augmented generation but also offers practical evidence for improving the reliability and controllability of large models in complex contexts.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present Contamination Detection via Context (CoDeC), a practical and accurate method to detect and quantify training data contamination in large language models. CoDeC distinguishes between data memorized during training and data outside the training distribution by measuring how in-context learning affects model performance. We find that in-context examples typically boost confidence for unseen datasets but may reduce it when the dataset was part of training, due to disrupted memorization patterns. Experiments show that CoDeC produces interpretable contamination scores that clearly separate seen and unseen datasets, and reveals strong evidence of memorization in open-weight models with undisclosed training corpora. The method is simple, automated, and both model- and dataset-agnostic, making it easy to integrate with benchmark evaluations.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present MLPerf Automotive, the first standardized public benchmark for evaluating Machine Learning systems that are deployed for AI acceleration in automotive systems. Developed through a collaborative partnership between MLCommons and the Autonomous Vehicle Computing Consortium, this benchmark addresses the need for standardized performance evaluation methodologies in automotive machine learning systems. Existing benchmark suites cannot be utilized for these systems since automotive workloads have unique constraints including safety and real-time processing that distinguish them from the domains that previously introduced benchmarks target. Our benchmarking framework provides latency and accuracy metrics along with evaluation protocols that enable consistent and reproducible performance comparisons across different hardware platforms and software implementations. The first iteration of the benchmark consists of automotive perception tasks in 2D object detection, 2D semantic segmentation, and 3D object detection. We describe the methodology behind the benchmark design including the task selection, reference models, and submission rules. We also discuss the first round of benchmark submissions and the challenges involved in acquiring the datasets and the engineering efforts to develop the reference implementations.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in large language model (LLM) reasoning, led by reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), have inspired self-play post-training, where models improve by generating and solving their own problems. While self-play has shown strong in-domain and out-of-domain gains, the mechanisms behind these improvements remain poorly understood. In this work, we analyze the training dynamics of self-play through the lens of the Absolute Zero Reasoner, comparing it against RLVR and supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Our study examines parameter update sparsity, entropy dynamics of token distributions, and alternative proposer reward functions. We further connect these dynamics to reasoning performance using pass@k evaluations. Together, our findings clarify how self-play differs from other post-training strategies, highlight its inherent limitations, and point toward future directions for improving LLM math reasoning through self-play.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper addresses the limitations of large-scale language models in safety alignment and robustness by proposing a fine-tuning method that combines contrastive distillation with noise-robust training. The method freezes the backbone model and transfers the knowledge boundaries of the teacher model to the student model through distillation, thereby improving semantic consistency and alignment accuracy. At the same time, noise perturbations and robust optimization constraints are introduced during training to ensure that the model maintains stable predictive outputs under noisy and uncertain inputs. The overall framework consists of distillation loss, robustness loss, and a regularization term, forming a unified optimization objective that balances alignment ability with resistance to interference. To systematically validate its effectiveness, the study designs experiments from multiple perspectives, including distillation weight sensitivity, stability analysis under computation budgets and mixed-precision environments, and the impact of data noise and distribution shifts on model performance. Results show that the method significantly outperforms existing baselines in knowledge transfer, robustness, and overall safety, achieving the best performance across several key metrics. This work not only enriches the theoretical system of parameter-efficient fine-tuning but also provides a new solution for building safer and more trustworthy alignment mechanisms.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, attack, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Security applications are increasingly relying on large language models (LLMs) for cyber threat detection; however, their opaque reasoning often limits trust, particularly in decisions that require domain-specific cybersecurity knowledge. Because security threats evolve rapidly, LLMs must not only recall historical incidents but also adapt to emerging vulnerabilities and attack patterns. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated effectiveness in general LLM applications, but its potential for cybersecurity remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce a RAG-based framework designed to contextualize cybersecurity data and enhance LLM accuracy in knowledge retention and temporal reasoning. Using external datasets and the Llama-3-8B-Instruct model, we evaluate baseline RAG, an optimized hybrid retrieval approach, and conduct a comparative analysis across multiple performance metrics. Our findings highlight the promise of hybrid retrieval in strengthening the adaptability and reliability of LLMs for cybersecurity tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Safety guardrails in large language models(LLMs) are developed to prevent malicious users from generating toxic content at a large scale. However, these measures can inadvertently introduce or reflect new biases, as LLMs may refuse to generate harmful content targeting some demographic groups and not others. We explore this selective refusal bias in LLM guardrails through the lens of refusal rates of targeted individual and intersectional demographic groups, types of LLM responses, and length of generated refusals. Our results show evidence of selective refusal bias across gender, sexual orientation, nationality, and religion attributes. This leads us to investigate additional safety implications via an indirect attack, where we target previously refused groups. Our findings emphasize the need for more equitable and robust performance in safety guardrails across demographic groups.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce HiT, a novel hierarchical neural field representation for 3D shapes that learns general hierarchies in a coarse-to-fine manner across different shape categories in an unsupervised setting. Our key contribution is a hierarchical transformer (HiT), where each level learns parent-child relationships of the tree hierarchy using a compressed codebook. This codebook enables the network to automatically identify common substructures across potentially diverse shape categories. Unlike previous works that constrain the task to a fixed hierarchical structure (e.g., binary), we impose no such restriction, except for limiting the total number of nodes at each tree level. This flexibility allows our method to infer the hierarchical structure directly from data, over multiple shape categories, and representing more general and complex hierarchies than prior approaches. When trained at scale with a reconstruction loss, our model captures meaningful containment relationships between parent and child nodes. We demonstrate its effectiveness through an unsupervised shape segmentation task over all 55 ShapeNet categories, where our method successfully segments shapes into multiple levels of granularity.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Aggregating intracranial recordings across subjects is challenging since electrode count, placement, and covered regions vary widely. Spatial normalization methods like MNI coordinates offer a shared anatomical reference, but often fail to capture true functional similarity, particularly when localization is imprecise; even at matched anatomical coordinates, the targeted brain region and underlying neural dynamics can differ substantially between individuals. We propose a scalable representation-learning framework that (i) learns a subject-agnostic functional identity for each electrode from multi-region local field potentials using a Siamese encoder with contrastive objectives, inducing an embedding geometry that is locality-sensitive to region-specific neural signatures, and (ii) tokenizes these embeddings for a transformer that models inter-regional relationships with a variable number of channels. We evaluate this framework on a 20-subject dataset spanning basal ganglia-thalamic regions collected during flexible rest/movement recording sessions with heterogeneous electrode layouts. The learned functional space supports accurate within-subject discrimination and forms clear, region-consistent clusters; it transfers zero-shot to unseen channels. The transformer, operating on functional tokens without subject-specific heads or supervision, captures cross-region dependencies and enables reconstruction of masked channels, providing a subject-agnostic backbone for downstream decoding. Together, these results indicate a path toward large-scale, cross-subject aggregation and pretraining for intracranial neural data where strict task structure and uniform sensor placement are unavailable.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Quantum theory provides non-classical principles, such as superposition and entanglement, that inspires promising paradigms in machine learning. However, most existing quantum-inspired fusion models rely solely on unitary or unitary-like transformations to generate quantum entanglement. While theoretically expressive, such approaches often suffer from training instability and limited generalizability. In this work, we propose a Quantum-inspired Neural Network with Quantum Jump (QiNN-QJ) for multimodal entanglement modelling. Each modality is firstly encoded as a quantum pure state, after which a differentiable module simulating the QJ operator transforms the separable product state into the entangled representation. By jointly learning Hamiltonian and Lindblad operators, QiNN-QJ generates controllable cross-modal entanglement among modalities with dissipative dynamics, where structured stochasticity and steady-state attractor properties serve to stabilize training and constrain entanglement shaping. The resulting entangled states are projected onto trainable measurement vectors to produce predictions. In addition to achieving superior performance over the state-of-the-art models on benchmark datasets, including CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, and CH-SIMS, QiNN-QJ facilitates enhanced post-hoc interpretability through von-Neumann entanglement entropy. This work establishes a principled framework for entangled multimodal fusion and paves the way for quantum-inspired approaches in modelling complex cross-modal correlations.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Bulk tissue RNA sequencing of heterogeneous samples provides averaged gene expression profiles, obscuring cell type-specific dynamics. To address this, we present a probabilistic hierarchical Bayesian model that deconvolves bulk RNA-seq data into constituent cell-type expression profiles and proportions, leveraging a high-resolution single-cell reference. We apply our model to human endometrial tissue across the menstrual cycle, a context characterized by dramatic hormone-driven cellular composition changes. Our extended framework provides a principled inference of cell type proportions and cell-specific gene expression changes across cycle phases. We demonstrate the model's structure, priors, and inference strategy in detail, and we validate its performance with simulations and comparisons to existing methods. The results reveal dynamic shifts in epithelial, stromal, and immune cell fractions between menstrual phases, and identify cell-type-specific differential gene expression associated with endometrial function (e.g., decidualization markers in stromal cells during the secretory phase). We further conduct robustness tests and show that our Bayesian approach is resilient to reference mismatches and noise. Finally, we discuss the biological significance of our findings, potential clinical implications for fertility and endometrial disorders, and future directions, including integration of spatial transcriptomics.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As Natural Language Generation (NLG) continues to be widely adopted, properly assessing it has become quite difficult. Lately, using large language models (LLMs) for evaluating these generations has gained traction, as they tend to align more closely with human preferences than conventional n-gram or embedding-based metrics. In our experiments, we show that LLM judges have low intra-rater reliability in their assigned scores across different runs. This variance makes their ratings inconsistent, almost arbitrary in the worst case, making it difficult to measure how good their judgments actually are. We quantify this inconsistency across different NLG tasks and benchmarks and see if judicious use of LLM judges can still be useful following proper guidelines.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Most expressivity results for transformers treat them as language recognizers (which accept or reject strings), and not as they are used in practice, as language models (which generate strings autoregressively and probabilistically). Here, we characterize the probability distributions that transformer language models can express. We show that making transformer language recognizers autoregressive can sometimes increase their expressivity, and that making them probabilistic can break equivalences that hold in the non-probabilistic case. Our overall contribution is to tease apart what functions transformers are capable of expressing, in their most common use-case as language models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Offline contextual bandits allow one to learn policies from historical/offline data without requiring online interaction. However, offline policy optimization that maximizes overall expected rewards can unintentionally amplify the reward disparities across groups. As a result, some groups might benefit more than others from the learned policy, raising concerns about fairness, especially when the resources are limited. In this paper, we study a group-sensitive fairness constraint in offline contextual bandits, reducing group-wise reward disparities that may arise during policy learning. We tackle the following common-parity requirements: the reward disparity is constrained within some user-defined threshold or the reward disparity should be minimized during policy optimization. We propose a constrained offline policy optimization framework by introducing group-wise reward disparity constraints into an off-policy gradient-based optimization procedure. To improve the estimation of the group-wise reward disparity during training, we employ a doubly robust estimator and further provide a convergence guarantee for policy optimization. Empirical results in synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method effectively reduces reward disparities while maintaining competitive overall performance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>protect, robust, extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the widespread adoption of deep neural networks (DNNs), protecting intellectual property and detecting unauthorized tampering of models have become pressing challenges. Recently, Perceptual hashing has emerged as an effective approach for identifying pirated models. However, existing methods either rely on neural networks for feature extraction, demanding substantial training resources, or suffer from limited applicability and cannot be universally applied to all convolutional neural networks (CNNs). To address these limitations, we propose a lightweight CNN model hashing technique that integrates higher-order statistics (HOS) features with a chaotic mapping mechanism. Without requiring any auxiliary neural network training, our method enables efficient piracy detection and precise tampering localization. Specifically, we extract skewness, kurtosis, and structural features from the parameters of each network layer to construct a model hash that is both robust and discriminative. Additionally, we introduce chaotic mapping to amplify minor changes in model parameters by exploiting the sensitivity of chaotic systems to initial conditions, thereby facilitating accurate localization of tampered regions. Experimental results validate the effectiveness and practical value of the proposed method for model copyright protection and integrity verification.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Artificial intelligence (AI) agents are emerging as transformative tools in drug discovery, with the ability to autonomously reason, act, and learn through complicated research workflows. Building on large language models (LLMs) coupled with perception, computation, action, and memory tools, these agentic AI systems could integrate diverse biomedical data, execute tasks, carry out experiments via robotic platforms, and iteratively refine hypotheses in closed loops. We provide a conceptual and technical overview of agentic AI architectures, ranging from ReAct and Reflection to Supervisor and Swarm systems, and illustrate their applications across key stages of drug discovery, including literature synthesis, toxicity prediction, automated protocol generation, small-molecule synthesis, drug repurposing, and end-to-end decision-making. To our knowledge, this represents the first comprehensive work to present real-world implementations and quantifiable impacts of agentic AI systems deployed in operational drug discovery settings. Early implementations demonstrate substantial gains in speed, reproducibility, and scalability, compressing workflows that once took months into hours while maintaining scientific traceability. We discuss the current challenges related to data heterogeneity, system reliability, privacy, and benchmarking, and outline future directions towards technology in support of science and translation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This study explored the utilities of rationales generated by GPT-4.1 and GPT-5 in automated scoring using Prompt 6 essays from the 2012 Kaggle ASAP data. Essay-based scoring was compared with rationale-based scoring. The study found in general essay-based scoring performed better than rationale-based scoring with higher Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK). However, rationale-based scoring led to higher scoring accuracy in terms of F1 scores for score 0 which had less representation due to class imbalance issues. The ensemble modeling of essay-based scoring models increased the scoring accuracy at both specific score levels and across all score levels. The ensemble modeling of essay-based scoring and each of the rationale-based scoring performed about the same. Further ensemble of essay-based scoring and both rationale-based scoring yielded the best scoring accuracy with QWK of 0.870 compared with 0.848 reported in literature.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, transformer, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models have shown strong capabilities in generating high-quality images from text prompts. However, these models often require large-scale training data and significant computational resources to train, or suffer from heavy structure with high latency. To this end, we propose Efficient Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (E-MMDiT), an efficient and lightweight multimodal diffusion model with only 304M parameters for fast image synthesis requiring low training resources. We provide an easily reproducible baseline with competitive results. Our model for 512px generation, trained with only 25M public data in 1.5 days on a single node of 8 AMD MI300X GPUs, achieves 0.66 on GenEval and easily reaches to 0.72 with some post-training techniques such as GRPO. Our design philosophy centers on token reduction as the computational cost scales significantly with the token count. We adopt a highly compressive visual tokenizer to produce a more compact representation and propose a novel multi-path compression module for further compression of tokens. To enhance our design, we introduce Position Reinforcement, which strengthens positional information to maintain spatial coherence, and Alternating Subregion Attention (ASA), which performs attention within subregions to further reduce computational cost. In addition, we propose AdaLN-affine, an efficient lightweight module for computing modulation parameters in transformer blocks. Our code is available at this https URL and we hope E-MMDiT serves as a strong and practical baseline for future research and contributes to democratization of generative AI models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>protect, fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Due to the growing concern about unsavory behaviors of machine learning models toward certain demographic groups, the notion of 'fairness' has recently drawn much attention from the community, thereby motivating the study of fairness in graph clustering. Fair graph clustering aims to partition the set of nodes in a graph into $k$ disjoint clusters such that the proportion of each protected group within each cluster is consistent with the proportion of that group in the entire dataset. It is, however, computationally challenging to incorporate fairness constraints into existing graph clustering algorithms, particularly for large graphs. To address this problem, we propose FairAD, a computationally efficient fair graph clustering method. It first constructs a new affinity matrix based on the notion of algebraic distance such that fairness constraints are imposed. A graph coarsening process is then performed on this affinity matrix to find representative nodes that correspond to $k$ clusters. Finally, a constrained minimization problem is solved to obtain the solution of fair clustering. Experiment results on the modified stochastic block model and six public datasets show that FairAD can achieve fair clustering while being up to 40 times faster compared to state-of-the-art fair graph clustering algorithms.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, attack, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed software development, enabling AI-powered applications known as LLM-based agents that promise to automate tasks across diverse apps and workflows. Yet, the security implications of deploying such agents in adversarial mobile environments remain poorly understood. In this paper, we present the first systematic study of security risks in mobile LLM agents. We design and evaluate a suite of adversarial case studies, ranging from opportunistic manipulations such as pop-up advertisements to advanced, end-to-end workflows involving malware installation and cross-app data exfiltration. Our evaluation covers eight state-of-the-art mobile agents across three architectures, with over 2,000 adversarial and paired benign trials. The results reveal systemic vulnerabilities: low-barrier vectors such as fraudulent ads succeed with over 80% reliability, while even workflows requiring the circumvention of operating-system warnings, such as malware installation, are consistently completed by advanced multi-app agents. By mapping these attacks to the MITRE ATT&CK Mobile framework, we uncover novel privilege-escalation and persistence pathways unique to LLM-driven automation. Collectively, our findings provide the first end-to-end evidence that mobile LLM agents are exploitable in realistic adversarial settings, where untrusted third-party channels (e.g., ads, embedded webviews, cross-app notifications) are an inherent part of the mobile ecosystem.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Three-dimensional scene generation holds significant potential in gaming, film, and virtual reality. However, most existing methods adopt a single-step generation process, making it difficult to balance scene complexity with minimal user input. Inspired by the human cognitive process in scene modeling, which progresses from global to local, focuses on key elements, and completes the scene through semantic association, we propose HiGS, a hierarchical generative framework for multi-step associative semantic spatial composition. HiGS enables users to iteratively expand scenes by selecting key semantic objects, offering fine-grained control over regions of interest while the model completes peripheral areas automatically. To support structured and coherent generation, we introduce the Progressive Hierarchical Spatial-Semantic Graph (PHiSSG), which dynamically organizes spatial relationships and semantic dependencies across the evolving scene structure. PHiSSG ensures spatial and geometric consistency throughout the generation process by maintaining a one-to-one mapping between graph nodes and generated objects and supporting recursive layout optimization. Experiments demonstrate that HiGS outperforms single-stage methods in layout plausibility, style consistency, and user preference, offering a controllable and extensible paradigm for efficient 3D scene construction.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Remote sensing image scene classification remains a challenging task, primarily due to the complex spatial structures and multi-scale characteristics of ground objects. Existing approaches see CNNs excel at modeling local textures, while Transformers excel at capturing global context. However, efficiently integrating them remains a bottleneck due to the high computational cost of Transformers. To tackle this, we propose AFM-Net, a novel Advanced Hierarchical Fusing framework that achieves effective local and global co-representation through two pathways: a CNN branch for extracting hierarchical visual priors, and a Mamba branch for efficient global sequence modeling. The core innovation of AFM-Net lies in its Hierarchical Fusion Mechanism, which progressively aggregates multi-scale features from both pathways, enabling dynamic cross-level feature interaction and contextual reconstruction to produce highly discriminative representations. These fused features are then adaptively routed through a Mixture-of-Experts classifier module, which dispatches them to the most suitable experts for fine-grained scene recognition. Experiments on AID, NWPU-RESISC45, and UC Merced show that AFM-Net obtains 93.72, 95.54, and 96.92 percent accuracy, surpassing state-of-the-art methods with balanced performance and efficiency.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The Banff Classification provides the global standard for evaluating renal transplant biopsies, yet its semi-quantitative nature, complex criteria, and inter-observer variability present significant challenges for computational replication. In this study, we explore the feasibility of approximating Banff lesion scores using existing deep learning models through a modular, rule-based framework. We decompose each Banff indicator - such as glomerulitis (g), peritubular capillaritis (ptc), and intimal arteritis (v) - into its constituent structural and inflammatory components, and assess whether current segmentation and detection tools can support their computation. Model outputs are mapped to Banff scores using heuristic rules aligned with expert guidelines, and evaluated against expert-annotated ground truths. Our findings highlight both partial successes and critical failure modes, including structural omission, hallucination, and detection ambiguity. Even when final scores match expert annotations, inconsistencies in intermediate representations often undermine interpretability. These results reveal the limitations of current AI pipelines in replicating computational expert-level grading, and emphasize the importance of modular evaluation and computational Banff grading standard in guiding future model development for transplant pathology.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vision-language models (VLMs) often struggle to generate accurate and detailed captions for high-resolution images since they are typically pre-trained on low-resolution inputs (e.g., 224x224 or 336x336 pixels). Downscaling high-resolution images to these dimensions may result in the loss of visual details and the omission of important objects. To address this limitation, we propose a novel pipeline that integrates vision-language models, large language models (LLMs), and object detection systems to enhance caption quality. Our proposed pipeline refines captions through a novel, multi-stage process. Given a high-resolution image, an initial caption is first generated using a VLM, and key objects in the image are then identified by an LLM. The LLM predicts additional objects likely to co-occur with the identified key objects, and these predictions are verified by object detection systems. Newly detected objects not mentioned in the initial caption undergo focused, region-specific captioning to ensure they are incorporated. This process enriches caption detail while reducing hallucinations by removing references to undetected objects. We evaluate the enhanced captions using pairwise comparison and quantitative scoring from large multimodal models, along with a benchmark for hallucination detection. Experiments on a curated dataset of high-resolution images demonstrate that our pipeline produces more detailed and reliable image captions while effectively minimizing hallucinations.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in 4D imaging radar have enabled robust perception in adverse weather, while camera sensors provide dense semantic information. Fusing the these complementary modalities has great potential for cost-effective 3D perception. However, most existing camera-radar fusion methods are limited to single-frame inputs, capturing only a partial view of the scene. The incomplete scene information, compounded by image degradation and 4D radar sparsity, hinders overall detection performance. In contrast, multi-frame fusion offers richer spatiotemporal information but faces two challenges: achieving robust and effective object feature fusion across frames and modalities, and mitigating the computational cost of redundant feature extraction. Consequently, we propose M^3Detection, a unified multi-frame 3D object detection framework that performs multi-level feature fusion on multi-modal data from camera and 4D imaging radar. Our framework leverages intermediate features from the baseline detector and employs the tracker to produce reference trajectories, improving computational efficiency and providing richer information for second-stage. In the second stage, we design a global-level inter-object feature aggregation module guided by radar information to align global features across candidate proposals and a local-level inter-grid feature aggregation module that expands local features along the reference trajectories to enhance fine-grained object representation. The aggregated features are then processed by a trajectory-level multi-frame spatiotemporal reasoning module to encode cross-frame interactions and enhance temporal representation. Extensive experiments on the VoD and TJ4DRadSet datasets demonstrate that M^3Detection achieves state-of-the-art 3D detection performance, validating its effectiveness in multi-frame detection with camera-4D imaging radar fusion.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recently, diffusion models have shown their impressive ability in visual generation tasks. Besides static images, more and more research attentions have been drawn to the generation of realistic videos. The video generation not only has a higher requirement for the quality, but also brings a challenge in ensuring the video continuity. Among all the video generation tasks, human-involved contents, such as human dancing, are even more difficult to generate due to the high degrees of freedom associated with human motions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, named as DANCER (Dance ANimation via Condition Enhancement and Rendering with Diffusion Model), for realistic single-person dance synthesis based on the most recent stable video diffusion model. As the video generation is generally guided by a reference image and a video sequence, we introduce two important modules into our framework to fully benefit from the two inputs. More specifically, we design an Appearance Enhancement Module (AEM) to focus more on the details of the reference image during the generation, and extend the motion guidance through a Pose Rendering Module (PRM) to capture pose conditions from extra domains. To further improve the generation capability of our model, we also collect a large amount of video data from Internet, and generate a novel datasetTikTok-3K to enhance the model training. The effectiveness of the proposed model has been evaluated through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, where the performance of our model is superior to that of the state-of-the-art methods. All the data and codes will be released upon acceptance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models have emerged as state-of-the-art in image generation, but their practical deployment is hindered by the significant computational cost of their iterative denoising process. While existing caching techniques can accelerate inference, they often create a challenging trade-off between speed and fidelity, suffering from quality degradation and high computational overhead. To address these limitations, we introduce H2-Cache, a novel hierarchical caching mechanism designed for modern generative diffusion model architectures. Our method is founded on the key insight that the denoising process can be functionally separated into a structure-defining stage and a detail-refining stage. H2-cache leverages this by employing a dual-threshold system, using independent thresholds to selectively cache each stage. To ensure the efficiency of our dual-check approach, we introduce pooled feature summarization (PFS), a lightweight technique for robust and fast similarity estimation. Extensive experiments on the Flux architecture demonstrate that H2-cache achieves significant acceleration (up to 5.08x) while maintaining image quality nearly identical to the baseline, quantitatively and qualitatively outperforming existing caching methods. Our work presents a robust and practical solution that effectively resolves the speed-quality dilemma, significantly lowering the barrier for the real-world application of high-fidelity diffusion models.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>defense, attack, robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Harmful fine-tuning poses critical safety risks to fine-tuning-as-a-service for large language models. Existing defense strategies preemptively build robustness via attack simulation but suffer from fundamental limitations: (i) the infeasibility of extending attack simulations beyond bounded threat models due to the inherent difficulty of anticipating unknown attacks, and (ii) limited adaptability to varying attack settings, as simulation fails to capture their variability and complexity. To address these challenges, we propose Bayesian Data Scheduler (BDS), an adaptive tuning-stage defense strategy with no need for attack simulation. BDS formulates harmful fine-tuning defense as a Bayesian inference problem, learning the posterior distribution of each data point's safety attribute, conditioned on the fine-tuning and alignment datasets. The fine-tuning process is then constrained by weighting data with their safety attributes sampled from the posterior, thus mitigating the influence of harmful data. By leveraging the post hoc nature of Bayesian inference, the posterior is conditioned on the fine-tuning dataset, enabling BDS to tailor its defense to the specific dataset, thereby achieving adaptive defense. Furthermore, we introduce a neural scheduler based on amortized Bayesian learning, enabling efficient transfer to new data without retraining. Comprehensive results across diverse attack and defense settings demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our approach. Code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Video identification attacks pose a significant privacy threat that can reveal videos that victims watch, which may disclose their hobbies, religious beliefs, political leanings, sexual orientation, and health status. Also, video watching history can be used for user profiling or advertising and may result in cyberbullying, discrimination, or blackmail. Existing extensive video inference techniques usually depend on analyzing network traffic generated by streaming online videos. In this work, we observe that the content of a subtitle determines its silhouette displayed on the screen, and identifying each subtitle silhouette also derives the temporal difference between two consecutive subtitles. We then propose SilhouetteTell, a novel video identification attack that combines the spatial and time domain information into a spatiotemporal feature of subtitle silhouettes. SilhouetteTell explores the spatiotemporal correlation between recorded subtitle silhouettes of a video and its subtitle file. It can infer both online and offline videos. Comprehensive experiments on off-the-shelf smartphones confirm the high efficacy of SilhouetteTell for inferring video titles and clips under various settings, including from a distance of up to 40 meters.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) between drone and satellite imagery remains challenging due to severe viewpoint gaps and the presence of hard negatives, which are visually similar but geographically mismatched samples. Existing mining or reweighting strategies often use static weighting, which is sensitive to distribution shifts and prone to overemphasizing difficult samples too early, leading to noisy gradients and unstable convergence. In this paper, we present a Dual-level Progressive Hardness-aware Reweighting (DPHR) strategy. At the sample level, a Ratio-based Difficulty-Aware (RDA) module evaluates relative difficulty and assigns fine-grained weights to negatives. At the batch level, a Progressive Adaptive Loss Weighting (PALW) mechanism exploits a training-progress signal to attenuate noisy gradients during early optimization and progressively enhance hard-negative mining as training matures. Experiments on the University-1652 and SUES-200 benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed DPHR, achieving consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, data-free, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Model inversion, which aims to reconstruct the original training data from pre-trained discriminative models, is especially useful when the original training data is unavailable due to privacy, usage rights, or size constraints. However, existing dense inversion methods attempt to reconstruct the entire image area, making them extremely inefficient when inverting high-resolution images from large-scale Vision Transformers (ViTs). We further identify two underlying causes of this inefficiency: the redundant inversion of noisy backgrounds and the unintended inversion of spurious correlations--a phenomenon we term "hallucination" in model inversion. To address these limitations, we propose a novel sparse model inversion strategy, as a plug-and-play extension to speed up existing dense inversion methods with no need for modifying their original loss functions. Specifically, we selectively invert semantic foregrounds while stopping the inversion of noisy backgrounds and potential spurious correlations. Through both theoretical and empirical studies, we validate the efficacy of our approach in achieving significant inversion acceleration (up to 3.79 faster) while maintaining comparable or even enhanced downstream performance in data-free model quantization and data-free knowledge transfer.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>defense, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into automated, multi-stage pipelines, risk patterns that arise from unvalidated trust between processing stages become a practical concern. This paper presents a mechanism-centered taxonomy of 41 recurring risk patterns in commercial LLMs. The analysis shows that inputs are often interpreted non-neutrally and can trigger implementation-shaped responses or unintended state changes even without explicit commands. We argue that these behaviors constitute architectural failure modes and that string-level filtering alone is insufficient. To mitigate such cross-stage vulnerabilities, we recommend zero-trust architectural principles, including provenance enforcement, context sealing, and plan revalidation, and we introduce "Countermind" as a conceptual blueprint for implementing these defenses.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As AI systems become increasingly integrated into human lives, endowing them with robust social intelligence has emerged as a critical frontier. A key aspect of this intelligence is discerning truth from deception, a ubiquitous element of human interaction that is conveyed through a complex interplay of verbal language and non-verbal visual cues. However, automatic deception detection in dynamic, multi-party conversations remains a significant challenge. The recent rise of powerful Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), with their impressive abilities in visual and textual understanding, makes them natural candidates for this task. Consequently, their capabilities in this crucial domain are mostly unquantified. To address this gap, we introduce a new task, Multimodal Interactive Veracity Assessment (MIVA), and present a novel multimodal dataset derived from the social deduction game Werewolf. This dataset provides synchronized video, text, with verifiable ground-truth labels for every statement. We establish a comprehensive benchmark evaluating state-of-the-art MLLMs, revealing a significant performance gap: even powerful models like GPT-4o struggle to distinguish truth from falsehood reliably. Our analysis of failure modes indicates that these models fail to ground language in visual social cues effectively and may be overly conservative in their alignment, highlighting the urgent need for novel approaches to building more perceptive and trustworthy AI systems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The proliferation of memes on social media necessitates the capabilities of multimodal Large Language Models (mLLMs) to effectively understand multimodal harmfulness. Existing evaluation approaches predominantly focus on mLLMs' detection accuracy for binary classification tasks, which often fail to reflect the in-depth interpretive nuance of harmfulness across diverse contexts. In this paper, we propose MemeArena, an agent-based arena-style evaluation framework that provides a context-aware and unbiased assessment for mLLMs' understanding of multimodal harmfulness. Specifically, MemeArena simulates diverse interpretive contexts to formulate evaluation tasks that elicit perspective-specific analyses from mLLMs. By integrating varied viewpoints and reaching consensus among evaluators, it enables fair and unbiased comparisons of mLLMs' abilities to interpret multimodal harmfulness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework effectively reduces the evaluation biases of judge agents, with judgment results closely aligning with human preferences, offering valuable insights into reliable and comprehensive mLLM evaluations in multimodal harmfulness understanding.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Traffic accidents represent a critical public health challenge, claiming over 1.35 million lives annually worldwide. Traditional accident prediction models treat road segments independently, failing to capture complex spatial relationships and temporal dependencies in urban transportation networks. This study develops MDAS-GNN, a Multi-Dimensional Attention-based Spatial-diffusion Graph Neural Network integrating three core risk dimensions: traffic safety, infrastructure, and environmental risk. The framework employs feature-specific spatial diffusion mechanisms and multi-head temporal attention to capture dependencies across different time horizons. Evaluated on UK Department for Transport accident data across Central London, South Manchester, and SE Birmingham, MDASGNN achieves superior performance compared to established baseline methods. The model maintains consistently low prediction errors across short, medium, and long-term periods, with particular strength in long-term forecasting. Ablation studies confirm that integrated multi-dimensional features outperform singlefeature approaches, reducing prediction errors by up to 40%. This framework provides civil engineers and urban planners with advanced predictive capabilities for transportation infrastructure design, enabling data-driven decisions for road network optimization, infrastructure resource improvements, and strategic safety interventions in urban development projects.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Villages areas hold significant importance in the study of human-land relationships. However, with the advancement of urbanization, the gradual disappearance of spatial characteristics and the homogenization of landscapes have emerged as prominent issues. Existing studies primarily adopt a single-disciplinary perspective to analyze villages spatial morphology and its influencing factors, relying heavily on qualitative analysis methods. These efforts are often constrained by the lack of digital infrastructure and insufficient data. To address the current research limitations, this paper proposes a Hierarchical Graph Neural Network (HGNN) model that integrates multi-source data to conduct an in-depth analysis of villages spatial morphology. The framework includes two types of nodes-input nodes and communication nodes-and two types of edges-static input edges and dynamic communication edges. By combining Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph Attention Networks (GAT), the proposed model efficiently integrates multimodal features under a two-stage feature update mechanism. Additionally, based on existing principles for classifying villages spatial morphology, the paper introduces a relational pooling mechanism and implements a joint training strategy across 17 subtypes. Experimental results demonstrate that this method achieves significant performance improvements over existing approaches in multimodal fusion and classification tasks. Additionally, the proposed joint optimization of all sub-types lifts mean accuracy/F1 from 0.71/0.83 (independent models) to 0.82/0.90, driven by a 6% gain for parcel tasks. Our method provides scientific evidence for exploring villages spatial patterns and generative logic.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose a novel continual self-supervised learning (CSSL) framework for simultaneously learning diverse features from multi-window-obtained chest computed tomography (CT) images and ensuring data privacy. Achieving a robust and highly generalizable model in medical image diagnosis is challenging, mainly because of issues, such as the scarcity of large-scale, accurately annotated datasets and domain shifts inherent to dynamic healthcare environments. Specifically, in chest CT, these domain shifts often arise from differences in window settings, which are optimized for distinct clinical purposes. Previous CSSL frameworks often mitigated domain shift by reusing past data, a typically impractical approach owing to privacy constraints. Our approach addresses these challenges by effectively capturing the relationship between previously learned knowledge and new information across different training stages through continual pretraining on unlabeled images. Specifically, by incorporating a latent replay-based mechanism into CSSL, our method mitigates catastrophic forgetting due to domain shifts during continual pretraining while ensuring data privacy. Additionally, we introduce a feature distillation technique that integrates Wasserstein distance-based knowledge distillation (WKD) and batch-knowledge ensemble (BKE), enhancing the ability of the model to learn meaningful, domain-shift-robust representations. Finally, we validate our approach using chest CT images obtained across two different window settings, demonstrating superior performance compared with other approaches.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a vital tool for fine-grained land-use and land-cover (LULC) mapping. However, the inherent heterogeneity of HSI data has long posed a major barrier to developing generalized models via joint training. Although HSI foundation models have shown promise for different downstream tasks, the existing approaches typically overlook the critical guiding role of sensor meta-attributes, and struggle with multi-sensor training, limiting their transferability. To address these challenges, we propose SpecAware, which is a novel hyperspectral spectral-content aware foundation model for unifying multi-sensor learning for HSI mapping. We also constructed the Hyper-400K dataset to facilitate this research, which is a new large-scale, high-quality benchmark dataset with over 400k image patches from diverse airborne AVIRIS sensors. The core of SpecAware is a two-step hypernetwork-driven encoding process for HSI data. Firstly, we designed a meta-content aware module to generate a unique conditional input for each HSI patch, tailored to each spectral band of every sample by fusing the sensor meta-attributes and its own image content. Secondly, we designed the HyperEmbedding module, where a sample-conditioned hypernetwork dynamically generates a pair of matrix factors for channel-wise encoding, consisting of adaptive spatial pattern extraction and latent semantic feature re-projection. Thus, SpecAware gains the ability to perceive and interpret spatial-spectral features across diverse scenes and sensors. This, in turn, allows SpecAware to adaptively process a variable number of spectral channels, establishing a unified framework for joint pre-training. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate that SpecAware can learn superior feature representations, excelling in land-cover semantic segmentation classification, change detection, and scene classification.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Accurate building instance segmentation and height classification are critical for urban planning, 3D city modeling, and infrastructure monitoring. This paper presents a detailed analysis of YOLOv11, the recent advancement in the YOLO series of deep learning models, focusing on its application to joint building extraction and discrete height classification from satellite imagery. YOLOv11 builds on the strengths of earlier YOLO models by introducing a more efficient architecture that better combines features at different scales, improves object localization accuracy, and enhances performance in complex urban scenes. Using the DFC2023 Track 2 dataset -- which includes over 125,000 annotated buildings across 12 cities -- we evaluate YOLOv11's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and mean average precision (mAP). Our findings demonstrate that YOLOv11 achieves strong instance segmentation performance with 60.4\% mAP@50 and 38.3\% mAP@50--95 while maintaining robust classification accuracy across five predefined height tiers. The model excels in handling occlusions, complex building shapes, and class imbalance, particularly for rare high-rise structures. Comparative analysis confirms that YOLOv11 outperforms earlier multitask frameworks in both detection accuracy and inference speed, making it well-suited for real-time, large-scale urban mapping. This research highlights YOLOv11's potential to advance semantic urban reconstruction through streamlined categorical height modeling, offering actionable insights for future developments in remote sensing and geospatial intelligence.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in language and vision have demonstrated that scaling up model capacity consistently improves performance across diverse tasks. In 3D visual geometry reconstruction, large-scale training has likewise proven effective for learning versatile representations. However, further scaling of 3D models is challenging due to the complexity of geometric supervision and the diversity of 3D data. To overcome these limitations, we propose MoRE, a dense 3D visual foundation model based on a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture that dynamically routes features to task-specific experts, allowing them to specialize in complementary data aspects and enhance both scalability and adaptability. Aiming to improve robustness under real-world conditions, MoRE incorporates a confidence-based depth refinement module that stabilizes and refines geometric estimation. In addition, it integrates dense semantic features with globally aligned 3D backbone representations for high-fidelity surface normal prediction. MoRE is further optimized with tailored loss functions to ensure robust learning across diverse inputs and multiple geometric tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoRE achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks and supports effective downstream applications without extra computation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized clients without sharing private data. However, FL suffers from biased global models due to non-IID and long-tail data distributions. We propose \textbf{FedSM}, a novel client-centric framework that mitigates this bias through semantics-guided feature mixup and lightweight classifier retraining. FedSM uses a pretrained image-text-aligned model to compute category-level semantic relevance, guiding the category selection of local features to mix-up with global prototypes to generate class-consistent pseudo-features. These features correct classifier bias, especially when data are heavily skewed. To address the concern of potential domain shift between the pretrained model and the data, we propose probabilistic category selection, enhancing feature diversity to effectively mitigate biases. All computations are performed locally, requiring minimal server overhead. Extensive experiments on long-tail datasets with various imbalanced levels demonstrate that FedSM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, with high robustness to domain shift and computational efficiency.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, defense, attack, robust, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In recent times, deep neural networks (DNNs) have been successfully adopted for various applications. Despite their notable achievements, it has become evident that DNNs are vulnerable to sophisticated adversarial attacks, restricting their applications in security-critical systems. In this paper, we present two-phase training methods to tackle the attack: first, training the denoising network, and second, the deep classifier model. We propose a novel denoising strategy that integrates both spatial and frequency domain approaches to defend against adversarial attacks on images. Our analysis reveals that high-frequency components of attacked images are more severely corrupted compared to their lower-frequency counterparts. To address this, we leverage Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for frequency analysis and develop a denoising network that combines spatial image features with wavelets through a transformer layer. Next, we retrain the classifier using the denoised images, which enhances the classifier's robustness against adversarial attacks. Experimental results across the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Fashion-MNIST datasets reveal that the proposed method remarkably elevates classification accuracy, substantially exceeding the performance by utilizing a denoising network and adversarial training approaches.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Evaluating the abilities of large language models (LLMs) for tasks that require long-term memory and thus long-context reasoning, for example in conversational settings, is hampered by the existing benchmarks, which often lack narrative coherence, cover narrow domains, and only test simple recall-oriented tasks. This paper introduces a comprehensive solution to these challenges. First, we present a novel framework for automatically generating long (up to 10M tokens), coherent, and topically diverse conversations, accompanied by probing questions targeting a wide range of memory abilities. From this, we construct BEAM, a new benchmark comprising 100 conversations and 2,000 validated questions. Second, to enhance model performance, we propose LIGHT-a framework inspired by human cognition that equips LLMs with three complementary memory systems: a long-term episodic memory, a short-term working memory, and a scratchpad for accumulating salient facts. Our experiments on BEAM reveal that even LLMs with 1M token context windows (with and without retrieval-augmentation) struggle as dialogues lengthen. In contrast, LIGHT consistently improves performance across various models, achieving an average improvement of 3.5%-12.69% over the strongest baselines, depending on the backbone LLM. An ablation study further confirms the contribution of each memory component.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success in computer vision tasks such as image classification, segmentation, and object detection. However, they are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can cause incorrect predictions with small perturbations in input images. Addressing this issue is crucial for deploying robust deep-learning systems. This paper presents a novel approach that utilizes contrastive learning for adversarial defense, a previously unexplored area. Our method leverages the contrastive loss function to enhance the robustness of classification models by training them with both clean and adversarially perturbed images. By optimizing the model's parameters alongside the perturbations, our approach enables the network to learn robust representations that are less susceptible to adversarial attacks. Experimental results show significant improvements in the model's robustness against various types of adversarial perturbations. This suggests that contrastive loss helps extract more informative and resilient features, contributing to the field of adversarial robustness in deep learning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) underperform on low resource, non-Latin scripts due to tokenizer fragmentation and weak cross-lingual coupling. We present LLINK (Latent Language Injection for Non-English Knowledge), a compute efficient language-as-modality method that conditions an instruction-tuned decoder without changing the tokenizer or retraining the decoder. First, we align sentence embeddings from a frozen multilingual encoder to the decoder's latent embedding space at a reserved position via a lightweight contrastive projector. Second, the vector is expanded into K soft slots and trained with minimal adapters so the frozen decoder consumes the signal. LLINK substantially improves bilingual retrieval and achieves 81.3% preference over the base model and 63.6% over direct fine-tuning in LLM-judged Q&A evaluations. We further find that improvements can be attributed to reduced tokenization inflation and a stronger cross lingual alignment, despite the model having residual weaknesses in numeric fidelity. Treating low resource languages as a modality offers a practical path to stronger cross-lingual alignment in lightweight LLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recently, there has been gradually more attention paid to Out-of-Distribution (OOD) performance prediction, whose goal is to predict the performance of trained models on unlabeled OOD test datasets, so that we could better leverage and deploy off-the-shelf trained models in risk-sensitive scenarios. Although progress has been made in this area, evaluation protocols in previous literature are inconsistent, and most works cover only a limited number of real-world OOD datasets and types of distribution shifts. To provide convenient and fair comparisons for various algorithms, we propose Out-of-Distribution Performance Prediction Benchmark (ODP-Bench), a comprehensive benchmark that includes most commonly used OOD datasets and existing practical performance prediction algorithms. We provide our trained models as a testbench for future researchers, thus guaranteeing the consistency of comparison and avoiding the burden of repeating the model training process. Furthermore, we also conduct in-depth experimental analyses to better understand their capability boundary.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In medical imaging, vision-language models face a critical duality: pretrained networks offer broad robustness but lack subtle, modality-specific characteristics, while fine-tuned expert models achieve high in-distribution accuracy yet falter under modality shift. Existing model-merging techniques, designed for natural-image benchmarks, are simple and efficient but fail to deliver consistent gains across diverse medical modalities; their static interpolation limits reliability in varied clinical tasks. To address this, we introduce Test-Time Task adaptive merging (T^3), a backpropagation-free framework that computes per-sample interpolation coefficients via the Jensen-Shannon divergence between the two models' output distributions. T^3 dynamically preserves local precision when models agree and defers to generalist robustness under drift. To overcome the inference costs of sample-wise merging, we further propose a batch-wise extension, T^3_B, that computes a merging coefficient across a batch of samples, dramatically reducing computational bottleneck. Recognizing the lack of a standardized medical-merging benchmark, we present a rigorous cross-evaluation protocol spanning in-domain, base-to-novel, and corruptions across four modalities. Empirically, T^3 sets new state-of-the-art in Top-1 accuracy and error reduction, outperforming strong baselines while maintaining efficiency, paving the way for adaptive MVLM deployment in clinical settings.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As large language models (LLMs) enter the medical domain, most benchmarks evaluate them on question answering or descriptive reasoning, overlooking quantitative reasoning critical to clinical decision-making. Existing datasets like MedCalc-Bench cover few calculation tasks and fail to reflect real-world computational scenarios. We introduce MedCalc-Eval, the largest benchmark for assessing LLMs' medical calculation abilities, comprising 700+ tasks across two types: equation-based (e.g., Cockcroft-Gault, BMI, BSA) and rule-based scoring systems (e.g., Apgar, Glasgow Coma Scale). These tasks span diverse specialties including internal medicine, surgery, pediatrics, and cardiology, offering a broader and more challenging evaluation setting. To improve performance, we further develop MedCalc-Env, a reinforcement learning environment built on the InternBootcamp framework, enabling multi-step clinical reasoning and planning. Fine-tuning a Qwen2.5-32B model within this environment achieves state-of-the-art results on MedCalc-Eval, with notable gains in numerical sensitivity, formula selection, and reasoning robustness. Remaining challenges include unit conversion, multi-condition logic, and contextual understanding. Code and datasets are available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, security, privacy, attack, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent improvement gains in large language models (LLMs) have lead to everyday usage of AI-based Conversational Agents (CAs). At the same time, LLMs are vulnerable to an array of threats, including jailbreaks and, for example, causing remote code execution when fed specific inputs. As a result, users may unintentionally introduce risks, for example, by uploading malicious files or disclosing sensitive information. However, the extent to which such user behaviors occur and thus potentially facilitate exploits remains largely unclear. To shed light on this issue, we surveyed a representative sample of 3,270 UK adults in 2024 using Prolific. A third of these use CA services such as ChatGPT or Gemini at least once a week. Of these ``regular users'', up to a third exhibited behaviors that may enable attacks, and a fourth have tried jailbreaking (often out of understandable reasons such as curiosity, fun or information seeking). Half state that they sanitize data and most participants report not sharing sensitive data. However, few share very sensitive data such as passwords. The majority are unaware that their data can be used to train models and that they can opt-out. Our findings suggest that current academic threat models manifest in the wild, and mitigations or guidelines for the secure usage of CAs should be developed. In areas critical to security and privacy, CAs must be equipped with effective AI guardrails to prevent, for example, revealing sensitive information to curious employees. Vendors need to increase efforts to prevent the entry of sensitive data, and to create transparency with regard to data usage policies and settings.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) represent images and video frames as visual tokens. Scaling from single images to hour-long videos, however, inflates the token budget far beyond practical limits. Popular pipelines therefore either uniformly subsample or apply keyframe selection with retrieval-style scoring using smaller vision-language models. However, these keyframe selection methods still rely on pre-filtering before selection to reduce the inference cost and can miss the most informative moments. We propose FOCUS, Frame-Optimistic Confidence Upper-bound Selection, a training-free, model-agnostic keyframe selection module that selects query-relevant frames under a strict token budget. FOCUS formulates keyframe selection as a combinatorial pure-exploration (CPE) problem in multi-armed bandits: it treats short temporal clips as arms, and uses empirical means and Bernstein confidence radius to identify informative regions while preserving exploration of uncertain areas. The resulting two-stage exploration-exploitation procedure reduces from a sequential policy with theoretical guarantees, first identifying high-value temporal regions, then selecting top-scoring frames within each region On two long-video question-answering benchmarks, FOCUS delivers substantial accuracy improvements while processing less than 2% of video frames. For videos longer than 20 minutes, it achieves an 11.9% gain in accuracy on LongVideoBench, demonstrating its effectiveness as a keyframe selection method and providing a simple and general solution for scalable long-video understanding with MLLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Accurate prediction of Drug-Target Affinity (DTA) is crucial for reducing experimental costs and accelerating early screening in computational drug discovery. While sequence-based deep learning methods avoid reliance on costly 3D structures, they still overlook simultaneous modeling of global sequence semantic features and local topological structural features within drugs and proteins, and represent drugs as flat sequences without atomic-level, substructural-level, and molecular-level multi-scale features. We propose HiF-DTA, a hierarchical network that adopts a dual-pathway strategy to extract both global sequence semantic and local topological features from drug and protein sequences, and models drugs multi-scale to learn atomic, substructural, and molecular representations fused via a multi-scale bilinear attention module. Experiments on Davis, KIBA, and Metz datasets show HiF-DTA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with ablations confirming the importance of global-local extraction and multi-scale fusion.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Concept erasure aims to selectively unlearning undesirable content in diffusion models (DMs) to reduce the risk of sensitive content generation. As a novel paradigm in concept erasure, most existing methods employ adversarial training to identify and suppress target concepts, thus reducing the likelihood of sensitive outputs. However, these methods often neglect the specificity of adversarial training in DMs, resulting in only partial mitigation. In this work, we investigate and quantify this specificity from the perspective of concept space, i.e., can adversarial samples truly fit the target concept space? We observe that existing methods neglect the role of conceptual semantics when generating adversarial samples, resulting in ineffective fitting of concept spaces. This oversight leads to the following issues: 1) when there are few adversarial samples, they fail to comprehensively cover the object concept; 2) conversely, they will disrupt other target concept spaces. Motivated by the analysis of these findings, we introduce S-GRACE (Semantics-Guided Robust Adversarial Concept Erasure), which grace leveraging semantic guidance within the concept space to generate adversarial samples and perform erasure training. Experiments conducted with seven state-of-the-art methods and three adversarial prompt generation strategies across various DM unlearning scenarios demonstrate that S-GRACE significantly improves erasure performance 26%, better preserves non-target concepts, and reduces training time by 90%.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Medical image super-resolution (SR) is essential for enhancing diagnostic accuracy while reducing acquisition cost and scanning time. However, modeling both long-range anatomical structures and fine-grained frequency details with low computational overhead remains challenging. We propose FGMamba, a novel frequency-aware gated state-space model that unifies global dependency modeling and fine-detail enhancement into a lightweight architecture. Our method introduces two key innovations: a Gated Attention-enhanced State-Space Module (GASM) that integrates efficient state-space modeling with dual-branch spatial and channel attention, and a Pyramid Frequency Fusion Module (PFFM) that captures high-frequency details across multiple resolutions via FFT-guided fusion. Extensive evaluations across five medical imaging modalities (Ultrasound, OCT, MRI, CT, and Endoscopic) demonstrate that FGMamba achieves superior PSNR/SSIM while maintaining a compact parameter footprint ($<$0.75M), outperforming CNN-based and Transformer-based SOTAs. Our results validate the effectiveness of frequency-aware state-space modeling for scalable and accurate medical image enhancement.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Phishing constitutes more than 90\% of successful cyberattacks globally, remaining one of the most persistent threats to organizational security. Despite organizations tripling their cybersecurity budgets between 2015 and 2025, the human factor continues to pose a critical vulnerability. This study presents a 12-month longitudinal investigation examining how continuous cybersecurity training and emotional cues affect employee susceptibility to phishing. The experiment involved 20 organizations and over 1,300 employees who collectively received more than 13,000 simulated phishing emails engineered with diverse emotional, contextual, and structural characteristics. Behavioral responses were analyzed using non-parametric correlation and regression models to assess the influence of psychological manipulation, message personalization, and perceived email source. Results demonstrate that sustained phishing simulations and targeted training programs lead to a significant reduction in employee susceptibility, halving successful compromise rates within six months. Additionally, employee turnover introduces measurable fluctuations in awareness levels, underscoring the necessity of maintaining continuous training initiatives. These findings provide one of the few long-term perspectives on phishing awareness efficacy, highlighting the strategic importance of ongoing behavioral interventions in strengthening organizational cyber resilience.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the growing volume of Internet of Things (IoT) network traffic, machine learning (ML)-based anomaly detection is more relevant than ever. Traditional batch learning models face challenges such as high maintenance and poor adaptability to rapid anomaly changes, known as concept drift. In contrast, streaming learning integrates online and incremental learning, enabling seamless updates and concept drift detection to improve robustness. This study investigates anomaly detection in streaming IoT traffic as binary classification, comparing batch and streaming learning approaches while assessing the limitations of current IoT traffic datasets. We simulated heterogeneous network data streams by carefully mixing existing datasets and streaming the samples one by one. Our results highlight the failure of batch models to handle concept drift, but also reveal persisting limitations of current datasets to expose model limitations due to low traffic heterogeneity. We also investigated the competitiveness of tree-based ML algorithms, well-known in batch anomaly detection, and compared it to non-tree-based ones, confirming the advantages of the former. Adaptive Random Forest achieved F1-score of 0.990 $\pm$ 0.006 at one-third the computational cost of its batch counterpart. Hoeffding Adaptive Tree reached F1-score of 0.910 $\pm$ 0.007, reducing computational cost by four times, making it a viable choice for online applications despite a slight trade-off in stability.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Early detection of coronary artery disease (CAD) is critical for reducing mortality and improving patient treatment planning. While angiographic image analysis from X-rays is a common and cost-effective method for identifying cardiac abnormalities, including stenotic coronary arteries, poor image quality can significantly impede clinical diagnosis. We present the Coronary Artery Segmentation and Refinement Network (CASR-Net), a three-stage pipeline comprising image preprocessing, segmentation, and refinement. A novel multichannel preprocessing strategy combining CLAHE and an improved Ben Graham method provides incremental gains, increasing Dice Score Coefficient (DSC) by 0.31-0.89% and Intersection over Union (IoU) by 0.40-1.16% compared with using the techniques individually. The core innovation is a segmentation network built on a UNet with a DenseNet121 encoder and a Self-organized Operational Neural Network (Self-ONN) based decoder, which preserves the continuity of narrow and stenotic vessel branches. A final contour refinement module further suppresses false positives. Evaluated with 5-fold cross-validation on a combination of two public datasets that contain both healthy and stenotic arteries, CASR-Net outperformed several state-of-the-art models, achieving an IoU of 61.43%, a DSC of 76.10%, and clDice of 79.36%. These results highlight a robust approach to automated coronary artery segmentation, offering a valuable tool to support clinicians in diagnosis and treatment planning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The inherent multimodality and heterogeneous temporal structures of medical data pose significant challenges for modeling. We propose MedM2T, a time-aware multimodal framework designed to address these complexities. MedM2T integrates: (i) Sparse Time Series Encoder to flexibly handle irregular and sparse time series, (ii) Hierarchical Time-Aware Fusion to capture both micro- and macro-temporal patterns from multiple dense time series, such as ECGs, and (iii) Bi-Modal Attention to extract cross-modal interactions, which can be extended to any number of modalities. To mitigate granularity gaps between modalities, MedM2T uses modality-specific pre-trained encoders and aligns resulting features within a shared encoder. We evaluated MedM2T on MIMIC-IV and MIMIC-IV-ECG datasets for three tasks that encompass chronic and acute disease dynamics: 90-day cardiovascular disease (CVD) prediction, in-hospital mortality prediction, and ICU length-of-stay (LOS) regression. MedM2T outperformed state-of-the-art multimodal learning frameworks and existing time series models, achieving an AUROC of 0.947 and an AUPRC of 0.706 for CVD prediction; an AUROC of 0.901 and an AUPRC of 0.558 for mortality prediction; and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 2.31 for LOS regression. These results highlight the robustness and broad applicability of MedM2T, positioning it as a promising tool in clinical prediction. We provide the implementation of MedM2T at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We consider the problem of ultra-low bit rate visual communication for remote vision analysis, human interactions and control in challenging scenarios with very low communication bandwidth, such as deep space exploration, battlefield intelligence, and robot navigation in complex environments. In this paper, we ask the following important question: can we accurately reconstruct the visual scene using only a very small portion of the bit rate in existing coding methods while not sacrificing the accuracy of vision analysis and performance of human interactions? Existing text-to-image generation models offer a new approach for ultra-low bitrate image description. However, they can only achieve a semantic-level approximation of the visual scene, which is far insufficient for the purpose of visual communication and remote vision analysis and human interactions. To address this important issue, we propose to seamlessly integrate image generation with deep image compression, using joint text and coding latent to guide the rectified flow models for precise generation of the visual scene. The semantic text description and coding latent are both encoded and transmitted to the decoder at a very small bit rate. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve the same image reconstruction quality and vision analysis accuracy as existing methods while using much less bandwidth. The code will be released upon paper acceptance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The ODELIA Breast MRI Challenge 2025 addresses a critical issue in breast cancer screening: improving early detection through more efficient and accurate interpretation of breast MRI scans. Even though methods for general-purpose whole-body lesion segmentation as well as multi-time-point analysis exist, breast cancer detection remains highly challenging, largely due to the limited availability of high-quality segmentation labels. Therefore, developing robust classification-based approaches is crucial for the future of early breast cancer detection, particularly in applications such as large-scale screening. In this write-up, we provide a comprehensive overview of our approach to the challenge. We begin by detailing the underlying concept and foundational assumptions that guided our work. We then describe the iterative development process, highlighting the key stages of experimentation, evaluation, and refinement that shaped the evolution of our solution. Finally, we present the reasoning and evidence that informed the design choices behind our final submission, with a focus on performance, robustness, and clinical relevance.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>A central architectural question for both biological and artificial intelligence is whether judgment relies on specialized modules or a unified, domain-general resource. While the discovery of decodable neural representations for distinct concepts in Large Language Models (LLMs) has suggested a modular architecture, whether these representations are truly independent systems remains an open question. Here we provide evidence for a convergent architecture. Across a range of LLMs, we find that diverse evaluative judgments are computed along a dominant dimension, which we term the Valence-Assent Axis (VAA). This axis jointly encodes subjective valence ("what is good") and the model's assent to factual claims ("what is true"). Through direct interventions, we show this unified representation creates a critical dependency: the VAA functions as a control signal that steers the generative process to construct a rationale consistent with its evaluative state, even at the cost of factual accuracy. This mechanism, which we term the subordination of reasoning, shifts the process of reasoning from impartial inference toward goal-directed justification. Our discovery offers a mechanistic account for systemic bias and hallucination, revealing how an architecture that promotes coherent judgment can systematically undermine faithful reasoning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Existing image editing methods can handle simple editing instructions very well. To deal with complex editing instructions, they often need to jointly fine-tune the large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models (DMs), which involves very high computational complexity and training cost. To address this issue, we propose a new method, called \textbf{C}omplex \textbf{I}mage \textbf{E}diting via \textbf{L}LM \textbf{R}easoning (CIELR), which converts a complex user instruction into a set of simple and explicit editing actions, eliminating the need for jointly fine-tuning the large language models and diffusion models. Specifically, we first construct a structured semantic representation of the input image using foundation models. Then, we introduce an iterative update mechanism that can progressively refine this representation, obtaining a fine-grained visual representation of the image scene. This allows us to perform complex and flexible image editing tasks. Extensive experiments on the SmartEdit Reasoning Scenario Set show that our method surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by 9.955 dB in PSNR, indicating its superior preservation of regions that should remain consistent. Due to the limited number of samples of public datasets of complex image editing with reasoning, we construct a benchmark named CIEBench, containing 86 image samples, together with a metric specifically for reasoning-based image editing. CIELR also outperforms previous methods on this benchmark. The code and dataset are available at \href{this https URL}{this https URL}.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the rise of location-based service (LBS) applications that rely on terrestrial and satellite infrastructures (e.g., GNSS and crowd-sourced Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, cellular, and IP databases) for positioning, ensuring their integrity and security is paramount. However, we demonstrate that these applications are susceptible to low-cost attacks (less than $50), including Wi-Fi spoofing combined with GNSS jamming, as well as more sophisticated coordinated location spoofing. These attacks manipulate position data to control or undermine LBS functionality, leading to user scams or service manipulation. Therefore, we propose a countermeasure to detect and thwart such attacks by utilizing readily available, redundant positioning information from off-the-shelf platforms. Our method extends the receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) framework by incorporating opportunistic information, including data from onboard sensors and terrestrial infrastructure signals, and, naturally, GNSS. We theoretically show that the fusion of heterogeneous signals improves resilience against sophisticated adversaries on multiple fronts. Experimental evaluations show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in improving detection accuracy by 62% at most compared to baseline schemes and restoring accurate positioning.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has extended CLIP-based frameworks to produce powerful, universal embeddings for retrieval tasks. However, existing methods primarily focus on natural images, offering limited support for other crucial visual modalities such as videos and visual documents. To bridge this gap, we introduce RzenEmbed, a unified framework to learn embeddings across a diverse set of modalities, including text, images, videos, and visual documents. We employ a novel two-stage training strategy to learn discriminative representations. The first stage focuses on foundational text and multimodal retrieval. In the second stage, we introduce an improved InfoNCE loss, incorporating two key enhancements. Firstly, a hardness-weighted mechanism guides the model to prioritize challenging samples by assigning them higher weights within each batch. Secondly, we implement an approach to mitigate the impact of false negatives and alleviate data noise. This strategy not only enhances the model's discriminative power but also improves its instruction-following capabilities. We further boost performance with learnable temperature parameter and model souping. RzenEmbed sets a new state-of-the-art on the MMEB benchmark. It not only achieves the best overall score but also outperforms all prior work on the challenging video and visual document retrieval tasks. Our models are available in this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper introduces ThoughtProbe, a novel inference time framework that leverages the hidden reasoning features of Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve their reasoning performance. Unlike previous works that manipulate the hidden representations to steer LLM generation, we harness them as discriminative signals to guide the tree structured response space exploration. In each node expansion, a classifier serves as a scoring and ranking mechanism that efficiently allocates computational resources by prioritizing higher score candidates for continuation. After completing the tree expansion, we collect answers from all branches to form a candidate answer pool. We then propose a branch aggregation method that marginalizes over all supporting branches by aggregating their CoT scores, thereby identifying the optimal answer from the pool. Experimental results show that our framework's comprehensive exploration not only covers valid reasoning chains but also effectively identifies them, achieving significant improvements across multiple arithmetic reasoning benchmarks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present a practical pipeline for fine-tuning open-source video diffusion transformers to synthesize cinematic scenes for television and film production from small datasets. The proposed two-stage process decouples visual style learning from motion generation. In the first stage, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules are integrated into the cross-attention layers of the Wan2.1 I2V-14B model to adapt its visual representations using a compact dataset of short clips from Ay Yapim's historical television film El Turco. This enables efficient domain transfer within hours on a single GPU. In the second stage, the fine-tuned model produces stylistically consistent keyframes that preserve costume, lighting, and color grading, which are then temporally expanded into coherent 720p sequences through the model's video decoder. We further apply lightweight parallelization and sequence partitioning strategies to accelerate inference without quality degradation. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations using FVD, CLIP-SIM, and LPIPS metrics, supported by a small expert user study, demonstrate measurable improvements in cinematic fidelity and temporal stability over the base model. The complete training and inference pipeline is released to support reproducibility and adaptation across cinematic domains.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Modality alignment is critical for vision-language models (VLMs) to effectively integrate information across modalities. However, existing methods extract hierarchical features from text while representing each image with a single feature, leading to asymmetric and suboptimal alignment. To address this, we propose Alignment across Trees, a method that constructs and aligns tree-like hierarchical features for both image and text modalities. Specifically, we introduce a semantic-aware visual feature extraction framework that applies a cross-attention mechanism to visual class tokens from intermediate Transformer layers, guided by textual cues to extract visual features with coarse-to-fine semantics. We then embed the feature trees of the two modalities into hyperbolic manifolds with distinct curvatures to effectively model their hierarchical structures. To align across the heterogeneous hyperbolic manifolds with different curvatures, we formulate a KL distance measure between distributions on heterogeneous manifolds, and learn an intermediate manifold for manifold alignment by minimizing the distance. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the optimal intermediate manifold. Experiments on taxonomic open-set classification tasks across multiple image datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines under few-shot and cross-domain settings.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, interpretability, explainability, diffusion, transformer, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid evolution of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models has made synthetic media increasingly realistic, raising societal concerns around misinformation, identity fraud, and digital trust. Existing deepfake detection methods either rely on deep learning, which suffers from poor generalization and vulnerability to distortions, or forensic analysis, which is interpretable but limited against new manipulation techniques. This study proposes a hybrid framework that fuses forensic features, including noise residuals, JPEG compression traces, and frequency-domain descriptors, with deep learning representations from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs). Evaluated on benchmark datasets (FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF v2, DFDC), the proposed model consistently outperformed single-method baselines and demonstrated superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art hybrid approaches, achieving F1-scores of 0.96, 0.82, and 0.77, respectively. Robustness tests demonstrated stable performance under compression (F1 = 0.87 at QF = 50), adversarial perturbations (AUC = 0.84), and unseen manipulations (F1 = 0.79). Importantly, explainability analysis showed that Grad-CAM and forensic heatmaps overlapped with ground-truth manipulated regions in 82 percent of cases, enhancing transparency and user trust. These findings confirm that hybrid approaches provide a balanced solution, combining the adaptability of deep models with the interpretability of forensic cues, to develop resilient and trustworthy deepfake detection systems.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Knowledge editing has emerged as an efficient approach for updating factual knowledge in large language models (LLMs). It typically locates knowledge storage modules and then modifies their parameters. However, most existing methods focus on the weights of multilayer perceptron (MLP) modules, which are often identified as the main repositories of factual information. Other components, such as attention (Attn) modules, are often ignored during editing. This imbalance can leave residual outdated knowledge and limit editing effectiveness. We perform comprehensive knowledge localization experiments on advanced LLMs and find that Attn modules play a substantial role in factual knowledge storage and retrieval, especially in earlier layers. Based on these insights, we propose IntAttn-Edit, a method that extends the associative memory paradigm to jointly update both MLP and Attn modules. Our approach uses a knowledge balancing strategy that allocates update magnitudes in proportion to each module's measured contribution to knowledge storage. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that IntAttn-Edit achieves higher edit success, better generalization, and stronger knowledge preservation than prior methods. Further analysis shows that the balancing strategy keeps editing performance within an optimal range across diverse settings.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The core bottleneck of Federated Learning (FL) lies in the communication rounds. That is, how to achieve more effective local updates is crucial for reducing communication rounds. Existing FL methods still primarily use element-wise local optimizers (Adam/SGD), neglecting the geometric structure of the weight matrices. This often leads to the amplification of pathological directions in the weights during local updates, leading deterioration in the condition number and slow convergence. Therefore, we introduce the Muon optimizer in local, which has matrix orthogonalization to optimize matrix-structured parameters. Experimental results show that, in IID setting, Local Muon significantly accelerates the convergence of FL and reduces communication rounds compared to Local SGD and Local AdamW. However, in non-IID setting, independent matrix orthogonalization based on the local distributions of each client induces strong client drift. Applying Muon in non-IID FL poses significant challenges: (1) client preconditioner leading to client drift; (2) moment reinitialization. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Federated Muon optimizer (FedMuon), which incorporates two key techniques: (1) momentum aggregation, where clients use the aggregated momentum for local initialization; (2) local-global alignment, where the local gradients are aligned with the global update direction to significantly reduce client drift. Theoretically, we prove that \texttt{FedMuon} achieves a linear speedup convergence rate without the heterogeneity assumption, where $S$ is the number of participating clients per round, $K$ is the number of local iterations, and $R$ is the total number of communication rounds. Empirically, we validate the effectiveness of FedMuon on language and vision models. Compared to several baselines, FedMuon significantly reduces communication rounds and improves test accuracy.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Interpretability is crucial for building safe, reliable, and controllable language models, yet existing interpretability pipelines remain costly and difficult to scale. Interpreting a new model typically requires costly training of model-specific sparse autoencoders, manual or semi-automated labeling of SAE components, and their subsequent validation. We introduce Atlas-Alignment, a framework for transferring interpretability across language models by aligning unknown latent spaces to a Concept Atlas - a labeled, human-interpretable latent space - using only shared inputs and lightweight representational alignment techniques. Once aligned, this enables two key capabilities in previously opaque models: (1) semantic feature search and retrieval, and (2) steering generation along human-interpretable atlas concepts. Through quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we show that simple representational alignment methods enable robust semantic retrieval and steerable generation without the need for labeled concept data. Atlas-Alignment thus amortizes the cost of explainable AI and mechanistic interpretability: by investing in one high-quality Concept Atlas, we can make many new models transparent and controllable at minimal marginal cost.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Advances in large language models are making personalized AI agents a new research focus. While current agent systems primarily rely on personalized external memory databases to deliver customized experiences, they face challenges such as memory redundancy, memory staleness, and poor memory-context integration, largely due to the lack of effective memory updates during interaction. To tackle these issues, we propose a new memory management system designed for affective scenarios. Our approach employs a Bayesian-inspired memory update algorithm with the concept of memory entropy, enabling the agent to autonomously maintain a dynamically updated memory vector database by minimizing global entropy to provide more personalized services. To better evaluate the system's effectiveness in this context, we propose DABench, a benchmark focusing on emotional expression and emotional change toward objects. Experimental results demonstrate that, our system achieves superior performance in personalization, logical coherence, and accuracy. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the Bayesian-inspired update mechanism in alleviating memory bloat. Our work offers new insights into the design of long-term memory systems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep learning models aim to improve diagnostic workflows, but fairness evaluation remains underexplored beyond classification, e.g., in image segmentation. Unaddressed segmentation bias can lead to disparities in the quality of care for certain populations, potentially compounded across clinical decision points and amplified through iterative model development. Here, we audit the fairness of the automated segmentation labels provided in the breast cancer tumor segmentation dataset MAMA-MIA. We evaluate automated segmentation quality across age, ethnicity, and data source. Our analysis reveals an intrinsic age-related bias against younger patients that continues to persist even after controlling for confounding factors, such as data source. We hypothesize that this bias may be linked to physiological factors, a known challenge for both radiologists and automated systems. Finally, we show how aggregating data from multiple data sources influences site-specific ethnic biases, underscoring the necessity of investigating data at a granular level.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Blind image deconvolution is a challenging ill-posed inverse problem, where both the latent sharp image and the blur kernel are unknown. Traditional methods often rely on handcrafted priors, while modern deep learning approaches typically require extensive pre-training on large external datasets, limiting their adaptability to real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose DeblurSDI, a zero-shot, self-supervised framework based on self-diffusion (SDI) that requires no prior training. DeblurSDI formulates blind deconvolution as an iterative reverse self-diffusion process that starts from pure noise and progressively refines the solution. At each step, two randomly-initialized neural networks are optimized continuously to refine the sharp image and the blur kernel. The optimization is guided by an objective function combining data consistency with a sparsity-promoting L1-norm for the kernel. A key innovation is our noise scheduling mechanism, which stabilizes the optimization and provides remarkable robustness to variations in blur kernel size. These allow DeblurSDI to dynamically learn an instance-specific prior tailored to the input image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeblurSDI consistently achieves superior performance, recovering sharp images and accurate kernels even in highly degraded scenarios.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated strong potential in medical imaging; however, their high computational demands and tendency to overfit on small datasets limit their applicability in real-world clinical scenarios. In this paper, we present CoMViT, a compact and generalizable Vision Transformer architecture optimized for resource-constrained medical image analysis. CoMViT integrates a convolutional tokenizer, diagonal masking, dynamic temperature scaling, and pooling-based sequence aggregation to improve performance and generalization. Through systematic architectural optimization, CoMViT achieves robust performance across twelve MedMNIST datasets while maintaining a lightweight design with only ~4.5M parameters. It matches or outperforms deeper CNN and ViT variants, offering up to 5-20x parameter reduction without sacrificing accuracy. Qualitative Grad-CAM analyses show that CoMViT consistently attends to clinically relevant regions despite its compact size. These results highlight the potential of principled ViT redesign for developing efficient and interpretable models in low-resource medical imaging settings.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Understanding post-wildfire vegetation loss is critical for developing effective ecological recovery strategies and is often challenging due to the extended time and effort required to capture the evolving ecosystem features. Recent works in this area have not fully explored all the contributing factors, their modalities, and interactions with each other. Furthermore, most research in this domain is limited by a lack of interpretability in predictive modeling, making it less useful in real-world settings. In this work, we propose a novel end-to-end ML pipeline called MVeLMA (\textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{Ve}getation \textbf{L}oss \textbf{M}odeling \textbf{A}rchitecture) to predict county-wise vegetation loss from fire events. MVeLMA uses a multimodal feature integration pipeline and a stacked ensemble-based architecture to capture different modalities while also incorporating uncertainty estimation through probabilistic modeling. Through comprehensive experiments, we show that our model outperforms several state-of-the-art (SOTA) and baseline models in predicting post-wildfire vegetation loss. Furthermore, we generate vegetation loss confidence maps to identify high-risk counties, thereby helping targeted recovery efforts. The findings of this work have the potential to inform future disaster relief planning, ecological policy development, and wildlife recovery management.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Scientific illustrations demand both high information density and post-editability. However, current generative models have two major limitations: Frist, image generation models output rasterized images lacking semantic structure, making it impossible to access, edit, or rearrange independent visual components in the images. Second, code-based generation methods (TikZ or SVG), although providing element-level control, force users into the cumbersome cycle of "writing-compiling-reviewing" and lack the intuitiveness of manipulation. Neither of these two approaches can well meet the needs for efficiency, intuitiveness, and iterative modification in scientific creation. To bridge this gap, we introduce VisPainter, a multi-agent framework for scientific illustration built upon the model context protocol. VisPainter orchestrates three specialized modules-a Manager, a Designer, and a Toolbox-to collaboratively produce diagrams compatible with standard vector graphics software. This modular, role-based design allows each element to be explicitly represented and manipulated, enabling true element-level control and any element can be added and modified later. To systematically evaluate the quality of scientific illustrations, we introduce VisBench, a benchmark with seven-dimensional evaluation metrics. It assesses high-information-density scientific illustrations from four aspects: content, layout, visual perception, and interaction cost. To this end, we conducted extensive ablation experiments to verify the rationality of our architecture and the reliability of our evaluation methods. Finally, we evaluated various vision-language models, presenting fair and credible model rankings along with detailed comparisons of their respective capabilities. Additionally, we isolated and quantified the impacts of role division, step control,and description on the quality of illustrations.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on long chain-of-thought (CoT) trajectories has emerged as a crucial technique for enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, the standard cross-entropy loss treats all tokens equally, ignoring their heterogeneous contributions across a reasoning trajectory. This uniform treatment leads to misallocated supervision and weak generalization, especially in complex, long-form reasoning tasks. To address this, we introduce \textbf{V}ariance-\textbf{C}ontrolled \textbf{O}ptimization-based \textbf{RE}weighting (VCORE), a principled framework that reformulates CoT supervision as a constrained optimization problem. By adopting an optimization-theoretic perspective, VCORE enables a principled and adaptive allocation of supervision across tokens, thereby aligning the training objective more closely with the goal of robust reasoning generalization. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that VCORE consistently outperforms existing token reweighting methods. Across both in-domain and out-of-domain settings, VCORE achieves substantial performance gains on mathematical and coding benchmarks, using models from the Qwen3 series (4B, 8B, 32B) and LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct. Moreover, we show that VCORE serves as a more effective initialization for subsequent reinforcement learning, establishing a stronger foundation for advancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. The Code will be released at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have witnessed remarkable advancements, with the test-time scaling law consistently enhancing the reasoning capabilities. Through systematic evaluation and exploration of a diverse spectrum of intermediate thoughts, LLMs demonstrate the potential to generate deliberate reasoning steps, thereby substantially enhancing reasoning accuracy. However, LLMs' autoregressive generation paradigm results in reasoning performance scaling sub-optimally with test-time computation, often requiring excessive computational overhead to propose thoughts while yielding only marginal performance gains. In contrast, diffusion language models (DLMs) can efficiently produce diverse samples through parallel denoising in a single forward pass, inspiring us to leverage them for proposing intermediate thoughts, thereby alleviating the computational burden associated with autoregressive generation while maintaining quality. In this work, we propose an efficient collaborative reasoning framework, leveraging DLMs to generate candidate thoughts and LLMs to evaluate their quality. Experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our framework achieves strong performance in complex reasoning tasks, offering a promising direction for future research.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Graphs are central to modeling complex systems in domains such as social networks, molecular chemistry, and neuroscience. While Graph Neural Networks, particularly Graph Convolutional Networks, have become standard tools for graph learning, they remain constrained by reliance on fixed structures and susceptibility to over-smoothing. We propose the Spectral Preservation Network, a new framework for graph representation learning that generates reduced graphs serving as faithful proxies of the original, enabling downstream tasks such as community detection, influence propagation, and information diffusion at a reduced computational cost. The Spectral Preservation Network introduces two key components: the Joint Graph Evolution layer and the Spectral Concordance loss. The former jointly transforms both the graph topology and the node feature matrix, allowing the structure and attributes to evolve adaptively across layers and overcoming the rigidity of static neighborhood aggregation. The latter regularizes these transformations by enforcing consistency in both the spectral properties of the graph and the feature vectors of the nodes. We evaluate the effectiveness of Spectral Preservation Network on node-level sparsification by analyzing well-established metrics and benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance and clear advantages of our approach.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Since deepfakes generated by advanced generative models have rapidly posed serious threats, existing audiovisual deepfake detection approaches struggle to generalize to unseen forgeries. We propose a novel reference-aware audiovisual deepfake detection method, called Referee. Speaker-specific cues from only one-shot examples are leveraged to detect manipulations beyond spatiotemporal artifacts. By matching and aligning identity-related queries from reference and target content into cross-modal features, Referee jointly reasons about audiovisual synchrony and identity consistency. Extensive experiments on FakeAVCeleb, FaceForensics++, and KoDF demonstrate that Referee achieves state-of-the-art performance on cross-dataset and cross-language evaluation protocols. Experimental results highlight the importance of cross-modal identity verification for future deepfake detection. The code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Underwater exploration offers critical insights into our planet and attracts increasing attention for its broader applications in resource exploration, national security, etc. We study the underwater scene understanding methods, which aim to achieve automated underwater exploration. The underwater scene understanding task demands multi-task perceptions from multiple granularities. However, the absence of large-scale underwater multi-task instruction-tuning datasets hinders the progress of this research. To bridge this gap, we construct NautData, a dataset containing 1.45 M image-text pairs supporting eight underwater scene understanding tasks. It enables the development and thorough evaluation of the underwater scene understanding models. Underwater image degradation is a widely recognized challenge that interferes with underwater tasks. To improve the robustness of underwater scene understanding, we introduce physical priors derived from underwater imaging models and propose a plug-and-play vision feature enhancement (VFE) module, which explicitly restores clear underwater information. We integrate this module into renowned baselines LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen2.5-VL and build our underwater LMM, NAUTILUS. Experiments conducted on the NautData and public underwater datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the VFE module, consistently improving the performance of both baselines on the majority of supported tasks, thus ensuring the superiority of NAUTILUS in the underwater scene understanding area.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Systems programmers have to consolidate the ever growing hardware mess present on modern System-on-Chips (SoCs). Correctly programming a multitude of components, providing functionality but also security, is a difficult problem: semantics of individual units are described in English prose, descriptions are often underspecified, and prone to inaccuracies. Rigorous statements about platform security are often impossible. We introduce a domain-specific language to describe hardware semantics, assumptions about software behavior, and desired security properties. We then create machine-readable specifications for a diverse set of eight SoCs from their reference manuals, and formally prove their (in-)security. In addition to security proofs about memory confidentiality and integrity, we discover a handful of documentation errors. Finally, our analysis also revealed a vulnerability on a real-world server chip. Our tooling offers system integrators a way of formally describing security properties for entire SoCs, and means to prove them or find counterexamples to them.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>federate, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>AdamW has become one of the most effective optimizers for training large-scale models. We have also observed its effectiveness in the context of federated learning (FL). However, directly applying AdamW in federated learning settings poses significant challenges: (1) due to data heterogeneity, AdamW often yields high variance in the second-moment estimate $\boldsymbol{v}$; (2) the local overfitting of AdamW may cause client drift; and (3) Reinitializing moment estimates ($\boldsymbol{v}$, $\boldsymbol{m}$) at each round slows down convergence. To address these challenges, we propose the first \underline{Fed}erated \underline{AdamW} algorithm, called \texttt{FedAdamW}, for training and fine-tuning various large models. \texttt{FedAdamW} aligns local updates with the global update using both a \textbf{local correction mechanism} and decoupled weight decay to mitigate local overfitting. \texttt{FedAdamW} efficiently aggregates the \texttt{mean} of the second-moment estimates to reduce their variance and reinitialize them. Theoretically, we prove that \texttt{FedAdamW} achieves a linear speedup convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{(L \Delta \sigma_l^2)/(S K R \epsilon^2)}+(L \Delta)/R)$ without \textbf{heterogeneity assumption}, where $S$ is the number of participating clients per round, $K$ is the number of local iterations, and $R$ is the total number of communication rounds. We also employ PAC-Bayesian generalization analysis to explain the effectiveness of decoupled weight decay in local training. Empirically, we validate the effectiveness of \texttt{FedAdamW} on language and vision Transformer models. Compared to several baselines, \texttt{FedAdamW} significantly reduces communication rounds and improves test accuracy. The code is available in this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Transformer-based autoregressive models have emerged as a unifying paradigm across modalities such as text and images, but their extension to 3D molecule generation remains underexplored. The gap stems from two fundamental challenges: (1) tokenizing molecules into a canonical 1D sequence of tokens that is invariant to both SE(3) transformations and atom index permutations, and (2) designing an architecture capable of modeling hybrid atom-based tokens that couple discrete atom types with continuous 3D coordinates. To address these challenges, we introduce InertialAR. InertialAR devises a canonical tokenization that aligns molecules to their inertial frames and reorders atoms to ensure SE(3) and permutation invariance. Moreover, InertialAR equips the attention mechanism with geometric awareness via geometric rotary positional encoding (GeoRoPE). In addition, it utilizes a hierarchical autoregressive paradigm to predict the next atom-based token, predicting the atom type first and then its 3D coordinates via Diffusion loss. Experimentally, InertialAR achieves state-of-the-art performance on 7 of the 10 evaluation metrics for unconditional molecule generation across QM9, GEOM-Drugs, and B3LYP. Moreover, it significantly outperforms strong baselines in controllable generation for targeted chemical functionality, attaining state-of-the-art results across all 5 metrics.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, protect, attack, federate, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>To prevent inference attacks in Federated Learning (FL) and reduce the leakage of sensitive information, Client-level Differentially Private Federated Learning (CL-DPFL) is widely used. However, current CL-DPFL methods usually result in sharper loss landscapes, which leads to a decrease in model generalization after differential privacy protection. By using Sharpness Aware Minimization (SAM), the current popular federated learning methods are to find a local flat minimum value to alleviate this problem. However, the local flatness may not reflect the global flatness in CL-DPFL. Therefore, to address this issue and seek global flat minima of models, we propose a new CL-DPFL algorithm, DP-FedPGN, in which we introduce a global gradient norm penalty to the local loss to find the global flat minimum. Moreover, by using our global gradient norm penalty, we not only find a flatter global minimum but also reduce the locally updated norm, which means that we further reduce the error of gradient clipping. From a theoretical perspective, we analyze how DP-FedPGN mitigates the performance degradation caused by DP. Meanwhile, the proposed DP-FedPGN algorithm eliminates the impact of data heterogeneity and achieves fast convergence. We also use Rényi DP to provide strict privacy guarantees and provide sensitivity analysis for local updates. Finally, we conduct effectiveness tests on both ResNet and Transformer models, and achieve significant improvements in six visual and natural language processing tasks compared to existing state-of-the-art algorithms.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Accurate lung tumor segmentation is vital for improving diagnosis and treatment planning, and effectively combining anatomical and functional information from PET and CT remains a major challenge. In this study, we propose vMambaX, a lightweight multimodal framework integrating PET and CT scan images through a Context-Gated Cross-Modal Perception Module (CGM). Built on the Visual Mamba architecture, vMambaX adaptively enhances inter-modality feature interaction, emphasizing informative regions while suppressing noise. Evaluated on the PCLT20K dataset, the model outperforms baseline models while maintaining lower computational complexity. These results highlight the effectiveness of adaptive cross-modal gating for multimodal tumor segmentation and demonstrate the potential of vMambaX as an efficient and scalable framework for advanced lung cancer analysis.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Machine learning models typically assume that training and test data follow the same distribution, an assumption that often fails in real-world scenarios due to distribution shifts. This issue is especially pronounced in low-resource settings, where data scarcity and limited domain diversity hinder robust generalization. Domain generalization (DG) approaches address this challenge by learning features that remain invariant across domains, often using causal mechanisms to improve model robustness. In this study, we examine two distinct causal DG techniques in low-resource natural language tasks. First, we investigate a causal data augmentation (CDA) approach that automatically generates counterfactual examples to improve robustness to spurious correlations. We apply this method to sentiment classification on the NaijaSenti Twitter corpus, expanding the training data with semantically equivalent paraphrases to simulate controlled distribution shifts. Second, we explore an invariant causal representation learning (ICRL) approach using the DINER framework, originally proposed for debiasing aspect-based sentiment analysis. We adapt DINER to a multilingual setting. Our findings demonstrate that both approaches enhance robustness to unseen domains: counterfactual data augmentation yields consistent cross-domain accuracy gains in sentiment classification, while causal representation learning with DINER improves out-of-distribution performance in multilingual sentiment analysis, albeit with varying gains across languages.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Transformer-based architectures have advanced text summarization, yet their quadratic complexity limits scalability on long documents. This paper introduces BiSparse-AAS (Bilinear Sparse Attention with Adaptive Spans), a novel framework that combines sparse attention, adaptive spans, and bilinear attention to address these limitations. Sparse attention reduces computational costs by focusing on the most relevant parts of the input, while adaptive spans dynamically adjust the attention ranges. Bilinear attention complements both by modeling complex token interactions within this refined context. BiSparse-AAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both extractive and abstractive summarization tasks, achieving average ROUGE improvements of about 68.1% on CNN/DailyMail and 52.6% on XSum, while maintaining strong performance on OpenWebText and Gigaword datasets. By addressing efficiency, scalability, and long-sequence modeling, BiSparse-AAS provides a unified, practical solution for real-world text summarization applications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) training is prohibitively expensive, driving interest in low-precision fully-quantized training (FQT). While novel 4-bit formats like NVFP4 offer substantial efficiency gains, achieving near-lossless training at such low precision remains challenging. We introduce TetraJet-v2, an end-to-end 4-bit FQT method that leverages NVFP4 for activations, weights, and gradients in all linear layers. We identify two critical issues hindering low-precision LLM training: weight oscillation and outliers. To address these, we propose: 1) an unbiased double-block quantization method for NVFP4 linear layers, 2) OsciReset, an algorithm to suppress weight oscillation, and 3) OutControl, an algorithm to retain outlier accuracy. TetraJet-v2 consistently outperforms prior FP4 training methods on pre-training LLMs across varying model sizes up to 370M and data sizes up to 200B tokens, reducing the performance gap to full-precision training by an average of 51.3%.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce SQLSpace, a human-interpretable, generalizable, compact representation for text-to-SQL examples derived with minimal human intervention. We demonstrate the utility of these representations in evaluation with three use cases: (i) closely comparing and contrasting the composition of popular text-to-SQL benchmarks to identify unique dimensions of examples they evaluate, (ii) understanding model performance at a granular level beyond overall accuracy scores, and (iii) improving model performance through targeted query rewriting based on learned correctness estimation. We show that SQLSpace enables analysis that would be difficult with raw examples alone: it reveals compositional differences between benchmarks, exposes performance patterns obscured by accuracy alone, and supports modeling of query success.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>protect, attack, robust, extraction, watermark</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The protection of intellectual property has become critical due to the rapid growth of three-dimensional content in digital media. Unlike traditional images or videos, 3D point clouds present unique challenges for copyright enforcement, as they are especially vulnerable to a range of geometric and non-geometric attacks that can easily degrade or remove conventional watermark signals. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing a robust deep neural watermarking framework for 3D point cloud copyright protection and ownership verification. Our approach embeds binary watermarks into the singular values of 3D point cloud blocks using spectral decomposition, i.e. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), and leverages the extraction capabilities of Deep Learning using PointNet++ neural network architecture. The network is trained to reliably extract watermarks even after the data undergoes various attacks such as rotation, scaling, noise, cropping and signal distortions. We validated our method using the publicly available ModelNet40 dataset, demonstrating that deep learning-based extraction significantly outperforms traditional SVD-based techniques under challenging conditions. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that the deep learning-based extraction approach significantly outperforms existing SVD-based methods with deep learning achieving bitwise accuracy up to 0.83 and Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.80, compared to SVD achieving a bitwise accuracy of 0.58 and IoU of 0.26 for the Crop (70%) attack, which is the most severe geometric distortion in our experiment. This demonstrates our method's ability to achieve superior watermark recovery and maintain high fidelity even under severe distortions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly demonstrating the potential to reach human-level performance in generating clinical summaries from patient-clinician conversations. However, these summaries often focus on patients' biology rather than their preferences, values, wishes, and concerns. To achieve patient-centered care, we propose a new standard for Artificial Intelligence (AI) clinical summarization tasks: Patient-Centered Summaries (PCS). Our objective was to develop a framework to generate PCS that capture patient values and ensure clinical utility and to assess whether current open-source LLMs can achieve human-level performance in this task. We used a mixed-methods process. Two Patient and Public Involvement groups (10 patients and 8 clinicians) in the United Kingdom participated in semi-structured interviews exploring what personal and contextual information should be included in clinical summaries and how it should be structured for clinical use. Findings informed annotation guidelines used by eight clinicians to create gold-standard PCS from 88 atrial fibrillation consultations. Sixteen consultations were used to refine a prompt aligned with the guidelines. Five open-source LLMs (Llama-3.2-3B, Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-8B, Gemma-3-4B, and Qwen3-8B) generated summaries for 72 consultations using zero-shot and few-shot prompting, evaluated with ROUGE-L, BERTScore, and qualitative metrics. Patients emphasized lifestyle routines, social support, recent stressors, and care values. Clinicians sought concise functional, psychosocial, and emotional context. The best zero-shot performance was achieved by Mistral-8B (ROUGE-L 0.189) and Llama-3.1-8B (BERTScore 0.673); the best few-shot by Llama-3.1-8B (ROUGE-L 0.206, BERTScore 0.683). Completeness and fluency were similar between experts and models, while correctness and patient-centeredness favored human PCS.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) shows significant promise in knowledge-intensive tasks by improving domain specificity, enhancing temporal relevance, and reducing hallucinations. However, applying RAG to finance encounters critical challenges: restricted access to proprietary datasets, limited retrieval accuracy, regulatory constraints, and sensitive data interpretation. We introduce AstuteRAG-FQA, an adaptive RAG framework tailored for Financial Question Answering (FQA), leveraging task-aware prompt engineering to address these challenges. The framework uses a hybrid retrieval strategy integrating both open-source and proprietary financial data while maintaining strict security protocols and regulatory compliance. A dynamic prompt framework adapts in real time to query complexity, improving precision and contextual relevance. To systematically address diverse financial queries, we propose a four-tier task classification: explicit factual, implicit factual, interpretable rationale, and hidden rationale involving implicit causal reasoning. For each category, we identify key challenges, datasets, and optimization techniques within the retrieval and generation process. The framework incorporates multi-layered security mechanisms including differential privacy, data anonymization, and role-based access controls to protect sensitive financial information. Additionally, AstuteRAG-FQA implements real-time compliance monitoring through automated regulatory validation systems that verify responses against industry standards and legal obligations. We evaluate three data integration techniques - contextual embedding, small model augmentation, and targeted fine-tuning - analyzing their efficiency and feasibility across varied financial environments.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present DialectalArabicMMLU, a new benchmark for evaluating the performance of large language models (LLMs) across Arabic dialects. While recently developed Arabic and multilingual benchmarks have advanced LLM evaluation for Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), dialectal varieties remain underrepresented despite their prevalence in everyday communication. DialectalArabicMMLU extends the MMLU-Redux framework through manual translation and adaptation of 3K multiple-choice question-answer pairs into five major dialects (Syrian, Egyptian, Emirati, Saudi, and Moroccan), yielding a total of 15K QA pairs across 32 academic and professional domains (22K QA pairs when also including English and MSA). The benchmark enables systematic assessment of LLM reasoning and comprehension beyond MSA, supporting both task-based and linguistic analysis. We evaluate 19 open-weight Arabic and multilingual LLMs (1B-13B parameters) and report substantial performance variation across dialects, revealing persistent gaps in dialectal generalization. DialectalArabicMMLU provides the first unified, human-curated resource for measuring dialectal understanding in Arabic, thus promoting more inclusive evaluation and future model development.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Historical maps are unique and valuable archives that document geographic features across different time periods. However, automated analysis of historical map images remains a significant challenge due to their wide stylistic variability and the scarcity of annotated training data. Constructing linked spatio-temporal datasets from historical map time series is even more time-consuming and labor-intensive, as it requires synthesizing information from multiple maps. Such datasets are essential for applications such as dating buildings, analyzing the development of road networks and settlements, studying environmental changes etc. We present MapSAM2, a unified framework for automatically segmenting both historical map images and time series. Built on a visual foundation model, MapSAM2 adapts to diverse segmentation tasks with few-shot fine-tuning. Our key innovation is to treat both historical map images and time series as videos. For images, we process a set of tiles as a video, enabling the memory attention mechanism to incorporate contextual cues from similar tiles, leading to improved geometric accuracy, particularly for areal features. For time series, we introduce the annotated Siegfried Building Time Series Dataset and, to reduce annotation costs, propose generating pseudo time series from single-year maps by simulating common temporal transformations. Experimental results show that MapSAM2 learns temporal associations effectively and can accurately segment and link buildings in time series under limited supervision or using pseudo videos. We will release both our dataset and code to support future research.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In multilingual healthcare applications, the availability of domain-specific natural language processing(NLP) tools is limited, especially for low-resource languages. Although multilingual bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) offers a promising motivation to mitigate the language gap, the medical NLP tasks in low-resource languages are still underexplored. Therefore, this study investigates how further pre-training on domain-specific corpora affects model performance on medical tasks, focusing on three languages: Dutch, Romanian and Spanish. In terms of further pre-training, we conducted four experiments to create medical domain models. Then, these models were fine-tuned on three downstream tasks: Automated patient screening in Dutch clinical notes, named entity recognition in Romanian and Spanish clinical notes. Results show that domain adaptation significantly enhanced task performance. Furthermore, further differentiation of domains, e.g. clinical and general biomedical domains, resulted in diverse performances. The clinical domain-adapted model outperformed the more general biomedical domain-adapted model. Moreover, we observed evidence of cross-lingual transferability. Moreover, we also conducted further investigations to explore potential reasons contributing to these performance differences. These findings highlight the feasibility of domain adaptation and cross-lingual ability in medical NLP. Within the low-resource language settings, these findings can provide meaningful guidance for developing multilingual medical NLP systems to mitigate the lack of training data and thereby improve the model performance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>x402 enables Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) services like application programming interfaces (APIs), data feeds, and inference providers to accept cryptocurrency payments for access. As agents increasingly consume these services, discovery becomes critical: which swap interface should an agent trust? Which data provider is the most reliable? We introduce TraceRank, a reputation-weighted ranking algorithm where payment transactions serve as endorsements. TraceRank seeds addresses with precomputed reputation metrics and propagates reputation through payment flows weighted by transaction value and temporal recency. Applied to x402's payment graph, this surfaces services preferred by high-reputation users rather than those with high transaction volume. Our system combines TraceRank with semantic search to respond to natural language queries with high quality results. We argue that reputation propagation resists Sybil attacks by making spam services with many low-reputation payers rank below legitimate services with few high-reputation payers. Ultimately, we aim to construct a search method for x402 enabled services that avoids infrastructure bias and has better performance than purely volume based or semantic methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>LLMs often require adaptation to domain-specific requirements, a process that can be expensive when relying solely on SFT. We present an empirical study on applying CPO to simulate a post-editing workflow for data-efficient domain adaptation. Our approach synthesizes preference pairs by treating the base model's own raw output as the 'rejected' translation and the human-approved TM entry as the 'chosen' one. This method provides direct feedback on the model's current knowledge, guiding it to align with domain-specific standards. Experiments in English-Brazilian Portuguese and English-Korean show that, by using just 14.7k preference pairs, the model achieves performance close to that of a model trained on 160k+ samples with SFT, demonstrating significant data efficiency. Although we showcase its effectiveness in MT, this application of CPO naturally generalizes to other generative tasks where a model's initial drafts can serve as a contrastive signal against a golden reference.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at reasoning and generation but are inherently limited by static pretraining data, resulting in factual inaccuracies and weak adaptability to new information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this issue by grounding LLMs in external knowledge; However, the effectiveness of RAG critically depends on whether the model can adequately access relevant information. Existing RAG systems rely on a single retriever with fixed top-k selection, restricting access to a narrow and static subset of the corpus. As a result, this single-retriever paradigm has become the primary bottleneck for comprehensive external information acquisition, especially in tasks requiring corpus-level reasoning. To overcome this limitation, we propose MARAG-R1, a reinforcement-learned multi-tool RAG framework that enables LLMs to dynamically coordinate multiple retrieval mechanisms for broader and more precise information access. MARAG-R1 equips the model with four retrieval tools -- semantic search, keyword search, filtering, and aggregation -- and learns both how and when to use them through a two-stage training process: supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning. This design allows the model to interleave reasoning and retrieval, progressively gathering sufficient evidence for corpus-level synthesis. Experiments on GlobalQA, HotpotQA, and 2WikiMultiHopQA demonstrate that MARAG-R1 substantially outperforms strong baselines and achieves new state-of-the-art results in corpus-level reasoning tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Neural networks have changed the way machines interpret the world. At their core, they learn by following gradients, adjusting their parameters step by step until they identify the most discriminant patterns in the data. This process gives them their strength, yet it also opens the door to a hidden flaw. The very gradients that help a model learn can also be used to produce small, imperceptible tweaks that cause the model to completely alter its decision. Such tweaks are called adversarial attacks. These attacks exploit this vulnerability by adding tiny, imperceptible changes to images that, while leaving them identical to the human eye, cause the model to make wrong predictions. In this work, we propose Adversarially-trained Contrastive Hard-mining for Optimized Robustness (ANCHOR), a framework that leverages the power of supervised contrastive learning with explicit hard positive mining to enable the model to learn representations for images such that the embeddings for the images, their augmentations, and their perturbed versions cluster together in the embedding space along with those for other images of the same class while being separated from images of other classes. This alignment helps the model focus on stable, meaningful patterns rather than fragile gradient cues. On CIFAR-10, our approach achieves impressive results for both clean and robust accuracy under PGD-20 (epsilon = 0.031), outperforming standard adversarial training methods. Our results indicate that combining adversarial guidance with hard-mined contrastive supervision helps models learn more structured and robust representations, narrowing the gap between accuracy and robustness.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid progress of generative diffusion models has enabled the creation of synthetic images that are increasingly difficult to distinguish from real ones, raising concerns about authenticity, copyright, and misinformation. Existing supervised detectors often struggle to generalize across unseen generators, requiring extensive labeled data and frequent retraining. We introduce FRIDA (Fake-image Recognition and source Identification via Diffusion-features Analysis), a lightweight framework that leverages internal activations from a pre-trained diffusion model for deepfake detection and source generator attribution. A k-nearest-neighbor classifier applied to diffusion features achieves state-of-the-art cross-generator performance without fine-tuning, while a compact neural model enables accurate source attribution. These results show that diffusion representations inherently encode generator-specific patterns, providing a simple and interpretable foundation for synthetic image forensics.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recently, augmenting Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) with world modeling has shown promise in improving robotic policy learning. However, it remains challenging to jointly predict next-state observations and action sequences because of the inherent difference between the two modalities. To address this, we propose DUal-STream diffusion (DUST), a world-model augmented VLA framework that handles the modality conflict and enhances the performance of VLAs across diverse tasks. Specifically, we propose a multimodal diffusion transformer architecture that explicitly maintains separate modality streams while still enabling cross-modal knowledge sharing. In addition, we introduce independent noise perturbations for each modality and a decoupled flow-matching loss. This design enables the model to learn the joint distribution in a bidirectional manner while avoiding the need for a unified latent space. Based on the decoupling of modalities during training, we also introduce a joint sampling method that supports test-time scaling, where action and vision tokens evolve asynchronously at different rates. Through experiments on simulated benchmarks such as RoboCasa and GR-1, DUST achieves up to 6% gains over baseline methods, while our test-time scaling approach provides an additional 2-5% boost. On real-world tasks with the Franka Research 3, DUST improves success rates by 13%, confirming its effectiveness beyond simulation. Furthermore, pre-training on action-free videos from BridgeV2 yields significant transfer gains on RoboCasa, underscoring DUST's potential for large-scale VLA pretraining.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Formulating optimization problems for industrial applications demands significant manual effort and domain expertise. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in automating this process, evaluating their performance remains difficult due to the absence of robust metrics. Existing solver-based approaches often face inconsistency, infeasibility issues, and high computational costs. To address these issues, we propose ORGEval, a graph-theoretic evaluation framework for assessing LLMs' capabilities in formulating linear and mixed-integer linear programs. ORGEval represents optimization models as graphs, reducing equivalence detection to graph isomorphism testing. We identify and prove a sufficient condition, when the tested graphs are symmetric decomposable (SD), under which the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test is guaranteed to correctly detect isomorphism. Building on this, ORGEval integrates a tailored variant of the WL-test with an SD detection algorithm to evaluate model equivalence. By focusing on structural equivalence rather than instance-level configurations, ORGEval is robust to numerical variations. Experimental results show that our method can successfully detect model equivalence and produce 100\% consistent results across random parameter configurations, while significantly outperforming solver-based methods in runtime, especially on difficult problems. Leveraging ORGEval, we construct the Bench4Opt dataset and benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs on optimization modeling. Our results reveal that although optimization modeling remains challenging for all LLMs, DeepSeek-V3 and Claude-Opus-4 achieve the highest accuracies under direct prompting, outperforming even leading reasoning models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Open-weight bio-foundation models present a dual-use dilemma. While holding great promise for accelerating scientific research and drug development, they could also enable bad actors to develop more deadly bioweapons. To mitigate the risk posed by these models, current approaches focus on filtering biohazardous data during pre-training. However, the effectiveness of such an approach remains unclear, particularly against determined actors who might fine-tune these models for malicious use. To address this gap, we propose \eval, a framework to evaluate the robustness of procedures that are intended to reduce the dual-use capabilities of bio-foundation models. \eval assesses models' virus understanding through three lenses, including sequence modeling, mutational effects prediction, and virulence prediction. Our results show that current filtering practices may not be particularly effective: Excluded knowledge can be rapidly recovered in some cases via fine-tuning, and exhibits broader generalizability in sequence modeling. Furthermore, dual-use signals may already reside in the pretrained representations, and can be elicited via simple linear probing. These findings highlight the challenges of data filtering as a standalone procedure, underscoring the need for further research into robust safety and security strategies for open-weight bio-foundation models.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Graphic layout generation is a growing research area focusing on generating aesthetically pleasing layouts ranging from poster designs to documents. While recent research has explored ways to incorporate user constraints to guide the layout generation, these constraints often require complex specifications which reduce usability. We introduce an innovative approach exploiting user-provided sketches as intuitive constraints and we demonstrate empirically the effectiveness of this new guidance method, establishing the sketch-to-layout problem as a promising research direction, which is currently under-explored. To tackle the sketch-to-layout problem, we propose a multimodal transformer-based solution using the sketch and the content assets as inputs to produce high quality layouts. Since collecting sketch training data from human annotators to train our model is very costly, we introduce a novel and efficient method to synthetically generate training sketches at scale. We train and evaluate our model on three publicly available datasets: PubLayNet, DocLayNet and SlidesVQA, demonstrating that it outperforms state-of-the-art constraint-based methods, while offering a more intuitive design experience. In order to facilitate future sketch-to-layout research, we release O(200k) synthetically-generated sketches for the public datasets above. The datasets are available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant computational bottlenecks during inference due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention mechanisms, particularly as context lengths increase. We introduce SpecAttn, a novel training-free approach that seamlessly integrates with existing speculative decoding techniques to enable efficient sparse attention in pre-trained transformers. Our key insight is to exploit the attention weights already computed by the draft model during speculative decoding to identify important tokens for the target model, eliminating redundant computation while maintaining output quality. SpecAttn employs three core techniques: KL divergence-based layer alignment between draft and target models, a GPU-optimized sorting-free algorithm for top-p token selection from draft attention patterns, and dynamic key-value cache pruning guided by these predictions. By leveraging the computational work already performed in standard speculative decoding pipelines, SpecAttn achieves over 75% reduction in key-value cache accesses with a mere 15.29% increase in perplexity on the PG-19 dataset, significantly outperforming existing sparse attention methods. Our approach demonstrates that speculative execution can be enhanced to provide approximate verification without significant performance degradation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Semantic segmentation of blood vessels is an important task in medical image analysis, but its progress is often hindered by the scarcity of large annotated datasets and the poor generalization of models across different imaging modalities. A key aspect is the tendency of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to learn texture-based features, which limits their performance when applied to new domains with different visual characteristics. We hypothesize that leveraging geometric priors of vessel shapes, such as their tubular and branching nature, can lead to more robust and data-efficient models. To investigate this, we introduce VessShape, a methodology for generating large-scale 2D synthetic datasets designed to instill a shape bias in segmentation models. VessShape images contain procedurally generated tubular geometries combined with a wide variety of foreground and background textures, encouraging models to learn shape cues rather than textures. We demonstrate that a model pre-trained on VessShape images achieves strong few-shot segmentation performance on two real-world datasets from different domains, requiring only four to ten samples for fine-tuning. Furthermore, the model exhibits notable zero-shot capabilities, effectively segmenting vessels in unseen domains without any target-specific training. Our results indicate that pre-training with a strong shape bias can be an effective strategy to overcome data scarcity and improve model generalization in blood vessel segmentation.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Operando microscopy provides direct insight into the dynamic chemical and physical processes that govern functional materials, yet measurement noise limits the effective resolution and undermines quantitative analysis. Here, we present a general framework for integrating unsupervised deep learning-based denoising into quantitative microscopy workflows across modalities and length scales. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that deep denoising preserves physical fidelity, introduces minimal bias, and reduces uncertainty in model learning with partial differential equation (PDE)-constrained optimization. Applied to experiments, denoising reveals nanoscale chemical and structural heterogeneity in scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) of lithium iron phosphate (LFP), enables automated particle segmentation and phase classification in optical microscopy of graphite electrodes, and reduces noise-induced variability by nearly 80% in neutron radiography to resolve heterogeneous lithium transport. Collectively, these results establish deep denoising as a powerful, modality-agnostic enhancement that advances quantitative operando imaging and extends the reach of previously noise-limited techniques.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>To serve global users safely and productively, LLMs need culture-specific knowledge that might not be learned during pre-training. How do we find such knowledge that is (1) salient to in-group users, but (2) unknown to LLMs? The most common solutions are single-initiative: either researchers define challenging questions that users passively answer (traditional annotation), or users actively produce data that researchers structure as benchmarks (knowledge extraction). The process would benefit from mixed-initiative collaboration, where users guide the process to meaningfully reflect their cultures, and LLMs steer the process towards more challenging questions that meet the researcher's goals. We propose a mixed-initiative methodology called CultureCartography. Here, an LLM initializes annotation with questions for which it has low-confidence answers, making explicit both its prior knowledge and the gaps therein. This allows a human respondent to fill these gaps and steer the model towards salient topics through direct edits. We implement this methodology as a tool called CultureExplorer. Compared to a baseline where humans answer LLM-proposed questions, we find that CultureExplorer more effectively produces knowledge that leading models like DeepSeek R1 and GPT-4o are missing, even with web search. Fine-tuning on this data boosts the accuracy of Llama-3.1-8B by up to 19.2% on related culture benchmarks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Person re-identification (ReID) in surveillance is challenged by occlusion, viewpoint distortion, and poor image quality. Most existing methods rely on complex modules or perform well only on clear frontal images. We propose Sh-ViT (Shuffling Vision Transformer), a lightweight and robust model for occluded person ReID. Built on ViT-Base, Sh-ViT introduces three components: First, a Shuffle module in the final Transformer layer to break spatial correlations and enhance robustness to occlusion and blur; Second, scenario-adapted augmentation (geometric transforms, erasing, blur, and color adjustment) to simulate surveillance conditions; Third, DeiT-based knowledge distillation to improve learning with limited this http URL support real-world evaluation, we construct the MyTT dataset, containing over 10,000 pedestrians and 30,000+ images from base station inspections, with frequent equipment occlusion and camera variations. Experiments show that Sh-ViT achieves 83.2% Rank-1 and 80.1% mAP on MyTT, outperforming CNN and ViT baselines, and 94.6% Rank-1 and 87.5% mAP on Market1501, surpassing state-of-the-art this http URL summary, Sh-ViT improves robustness to occlusion and blur without external modules, offering a practical solution for surveillance-based personnel monitoring.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled impressive multimodal reasoning, yet most medical applications remain limited to 2D imaging. In this work, we extend VLMs to 3D positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET/CT), a domain characterized by large volumetric data, small and dispersed lesions, and lengthy radiology reports. We introduce a large-scale dataset comprising over 11,000 lesion-level descriptions paired with 3D segmentations from more than 5,000 PET/CT exams, extracted via a hybrid rule-based and large language model (LLM) pipeline. Building upon this dataset, we propose PETAR-4B, a 3D mask-aware vision-language model that integrates PET, CT, and lesion contours for spatially grounded report generation. PETAR bridges global contextual reasoning with fine-grained lesion awareness, producing clinically coherent and localized findings. Comprehensive automated and human evaluations demonstrate that PETAR substantially improves PET/CT report generation quality, advancing 3D medical vision-language understanding.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) distills score-based generative models into efficient one-step generators, without requiring a one-to-one correspondence with the sampling trajectories of their teachers. However, limited model capacity causes one-step distilled models underperform on complex generative tasks, e.g., synthesizing intricate object motions in text-to-video generation. Directly extending DMD to multi-step distillation increases memory usage and computational depth, leading to instability and reduced efficiency. While prior works propose stochastic gradient truncation as a potential solution, we observe that it substantially reduces the generation diversity of multi-step distilled models, bringing it down to the level of their one-step counterparts. To address these limitations, we propose Phased DMD, a multi-step distillation framework that bridges the idea of phase-wise distillation with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), reducing learning difficulty while enhancing model capacity. Phased DMD is built upon two key ideas: progressive distribution matching and score matching within subintervals. First, our model divides the SNR range into subintervals, progressively refining the model to higher SNR levels, to better capture complex distributions. Next, to ensure the training objective within each subinterval is accurate, we have conducted rigorous mathematical derivations. We validate Phased DMD by distilling state-of-the-art image and video generation models, including Qwen-Image (20B parameters) and Wan2.2 (28B parameters). Experimental results demonstrate that Phased DMD preserves output diversity better than DMD while retaining key generative capabilities. We will release our code and models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, generative, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The efficiency of large language models (LLMs) is fundamentally limited by their sequential, token-by-token generation process. We argue that overcoming this bottleneck requires a new design axis for LLM scaling: increasing the semantic bandwidth of each generative step. To this end, we introduce Continuous Autoregressive Language Models (CALM), a paradigm shift from discrete next-token prediction to continuous next-vector prediction. CALM uses a high-fidelity autoencoder to compress a chunk of K tokens into a single continuous vector, from which the original tokens can be reconstructed with over 99.9\% accuracy. This allows us to model language as a sequence of continuous vectors instead of discrete tokens, which reduces the number of generative steps by a factor of K. The paradigm shift necessitates a new modeling toolkit; therefore, we develop a comprehensive likelihood-free framework that enables robust training, evaluation, and controllable sampling in the continuous domain. Experiments show that CALM significantly improves the performance-compute trade-off, achieving the performance of strong discrete baselines at a significantly lower computational cost. More importantly, these findings establish next-vector prediction as a powerful and scalable pathway towards ultra-efficient language models. Code: this https URL. Project: this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Non-contact electrocardiogram (ECG) reconstruction from radar signals offers a promising approach for unobtrusive cardiac monitoring. We present LifWavNet, a lifting wavelet network based on a multi-resolution analysis and synthesis (MRAS) model for radar-to-ECG reconstruction. Unlike prior models that use fixed wavelet approaches, LifWavNet employs learnable lifting wavelets with lifting and inverse lifting units to adaptively capture radar signal features and synthesize physiologically meaningful ECG waveforms. To improve reconstruction fidelity, we introduce a multi-resolution short-time Fourier transform (STFT) loss, that enforces consistency with the ground-truth ECG in both temporal and spectral domains. Evaluations on two public datasets demonstrate that LifWavNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in ECG reconstruction and downstream vital sign estimation (heart rate and heart rate variability). Furthermore, intermediate feature visualization highlights the interpretability of multi-resolution decomposition and synthesis in radar-to-ECG reconstruction. These results establish LifWavNet as a robust framework for radar-based non-contact ECG measurement.</li>
