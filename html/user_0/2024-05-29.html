<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using a transformer-based, spatiotemporal attention network (STAN) for gradient-based time-series explanations. First, we trained the STAN model for video classifications using the global and local views of data and weakly supervised labels on time-series data (i.e. the type of an activity). We then leveraged a gradient-based XAI technique (e.g. saliency map) to identify salient frames of time-series data. According to the experiments using the datasets of four medically relevant activities, the STAN model demonstrated its potential to identify important frames of videos.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Understanding generalization in deep neural networks is an active area of research. A promising avenue of exploration has been that of margin measurements: the shortest distance to the decision boundary for a given sample or that sample's representation internal to the network. Margin-based complexity measures have been shown to be correlated with the generalization ability of deep neural networks in some circumstances but not others. The reasons behind the success or failure of these metrics are currently unclear. In this study, we examine margin-based generalization prediction methods in different settings. We motivate why these metrics sometimes fail to accurately predict generalization and how they can be improved. First, we analyze the relationship between margins measured in the input space and sample noise. We find that different types of sample noise can have a very different effect on the overall margin of a network that has modeled noisy data. Following this, we empirically evaluate how robust margins measured at different representational spaces are at predicting generalization. We find that these metrics have several limitations and that a large margin does not exhibit a strong correlation with empirical risk in many cases. Finally, we introduce a new margin-based measure that incorporates an approximation of the underlying data manifold. It is empirically demonstrated that this measure is generally more predictive of generalization than all other margin-based measures. Furthermore, we find that this measurement also outperforms other contemporary complexity measures on a well-known generalization prediction benchmark. In addition, we analyze the utility and limitations of this approach and find that this metric is well aligned with intuitions expressed in prior work.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>VisionTransformers have been shown to be powerful out-of-distribution detectors for ImageNet-scale settings when finetuned from publicly available checkpoints, often outperforming other model types on popular benchmarks. In this work, we investigate the impact of both the pretraining and finetuning scheme on the performance of ViTs on this task by analyzing a large pool of models. We find that the exact type of pretraining has a strong impact on which method works well and on OOD detection performance in general. We further show that certain training schemes might only be effective for a specific type of out-distribution, but not in general, and identify a best-practice training recipe.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Next-frame prediction is a useful and powerful method for modelling and understanding the dynamics of video data. Inspired by the empirical success of causal language modelling and next-token prediction in language modelling, we explore the extent to which next-frame prediction serves as a strong foundational learning strategy (analogous to language modelling) for inducing an understanding of the visual world. In order to quantify the specific visual understanding induced by next-frame prediction, we introduce six diagnostic simulation video datasets derived from fundamental physical laws created by varying physical constants such as gravity and mass. We demonstrate that our models trained only on next-frame prediction are capable of predicting the value of these physical constants (e.g. gravity) without having been trained directly to learn these constants via a regression task. We find that the generative training phase alone induces a model state that can predict physical constants significantly better than that of a random model, improving the loss by a factor of between 1.28 to 6.24. We conclude that next-frame prediction shows great promise as a general learning strategy to induce understanding of the many `laws' that govern the visual domain without the need for explicit labelling.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper introduces WeatherFormer, a transformer encoder-based model designed to learn robust weather features from minimal observations. It addresses the challenge of modeling complex weather dynamics from small datasets, a bottleneck for many prediction tasks in agriculture, epidemiology, and climate science. WeatherFormer was pretrained on a large pretraining dataset comprised of 39 years of satellite measurements across the Americas. With a novel pretraining task and fine-tuning, WeatherFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance in county-level soybean yield prediction and influenza forecasting. Technical innovations include a unique spatiotemporal encoding that captures geographical, annual, and seasonal variations, adapting the transformer architecture to continuous weather data, and a pretraining strategy to learn representations that are robust to missing weather features. This paper for the first time demonstrates the effectiveness of pretraining large transformer encoder models for weather-dependent applications across multiple domains.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We re-examine the problem of reconstructing a high-dimensional signal from a small set of linear measurements, in combination with image prior from a diffusion probabilistic model. Well-established methods for optimizing such measurements include principal component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA) and compressed sensing (CS), all of which rely on axis- or subspace-aligned statistical characterization. But many naturally occurring signals, including photographic images, contain richer statistical structure. To exploit such structure, we introduce a general method for obtaining an optimized set of linear measurements, assuming a Bayesian inverse solution that leverages the prior implicit in a neural network trained to perform denoising. We demonstrate that these measurements are distinct from those of PCA and CS, with significant improvements in minimizing squared reconstruction error. In addition, we show that optimizing the measurements for the SSIM perceptual loss leads to perceptually improved reconstruction. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating the specific statistical regularities of natural signals when designing effective linear measurements.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, federate, diffusion, data-free, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated Class Incremental Learning (FCIL) is a critical yet largely underexplored issue that deals with the dynamic incorporation of new classes within federated learning (FL). Existing methods often employ generative adversarial networks (GANs) to produce synthetic images to address privacy concerns in FL. However, GANs exhibit inherent instability and high sensitivity, compromising the effectiveness of these methods. In this paper, we introduce a novel data-free federated class incremental learning framework with diffusion-based generative memory (DFedDGM) to mitigate catastrophic forgetting by generating stable, high-quality images through diffusion models. We design a new balanced sampler to help train the diffusion models to alleviate the common non-IID problem in FL, and introduce an entropy-based sample filtering technique from an information theory perspective to enhance the quality of generative samples. Finally, we integrate knowledge distillation with a feature-based regularization term for better knowledge transfer. Our framework does not incur additional communication costs compared to the baseline FedAvg method. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines, e.g., over a 4% improvement in average accuracy on the Tiny-ImageNet dataset.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The advent of Federated Learning (FL) highlights the practical necessity for the 'right to be forgotten' for all clients, allowing them to request data deletion from the machine learning model's service provider. This necessity has spurred a growing demand for Federated Unlearning (FU). Feature unlearning has gained considerable attention due to its applications in unlearning sensitive features, backdoor features, and bias features. Existing methods employ the influence function to achieve feature unlearning, which is impractical for FL as it necessitates the participation of other clients in the unlearning process. Furthermore, current research lacks an evaluation of the effectiveness of feature unlearning. To address these limitations, we define feature sensitivity in the evaluation of feature unlearning according to Lipschitz continuity. This metric characterizes the rate of change or sensitivity of the model output to perturbations in the input feature. We then propose an effective federated feature unlearning framework called Ferrari, which minimizes feature sensitivity. Extensive experimental results and theoretical analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of Ferrari across various feature unlearning scenarios, including sensitive, backdoor, and biased features.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This work studies the intersection of continual and federated learning, in which independent agents face unique tasks in their environments and incrementally develop and share knowledge. We introduce a mathematical framework capturing the essential aspects of distributed continual learning, including agent model and statistical heterogeneity, continual distribution shift, network topology, and communication constraints. Operating on the thesis that distributed continual learning enhances individual agent performance over single-agent learning, we identify three modes of information exchange: data instances, full model parameters, and modular (partial) model parameters. We develop algorithms for each sharing mode and conduct extensive empirical investigations across various datasets, topology structures, and communication limits. Our findings reveal three key insights: sharing parameters is more efficient than sharing data as tasks become more complex; modular parameter sharing yields the best performance while minimizing communication costs; and combining sharing modes can cumulatively improve performance.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Customer segmentation is a fundamental process to develop effective marketing strategies, personalize customer experience and boost their retention and loyalty. This problem has been widely addressed in the scientific literature, yet no definitive solution for every case is available. A specific case study characterized by several individualizing features is thoroughly analyzed and discussed in this paper. Because of the case properties a robust and innovative approach to both data handling and analytical processes is required. The study led to a sound proposal for customer segmentation. The highlights of the proposal include a convenient data partition to decompose the problem, an adaptive distance function definition and its optimization through genetic algorithms. These comprehensive data handling strategies not only enhance the dataset reliability for segmentation analysis but also support the operational efficiency and marketing strategies of sports centers, ultimately improving the customer experience.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Human mobility significantly impacts various aspects of society, including transportation, urban planning, and public health. The increasing availability of diverse mobility data and advancements in deep learning have revolutionized mobility modeling. Existing deep learning models, however, mainly study spatio-temporal patterns using trajectories and often fall short in capturing the underlying semantic interdependency among activities. Moreover, they are also constrained by the data source. These two factors thereby limit their realism and adaptability, respectively. Meanwhile, traditional activity-based models (ABMs) in transportation modeling rely on rigid assumptions and are costly and time-consuming to calibrate, making them difficult to adapt and scale to new regions, especially those regions with limited amount of required conventional travel data. To address these limitations, we develop a novel generative deep learning approach for human mobility modeling and synthesis, using ubiquitous and open-source data. Additionally, the model can be fine-tuned with local data, enabling adaptable and accurate representations of mobility patterns across different regions. The model is evaluated on a nationwide dataset of the United States, where it demonstrates superior performance in generating activity chains that closely follow ground truth distributions. Further tests using state- or city-specific datasets from California, Washington, and Mexico City confirm its transferability. This innovative approach offers substantial potential to advance mobility modeling research, especially in generating human activity chains as input for downstream activity-based mobility simulation models and providing enhanced tools for urban planners and policymakers.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced natural language processing tasks such as machine translation, text generation, and sentiment analysis. However, their large size, often consisting of billions of parameters, poses challenges for storage, computation, and deployment, particularly in resource-constrained environments like mobile devices and edge computing platforms. Effective compression and quantization techniques are crucial for addressing these issues, reducing memory footprint and computational requirements without significantly compromising performance. Traditional methods that uniformly map parameters to compressed spaces fail to account for the uneven distribution of parameters, leading to substantial accuracy loss. In this work, we propose Athena, a novel algorithm for efficient block-wise post-training quantization of LLMs. Athena leverages Second-Order Matrix Derivative Information to guide the quantization process using the curvature information of the loss landscape. By grouping parameters by columns or rows and iteratively optimizing the quantization process, Athena updates the model parameters and Hessian matrix to achieve significant compression while maintaining high accuracy. This makes Athena a practical solution for deploying LLMs in various settings.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL) has garnered increasing attention recently. However, due to the intrinsic spatio-temporal non-stationarity of data distributions, the current approaches typically suffer from high interaction and communication costs. In this paper, we introduce a new FRL algorithm, named \alg{}, that utilizes momentum, importance sampling, and additional server-side adjustment to control the shift of stochastic policy gradients and enhance the efficiency of data utilization. We prove that by proper selection of momentum parameters and interaction frequency, \alg{} can achieve $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(H N^{-1}\epsilon^{-3/2})$ and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-1})$ interaction and communication complexities ($N$ represents the number of agents), where the interaction complexity achieves linear speedup with the number of agents, and the communication complexity aligns the best achievable of existing first-order FL algorithms. Extensive experiments corroborate the substantial performance gains of \alg{} over existing methods on a suite of complex and high-dimensional benchmarks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text-to-image diffusion models can be fine-tuned in custom domains to adapt to specific user preferences, but such unconstrained adaptability has also been utilized for illegal purposes, such as forging public figures' portraits and duplicating copyrighted artworks. Most existing work focuses on detecting the illegally generated contents, but cannot prevent or mitigate illegal adaptations of diffusion models. Other schemes of model unlearning and reinitialization, similarly, cannot prevent users from relearning the knowledge of illegal model adaptation with custom data. In this paper, we present FreezeAsGuard, a new technique that addresses these limitations and enables irreversible mitigation of illegal adaptations of diffusion models. The basic approach is that the model publisher selectively freezes tensors in pre-trained diffusion models that are critical to illegal model adaptations, to mitigate the fine-tuned model's representation power in illegal domains but minimize the impact on legal model adaptations in other domains. Such tensor freezing can be enforced via APIs provided by the model publisher for fine-tuning, can motivate users' adoption due to its computational savings. Experiment results with datasets in multiple domains show that FreezeAsGuard provides stronger power in mitigating illegal model adaptations of generating fake public figures' portraits, while having the minimum impact on model adaptation in other legal domains.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL) has been deemed as a promising solution for intelligent decision-making in the era of Artificial Internet of Things. However, existing FRL approaches often entail repeated interactions with the environment during local updating, which can be prohibitively expensive or even infeasible in many real-world domains. To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes a novel offline federated policy optimization algorithm, named $\texttt{DRPO}$, which enables distributed agents to collaboratively learn a decision policy only from private and static data without further environmental interactions. $\texttt{DRPO}$ leverages dual regularization, incorporating both the local behavioral policy and the global aggregated policy, to judiciously cope with the intrinsic two-tier distributional shifts in offline FRL. Theoretical analysis characterizes the impact of the dual regularization on performance, demonstrating that by achieving the right balance thereof, $\texttt{DRPO}$ can effectively counteract distributional shifts and ensure strict policy improvement in each federative learning round. Extensive experiments validate the significant performance gains of $\texttt{DRPO}$ over baseline methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Offline Imitation Learning (IL) with imperfect demonstrations has garnered increasing attention owing to the scarcity of expert data in many real-world domains. A fundamental problem in this scenario is how to extract positive behaviors from noisy data. In general, current approaches to the problem select data building on state-action similarity to given expert demonstrations, neglecting precious information in (potentially abundant) $\textit{diverse}$ state-actions that deviate from expert ones. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective data selection method that identifies positive behaviors based on their resultant states -- a more informative criterion enabling explicit utilization of dynamics information and effective extraction of both expert and beneficial diverse behaviors. Further, we devise a lightweight behavior cloning algorithm capable of leveraging the expert and selected data correctly. In the experiments, we evaluate our method on a suite of complex and high-dimensional offline IL benchmarks, including continuous-control and vision-based tasks. The results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods on $\textbf{20/21}$ benchmarks, typically by $\textbf{2-5x}$, while maintaining a comparable runtime to Behavior Cloning ($\texttt{BC}$).</li>

          Bridging The Gap between Low-rank and Orthogonal Adaptation via Householder Reflection Adaptation(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While following different technical routes, both low-rank and orthogonal adaptation techniques can efficiently adapt large-scale pre-training models in specific tasks or domains based on a small piece of trainable parameters. In this study, we bridge the gap between these two techniques, proposing a simple but effective adaptation method based on Householder reflections. Given a pre-trained model, our method fine-tunes its layers by multiplying each frozen weight matrix with an orthogonal matrix constructed by a chain of learnable Householder reflections (HRs). This HR-based orthogonal fine-tuning is equivalent to an adaptive low-rank adaptation. Moreover, we show that the orthogonality of the reflection planes corresponding to the HRs impacts the model capacity and regularity. The analysis motivates us to regularize the orthogonality of the HRs, leading to different implementations of the proposed Householder reflection adaptation (HRA) method. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, HRA achieves superior performance with fewer learnable parameters when adapting large language models and conditional image generators.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The prevalent use of Transformer-like models, exemplified by ChatGPT in modern language processing applications, underscores the critical need for enabling private inference essential for many cloud-based services reliant on such models. However, current privacy-preserving frameworks impose significant communication burden, especially for non-linear computation in Transformer model. In this paper, we introduce a novel plug-in method Comet to effectively reduce the communication cost without compromising the inference performance. We second introduce an efficient approximation method to eliminate the heavy communication in finding good initial approximation. We evaluate our Comet on Bert and RoBERTa models with GLUE benchmark datasets, showing up to 3.9$\times$ less communication and 3.5$\times$ speedups while keep competitive model performance compared to the prior art.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Fault detection is a key challenge in the management of complex systems. In the context of SparkCognition's efforts towards predictive maintenance in large scale industrial systems, this problem is often framed in terms of anomaly detection - identifying patterns of behavior in the data which deviate from normal. Patterns of normal behavior aren't captured simply in the coarse statistics of measured signals. Rather, the multivariate sequential pattern itself can be indicative of normal vs. abnormal behavior. For this reason, normal behavior modeling that relies on snapshots of the data without taking into account temporal relationships as they evolve would be lacking. However, common strategies for dealing with temporal dependence, such as Recurrent Neural Networks or attention mechanisms are oftentimes computationally expensive and difficult to train. In this paper, we propose a fast and efficient approach to anomaly detection and alert filtering based on sequential pattern similarities. In our empirical analysis section, we show how this approach can be leveraged for a variety of purposes involving anomaly detection on a large scale real-world industrial system. Subsequently, we test our approach on a publicly-available dataset in order to establish its general applicability and robustness compared to a state-of-the-art baseline. We also demonstrate an efficient way of optimizing the framework based on an alert recall objective function.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Influence functions serve as crucial tools for assessing sample influence in model interpretation, subset training set selection, noisy label detection, and more. By employing the first-order Taylor extension, influence functions can estimate sample influence without the need for expensive model retraining. However, applying influence functions directly to deep models presents challenges, primarily due to the non-convex nature of the loss function and the large size of model parameters. This difficulty not only makes computing the inverse of the Hessian matrix costly but also renders it non-existent in some cases. Various approaches, including matrix decomposition, have been explored to expedite and approximate the inversion of the Hessian matrix, with the aim of making influence functions applicable to deep models. In this paper, we revisit a specific, albeit naive, yet effective approximation method known as TracIn. This method substitutes the inverse of the Hessian matrix with an identity matrix. We provide deeper insights into why this simple approximation method performs well. Furthermore, we extend its applications beyond measuring model utility to include considerations of fairness and robustness. Finally, we enhance TracIn through an ensemble strategy. To validate its effectiveness, we conduct experiments on synthetic data and extensive evaluations on noisy label detection, sample selection for large language model fine-tuning, and defense against adversarial attacks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) is a privacy-preserving distributed learning paradigm where different parties collaboratively learn models using partitioned features of shared samples, without leaking private data. Recent research has shown promising results addressing various challenges in VFL, highlighting its potential for practical applications in cross-domain collaboration. However, the corresponding research is scattered and lacks organization. To advance VFL research, this survey offers a systematic overview of recent developments. First, we provide a history and background introduction, along with a summary of the general training protocol of VFL. We then revisit the taxonomy in recent reviews and analyze limitations in-depth. For a comprehensive and structured discussion, we synthesize recent research from three fundamental perspectives: effectiveness, security, and applicability. Finally, we discuss several critical future research directions in VFL, which will facilitate the developments in this field.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) faces the significant challenge of adversarial or unreliable vehicles in vehicular networks, which can compromise the model's integrity through misleading updates. Addressing this, our study introduces a novel framework that integrates dynamic vehicle selection and robust anomaly detection mechanisms, aiming to optimize participant selection and mitigate risks associated with malicious contributions. Our approach involves a comprehensive vehicle reliability assessment, considering historical accuracy, contribution frequency, and anomaly records. An anomaly detection algorithm is utilized to identify anomalous behavior by analyzing the cosine similarity of local or model parameters during the federated learning (FL) process. These anomaly records are then registered and combined with past performance for accuracy and contribution frequency to identify the most suitable vehicles for each learning round. Dynamic client selection and anomaly detection algorithms are deployed at different levels, including cluster heads (CHs), cluster members (CMs), and the Evolving Packet Core (EPC), to detect and filter out spurious updates. Through simulation-based performance evaluation, our proposed algorithm demonstrates remarkable resilience even under intense attack conditions. Even in the worst-case scenarios, it achieves convergence times at $63$\% as effective as those in scenarios without any attacks. Conversely, in scenarios without utilizing our proposed algorithm, there is a high likelihood of non-convergence in the FL process.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Housing has emerged as a crucial concern among young individuals residing in major cities, including Shanghai. Given the unprecedented surge in property prices in this metropolis, young people have increasingly resorted to the rental market to address their housing needs. This study utilizes five traditional machine learning methods: multiple linear regression (MLR), ridge regression (RR), lasso regression (LR), decision tree (DT), and random forest (RF), along with a Large Language Model (LLM) approach using ChatGPT, for predicting the rental prices of lane houses in Shanghai. It applies these methods to examine a public data sample of about 2,609 lane house rental transactions in 2021 in Shanghai, and then compares the results of these methods. In terms of predictive power, RF has achieved the best performance among the traditional methods. However, the LLM approach, particularly in the 10-shot scenario, shows promising results that surpass traditional methods in terms of R-Squared value. The three performance metrics: mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-Squared, are used to evaluate the models. Our conclusion is that while traditional machine learning models offer robust techniques for rental price prediction, the integration of LLM such as ChatGPT holds significant potential for enhancing predictive accuracy.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Low-rank adaptation of large models, particularly LoRA, has gained traction due to its computational efficiency. This efficiency, contrasted with the prohibitive costs of full-model fine-tuning, means that practitioners often turn to LoRA and sometimes without a complete understanding of its ramifications. In this study, we focus on fairness and ask whether LoRA has an unexamined impact on utility, calibration, and resistance to membership inference across different subgroups (e.g., genders, races, religions) compared to a full-model fine-tuning baseline. We present extensive experiments across vision and language domains and across classification and generation tasks using ViT-Base, Swin-v2-Large, Llama-2 7B, and Mistral 7B. Intriguingly, experiments suggest that while one can isolate cases where LoRA exacerbates model bias across subgroups, the pattern is inconsistent -- in many cases, LoRA has equivalent or even improved fairness compared to the base model or its full fine-tuning baseline. We also examine the complications of evaluating fine-tuning fairness relating to task design and model token bias, calling for more careful fairness evaluations in future work.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated learning (FL), as an emerging collaborative learning paradigm, has garnered significant attention due to its capacity to preserve privacy within distributed learning systems. In these systems, clients collaboratively train a unified neural network model using their local datasets and share model parameters rather than raw data, enhancing privacy. Predominantly, FL systems are designed for mobile and edge computing environments where training typically occurs over wireless networks. Consequently, as model sizes increase, the conventional FL frameworks increasingly consume substantial communication resources. To address this challenge and improve communication efficiency, this paper introduces a novel hierarchical FL framework that integrates the benefits of clustered FL and model compression. We present an adaptive clustering algorithm that identifies a core client and dynamically organizes clients into clusters. Furthermore, to enhance transmission efficiency, each core client implements a local aggregation with compression (LC aggregation) algorithm after collecting compressed models from other clients within the same cluster. Simulation results affirm that our proposed algorithms not only maintain comparable predictive accuracy but also significantly reduce energy consumption relative to existing FL mechanisms.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep models have recently emerged as a promising tool to solve partial differential equations (PDEs), known as neural PDE solvers. While neural solvers trained from either simulation data or physics-informed loss can solve the PDEs reasonably well, they are mainly restricted to a specific set of PDEs, e.g. a certain equation or a finite set of coefficients. This bottleneck limits the generalizability of neural solvers, which is widely recognized as its major advantage over numerical solvers. In this paper, we present the Universal PDE solver (Unisolver) capable of solving a wide scope of PDEs by leveraging a Transformer pre-trained on diverse data and conditioned on diverse PDEs. Instead of simply scaling up data and parameters, Unisolver stems from the theoretical analysis of the PDE-solving process. Our key finding is that a PDE solution is fundamentally under the control of a series of PDE components, e.g. equation symbols, coefficients, and initial and boundary conditions. Inspired by the mathematical structure of PDEs, we define a complete set of PDE components and correspondingly embed them as domain-wise (e.g. equation symbols) and point-wise (e.g. boundaries) conditions for Transformer PDE solvers. Integrating physical insights with recent Transformer advances, Unisolver achieves consistent state-of-the-art results on three challenging large-scale benchmarks, showing impressive gains and endowing favorable generalizability and scalability.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DPSGD) is widely utilized to preserve training data privacy in deep learning, which first clips the gradients to a predefined norm and then injects calibrated noise into the training procedure. Existing DPSGD works typically assume the gradients follow sub-Gaussian distributions and design various clipping mechanisms to optimize training performance. However, recent studies have shown that the gradients in deep learning exhibit a heavy-tail phenomenon, that is, the tails of the gradient have infinite variance, which may lead to excessive clipping loss to the gradients with existing DPSGD mechanisms. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach, Discriminative Clipping~(DC)-DPSGD, with two key designs. First, we introduce a subspace identification technique to distinguish between body and tail gradients. Second, we present a discriminative clipping mechanism that applies different clipping thresholds for body and tail gradients to reduce the clipping loss. Under the non-convex condition, \ourtech{} reduces the empirical gradient norm from {${\mathbb{O}\left(\log^{\max(0,\theta-1)}(T/\delta)\log^{2\theta}(\sqrt{T})\right)}$} to {${\mathbb{O}\left(\log(\sqrt{T})\right)}$} with heavy-tailed index $\theta\geq 1/2$, iterations $T$, and arbitrary probability $\delta$. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms three baselines by up to 9.72\% in terms of accuracy.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The landscape of computer graphics has undergone significant transformations with the recent advances of differentiable rendering models. These rendering models often rely on heuristic designs that may not fully align with the final rendering objectives. We address this gap by pioneering \textit{evolutive rendering models}, a methodology where rendering models possess the ability to evolve and adapt dynamically throughout the rendering process. In particular, we present a comprehensive learning framework that enables the optimization of three principal rendering elements, including the gauge transformations, the ray sampling mechanisms, and the primitive organization. Central to this framework is the development of differentiable versions of these rendering elements, allowing for effective gradient backpropagation from the final rendering objectives. A detailed analysis of gradient characteristics is performed to facilitate a stable and goal-oriented elements evolution. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the large potential of evolutive rendering models for enhancing the rendering performance across various domains, including static and dynamic scene representations, generative modeling, and texture mapping.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent text-to-image customization works have been proven successful in generating images of given concepts by fine-tuning the diffusion models on a few examples. However, these methods tend to overfit the concepts, resulting in failure to create the concept under multiple conditions (e.g. headphone is missing when generating a <sks> dog wearing a headphone'). Interestingly, we notice that the base model before fine-tuning exhibits the capability to compose the base concept with other elements (e.g. a dog wearing a headphone) implying that the compositional ability only disappears after personalization tuning. Inspired by this observation, we present ClassDiffusion, a simple technique that leverages a semantic preservation loss to explicitly regulate the concept space when learning the new concept. Despite its simplicity, this helps avoid semantic drift when fine-tuning on the target concepts. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that the use of semantic preservation loss effectively improves the compositional abilities of the fine-tune models. In response to the ineffective evaluation of CLIP-T metrics, we introduce BLIP2-T metric, a more equitable and effective evaluation metric for this particular domain. We also provide in-depth empirical study and theoretical analysis to better understand the role of the proposed loss. Lastly, we also extend our ClassDiffusion to personalized video generation, demonstrating its flexibility.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Probabilistic verification of neural networks is concerned with formally analysing the output distribution of a neural network under a probability distribution of the inputs. Examples of probabilistic verification include verifying the demographic parity fairness notion or quantifying the safety of a neural network. We present a new algorithm for the probabilistic verification of neural networks based on an algorithm for computing and iteratively refining lower and upper bounds on probabilities over the outputs of a neural network. By applying state-of-the-art bound propagation and branch and bound techniques from non-probabilistic neural network verification, our algorithm significantly outpaces existing probabilistic verification algorithms, reducing solving times for various benchmarks from the literature from tens of minutes to tens of seconds. Furthermore, our algorithm compares favourably even to dedicated algorithms for restricted subsets of probabilistic verification. We complement our empirical evaluation with a theoretical analysis, proving that our algorithm is sound and, under mildly restrictive conditions, also complete when using a suitable set of heuristics.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep neural networks (DNNs) have heavily relied on traditional computational units like CPUs and GPUs. However, this conventional approach brings significant computational burdens, latency issues, and high power consumption, limiting their effectiveness. This has sparked the need for lightweight networks like ExtremeC3Net. On the other hand, there have been notable advancements in optical computational units, particularly with metamaterials, offering the exciting prospect of energy-efficient neural networks operating at the speed of light. Yet, the digital design of metamaterial neural networks (MNNs) faces challenges such as precision, noise, and bandwidth, limiting their application to intuitive tasks and low-resolution images. In this paper, we propose a large kernel lightweight segmentation model, ExtremeMETA. Based on the ExtremeC3Net, the ExtremeMETA maximizes the ability of the first convolution layer by exploring a larger convolution kernel and multiple processing paths. With the proposed large kernel convolution model, we extend the optic neural network application boundary to the segmentation task. To further lighten the computation burden of the digital processing part, a set of model compression methods is applied to improve model efficiency in the inference stage. The experimental results on three publicly available datasets demonstrate that the optimized efficient design improved segmentation performance from 92.45 to 95.97 on mIoU while reducing computational FLOPs from 461.07 MMacs to 166.03 MMacs.

          Discriminant audio properties in deep learning based respiratory insufficiency detection in Brazilian Portuguese(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This work investigates Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems that detect respiratory insufficiency (RI) by analyzing speech audios, thus treating speech as a RI biomarker. Previous works collected RI data (P1) from COVID-19 patients during the first phase of the pandemic and trained modern AI models, such as CNNs and Transformers, which achieved $96.5\%$ accuracy, showing the feasibility of RI detection via AI. Here, we collect RI patient data (P2) with several causes besides COVID-19, aiming at extending AI-based RI detection. We also collected control data from hospital patients without RI. We show that the considered models, when trained on P1, do not generalize to P2, indicating that COVID-19 RI has features that may not be found in all RI types.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep learning approaches have recently been extensively explored for the prognostics of industrial assets. However, they still suffer from a lack of interpretability, which hinders their adoption in safety-critical applications. To improve their trustworthiness, explainable AI (XAI) techniques have been applied in prognostics, primarily to quantify the importance of input variables for predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) using post-hoc attribution methods. In this work, we propose the application of Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs), a family of inherently interpretable neural network architectures based on concept explanations, to the task of RUL prediction. Unlike attribution methods, which explain decisions in terms of low-level input features, concepts represent high-level information that is easily understandable by users. Moreover, once verified in actual applications, CBMs enable domain experts to intervene on the concept activations at test-time. We propose using the different degradation modes of an asset as intermediate concepts. Our case studies on the New Commercial Modular AeroPropulsion System Simulation (N-CMAPSS) aircraft engine dataset for RUL prediction demonstrate that the performance of CBMs can be on par or superior to black-box models, while being more interpretable, even when the available labeled concepts are limited.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>3D open-vocabulary scene understanding, crucial for advancing augmented reality and robotic applications, involves interpreting and locating specific regions within a 3D space as directed by natural language instructions. To this end, we introduce GOI, a framework that integrates semantic features from 2D vision-language foundation models into 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and identifies 3D Gaussians of Interest using an Optimizable Semantic-space Hyperplane. Our approach includes an efficient compression method that utilizes scene priors to condense noisy high-dimensional semantic features into compact low-dimensional vectors, which are subsequently embedded in 3DGS. During the open-vocabulary querying process, we adopt a distinct approach compared to existing methods, which depend on a manually set fixed empirical threshold to select regions based on their semantic feature distance to the query text embedding. This traditional approach often lacks universal accuracy, leading to challenges in precisely identifying specific target areas. Instead, our method treats the feature selection process as a hyperplane division within the feature space, retaining only those features that are highly relevant to the query. We leverage off-the-shelf 2D Referring Expression Segmentation (RES) models to fine-tune the semantic-space hyperplane, enabling a more precise distinction between target regions and others. This fine-tuning substantially improves the accuracy of open-vocabulary queries, ensuring the precise localization of pertinent 3D Gaussians. Extensive experiments demonstrate GOI's superiority over previous state-of-the-art methods. Our project page is available at this https URL .</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Supervised multi-modal learning involves mapping multiple modalities to a target label. Previous studies in this field have concentrated on capturing in isolation either the inter-modality dependencies (the relationships between different modalities and the label) or the intra-modality dependencies (the relationships within a single modality and the label). We argue that these conventional approaches that rely solely on either inter- or intra-modality dependencies may not be optimal in general. We view the multi-modal learning problem from the lens of generative models where we consider the target as a source of multiple modalities and the interaction between them. Towards that end, we propose inter- & intra-modality modeling (I2M2) framework, which captures and integrates both the inter- and intra-modality dependencies, leading to more accurate predictions. We evaluate our approach using real-world healthcare and vision-and-language datasets with state-of-the-art models, demonstrating superior performance over traditional methods focusing only on one type of modality dependency.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Reinforcement learning (RL) training is inherently unstable due to factors such as moving targets and high gradient variance. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) can introduce additional difficulty. Differing preferences can complicate the alignment process, and prediction errors in a trained reward model can become more severe as the LLM generates unseen outputs. To enhance training robustness, RL has adopted techniques from supervised learning, such as ensembles and layer normalization. In this work, we improve the stability of RL training by adapting the reverse cross entropy (RCE) from supervised learning for noisy data to define a symmetric RL loss. We demonstrate performance improvements across various tasks and scales. We conduct experiments in discrete action tasks (Atari games) and continuous action space tasks (MuJoCo benchmark and Box2D) using Symmetric A2C (SA2C) and Symmetric PPO (SPPO), with and without added noise with especially notable performance in SPPO across different hyperparameters. Furthermore, we validate the benefits of the symmetric RL loss when using SPPO for large language models through improved performance in RLHF tasks, such as IMDB positive sentiment sentiment and TL;DR summarization tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Active learning strategically selects informative unlabeled data points and queries their ground truth labels for model training. The prevailing assumption underlying this machine learning paradigm is that acquiring these ground truth labels will optimally enhance model performance. However, this assumption may not always hold true or maximize learning capacity, particularly considering the costly labor annotations required for ground truth labels. In contrast to traditional ground truth labeling, this paper proposes salutary labeling, which automatically assigns the most beneficial labels to the most informative samples without human annotation. Specifically, we utilize the influence function, a tool for estimating sample influence, to select newly added samples and assign their salutary labels by choosing the category that maximizes their positive influence. This process eliminates the need for human annotation. Extensive experiments conducted on nine benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our salutary labeling approach over traditional active learning strategies. Additionally, we provide several in-depth explorations and practical applications of large language model (LLM) fine-tuning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present PPCEF, a novel method for generating probabilistically plausible counterfactual explanations (CFs). PPCEF advances beyond existing methods by combining a probabilistic formulation that leverages the data distribution with the optimization of plausibility within a unified framework. Compared to reference approaches, our method enforces plausibility by directly optimizing the explicit density function without assuming a particular family of parametrized distributions. This ensures CFs are not only valid (i.e., achieve class change) but also align with the underlying data's probability density. For that purpose, our approach leverages normalizing flows as powerful density estimators to capture the complex high-dimensional data distribution. Furthermore, we introduce a novel loss that balances the trade-off between achieving class change and maintaining closeness to the original instance while also incorporating a probabilistic plausibility term. PPCEF's unconstrained formulation allows for efficient gradient-based optimization with batch processing, leading to orders of magnitude faster computation compared to prior methods. Moreover, the unconstrained formulation of PPCEF allows for the seamless integration of future constraints tailored to specific counterfactual properties. Finally, extensive evaluations demonstrate PPCEF's superiority in generating high-quality, probabilistically plausible counterfactual explanations in high-dimensional tabular settings. This makes PPCEF a powerful tool for not only interpreting complex machine learning models but also for improving fairness, accountability, and trust in AI systems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Growing regulatory and societal pressures demand increased transparency in AI, particularly in understanding the decisions made by complex machine learning models. Counterfactual Explanations (CFs) have emerged as a promising technique within Explainable AI (xAI), offering insights into individual model predictions. However, to understand the systemic biases and disparate impacts of AI models, it is crucial to move beyond local CFs and embrace global explanations, which offer a~holistic view across diverse scenarios and populations. Unfortunately, generating Global Counterfactual Explanations (GCEs) faces challenges in computational complexity, defining the scope of "global," and ensuring the explanations are both globally representative and locally plausible. We introduce a novel unified approach for generating Local, Group-wise, and Global Counterfactual Explanations for differentiable classification models via gradient-based optimization to address these challenges. This framework aims to bridge the gap between individual and systemic insights, enabling a deeper understanding of model decisions and their potential impact on diverse populations. Our approach further innovates by incorporating a probabilistic plausibility criterion, enhancing actionability and trustworthiness. By offering a cohesive solution to the optimization and plausibility challenges in GCEs, our work significantly advances the interpretability and accountability of AI models, marking a step forward in the pursuit of transparent AI.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The inner workings of neural networks can be better understood if we can fully decipher the information encoded in neural activations. In this paper, we argue that this information is embodied by the subset of inputs that give rise to similar activations. Computing such subsets is nontrivial as the input space is exponentially large. We propose InversionView, which allows us to practically inspect this subset by sampling from a trained decoder model conditioned on activations. This helps uncover the information content of activation vectors, and facilitates understanding of the algorithms implemented by transformer models. We present three case studies where we investigate models ranging from small transformers to GPT-2. In these studies, we demonstrate the characteristics of our method, show the distinctive advantages it offers, and provide causally verified circuits.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Retrosynthesis, the task of identifying precursors for a given molecule, can be naturally framed as a conditional graph generation task. Diffusion models are a particularly promising modelling approach, enabling post-hoc conditioning and trading off quality for speed during generation. We show mathematically that permutation equivariant denoisers severely limit the expressiveness of graph diffusion models and thus their adaptation to retrosynthesis. To address this limitation, we relax the equivariance requirement such that it only applies to aligned permutations of the conditioning and the generated graphs obtained through atom mapping. Our new denoiser achieves the highest top-$1$ accuracy ($54.7$\%) across template-free and template-based methods on USPTO-50k. We also demonstrate the ability for flexible post-training conditioning and good sample quality with small diffusion step counts, highlighting the potential for interactive applications and additional controls for multi-step planning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>High-performance Transformer trackers have shown excellent results, yet they often bear a heavy computational load. Observing that a smaller input can immediately and conveniently reduce computations without changing the model, an easy solution is to adopt the low-resolution input for efficient Transformer tracking. Albeit faster, this hurts tracking accuracy much due to information loss in low resolution tracking. In this paper, we aim to mitigate such information loss to boost the performance of the low-resolution Transformer tracking via dual knowledge distillation from a frozen high-resolution (but not a larger) Transformer tracker. The core lies in two simple yet effective distillation modules, comprising query-key-value knowledge distillation (QKV-KD) and discrimination knowledge distillation (Disc-KD), across resolutions. The former, from the global view, allows the low-resolution tracker to inherit the features and interactions from the high-resolution tracker, while the later, from the target-aware view, enhances the target-background distinguishing capacity via imitating discriminative regions from its high-resolution counterpart. With the dual knowledge distillation, our Low-Resolution Transformer Tracker (LoReTrack) enjoys not only high efficiency owing to reduced computation but also enhanced accuracy by distilling knowledge from the high-resolution tracker. In extensive experiments, LoReTrack with a 256x256 resolution consistently improves baseline with the same resolution, and shows competitive or even better results compared to 384x384 high-resolution Transformer tracker, while running 52% faster and saving 56% MACs. Moreover, LoReTrack is resolution-scalable. With a 128x128 resolution, it runs 25 fps on a CPU with 64.9%/46.4% SUC scores on LaSOT/LaSOText, surpassing all other CPU real-time trackers.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>There is a rapidly growing interest in controlling consistency across multiple generated images using diffusion models. Among various methods, recent works have found that simply manipulating attention modules by concatenating features from multiple reference images provides an efficient approach to enhancing consistency without fine-tuning. Despite its popularity and success, few studies have elucidated the underlying mechanisms that contribute to its effectiveness. In this work, we reveal that the popular approach is a linear interpolation of image self-attention and cross-attention between synthesized content and reference features, with a constant rank-1 coefficient. Motivated by this observation, we find that a rank-1 coefficient is not necessary and simplifies the controllable generation mechanism. The resulting algorithm, which we coin as RefDrop, allows users to control the influence of reference context in a direct and precise manner. Besides further enhancing consistency in single-subject image generation, our method also enables more interesting applications, such as the consistent generation of multiple subjects, suppressing specific features to encourage more diverse content, and high-quality personalized video generation by boosting temporal consistency. Even compared with state-of-the-art image-prompt-based generators, such as IP-Adapter, RefDrop is competitive in terms of controllability and quality while avoiding the need to train a separate image encoder for feature injection from reference images, making it a versatile plug-and-play solution for any image or video diffusion model.</li>

In this study, we investigate whether ideas from deep learning loss design can be applied to improve the robustness of decision trees. In particular, we show that loss correction and symmetric losses, both standard approaches, are not effective.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Constructing fast samplers for unconditional diffusion and flow-matching models has received much attention recently; however, existing methods for solving inverse problems, such as super-resolution, inpainting, or deblurring, still require hundreds to thousands of iterative steps to obtain high-quality results. We propose a plug-and-play framework for constructing efficient samplers for inverse problems, requiring only pre-trained diffusion or flow-matching models. We present Conditional Conjugate Integrators, which leverage the specific form of the inverse problem to project the respective conditional diffusion/flow dynamics into a more amenable space for sampling. Our method complements popular posterior approximation methods for solving inverse problems using diffusion/flow models. We evaluate the proposed method's performance on various linear image restoration tasks across multiple datasets, employing diffusion and flow-matching models. Notably, on challenging inverse problems like 4$\times$ super-resolution on the ImageNet dataset, our method can generate high-quality samples in as few as 5 conditional sampling steps and outperforms competing baselines requiring 20-1000 steps.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Transformer-based detectors have shown success in computer vision tasks with natural images. These models, exemplified by the Deformable DETR, are optimized through complex engineering strategies tailored to the typical characteristics of natural scenes. However, medical imaging data presents unique challenges such as extremely large image sizes, fewer and smaller regions of interest, and object classes which can be differentiated only through subtle differences. This study evaluates the applicability of these transformer-based design choices when applied to a screening mammography dataset that represents these distinct medical imaging data characteristics. Our analysis reveals that common design choices from the natural image domain, such as complex encoder architectures, multi-scale feature fusion, query initialization, and iterative bounding box refinement, do not improve and sometimes even impair object detection performance in medical imaging. In contrast, simpler and shallower architectures often achieve equal or superior results. This finding suggests that the adaptation of transformer models for medical imaging data requires a reevaluation of standard practices, potentially leading to more efficient and specialized frameworks for medical diagnosis.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This work addresses the challenge of achieving zero-shot adversarial robustness while preserving zero-shot generalization in large-scale foundation models, with a focus on the popular Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP). Although foundation models were reported to have exceptional zero-shot generalization, they are highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. Existing methods achieve a comparable good tradeoff between zero-shot adversarial robustness and generalization under small adversarial perturbations. However, they fail to achieve a good tradeoff under large adversarial perturbations. To this end, we propose a novel Text-Image Mutual Awareness (TIMA) method that strikes a balance between zero-shot adversarial robustness and generalization. More precisely, we propose an Image-Aware Text (IAT) tuning mechanism that increases the inter-class distance of text embeddings by incorporating the Minimum Hyperspherical Energy (MHE). Simultaneously, fixed pre-trained image embeddings are used as cross-modal auxiliary supervision to maintain the similarity between the MHE-tuned and original text embeddings by the knowledge distillation, preserving semantic information between different classes. Besides, we introduce a Text-Aware Image (TAI) tuning mechanism, which increases inter-class distance between image embeddings during the training stage by Text-distance based Adaptive Margin (TAM). Similarly, a knowledge distillation is utilized to retain the similarity between fine-tuned and pre-trained image embeddings. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing impressive zero-shot performance against a wide range of adversarial perturbations while preserving the zero-shot generalization capabilities of the original CLIP model.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, transformer, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Understanding multi-agent behavior is critical across various fields. The conventional approach involves analyzing agent movements through three primary tasks: trajectory prediction, imputation, and spatial-temporal recovery. Considering the unique input formulation and constraint of these tasks, most existing methods are tailored to address only one specific task. However, in real-world applications, these scenarios frequently occur simultaneously. Consequently, methods designed for one task often fail to adapt to others, resulting in performance drops. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Unified Trajectory Generation model, UniTraj, that processes arbitrary trajectories as masked inputs, adaptable to diverse scenarios. Specifically, we introduce a Ghost Spatial Masking (GSM) module embedded within a Transformer encoder for spatial feature extraction. We further extend recent successful State Space Models (SSMs), particularly the Mamba model, into a Bidirectional Temporal Mamba to effectively capture temporal dependencies. Additionally, we incorporate a Bidirectional Temporal Scaled (BTS) module to comprehensively scan trajectories while maintaining the temporal missing relationships within the sequence. We curate and benchmark three practical sports game datasets, Basketball-U, Football-U, and Soccer-U, for evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that addresses this unified problem through a versatile generative framework, thereby enhancing our understanding of multi-agent movement.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Personalized learning is a proposed approach to address the problem of data heterogeneity in collaborative machine learning. In a decentralized setting, the two main challenges of personalization are client clustering and data privacy. In this paper, we address these challenges by developing P4 (Personalized Private Peer-to-Peer) a method that ensures that each client receives a personalized model while maintaining differential privacy guarantee of each client's local dataset during and after the training. Our approach includes the design of a lightweight algorithm to identify similar clients and group them in a private, peer-to-peer (P2P) manner. Once grouped, we develop differentially-private knowledge distillation for clients to co-train with minimal impact on accuracy. We evaluate our proposed method on three benchmark datasets (FEMNIST or Federated EMNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100) and two different neural network architectures (Linear and CNN-based networks) across a range of privacy parameters. The results demonstrate the potential of P4, as it outperforms the state-of-the-art of differential private P2P by up to 40 percent in terms of accuracy. We also show the practicality of P4 by implementing it on resource constrained devices, and validating that it has minimal overhead, e.g., about 7 seconds to run collaborative training between two clients.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent research (arXiv:2310.11453, arXiv:2402.17764) has proposed binary and ternary transformer networks as a way to significantly reduce memory and improve inference speed in Large Language Models (LLMs) while maintaining accuracy. In this work, we apply techniques from mechanistic interpretability to investigate whether such networks learn distinctly different or similar algorithms when compared to full-precision transformer networks. In particular, we reverse engineer the algorithms learned for the toy problem of modular addition where we find that binary and ternary networks learn similar algorithms as full precision networks. This provides evidence against the possibility of using binary and ternary networks as a more interpretable alternative in the LLM setting.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper introduces the Contextual Language model for Accurate Imputation Method (CLAIM), a novel strategy that capitalizes on the expansive knowledge and reasoning capabilities of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to address missing data challenges in tabular datasets. Unlike traditional imputation methods, which predominantly rely on numerical estimations, CLAIM utilizes contextually relevant natural language descriptors to fill missing values. This approach transforms datasets into natural language contextualized formats that are inherently more aligned with LLMs' capabilities, thereby facilitating the dual use of LLMs: first, to generate missing value descriptors, and then, to fine-tune the LLM on the enriched dataset for improved performance in downstream tasks. Our evaluations across diverse datasets and missingness patterns reveal CLAIM's superior performance over existing imputation techniques. Furthermore, our investigation into the effectiveness of context-specific versus generic descriptors for missing data highlights the importance of contextual accuracy in enhancing LLM performance for data imputation. The results underscore CLAIM's potential to markedly improve the reliability and quality of data analysis and machine learning models, offering a more nuanced and effective solution for handling missing data.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Image retrieval aims to identify visually similar images within a database using a given query image. Traditional methods typically employ both global and local features extracted from images for matching, and may also apply re-ranking techniques to enhance accuracy. However, these methods often fail to account for the noise present in query images, which can stem from natural or human-induced factors, thereby negatively impacting retrieval performance. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a novel setting for low-quality image retrieval, and propose an Adaptive Noise-Based Network (AdapNet) to learn robust abstract representations. Specifically, we devise a quality compensation block trained to compensate for various low-quality factors in input images. Besides, we introduce an innovative adaptive noise-based loss function, which dynamically adjusts its focus on the gradient in accordance with image quality, thereby augmenting the learning of unknown noisy samples during training and enhancing intra-class compactness. To assess the performance, we construct two datasets with low-quality queries, which is built by applying various types of noise on clean query images on the standard Revisited Oxford and Revisited Paris datasets. Comprehensive experimental results illustrate that AdapNet surpasses state-of-the-art methods on the Noise Revisited Oxford and Noise Revisited Paris benchmarks, while maintaining competitive performance on high-quality datasets. The code and constructed datasets will be made available.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Egocentric video-language pretraining is a crucial paradigm to advance the learning of egocentric hand-object interactions (EgoHOI). Despite the great success on existing testbeds, these benchmarks focus more on closed-set visual concepts or limited scenarios. Due to the occurrence of diverse EgoHOIs in the real world, we propose an open-vocabulary benchmark named EgoHOIBench to reveal the diminished performance of current egocentric video-language models (EgoVLM) on fined-grained concepts, indicating that these models still lack a full spectrum of egocentric understanding. We attribute this performance gap to insufficient fine-grained supervision and strong bias towards understanding objects rather than temporal dynamics in current methods. To tackle these issues, we introduce a novel asymmetric contrastive objective for EgoHOI named EgoNCE++. For video-to-text loss, we enhance text supervision through the generation of negative captions by leveraging the in-context learning of large language models to perform HOI-related word substitution. For text-to-video loss, we propose an object-centric positive video sampling strategy that aggregates video representations by the same nouns. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that EgoNCE++ significantly boosts open-vocabulary HOI recognition, multi-instance retrieval, and action recognition tasks across various egocentric models, with improvements of up to +26.55%.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Research efforts to understand neural signals have been ongoing for many years, with visual decoding from fMRI signals attracting considerable attention. Particularly, the advent of image diffusion models has advanced the reconstruction of images from fMRI data significantly. However, existing approaches often introduce inter- and intra- subject variations in the reconstructed images, which can compromise accuracy. To address current limitations in multi-subject brain decoding, we introduce a new Transformer architecture called MindFormer. This model is specifically designed to generate fMRI-conditioned feature vectors that can be used for conditioning Stable Diffusion model. More specifically, MindFormer incorporates two key innovations: 1) a novel training strategy based on the IP-Adapter to extract semantically meaningful features from fMRI signals, and 2) a subject specific token and linear layer that effectively capture individual differences in fMRI signals while synergistically combines multi subject fMRI data for training. Our experimental results demonstrate that Stable Diffusion, when integrated with MindFormer, produces semantically consistent images across different subjects. This capability significantly surpasses existing models in multi-subject brain decoding. Such advancements not only improve the accuracy of our reconstructions but also deepen our understanding of neural processing variations among individuals.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Classical Chinese Understanding (CCU) holds significant value in preserving and exploration of the outstanding traditional Chinese culture. Recently, researchers have attempted to leverage the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for CCU by capitalizing on their remarkable comprehension and semantic capabilities. However, no comprehensive benchmark is available to assess the CCU capabilities of LLMs. To fill this gap, this paper introduces C$^{3}$bench, a Comprehensive Classical Chinese understanding benchmark, which comprises 50,000 text pairs for five primary CCU tasks, including classification, retrieval, named entity recognition, punctuation, and translation. Furthermore, the data in C$^{3}$bench originates from ten different domains, covering most of the categories in classical Chinese. Leveraging the proposed C$^{3}$bench, we extensively evaluate the quantitative performance of 15 representative LLMs on all five CCU tasks. Our results not only establish a public leaderboard of LLMs' CCU capabilities but also gain some findings. Specifically, existing LLMs are struggle with CCU tasks and still inferior to supervised models. Additionally, the results indicate that CCU is a task that requires special attention. We believe this study could provide a standard benchmark, comprehensive baselines, and valuable insights for the future advancement of LLM-based CCU research.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>HTTP/1.1 parsing discrepancies have been the basis for numerous classes of attacks against web servers. Previous techniques for discovering HTTP parsing discrepancies have focused on blackbox differential testing of HTTP gateway servers, despite evidence that the most significant parsing anomalies occur within origin servers. While these techniques can detect some vulnerabilities, not all parsing discrepancy-related vulnerabilities are detectable by examining a gateway server's output alone. Our system, the HTTP Garden, examines both origin servers' interpretations and gateway servers' transformations of HTTP requests. It also includes a coverage-guided differential fuzzer for HTTP/1.1 origin servers that is capable of mutating all components of a request stream, paired with an interactive REPL that facilitates the automatic discovery of meaningful HTTP parsing discrepancies and the rapid development of those discrepancies into attack payloads. Using our tool, we have discovered and reported over 100 HTTP parsing bugs in popular web servers, of which 68 have been fixed following our reports. We designate 39 of these to be exploitable. We release the HTTP Garden to the public on GitHub under a free software license to allow researchers to further explore new parser discrepancy-based attacks against HTTP/1.1 servers.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Existing recommendation systems have focused on two paradigms: 1- historical user-item interaction-based recommendations and 2- conversational recommendations. Conversational recommendation systems facilitate natural language dialogues between users and the system, allowing the system to solicit users' explicit needs while enabling users to inquire about recommendations and provide feedback. Due to substantial advancements in natural language processing, conversational recommendation systems have gained prominence. Existing conversational recommendation datasets have greatly facilitated research in their respective domains. Despite the exponential growth in mobile users and apps in recent years, research in conversational mobile app recommender systems has faced substantial constraints. This limitation can primarily be attributed to the lack of high-quality benchmark datasets specifically tailored for mobile apps. To facilitate research for conversational mobile app recommendations, we introduce MobileConvRec. MobileConvRec simulates conversations by leveraging real user interactions with mobile apps on the Google Play store, originally captured in large-scale mobile app recommendation dataset MobileRec. The proposed conversational recommendation dataset synergizes sequential user-item interactions, which reflect implicit user preferences, with comprehensive multi-turn conversations to effectively grasp explicit user needs. MobileConvRec consists of over 12K multi-turn recommendation-related conversations spanning 45 app categories. Moreover, MobileConvRec presents rich metadata for each app such as permissions data, security and privacy-related information, and binary executables of apps, among others. We demonstrate that MobileConvRec can serve as an excellent testbed for conversational mobile app recommendation through a comparative study of several pre-trained large language models.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for complex Operations Research (OR) in automating optimization modeling. However, current methodologies heavily rely on prompt engineering (e.g., multi-agent cooperation) with proprietary LLMs, raising data privacy concerns that could be prohibitive in industry applications. To tackle this issue, we propose training open-source LLMs for optimization modeling. We identify four critical requirements for the training dataset of OR LLMs, design and implement OR-Instruct, a semi-automated process for creating synthetic data tailored to specific requirements. We also introduce the IndustryOR benchmark, the first industrial benchmark for testing LLMs on solving real-world OR problems. We apply the data from OR-Instruct to various open-source LLMs of 7b size (termed as ORLMs), resulting in a significantly improved capability for optimization modeling. Our best-performing ORLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on the NL4OPT, MAMO, and IndustryOR benchmarks. Our code and data will be available at \url{this https URL}.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>defense, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are known to be vulnerable to backdoor attacks, posing concerning threats to their reliable deployment. Recent research reveals that backdoors can be erased from infected DNNs by pruning a specific group of neurons, while how to effectively identify and remove these backdoor-associated neurons remains an open challenge. Most of the existing defense methods rely on defined rules and focus on neuron's local properties, ignoring the exploration and optimization of pruning policies. To address this gap, we propose an Optimized Neuron Pruning (ONP) method combined with Graph Neural Network (GNN) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to repair backdoor models. Specifically, ONP first models the target DNN as graphs based on neuron connectivity, and then uses GNN-based RL agents to learn graph embeddings and find a suitable pruning policy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to employ GNN and RL for optimizing pruning policies in the field of backdoor defense. Experiments show, with a small amount of clean data, ONP can effectively prune the backdoor neurons implanted by a set of backdoor attacks at the cost of negligible performance degradation, achieving a new state-of-the-art performance for backdoor mitigation.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are known to be vulnerable to backdoor attacks, posing concerning threats to their reliable deployment. Recent research reveals that backdoors can be erased from infected DNNs by pruning a specific group of neurons, while how to effectively identify and remove these backdoor-associated neurons remains an open challenge. In this paper, we investigate the correlation between backdoor behavior and neuron magnitude, and find that backdoor neurons deviate from the magnitude-saliency correlation of the model. The deviation inspires us to propose a Magnitude-based Neuron Pruning (MNP) method to detect and prune backdoor neurons. Specifically, MNP uses three magnitude-guided objective functions to manipulate the magnitude-saliency correlation of backdoor neurons, thus achieving the purpose of exposing backdoor behavior, eliminating backdoor neurons and preserving clean neurons, respectively. Experiments show our pruning strategy achieves state-of-the-art backdoor defense performance against a variety of backdoor attacks with a limited amount of clean data, demonstrating the crucial role of magnitude for guiding backdoor defenses.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Length generalization failure problem, namely the large language model (LLM) fails to generalize to texts longer than its maximum training length, greatly restricts the application of LLM in the scenarios with streaming long inputs. To address this problem, the existing methods either require substantial costs or introduce precision loss. In this paper, we empirically find that the accuracy of the LLM's prediction is highly correlated to its certainty. Based on this, we propose an efficient training free framework, named XL3M (it means extra-long large language model), which enables the LLMs trained on short sequences to reason extremely long sequence without any further training or fine-tuning. Under the XL3M framework, the input context will be firstly decomposed into multiple short sub-contexts, where each sub-context contains an independent segment and a common ``question'' which is a few tokens from the end of the original context. Then XL3M gives a method to measure the relevance between each segment and the ``question'', and constructs a concise key context by splicing all the relevant segments in chronological order. The key context is further used instead of the original context to complete the inference task. Evaluations on comprehensive benchmarks show the superiority of XL3M. Using our framework, a Llama2-7B model is able to reason 20M long sequences on an 8-card Huawei Ascend 910B NPU machine with 64GB memory per card.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Neural collapse ($\mathcal{NC}$) is a phenomenon observed in classification tasks where top-layer representations collapse into their class means, which become equinorm, equiangular and aligned with the classifiers. These behaviors -- associated with generalization and robustness -- would manifest under specific conditions: models are trained towards zero loss, with noise-free labels belonging to balanced classes, which do not outnumber the model's hidden dimension. Recent studies have explored $\mathcal{NC}$ in the absence of one or more of these conditions to extend and capitalize on the associated benefits of ideal geometries. Language modeling presents a curious frontier, as \textit{training by token prediction} constitutes a classification task where none of the conditions exist: the vocabulary is imbalanced and exceeds the embedding dimension; different tokens might correspond to similar contextual embeddings; and large language models (LLMs) in particular are typically only trained for a few epochs. This paper empirically investigates the impact of scaling the architectures and training of causal language models (CLMs) on their progression towards $\mathcal{NC}$. We find that $\mathcal{NC}$ properties that develop with scaling are linked to generalization. Moreover, there is evidence of some relationship between $\mathcal{NC}$ and generalization independent of scale. Our work therefore underscores the generality of $\mathcal{NC}$ as it extends to the novel and more challenging setting of language modeling. Downstream, we seek to inspire further research on the phenomenon to deepen our understanding of LLMs -- and neural networks at large -- and improve existing architectures based on $\mathcal{NC}$-related properties.</li>

          The Binary Quantized Neural Network for Dense Prediction via Specially Designed Upsampling and Attention(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep learning-based information processing consumes long time and requires huge computing resources, especially for dense prediction tasks which require an output for each pixel, like semantic segmentation and salient object detection. There are mainly two challenges for quantization of dense prediction tasks. Firstly, directly applying the upsampling operation that dense prediction tasks require is extremely crude and causes unacceptable accuracy reduction. Secondly, the complex structure of dense prediction networks means it is difficult to maintain a fast speed as well as a high accuracy when performing quantization. In this paper, we propose an effective upsampling method and an efficient attention computation strategy to transfer the success of the binary neural networks (BNN) from single prediction tasks to dense prediction tasks. Firstly, we design a simple and robust multi-branch parallel upsampling structure to achieve the high accuracy. Then we further optimize the attention method which plays an important role in segmentation but has huge computation complexity. Our attention method can reduce the computational complexity by a factor of one hundred times but retain the original effect. Experiments on Cityscapes, KITTI road, and ECSSD fully show the effectiveness of our work.</li>

          Post-Fair Federated Learning: Achieving Group and Community Fairness in Federated Learning via Post-processing(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>protect, federate, fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning framework in which a set of local communities collaboratively learn a shared global model while retaining all training data locally within each community. Two notions of fairness have recently emerged as important issues for federated learning: group fairness and community fairness. Group fairness requires that a model's decisions do not favor any particular group based on a set of legally protected attributes such as race or gender. Community fairness requires that global models exhibit similar levels of performance (accuracy) across all collaborating communities. Both fairness concepts can coexist within an FL framework, but the existing literature has focused on either one concept or the other. This paper proposes and analyzes a post-processing fair federated learning (FFL) framework called post-FFL. Post-FFL uses a linear program to simultaneously enforce group and community fairness while maximizing the utility of the global model. Because Post-FFL is a post-processing approach, it can be used with existing FL training pipelines whose convergence properties are well understood. This paper uses post-FFL on real-world datasets to mimic how hospital networks, for example, use federated learning to deliver community health care. Theoretical results bound the accuracy lost when post-FFL enforces both notion of fairness. Experimental results illustrate that post-FFL simultaneously improves both group and community fairness in FL. Moreover, post-FFL outperforms the existing in-processing fair federated learning in terms of improving both notions of fairness, communication efficiency and computation cost.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Most work treats large language models as black boxes without in-depth understanding of their internal working mechanism. In order to explain the internal representations of LLMs, we propose a gradient-based metric to assess the activation level of model parameters. Based on this metric, we obtain three preliminary findings. (1) When the inputs are in the same domain, parameters in the shallow layers will be activated densely, which means a larger portion of parameters will have great impacts on the outputs. In contrast, parameters in the deep layers are activated sparsely. (2) When the inputs are across different domains, parameters in shallow layers exhibit higher similarity in the activation behavior than deep layers. (3) In deep layers, the similarity of the distributions of activated parameters is positively correlated to the empirical data relevance. Further, we develop three validation experiments to solidify these findings. (1) Firstly, starting from the first finding, we attempt to configure different prune ratios for different layers, and find this method can benefit model pruning. (2) Secondly, we find that a pruned model based on one calibration set can better handle tasks related to the calibration task than those not related, which validate the second finding. (3) Thirdly, Based on the STS-B and SICK benchmark, we find that two sentences with consistent semantics tend to share similar parameter activation patterns in deep layers, which aligns with our third finding. Our work sheds light on the behavior of parameter activation in LLMs, and we hope these findings will have the potential to inspire more practical applications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Grammatical error correction (GEC) is a task dedicated to rectifying texts with minimal edits, which can be decoupled into two components: detection and correction. However, previous works have predominantly focused on direct correction, with no prior efforts to integrate both into a single model. Moreover, the exploration of the detection-correction paradigm by large language models (LLMs) remains underdeveloped. This paper introduces an integrated detection-correction structure, named DeCoGLM, based on the General Language Model (GLM). The detection phase employs a fault-tolerant detection template, while the correction phase leverages autoregressive mask infilling for localized error correction. Through the strategic organization of input tokens and modification of attention masks, we facilitate multi-task learning within a single model. Our model demonstrates competitive performance against the state-of-the-art models on English and Chinese GEC datasets. Further experiments present the effectiveness of the detection-correction structure in LLMs, suggesting a promising direction for GEC.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid development and reduced barriers to entry for Text-to-Image (T2I) models have raised concerns about the biases in their outputs, but existing research lacks a holistic definition and evaluation framework of biases, limiting the enhancement of debiasing techniques. To address this issue, we introduce FAIntbench, a holistic and precise benchmark for biases in T2I models. In contrast to existing benchmarks that evaluate bias in limited aspects, FAIntbench evaluate biases from four dimensions: manifestation of bias, visibility of bias, acquired attributes, and protected attributes. We applied FAIntbench to evaluate seven recent large-scale T2I models and conducted human evaluation, whose results demonstrated the effectiveness of FAIntbench in identifying various biases. Our study also revealed new research questions about biases, including the side-effect of distillation. The findings presented here are preliminary, highlighting the potential of FAIntbench to advance future research aimed at mitigating the biases in T2I models. Our benchmark is publicly available to ensure the reproducibility.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the realm of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), vision-language connector plays a crucial role to link the pre-trained vision encoders with Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite its importance, the vision-language connector has been relatively less explored. In this study, we aim to propose a strong vision-language connector that enables MLLMs to achieve high accuracy while maintain low computation cost. We first reveal the existence of the visual anchors in Vision Transformer and propose a cost-effective search algorithm to extract them. Building on these findings, we introduce the Anchor Former (AcFormer), a novel vision-language connector designed to leverage the rich prior knowledge obtained from these visual anchors during pretraining, guiding the aggregation of information. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that the proposed method significantly reduces computational costs by nearly two-thirds compared with baseline, while simultaneously outperforming baseline methods. This highlights the effectiveness and efficiency of AcFormer.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advancements in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have revolutionized how machines understand and generate textual responses based on visual inputs. Despite their impressive capabilities, they often produce "hallucinatory" outputs that do not accurately reflect the visual information, posing challenges in reliability and trustworthiness. Current methods such as contrastive decoding have made strides in addressing these issues by contrasting the original probability distribution of generated tokens with distorted counterparts; yet, generating visually-faithful outputs remains a challenge. In this work, we shift our focus to the opposite: What could serve as a complementary enhancement to the original probability distribution? We propose a simple, training-free method termed RITUAL to enhance robustness against hallucinations in LVLMs. Our approach employs random image transformations as complements to the original probability distribution, aiming to mitigate the likelihood of hallucinatory visual explanations by enriching the model's exposure to varied visual scenarios. Our empirical results show that while the isolated use of transformed images initially degrades performance, strategic implementation of these transformations can indeed serve as effective complements. Notably, our method is compatible with current contrastive decoding methods and does not require external models or costly self-feedback mechanisms, making it a practical addition. In experiments, RITUAL significantly outperforms existing contrastive decoding methods across several object hallucination benchmarks, including POPE, CHAIR, and MME.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present a Conversational Chain-of-Action (Conv-CoA) framework for Open-domain Conversational Question Answering (OCQA). Compared with literature, Conv-CoA addresses three major challenges: (i) unfaithful hallucination that is inconsistent with real-time or domain facts, (ii) weak reasoning performance in conversational scenarios, and (iii) unsatisfying performance in conversational information retrieval. Our key contribution is a dynamic reasoning-retrieval mechanism that extracts the intent of the question and decomposes it into a reasoning chain to be solved via systematic prompting, pre-designed actions, updating the Contextual Knowledge Set (CKS), and a novel Hopfield-based retriever. Methodologically, we propose a resource-efficiency Hopfield retriever to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of conversational information retrieval within our actions. Additionally, we propose a conversational-multi-reference faith score (Conv-MRFS) to verify and resolve conflicts between retrieved knowledge and answers in conversations. Empirically, we conduct comparisons between our framework and 23 state-of-the-art methods across five different research directions and two public benchmarks. These comparisons demonstrate that our Conv-CoA outperforms other methods in both the accuracy and efficiency dimensions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present Diffusion Model Patching (DMP), a simple method to boost the performance of pre-trained diffusion models that have already reached convergence, with a negligible increase in parameters. DMP inserts a small, learnable set of prompts into the model's input space while keeping the original model frozen. The effectiveness of DMP is not merely due to the addition of parameters but stems from its dynamic gating mechanism, which selects and combines a subset of learnable prompts at every step of the generative process (e.g., reverse denoising steps). This strategy, which we term "mixture-of-prompts", enables the model to draw on the distinct expertise of each prompt, essentially "patching" the model's functionality at every step with minimal yet specialized parameters. Uniquely, DMP enhances the model by further training on the same dataset on which it was originally trained, even in a scenario where significant improvements are typically not expected due to model convergence. Experiments show that DMP significantly enhances the converged FID of DiT-L/2 on FFHQ 256x256 by 10.38%, achieved with only a 1.43% parameter increase and 50K additional training iterations.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, transformer, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the emergence of diffusion models as the frontline of generative models, many researchers have proposed molecule generation techniques using conditional diffusion models. However, due to the fundamental nature of a molecule, which carries highly entangled correlations within a small number of atoms and bonds, it becomes difficult for a model to connect raw data with the conditions when the conditions become more complex as natural language. To address this, here we present a novel latent diffusion model dubbed LDMol, which enables a natural text-conditioned molecule generation. Specifically, LDMol is composed of three building blocks: a molecule encoder that produces a chemically informative feature space, a natural language-conditioned latent diffusion model using a Diffusion Transformer (DiT), and an autoregressive decoder for molecule re. In particular, recognizing that multiple SMILES notations can represent the same molecule, we employ a contrastive learning strategy to extract the chemical informative feature space. LDMol not only beats the existing baselines on the text-to-molecule generation benchmark but is also capable of zero-shot inference with unseen scenarios. Furthermore, we show that LDMol can be applied to downstream tasks such as molecule-to-text retrieval and text-driven molecule editing, demonstrating its versatility as a diffusion model.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The performance on general tasks decreases after Large Language Models (LLMs) are fine-tuned on domain-specific tasks, the phenomenon is known as Catastrophic Forgetting (CF). However, this paper presents a further challenge for real application of domain-specific LLMs beyond CF, called General Capabilities Integration (GCI), which necessitates the integration of both the general capabilities and domain knowledge within a single instance. The objective of GCI is not merely to retain previously acquired general capabilities alongside new domain knowledge, but to harmonize and utilize both sets of skills in a cohesive manner to enhance performance on domain-specific tasks. Taking legal domain as an example, we carefully design three groups of training and testing tasks without lacking practicability, and construct the corresponding datasets. To better incorporate general capabilities across domain-specific scenarios, we introduce ALoRA, which utilizes a multi-head attention module upon LoRA, facilitating direct information transfer from preceding tokens to the current one. This enhancement permits the representation to dynamically switch between domain-specific knowledge and general competencies according to the attention. Extensive experiments are conducted on the proposed tasks. The results exhibit the significance of our setting, and the effectiveness of our method.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this study, we aim to construct an audio-video generative model with minimal computational cost by leveraging pre-trained single-modal generative models for audio and video. To achieve this, we propose a novel method that guides each single-modal model to cooperatively generate well-aligned samples across modalities. Specifically, given two pre-trained base diffusion models, we train a lightweight joint guidance module to adjust scores separately estimated by the base models to match the score of joint distribution over audio and video. We theoretically show that this guidance can be computed through the gradient of the optimal discriminator distinguishing real audio-video pairs from fake ones independently generated by the base models. On the basis of this analysis, we construct the joint guidance module by training this discriminator. Additionally, we adopt a loss function to make the gradient of the discriminator work as a noise estimator, as in standard diffusion models, stabilizing the gradient of the discriminator. Empirical evaluations on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method improves both single-modal fidelity and multi-modal alignment with a relatively small number of parameters.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Post-training quantization (PTQ) serves as a potent technique to accelerate the inference of large language models (LLMs). Nonetheless, existing works still necessitate a considerable number of floating-point (FP) operations during inference, including additional quantization and de-quantization, as well as non-linear operators such as RMSNorm and Softmax. This limitation hinders the deployment of LLMs on the edge and cloud devices. In this paper, we identify the primary obstacle to integer-only quantization for LLMs lies in the large fluctuation of activations across channels and tokens in both linear and non-linear operations. To address this issue, we propose I-LLM, a novel integer-only fully-quantized PTQ framework tailored for LLMs. Specifically, (1) we develop Fully-Smooth Block-Reconstruction (FSBR) to aggressively smooth inter-channel variations of all activations and weights. (2) to alleviate degradation caused by inter-token variations, we introduce a novel approach called Dynamic Integer-only MatMul (DI-MatMul). This method enables dynamic quantization in full-integer matrix multiplication by dynamically quantizing the input and outputs with integer-only operations. (3) we design DI-ClippedSoftmax, DI-Exp, and DI-Normalization, which utilize bit shift to execute non-linear operators efficiently while maintaining accuracy. The experiment shows that our I-LLM achieves comparable accuracy to the FP baseline and outperforms non-integer quantization methods. For example, I-LLM can operate at W4A4 with negligible loss of accuracy. To our knowledge, we are the first to bridge the gap between integer-only quantization and LLMs. We've published our code on anonymous.4open.science, aiming to contribute to the advancement of this field.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Fare evasion is a problem for public transport companies, with LSTM models this issue can help companies get an analytical insight into where this issue occurs the most, to prevent capital loss. In addition to the financial burden this problem causes, having more inspectors is not enough to alleviate the problem. The purpose of this study is to find a different way to predict fare evasion in the public transport sector. Through the use of keypoint extractions of passengers in video footage, an LSTM model is trained on those keypoints to help predict the actions of passengers between payments and evasions. The results were promising when it came to predicting the actions of passengers on real-time footage. Thus a sophisticated approach can help to decrease the fare evasion problem. A ReID model can be used alongside the LSTM model for better accuracy, as there is always the chance that a person might only pay for the fare at a later stage. With both models, it is possible for public transport companies to start narrowing down where the root of their fare evasion problems emerges.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Novel Instance Detection and Segmentation (NIDS) aims at detecting and segmenting novel object instances given a few examples of each instance. We propose a unified framework (NIDS-Net) comprising object proposal generation, embedding creation for both instance templates and proposal regions, and embedding matching for instance label assignment. Leveraging recent advancements in large vision methods, we utilize the Grounding DINO and Segment Anything Model (SAM) to obtain object proposals with accurate bounding boxes and masks. Central to our approach is the generation of high-quality instance embeddings. We utilize foreground feature averages of patch embeddings from the DINOv2 ViT backbone, followed by refinement through a weight adapter mechanism that we introduce. We show experimentally that our weight adapter can adjust the embeddings locally within their feature space and effectively limit overfitting. This methodology enables a straightforward matching strategy, resulting in significant performance gains. Our framework surpasses current state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating notable improvements of 22.3, 46.2, 10.3, and 24.0 in average precision (AP) across four detection datasets. In instance segmentation tasks on seven core datasets of the BOP challenge, our method outperforms the top RGB methods by 3.6 AP and remains competitive with the best RGB-D method.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Advances in Deep Learning bring further investigation into credibility and robustness, especially for safety-critical engineering applications such as the nuclear industry. The key challenges include the availability of data set (often scarce and sparse) and insufficient consideration of the uncertainty in the data, model, and prediction. This paper therefore presents a meta-learning based approach that is both uncertainty- and prior knowledge-informed, aiming at trustful predictions of material properties for the nuclear reactor design. It is suited for robust learning under limited data. Uncertainty has been accounted for where a distribution of predictor functions are produced for extrapolation. Results suggest it achieves superior performance than existing empirical methods in rupture life prediction, a case which is typically under a small data regime. While demonstrated herein with rupture properties, this learning approach is transferable to solve similar problems of data scarcity across the nuclear industry. It is of great importance to boosting the AI analytics in the nuclear industry by proving the applicability and robustness while providing tools that can be trusted.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models have achieved significant visual generation quality. However, their significant computational and memory costs pose challenge for their application on resource-constrained mobile devices or even desktop GPUs. Recent few-step diffusion models reduces the inference time by reducing the denoising steps. However, their memory consumptions are still excessive. The Post Training Quantization (PTQ) replaces high bit-width FP representation with low-bit integer values (INT4/8) , which is an effective and efficient technique to reduce the memory cost. However, when applying to few-step diffusion models, existing quantization methods face challenges in preserving both the image quality and text alignment. To address this issue, we propose an mixed-precision quantization framework - MixDQ. Firstly, We design specialized BOS-aware quantization method for highly sensitive text embedding quantization. Then, we conduct metric-decoupled sensitivity analysis to measure the sensitivity of each layer. Finally, we develop an integer-programming-based method to conduct bit-width allocation. While existing quantization methods fall short at W8A8, MixDQ could achieve W8A8 without performance loss, and W4A8 with negligible visual degradation. Compared with FP16, we achieve 3-4x reduction in model size and memory cost, and 1.45x latency speedup.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) is proposed to find the greatest personalized models for each client. To avoid the central failure and communication bottleneck in the server-based FL, we concentrate on the Decentralized Personalized Federated Learning (DPFL) that performs distributed model training in a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) manner. Most personalized works in DPFL are based on undirected and symmetric topologies, however, the data, computation and communication resources heterogeneity result in large variances in the personalized models, which lead the undirected aggregation to suboptimal personalized performance and unguaranteed convergence. To address these issues, we propose a directed collaboration DPFL framework by incorporating stochastic gradient push and partial model personalized, called \textbf{D}ecentralized \textbf{Fed}erated \textbf{P}artial \textbf{G}radient \textbf{P}ush (\textbf{DFedPGP}). It personalizes the linear classifier in the modern deep model to customize the local solution and learns a consensus representation in a fully decentralized manner. Clients only share gradients with a subset of neighbors based on the directed and asymmetric topologies, which guarantees flexible choices for resource efficiency and better convergence. Theoretically, we show that the proposed DFedPGP achieves a superior convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{T}})$ in the general non-convex setting, and prove the tighter connectivity among clients will speed up the convergence. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy in both data and computation heterogeneity scenarios, demonstrating the efficiency of the directed collaboration and partial gradient push.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, attack, membership infer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Machine unlearning (MU) addresses privacy concerns by removing information of `forgetting data' samples from trained models. Typically, evaluating MU methods involves comparing unlearned models to those retrained from scratch without forgetting data, using metrics such as membership inference attacks (MIA) and accuracy measurements. These evaluations implicitly assume that if the output logits of the unlearned and retrained models are similar, the unlearned model has successfully forgotten the data. Here, we challenge if this assumption is valid. In particular, we conduct a simple experiment of training only the last layer of a given original model using a novel masked-distillation technique while keeping the rest fixed. Surprisingly, simply altering the last layer yields favorable outcomes in the existing evaluation metrics, while the model does not successfully unlearn the samples or classes. For better evaluating the MU methods, we propose a metric that quantifies the residual information about forgetting data samples in intermediate features using mutual information, called information difference index or IDI for short. The IDI provides a comprehensive evaluation of MU methods by efficiently analyzing the internal structure of DNNs. Our metric is scalable to large datasets and adaptable to various model architectures. Additionally, we present COLapse-and-Align (COLA), a simple contrastive-based method that effectively unlearns intermediate features.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion planners have shown promise in handling long-horizon and sparse-reward tasks due to the non-autoregressive plan generation. However, their inherent stochastic risk of generating infeasible trajectories presents significant challenges to their reliability and stability. We introduce a novel approach, the Trajectory Aggregation Tree (TAT), to address this issue in diffusion planners. Compared to prior methods that rely solely on raw trajectory predictions, TAT aggregates information from both historical and current trajectories, forming a dynamic tree-like structure. Each trajectory is conceptualized as a branch and individual states as nodes. As the structure evolves with the integration of new trajectories, unreliable states are marginalized, and the most impactful nodes are prioritized for decision-making. TAT can be deployed without modifying the original training and sampling pipelines of diffusion planners, making it a training-free, ready-to-deploy solution. We provide both theoretical analysis and empirical evidence to support TAT's effectiveness. Our results highlight its remarkable ability to resist the risk from unreliable trajectories, guarantee the performance boosting of diffusion planners in $100\%$ of tasks, and exhibit an appreciable tolerance margin for sample quality, thereby enabling planning with a more than $3\times$ acceleration.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in powerful pre-trained diffusion models encourage the development of methods to improve the sampling performance under well-trained diffusion models. This paper introduces Diffusion Rejection Sampling (DiffRS), which uses a rejection sampling scheme that aligns the sampling transition kernels with the true ones at each timestep. The proposed method can be viewed as a mechanism that evaluates the quality of samples at each intermediate timestep and refines them with varying effort depending on the sample. Theoretical analysis shows that DiffRS can achieve a tighter bound on sampling error compared to pre-trained models. Empirical results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of DiffRS on the benchmark datasets and the effectiveness of DiffRS for fast diffusion samplers and large-scale text-to-image diffusion models.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative modeling of crystal structures is significantly challenged by the complexity of input data, which constrains the ability of these models to explore and discover novel crystals. This complexity often confines de novo design methodologies to merely small perturbations of known crystals and hampers the effective application of advanced optimization techniques. One such optimization technique, Latent Space Bayesian Optimization (LSBO) has demonstrated promising results in uncovering novel objects across various domains, especially when combined with Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). Recognizing LSBO's potential and the critical need for innovative crystal discovery, we introduce Crystal-LSBO, a de novo design framework for crystals specifically tailored to enhance explorability within LSBO frameworks. Crystal-LSBO employs multiple VAEs, each dedicated to a distinct aspect of crystal structure: lattice, coordinates, and chemical elements, orchestrated by an integrative model that synthesizes these components into a cohesive output. This setup not only streamlines the learning process but also produces explorable latent spaces thanks to the decreased complexity of the learning task for each model, enabling LSBO approaches to operate. Our study pioneers the use of LSBO for de novo crystal design, demonstrating its efficacy through optimization tasks focused mainly on formation energy values. Our results highlight the effectiveness of our methodology, offering a new perspective for de novo crystal discovery.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the domains of image and audio, diffusion models have shown impressive performance. However, their application to discrete data types, such as language, has often been suboptimal compared to autoregressive generative models. This paper tackles the challenge of improving discrete diffusion models by introducing a structured forward process that leverages the inherent information hierarchy in discrete categories, such as words in text. Our approach biases the generative process to produce certain categories before others, resulting in a notable improvement in log-likelihood scores on the text8 dataset. This work paves the way for more advances in discrete diffusion models with potentially significant enhancements in performance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Instructing large language models (LLMs) to solve elementary school math problems has shown great success using Chain of Thought (CoT). However, the CoT approach relies on an LLM to generate a sequence of arithmetic calculations which can be prone to cascaded calculation errors. We hypothesize that an LLM should focus on extracting predicates and generating symbolic formulas from the math problem description so that the underlying calculation can be done via an external code interpreter. We investigate using LLM to generate Prolog programs to solve mathematical questions. Experimental results show that our Prolog-based arithmetic problem-solving outperforms CoT generation in the GSM8K benchmark across three distinct LLMs. In addition, given the insensitive ordering of predicates and symbolic formulas in Prolog, we propose to permute the ground truth predicates for more robust LLM training via data augmentation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>defense, attack, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have underscored their superiority in various multimodal tasks. However, the adversarial robustness of VLMs has not been fully explored. Existing methods mainly assess robustness through unimodal adversarial attacks that perturb images, while assuming inherent resilience against text-based attacks. Different from existing attacks, in this work we propose a more comprehensive strategy that jointly attacks both text and image modalities to exploit a broader spectrum of vulnerability within VLMs. Specifically, we propose a dual optimization objective aimed at guiding the model to generate affirmative responses with high toxicity. Our attack method begins by optimizing an adversarial image prefix from random noise to generate diverse harmful responses in the absence of text input, thus imbuing the image with toxic semantics. Subsequently, an adversarial text suffix is integrated and co-optimized with the adversarial image prefix to maximize the probability of eliciting affirmative responses to various harmful instructions. The discovered adversarial image prefix and text suffix are collectively denoted as a Universal Master Key (UMK). When integrated into various malicious queries, UMK can circumvent the alignment defenses of VLMs and lead to the generation of objectionable content, known as jailbreaks. The experimental results demonstrate that our universal attack strategy can effectively jailbreak MiniGPT-4 with a 96% success rate, highlighting the vulnerability of VLMs and the urgent need for new alignment strategies.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we present a novel data-free method for merging neural networks in weight space. Differently from most existing works, our method optimizes for the permutations of network neurons globally across all layers. This allows us to enforce cycle consistency of the permutations when merging $N \geq 3$ models, allowing circular compositions of permutations to be computed without accumulating error along the path. We qualitatively and quantitatively motivate the need for such a constraint, showing its benefits when merging sets of models in scenarios spanning varying architectures and datasets. We finally show that, when coupled with activation renormalization, our approach yields the best results in the task.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Plant health can be monitored dynamically using multispectral sensors that measure Near-Infrared reflectance (NIR). Despite this potential, obtaining and annotating high-resolution NIR images poses a significant challenge for training deep neural networks. Typically, large networks pre-trained on the RGB domain are utilized to fine-tune infrared images. This practice introduces a domain shift issue because of the differing visual traits between RGB and NIR this http URL an alternative to fine-tuning, a method called low-rank adaptation (LoRA) enables more efficient training by optimizing rank-decomposition matrices while keeping the original network weights frozen. However, existing parameter-efficient adaptation strategies for remote sensing images focus on RGB images and overlook domain shift issues in the NIR domain. Therefore, this study investigates the potential benefits of using vision transformer (ViT) backbones pre-trained in the RGB domain, with low-rank adaptation for downstream tasks in the NIR domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that employing LoRA with pre-trained ViT backbones yields the best performance for downstream tasks applied to NIR images.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Visual object tracking, which is primarily based on visible light image sequences, encounters numerous challenges in complicated scenarios, such as low light conditions, high dynamic ranges, and background clutter. To address these challenges, incorporating the advantages of multiple visual modalities is a promising solution for achieving reliable object tracking. However, the existing approaches usually integrate multimodal inputs through adaptive local feature interactions, which cannot leverage the full potential of visual cues, thus resulting in insufficient feature modeling. In this study, we propose a novel multimodal hybrid tracker (MMHT) that utilizes frame-event-based data for reliable single object tracking. The MMHT model employs a hybrid backbone consisting of an artificial neural network (ANN) and a spiking neural network (SNN) to extract dominant features from different visual modalities and then uses a unified encoder to align the features across different domains. Moreover, we propose an enhanced transformer-based module to fuse multimodal features using attention mechanisms. With these methods, the MMHT model can effectively construct a multiscale and multidimensional visual feature space and achieve discriminative feature modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the MMHT model exhibits competitive performance in comparison with that of other state-of-the-art methods. Overall, our results highlight the effectiveness of the MMHT model in terms of addressing the challenges faced in visual object tracking tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the development of modern society, traffic volume continues to increase in most countries worldwide, leading to an increase in the rate of pavement damage Therefore, the real-time and highly accurate pavement damage detection and maintenance have become the current need. In this paper, an enhanced pavement damage detection method with CycleGAN and improved YOLOv5 algorithm is presented. We selected 7644 self-collected images of pavement damage samples as the initial dataset and augmented it by CycleGAN. Due to a substantial difference between the images generated by CycleGAN and real road images, we proposed a data enhancement method based on an improved Scharr filter, CycleGAN, and Laplacian pyramid. To improve the target recognition effect on a complex background and solve the problem that the spatial pyramid pooling-fast module in the YOLOv5 network cannot handle multiscale targets, we introduced the convolutional block attention module attention mechanism and proposed the atrous spatial pyramid pooling with squeeze-and-excitation structure. In addition, we optimized the loss function of YOLOv5 by replacing the CIoU with EIoU. The experimental results showed that our algorithm achieved a precision of 0.872, recall of 0.854, and mean average precision@0.5 of 0.882 in detecting three main types of pavement damage: cracks, potholes, and patching. On the GPU, its frames per second reached 68, meeting the requirements for real-time detection. Its overall performance even exceeded the current more advanced YOLOv7 and achieved good results in practical applications, providing a basis for decision-making in pavement damage detection and prevention.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Long-context modeling capabilities are important for large language models (LLMs) in various applications. However, directly training LLMs with long context windows is insufficient to enhance this capability since some training samples do not exhibit strong semantic dependencies across long contexts. In this study, we propose a data mining framework \textbf{ProLong} that can assign each training sample with a long dependency score, which can be used to rank and filter samples that are more advantageous for enhancing long-context modeling abilities in LLM training. Specifically, we first use delta perplexity scores to measure the \textit{Dependency Strength} between text segments in a given document. Then we refine this metric based on the \textit{Dependency Distance} of these segments to incorporate spatial relationships across long-contexts. Final results are calibrated with a \textit{Dependency Specificity} metric to prevent trivial dependencies introduced by repetitive patterns. Moreover, a random sampling approach is proposed to optimize the computational efficiency of ProLong. Comprehensive experiments on multiple benchmarks indicate that ProLong effectively identifies documents that carry long dependencies and LLMs trained on these documents exhibit significantly enhanced long-context modeling capabilities.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Quantifying sarcomere structure organization in human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) is crucial for understanding cardiac disease pathology, improving drug screening, and advancing regenerative medicine. Traditional methods, such as manual annotation and Fourier transform analysis, are labor-intensive, error-prone, and lack high-throughput capabilities. In this study, we present a novel deep learning-based framework that leverages cell images and integrates cell features to automatically evaluate the sarcomere structure of hiPSC-CMs from the onset of differentiation. This framework overcomes the limitations of traditional methods through automated, high-throughput analysis, providing consistent, reliable results while accurately detecting complex sarcomere patterns across diverse samples. The proposed framework contains the SarcNet, a linear layers-added ResNet-18 module, to output a continuous score ranging from one to five that captures the level of sarcomere structure organization. It is trained and validated on an open-source dataset of hiPSC-CMs images with the endogenously GFP-tagged alpha-actinin-2 structure developed by the Allen Institute for Cell Science (AICS). SarcNet achieves a Spearman correlation of 0.831 with expert evaluations, demonstrating superior performance and an improvement of 0.075 over the current state-of-the-art approach, which uses Linear Regression. Our results also show a consistent pattern of increasing organization from day 18 to day 32 of differentiation, aligning with expert evaluations. By integrating the quantitative features calculated directly from the images with the visual features learned during the deep learning model, our framework offers a more comprehensive and accurate assessment, thereby enhancing the further utility of hiPSC-CMs in medical research and therapy development.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper addresses image copy detection, a task in online sharing platforms for copyright protection. While previous approaches have performed exceptionally well, the large size of their networks and descriptors remains a significant disadvantage, complicating their practical application. In this paper, we propose a novel method that achieves a competitive performance by using a lightweight network and compact descriptors. By utilizing relational self-supervised distillation to transfer knowledge from a large network to a small network, we enable the training of lightweight networks with a small descriptor size. Our approach, which we call Relational selfsupervised Distillation with Compact Descriptors (RDCD), introduces relational self-supervised distillation (RSD) for flexible representation in a smaller feature space and applies contrastive learning with a hard negative (HN) loss to prevent dimensional collapse. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using the DISC2021, Copydays, and NDEC benchmark datasets, with which our lightweight network with compact descriptors achieves a competitive performance. For the DISC2021 benchmark, ResNet-50/EfficientNet- B0 are used as a teacher and student respectively, the micro average precision improved by 5.0%/4.9%/5.9% for 64/128/256 descriptor sizes compared to the baseline method.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>defense, attack, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are known to be vulnerable to both backdoor and adversarial attacks. In the literature, these two types of attacks are commonly treated as distinct robustness problems and solved separately, since they belong to training-time and inference-time attacks respectively. However, this paper revealed that there is an intriguing connection between them: (1) planting a backdoor into a model will significantly affect the model's adversarial examples; (2) for an infected model, its adversarial examples have similar features as the triggered images. Based on these observations, a novel Progressive Unified Defense (PUD) algorithm is proposed to defend against backdoor and adversarial attacks simultaneously. Specifically, our PUD has a progressive model purification scheme to jointly erase backdoors and enhance the model's adversarial robustness. At the early stage, the adversarial examples of infected models are utilized to erase backdoors. With the backdoor gradually erased, our model purification can naturally turn into a stage to boost the model's robustness against adversarial attacks. Besides, our PUD algorithm can effectively identify poisoned images, which allows the initial extra dataset not to be completely clean. Extensive experimental results show that, our discovered connection between backdoor and adversarial attacks is ubiquitous, no matter what type of backdoor attack. The proposed PUD outperforms the state-of-the-art backdoor defense, including the model repairing-based and data filtering-based methods. Besides, it also has the ability to compete with the most advanced adversarial defense methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Effectively aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human-centric values while preventing the degradation of abilities acquired through Pre-training and Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) poses a central challenge in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). In this paper, we first discover that interpolating RLHF and SFT model parameters can adjust the trade-off between human preference and basic capabilities, thereby reducing the alignment tax at the cost of alignment reward. Inspired by this, we propose integrating the RL policy and SFT models at each optimization step in RLHF to continuously regulate the training direction, introducing the Online Merging Optimizer. Specifically, we merge gradients with the parameter differences between SFT and pretrained models, effectively steering the gradient towards maximizing rewards in the direction of SFT optimization. We demonstrate that our optimizer works well with different LLM families, such as Qwen and LLaMA, across various model sizes ranging from 1.8B to 8B, various RLHF algorithms like DPO and KTO, and existing model merging methods. It significantly enhances alignment reward while mitigating alignment tax, achieving higher overall performance across 14 benchmarks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Adaptive moment estimation (Adam), as a Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) variant, has gained widespread popularity in federated learning (FL) due to its fast convergence. However, federated Adam (FedAdam) algorithms suffer from a threefold increase in uplink communication overhead compared to federated SGD (FedSGD) algorithms, which arises from the necessity to transmit both local model updates and first and second moment estimates from distributed devices to the centralized server for aggregation. Driven by this issue, we propose a novel sparse FedAdam algorithm called FedAdam-SSM, wherein distributed devices sparsify the updates of local model parameters and moment estimates and subsequently upload the sparse representations to the centralized server. To further reduce the communication overhead, the updates of local model parameters and moment estimates incorporate a shared sparse mask (SSM) into the sparsification process, eliminating the need for three separate sparse masks. Theoretically, we develop an upper bound on the divergence between the local model trained by FedAdam-SSM and the desired model trained by centralized Adam, which is related to sparsification error and imbalanced data distribution. By minimizing the divergence bound between the model trained by FedAdam-SSM and centralized Adam, we optimize the SSM to mitigate the learning performance degradation caused by sparsification error. Additionally, we provide convergence bounds for FedAdam-SSM in both convex and non-convex objective function settings, and investigate the impact of local epoch, learning rate and sparsification ratio on the convergence rate of FedAdam-SSM. Experimental results show that FedAdam-SSM outperforms baselines in terms of convergence rate (over 1.1$\times$ faster than the sparse FedAdam baselines) and test accuracy (over 14.5\% ahead of the quantized FedAdam baselines).</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce ToonCrafter, a novel approach that transcends traditional correspondence-based cartoon video interpolation, paving the way for generative interpolation. Traditional methods, that implicitly assume linear motion and the absence of complicated phenomena like dis-occlusion, often struggle with the exaggerated non-linear and large motions with occlusion commonly found in cartoons, resulting in implausible or even failed interpolation results. To overcome these limitations, we explore the potential of adapting live-action video priors to better suit cartoon interpolation within a generative framework. ToonCrafter effectively addresses the challenges faced when applying live-action video motion priors to generative cartoon interpolation. First, we design a toon rectification learning strategy that seamlessly adapts live-action video priors to the cartoon domain, resolving the domain gap and content leakage issues. Next, we introduce a dual-reference-based 3D decoder to compensate for lost details due to the highly compressed latent prior spaces, ensuring the preservation of fine details in interpolation results. Finally, we design a flexible sketch encoder that empowers users with interactive control over the interpolation results. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method not only produces visually convincing and more natural dynamics, but also effectively handles dis-occlusion. The comparative evaluation demonstrates the notable superiority of our approach over existing competitors.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recently, tool learning with large language models (LLMs) has emerged as a promising paradigm for augmenting the capabilities of LLMs to tackle highly complex problems. Despite growing attention and rapid advancements in this field, the existing literature remains fragmented and lacks systematic organization, posing barriers to entry for newcomers. This gap motivates us to conduct a comprehensive survey of existing works on tool learning with LLMs. In this survey, we focus on reviewing existing literature from the two primary aspects (1) why tool learning is beneficial and (2) how tool learning is implemented, enabling a comprehensive understanding of tool learning with LLMs. We first explore the "why" by reviewing both the benefits of tool integration and the inherent benefits of the tool learning paradigm from six specific aspects. In terms of "how", we systematically review the literature according to a taxonomy of four key stages in the tool learning workflow: task planning, tool selection, tool calling, and response generation. Additionally, we provide a detailed summary of existing benchmarks and evaluation methods, categorizing them according to their relevance to different stages. Finally, we discuss current challenges and outline potential future directions, aiming to inspire both researchers and industrial developers to further explore this emerging and promising area.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We study the problem of robust data augmentation for regression tasks in the presence of noisy data. Data augmentation is essential for generalizing deep learning models, but most of the techniques like the popular Mixup are primarily designed for classification tasks on image data. Recently, there are also Mixup techniques that are specialized to regression tasks like C-Mixup. In comparison to Mixup, which takes linear interpolations of pairs of samples, C-Mixup is more selective in which samples to mix based on their label distances for better regression performance. However, C-Mixup does not distinguish noisy versus clean samples, which can be problematic when mixing and lead to suboptimal model performance. At the same time, robust training has been heavily studied where the goal is to train accurate models against noisy data through multiple rounds of model training. We thus propose our data augmentation strategy RC-Mixup, which tightly integrates C-Mixup with multi-round robust training methods for a synergistic effect. In particular, C-Mixup improves robust training in identifying clean data, while robust training provides cleaner data to C-Mixup for it to perform better. A key advantage of RC-Mixup is that it is data-centric where the robust model training algorithm itself does not need to be modified, but can simply benefit from data mixing. We show in our experiments that RC-Mixup significantly outperforms C-Mixup and robust training baselines on noisy data benchmarks and can be integrated with various robust training methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In autonomous driving, multi-modal perception models leveraging inputs from multiple sensors exhibit strong robustness in degraded environments. However, these models face challenges in efficiently and effectively transferring learned representations across different modalities and tasks. This paper presents NeRF-Supervised Masked Auto Encoder (NS-MAE), a self-supervised pre-training paradigm for transferable multi-modal representation learning. NS-MAE is designed to provide pre-trained model initializations for efficient and high-performance fine-tuning. Our approach uses masked multi-modal reconstruction in neural radiance fields (NeRF), training the model to reconstruct missing or corrupted input data across multiple modalities. Specifically, multi-modal embeddings are extracted from corrupted LiDAR point clouds and images, conditioned on specific view directions and locations. These embeddings are then rendered into projected multi-modal feature maps using neural rendering techniques. The original multi-modal signals serve as reconstruction targets for the rendered feature maps, facilitating self-supervised representation learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the promising transferability of NS-MAE representations across diverse multi-modal and single-modal perception models. This transferability is evaluated on various 3D perception downstream tasks, such as 3D object detection and BEV map segmentation, using different amounts of fine-tuning labeled data. Our code will be released to support the community.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) drives the prosperity of the blockchain ecosystem. By strategically including, excluding, or reordering transactions within blocks, block producers/validators can extract additional value, which in turn incentivizes them to keep the decentralization of the whole blockchain platform. Before The Merge of Ethereum in Sep. 2022, around \$675M was extracted in terms of MEV. Despite its importance, current measurement works on MEV suffer some limitations. First, current works only focus on transactions of a very limited number of DApps. Second, current methods heavily rely on fixed heuristic rule-based patterns, leading to false negative/positive. Third, the observations and conclusions are outdated to some extent due to the continuously introduced features, like The Merge in Ethereum. To address these challenges, in this work, we first propose two robust methods to identify arbitrage transactions and sandwich attacks, respectively. Then, we apply them to the largest-ever dataset to filter out related MEV transactions. Based on the identified results, we have characterized the overall landscape of the Ethereum MEV ecosystem, the impact the private transaction architectures bring, and the adoption of back-running mechanism. Our research will shed light on future MEV-related work.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Transformer architectures have shown promising results in time series processing. However, despite recent advances in subquadratic attention mechanisms or state-space models, processing very long sequences still imposes significant computational requirements. Token merging, which involves replacing multiple tokens with a single one calculated as their linear combination, has shown to considerably improve the throughput of vision transformer architectures while maintaining accuracy. In this work, we go beyond computer vision and perform the first investigations of token merging in time series analysis on both time series transformers and state-space models. To effectively scale token merging to long sequences, we introduce local merging, a domain-specific token merging algorithm that selectively combines tokens within a local neighborhood, adjusting the computational complexity from linear to quadratic based on the neighborhood size. Our comprehensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that token merging offers substantial computational benefits with minimal impact on accuracy across various models and datasets. On the recently proposed Chronos foundation model, we achieve accelerations up to 5400% with only minor accuracy degradations.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Dynamic topic models track the evolution of topics in sequential documents, which have derived various applications like trend analysis and opinion mining. However, existing models suffer from repetitive topic and unassociated topic issues, failing to reveal the evolution and hindering further applications. To address these issues, we break the tradition of simply chaining topics in existing work and propose a novel neural \modelfullname. We introduce a new evolution-tracking contrastive learning method that builds the similarity relations among dynamic topics. This not only tracks topic evolution but also maintains topic diversity, mitigating the repetitive topic issue. To avoid unassociated topics, we further present an unassociated word exclusion method that consistently excludes unassociated words from discovered topics. Extensive experiments demonstrate our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, tracking topic evolution with high-quality topics, showing better performance on downstream tasks, and remaining robust to the hyperparameter for evolution intensities.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Empowering 3D Gaussian Splatting with generalization ability is appealing. However, existing generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting methods are largely confined to narrow-range interpolation between stereo images due to their heavy backbones, thus lacking the ability to accurately localize 3D Gaussian and support free-view synthesis across wide view range. In this paper, we present a novel framework FreeSplat that is capable of reconstructing geometrically consistent 3D scenes from long sequence input towards free-view synthesis.Specifically, we firstly introduce Low-cost Cross-View Aggregation achieved by constructing adaptive cost volumes among nearby views and aggregating features using a multi-scale structure. Subsequently, we present the Pixel-wise Triplet Fusion to eliminate redundancy of 3D Gaussians in overlapping view regions and to aggregate features observed across multiple views. Additionally, we propose a simple but effective free-view training strategy that ensures robust view synthesis across broader view range regardless of the number of views. Our empirical results demonstrate state-of-the-art novel view synthesis peformances in both novel view rendered color maps quality and depth maps accuracy across different numbers of input views. We also show that FreeSplat performs inference more efficiently and can effectively reduce redundant Gaussians, offering the possibility of feed-forward large scene reconstruction without depth priors.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the unprecedented performance being achieved by text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, T2I customization further empowers users to tailor the diffusion model to new concepts absent in the pre-training dataset, termed subject-driven generation. Moreover, extracting several new concepts from a single image enables the model to learn multiple concepts, and simultaneously decreases the difficulties of training data preparation, urging the disentanglement of multiple concepts to be a new challenge. However, existing models for disentanglement commonly require pre-determined masks or retain background elements. To this end, we propose an attention-guided method, AttenCraft, for multiple concept disentanglement. In particular, our method leverages self-attention and cross-attention maps to create accurate masks for each concept within a single initialization step, omitting any required mask preparation by humans or other models. The created masks are then applied to guide the cross-attention activation of each target concept during training and achieve concept disentanglement. Additionally, we introduce Uniform sampling and Reweighted sampling schemes to alleviate the non-synchronicity of feature acquisition from different concepts, and improve generation quality. Our method outperforms baseline models in terms of image-alignment, and behaves comparably on text-alignment. Finally, we showcase the applicability of AttenCraft to more complicated settings, such as an input image containing three concepts. The project is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The remarkable capabilities of modern large language models are rooted in their vast repositories of knowledge encoded within their parameters, enabling them to perceive the world and engage in reasoning. The inner workings of how these models store knowledge have long been a subject of intense interest and investigation among researchers. To date, most studies have concentrated on isolated components within these models, such as the Multilayer Perceptrons and attention head. In this paper, we delve into the computation graph of the language model to uncover the knowledge circuits that are instrumental in articulating specific knowledge. The experiments, conducted with GPT2 and TinyLLAMA, has allowed us to observe how certain information heads, relation heads, and Multilayer Perceptrons collaboratively encode knowledge within the model. Moreover, we evaluate the impact of current knowledge editing techniques on these knowledge circuits, providing deeper insights into the functioning and constraints of these editing methodologies. Finally, we utilize knowledge circuits to analyze and interpret language model behaviors such as hallucinations and in-context learning. We believe the knowledge circuit holds potential for advancing our understanding of Transformers and guiding the improved design of knowledge editing.

Personalized dialogue generation, however, is multifaceted and varies in its definition -- ranging from instilling a persona in the agent to capturing users' explicit and implicit cues. This paper seeks to systemically survey the recent landscape of personalized dialogue generation, including the datasets employed, methodologies developed, and evaluation metrics applied.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Although humans inherently have diverse values, current large language model (LLM) alignment methods often assume that aligning LLMs with the general public's preferences is optimal. A major challenge in adopting a more individualized approach to LLM alignment is its lack of scalability, as it involves repeatedly acquiring preference data and training new reward models and LLMs for each individual's preferences. To address these challenges, we propose a new paradigm where users specify what they value most within the system message, steering the LLM's generation behavior to better align with the user's intentions. However, a naive application of such an approach is non-trivial since LLMs are typically trained on a uniform system message (e.g., "You are a helpful assistant") which limits their ability to generalize to diverse, unseen system messages. To improve this generalization, we create the Multifaceted Collection, a preference dataset with 192k combinations of values beyond generic helpfulness and harmlessness, spanning 65k user instructions. Using this dataset, we train a 7B LLM called Janus and test it on 921 prompts from 5 benchmarks (AlpacaEval 2.0, FLASK, Koala, MT-Bench, and Self-Instruct) by adding various unseen system messages that reflect user preferences. Janus achieves tie+win rate of 75.2%, 72.4%, and 66.4% against Mistral 7B Instruct v0.2, GPT-3.5 Turbo, and GPT-4, respectively. Unexpectedly, on three benchmarks focused on response helpfulness (AlpacaEval 2.0, MT-Bench, Arena Hard Auto v0.1), Janus also outperforms LLaMA 3 8B Instruct by a +4.0%, +0.1%, +3.0% margin, underscoring that training with a vast array of system messages could also enhance alignment to the general public's preference as well.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, generative, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the enhancement in the field of generative artificial intelligence (AI), contextual question answering has become extremely relevant. Attributing model generations to the input source document is essential to ensure trustworthiness and reliability. We observe that when large language models (LLMs) are used for contextual question answering, the output answer often consists of text copied verbatim from the input prompt which is linked together with "glue text" generated by the LLM. Motivated by this, we propose that LLMs have an inherent awareness from where the text was copied, likely captured in the hidden states of the LLM. We introduce a novel method for attribution in contextual question answering, leveraging the hidden state representations of LLMs. Our approach bypasses the need for extensive model retraining and retrieval model overhead, offering granular attributions and preserving the quality of generated answers. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method performs on par or better than GPT-4 at identifying verbatim copied segments in LLM generations and in attributing these segments to their source. Importantly, our method shows robust performance across various LLM architectures, highlighting its broad applicability. Additionally, we present Verifiability-granular, an attribution dataset which has token level annotations for LLM generations in the contextual question answering setup.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Graph Prompt Learning (GPL) bridges significant disparities between pretraining and downstream applications to alleviate the knowledge transfer bottleneck in real-world graph learning. While GPL offers superior effectiveness in graph knowledge transfer and computational efficiency, the security risks posed by backdoor poisoning effects embedded in pretrained models remain largely unexplored. Our study provides a comprehensive analysis of GPL's vulnerability to backdoor attacks. We introduce \textit{CrossBA}, the first cross-context backdoor attack against GPL, which manipulates only the pretraining phase without requiring knowledge of downstream applications. Our investigation reveals both theoretically and empirically that tuning trigger graphs, combined with prompt transformations, can seamlessly transfer the backdoor threat from pretrained encoders to downstream applications. Through extensive experiments involving 3 representative GPL methods across 5 distinct cross-context scenarios and 5 benchmark datasets of node and graph classification tasks, we demonstrate that \textit{CrossBA} consistently achieves high attack success rates while preserving the functionality of downstream applications over clean input. We also explore potential countermeasures against \textit{CrossBA} and conclude that current defenses are insufficient to mitigate \textit{CrossBA}. Our study highlights the persistent backdoor threats to GPL systems, raising trustworthiness concerns in the practices of GPL techniques.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, protect, defense, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is a short-range wireless communication technology for resource-constrained IoT devices. Unfortunately, BLE is vulnerable to session-based attacks, where previous packets construct exploitable conditions for subsequent packets to compromise connections. Defending against session-based attacks is challenging because each step in the attack sequence is legitimate when inspected individually. In this paper, we present BlueSWAT, a lightweight state-aware security framework for protecting BLE devices. To perform inspection on the session level rather than individual packets, BlueSWAT leverages a finite state machine (FSM) to monitor sequential actions of connections at runtime. Patterns of session-based attacks are modeled as malicious transition paths in the FSM. To overcome the heterogeneous IoT environment, we develop a lightweight eBPF framework to facilitate universal patch distribution across different BLE architectures and stacks, without requiring device reboot. We implement BlueSWAT on 5 real-world devices with different chips and stacks to demonstrate its cross-device adaptability. On our dataset with 101 real-world BLE vulnerabilities, BlueSWAT can mitigate 76.1% of session-based attacks, outperforming other defense frameworks. In our end-to-end application evaluation, BlueSWAT patches introduce an average of 0.073% memory overhead and negligible latency.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) have recently emerged as powerful tools for tackling many language-processing tasks. Despite their success, training and fine-tuning these models is still far too computationally and memory intensive. In this paper, we identify and characterise the important components needed for effective model convergence using gradient descent. In doing so we find that the intermediate activations used to implement backpropagation can be excessively compressed without incurring any degradation in performance. This result leads us to a cheap and memory-efficient algorithm for both fine-tuning and pre-training LLMs. The proposed algorithm simply divides the tokens up into smaller sub-tokens before projecting them onto a fixed 1-dimensional subspace during the forward pass. These features are then coarsely reconstructed during the backward pass to implement the update rules. We confirm the effectiveness of our algorithm as being complimentary to many state-of-the-art PEFT methods on the VTAB-1k fine-tuning benchmark. Furthermore, we outperform QLoRA for fine-tuning LLaMA and show competitive performance against other memory-efficient pre-training methods on the large-scale C4 dataset.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Over the past decade, studies of naturalistic language processing where participants are scanned while listening to continuous text have flourished. Using word embeddings at first, then large language models, researchers have created encoding models to analyze the brain signals. Presenting these models with the same text as the participants allows to identify brain areas where there is a significant correlation between the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) time series and the ones predicted by the models' artificial neurons. One intriguing finding from these studies is that they have revealed highly symmetric bilateral activation patterns, somewhat at odds with the well-known left lateralization of language processing. Here, we report analyses of an fMRI dataset where we manipulate the complexity of large language models, testing 28 pretrained models from 8 different families, ranging from 124M to 14.2B parameters. First, we observe that the performance of models in predicting brain responses follows a scaling law, where the fit with brain activity increases linearly with the logarithm of the number of parameters of the model (and its performance on natural language processing tasks). Second, we show that a left-right asymmetry gradually appears as model size increases, and that the difference in left-right brain correlations also follows a scaling law. Whereas the smallest models show no asymmetry, larger models fit better and better left hemispheric activations than right hemispheric ones. This finding reconciles computational analyses of brain activity using large language models with the classic observation from aphasic patients showing left hemisphere dominance for language.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The joint-embedding predictive architecture (JEPA) recently has shown impressive results in extracting visual representations from unlabeled imagery under a masking strategy. However, we reveal its disadvantages, notably its insufficient understanding of local semantics. This deficiency originates from masked modeling in the embedding space, resulting in a reduction of discriminative power and can even lead to the neglect of critical local semantics. To bridge this gap, we introduce DMT-JEPA, a novel masked modeling objective rooted in JEPA, specifically designed to generate discriminative latent targets from neighboring information. Our key idea is simple: we consider a set of semantically similar neighboring patches as a target of a masked patch. To be specific, the proposed DMT-JEPA (a) computes feature similarities between each masked patch and its corresponding neighboring patches to select patches having semantically meaningful relations, and (b) employs lightweight cross-attention heads to aggregate features of neighboring patches as the masked targets. Consequently, DMT-JEPA demonstrates strong discriminative power, offering benefits across a diverse spectrum of downstream tasks. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate our effectiveness across various visual benchmarks, including ImageNet-1K image classification, ADE20K semantic segmentation, and COCO object detection tasks.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion-based video generation has achieved significant progress, yet generating multiple actions that occur sequentially remains a formidable task. Directly generating a video with sequential actions can be extremely challenging due to the scarcity of fine-grained action annotations and the difficulty in establishing temporal semantic correspondences and maintaining long-term consistency. To tackle this, we propose an intuitive and straightforward solution: splicing multiple single-action video segments sequentially. The core challenge lies in generating smooth and natural transitions between these segments given the inherent complexity and variability of action transitions. We introduce MAVIN (Multi-Action Video INfilling model), designed to generate transition videos that seamlessly connect two given videos, forming a cohesive integrated sequence. MAVIN incorporates several innovative techniques to address challenges in the transition video infilling task. Firstly, a consecutive noising strategy coupled with variable-length sampling is employed to handle large infilling gaps and varied generation lengths. Secondly, boundary frame guidance (BFG) is proposed to address the lack of semantic guidance during transition generation. Lastly, a Gaussian filter mixer (GFM) dynamically manages noise initialization during inference, mitigating train-test discrepancy while preserving generation flexibility. Additionally, we introduce a new metric, CLIP-RS (CLIP Relative Smoothness), to evaluate temporal coherence and smoothness, complementing traditional quality-based metrics. Experimental results on horse and tiger scenarios demonstrate MAVIN's superior performance in generating smooth and coherent video transitions compared to existing methods.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the widespread application of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly deep learning (DL) and vision-based large language models (VLLMs), in skin disease diagnosis, the need for interpretability becomes crucial. However, existing dermatology datasets are limited in their inclusion of concept-level meta-labels, and none offer rich medical descriptions in natural language. This deficiency impedes the advancement of LLM-based methods in dermatological diagnosis. To address this gap and provide a meticulously annotated dermatology dataset with comprehensive natural language descriptions, we introduce SkinCAP: a multi-modal dermatology dataset annotated with rich medical captions. SkinCAP comprises 4,000 images sourced from the Fitzpatrick 17k skin disease dataset and the Diverse Dermatology Images dataset, annotated by board-certified dermatologists to provide extensive medical descriptions and captions. Notably, SkinCAP represents the world's first such dataset and is publicly available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) typically have a limited context window, resulting in significant performance degradation when processing text beyond the length of the context window. Extensive studies have been proposed to extend the context window and achieve length extrapolation of LLMs, but there is still a lack of in-depth interpretation of these approaches. In this study, we explore the positional information within and beyond the context window for deciphering the underlying mechanism of LLMs. By using a mean-based decomposition method, we disentangle positional vectors from hidden states of LLMs and analyze their formation and effect on attention. Furthermore, when texts exceed the context window, we analyze the change of positional vectors in two settings, i.e., direct extrapolation and context window extension. Based on our findings, we design two training-free context window extension methods, positional vector replacement and attention window extension. Experimental results show that our methods can effectively extend the context window length.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Objective. Active adverse event surveillance monitors Adverse Drug Events (ADE) from different data sources, such as electronic health records, medical literature, social media and search engine logs. Over years, many datasets are created, and shared tasks are organised to facilitate active adverse event surveillance. However, most-if not all-datasets or shared tasks focus on extracting ADEs from a particular type of text. Domain generalisation-the ability of a machine learning model to perform well on new, unseen domains (text types)-is under-explored. Given the rapid advancements in natural language processing, one unanswered question is how far we are from having a single ADE extraction model that are effective on various types of text, such as scientific literature and social media posts}. Methods. We contribute to answering this question by building a multi-domain benchmark for adverse drug event extraction, which we named MultiADE. The new benchmark comprises several existing datasets sampled from different text types and our newly created dataset-CADECv2, which is an extension of CADEC (Karimi, et al., 2015), covering online posts regarding more diverse drugs than CADEC. Our new dataset is carefully annotated by human annotators following detailed annotation guidelines. Conclusion. Our benchmark results show that the generalisation of the trained models is far from perfect, making it infeasible to be deployed to process different types of text. In addition, although intermediate transfer learning is a promising approach to utilising existing resources, further investigation is needed on methods of domain adaptation, particularly cost-effective methods to select useful training instances.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Personalized retrieval and segmentation aim to locate specific instances within a dataset based on an input image and a short description of the reference instance. While supervised methods are effective, they require extensive labeled data for training. Recently, self-supervised foundation models have been introduced to these tasks showing comparable results to supervised methods. However, a significant flaw in these models is evident: they struggle to locate a desired instance when other instances within the same class are presented. In this paper, we explore text-to-image diffusion models for these tasks. Specifically, we propose a novel approach called PDM for Personalized Features Diffusion Matching, that leverages intermediate features of pre-trained text-to-image models for personalization tasks without any additional training. PDM demonstrates superior performance on popular retrieval and segmentation benchmarks, outperforming even supervised methods. We also highlight notable shortcomings in current instance and segmentation datasets and propose new benchmarks for these tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While Large Language Models (LLMs) can serve as agents to simulate human behaviors (i.e., role-playing agents), we emphasize the importance of point-in-time role-playing. This situates characters at specific moments in the narrative progression for three main reasons: (i) enhancing users' narrative immersion, (ii) avoiding spoilers, and (iii) fostering engagement in fandom role-playing. To accurately represent characters at specific time points, agents must avoid character hallucination, where they display knowledge that contradicts their characters' identities and historical timelines. We introduce TimeChara, a new benchmark designed to evaluate point-in-time character hallucination in role-playing LLMs. Comprising 10,895 instances generated through an automated pipeline, this benchmark reveals significant hallucination issues in current state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o). To counter this challenge, we propose Narrative-Experts, a method that decomposes the reasoning steps and utilizes narrative experts to reduce point-in-time character hallucinations effectively. Still, our findings with TimeChara highlight the ongoing challenges of point-in-time character hallucination, calling for further study.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The MEDIQA-CORR 2024 shared task aims to assess the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify and correct medical errors in clinical notes. In this study, we evaluate the capability of general LLMs, specifically GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, to identify and correct medical errors with multiple prompting strategies. Recognising the limitation of LLMs in generating accurate corrections only via prompting strategies, we propose incorporating error-span predictions from a smaller, fine-tuned model in two ways: 1) by presenting it as a hint in the prompt and 2) by framing it as multiple-choice questions from which the LLM can choose the best correction. We found that our proposed prompting strategies significantly improve the LLM's ability to generate corrections. Our best-performing solution with 8-shot + CoT + hints ranked sixth in the shared task leaderboard. Additionally, our comprehensive analyses show the impact of the location of the error sentence, the prompted role, and the position of the multiple-choice option on the accuracy of the LLM. This prompts further questions about the readiness of LLM to be implemented in real-world clinical settings.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The ultimate goal of generative models is to characterize the data distribution perfectly. For image generation, common metrics of visual quality (e.g., FID), and the truthlikeness of generated images to the human eyes seem to suggest that we are close to achieving it. However, through distribution classification tasks, we find that, in the eyes of classifiers parameterized by neural networks, the strongest diffusion models are still far from this goal. Specifically, classifiers consistently and effortlessly distinguish between real and generated images in various settings. Further, we observe an intriguing discrepancy: classifiers can identify differences between diffusion models with similar performance (e.g., U-ViT-H vs. DiT-XL), but struggle to differentiate between the smallest and largest models in the same family (e.g., EDM2-XS vs. EDM2-XXL), whereas humans exhibit the opposite tendency. As an explanation, our comprehensive empirical study suggests that, unlike humans, classifiers tend to classify images through edge and high-frequency components. We believe that our methodology can serve as a probe to understand how generative models work and inspire further thought on how existing models can be improved and how the abuse of such models can be prevented.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Gaussian Splatting has revolutionized the world of novel view synthesis by achieving high rendering performance in real-time. Recently, studies have focused on enriching these 3D representations with semantic information for downstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce RT-GS2, the first generalizable semantic segmentation method employing Gaussian Splatting. While existing Gaussian Splatting-based approaches rely on scene-specific training, RT-GS2 demonstrates the ability to generalize to unseen scenes. Our method adopts a new approach by first extracting view-independent 3D Gaussian features in a self-supervised manner, followed by a novel View-Dependent / View-Independent (VDVI) feature fusion to enhance semantic consistency over different views. Extensive experimentation on three different datasets showcases RT-GS2's superiority over the state-of-the-art methods in semantic segmentation quality, exemplified by a 8.01% increase in mIoU on the Replica dataset. Moreover, our method achieves real-time performance of 27.03 FPS, marking an astonishing 901 times speedup compared to existing approaches. This work represents a significant advancement in the field by introducing, to the best of our knowledge, the first real-time generalizable semantic segmentation method for 3D Gaussian representations of radiance fields.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) identifies sentiment information related to specific aspects and provides deeper market insights to businesses and organizations. With the emergence of large language models (LMs), recent studies have proposed using fixed examples for instruction tuning to reformulate ABSA as a generation task. However, the performance is sensitive to the selection of in-context examples; several retrieval methods are based on surface similarity and are independent of the LM generative objective. This study proposes an instruction learning method with retrieval-based example ranking for ABSA tasks. For each target sample, an LM was applied as a scorer to estimate the likelihood of the output given the input and a candidate example as the prompt, and training examples were labeled as positive or negative by ranking the scores. An alternating training schema is proposed to train both the retriever and LM. Instructional prompts can be constructed using high-quality examples. The LM is used for both scoring and inference, improving the generation efficiency without incurring additional computational costs or training difficulties. Extensive experiments on three ABSA subtasks verified the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating its superiority over various strong baseline models.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The challenge of effectively learning inter-series correlations for multivariate time series forecasting remains a substantial and unresolved problem. Traditional deep learning models, which are largely dependent on the Transformer paradigm for modeling long sequences, often fail to integrate information from multiple time series into a coherent and universally applicable model. To bridge this gap, our paper presents ForecastGrapher, a framework reconceptualizes multivariate time series forecasting as a node regression task, providing a unique avenue for capturing the intricate temporal dynamics and inter-series correlations. Our approach is underpinned by three pivotal steps: firstly, generating custom node embeddings to reflect the temporal variations within each series; secondly, constructing an adaptive adjacency matrix to encode the inter-series correlations; and thirdly, augmenting the GNNs' expressive power by diversifying the node feature distribution. To enhance this expressive power, we introduce the Group Feature Convolution GNN (GFC-GNN). This model employs a learnable scaler to segment node features into multiple groups and applies one-dimensional convolutions with different kernel lengths to each group prior to the aggregation phase. Consequently, the GFC-GNN method enriches the diversity of node feature distribution in a fully end-to-end fashion. Through extensive experiments and ablation studies, we show that ForecastGrapher surpasses strong baselines and leading published techniques in the domain of multivariate time series forecasting.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper proposes a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to automate curriculum design, thereby enhancing the application of reinforcement learning (RL) in mobile networks. As mobile networks evolve towards the 6G era, managing their increasing complexity and dynamic nature poses significant challenges. Conventional RL approaches often suffer from slow convergence and poor generalization due to conflicting objectives and the large state and action spaces associated with mobile networks. To address these shortcomings, we introduce curriculum learning, a method that systematically exposes the RL agent to progressively challenging tasks, improving convergence and generalization. However, curriculum design typically requires extensive domain knowledge and manual human effort. Our framework mitigates this by utilizing the generative capabilities of LLMs to automate the curriculum design process, significantly reducing human effort while improving the RL agent's convergence and performance. We deploy our approach within a simulated mobile network environment and demonstrate improved RL convergence rates, generalization to unseen scenarios, and overall performance enhancements. As a case study, we consider autonomous coordination and user association in mobile networks. Our obtained results highlight the potential of combining LLM-based curriculum generation with RL for managing next-generation wireless networks, marking a significant step towards fully autonomous network operations.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, protect, attack, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated learning (FL) has recently emerged as a compelling machine learning paradigm, prioritizing the protection of privacy for training data. The increasing demand to address issues such as ``the right to be forgotten'' and combat data poisoning attacks highlights the importance of techniques, known as \textit{unlearning}, which facilitate the removal of specific training data from trained FL models. Despite numerous unlearning methods proposed for centralized learning, they often prove inapplicable to FL due to fundamental differences in the operation of the two learning paradigms. Consequently, unlearning in FL remains in its early stages, presenting several challenges. Many existing unlearning solutions in FL require a costly retraining process, which can be burdensome for clients. Moreover, these methods are primarily validated through experiments, lacking theoretical assurances. In this study, we introduce Fast-FedUL, a tailored unlearning method for FL, which eliminates the need for retraining entirely. Through meticulous analysis of the target client's influence on the global model in each round, we develop an algorithm to systematically remove the impact of the target client from the trained model. In addition to presenting empirical findings, we offer a theoretical analysis delineating the upper bound of our unlearned model and the exact retrained model (the one obtained through retraining using untargeted clients). Experimental results with backdoor attack scenarios indicate that Fast-FedUL effectively removes almost all traces of the target client, while retaining the knowledge of untargeted clients (obtaining a high accuracy of up to 98\% on the main task). Significantly, Fast-FedUL attains the lowest time complexity, providing a speed that is 1000 times faster than retraining. Our source code is publicly available at \url{this https URL}.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The Masked autoencoder (MAE) has drawn attention as a representative self-supervised approach for masked image modeling with vision transformers. However, even though MAE shows better generalization capability than fully supervised training from scratch, the reason why has not been explored. In another line of work, the Reconstruction Consistent Masked Auto Encoder (RC-MAE), has been proposed which adopts a self-distillation scheme in the form of an exponential moving average (EMA) teacher into MAE, and it has been shown that the EMA-teacher performs a conditional gradient correction during optimization. To further investigate the reason for better generalization of the self-supervised ViT when trained by MAE (MAE-ViT) and the effect of the gradient correction of RC-MAE from the perspective of optimization, we visualize the loss landscapes of the self-supervised vision transformer by both MAE and RC-MAE and compare them with the supervised ViT (Sup-ViT). Unlike previous loss landscape visualizations of neural networks based on classification task loss, we visualize the loss landscape of ViT by computing pre-training task loss. Through the lens of loss landscapes, we find two interesting observations: (1) MAE-ViT has a smoother and wider overall loss curvature than Sup-ViT. (2) The EMA-teacher allows MAE to widen the region of convexity in both pretraining and linear probing, leading to quicker convergence. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to investigate the self-supervised ViT through the lens of the loss landscape.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>What do different contrastive learning (CL) losses actually optimize for? Although multiple CL methods have demonstrated remarkable representation learning capabilities, the differences in their inner workings remain largely opaque. In this work, we analyse several CL families and prove that, under certain conditions, they admit the same minimisers when optimizing either their batch-level objectives or their expectations asymptotically. In both cases, an intimate connection with the hyperspherical energy minimisation (HEM) problem resurfaces. Drawing inspiration from this, we introduce a novel CL objective, coined Decoupled Hyperspherical Energy Loss (DHEL). DHEL simplifies the problem by decoupling the target hyperspherical energy from the alignment of positive examples while preserving the same theoretical guarantees. Going one step further, we show the same results hold for another relevant CL family, namely kernel contrastive learning (KCL), with the additional advantage of the expected loss being independent of batch size, thus identifying the minimisers in the non-asymptotic regime. Empirical results demonstrate improved downstream performance and robustness across combinations of different batch sizes and hyperparameters and reduced dimensionality collapse, on several computer vision datasets.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) grow in size and complexity, they often exceed the memory capacity of a single accelerator, necessitating the sharding of model parameters across multiple accelerators. Pipeline parallelism is a commonly used sharding strategy for training large DNNs. However, current implementations of pipeline parallelism are being unintentionally bottlenecked by the automatic differentiation tools provided by ML frameworks. This paper introduces 2-stage backpropagation (2BP). By splitting the backward propagation step into two separate stages, we can reduce idle compute time. We tested 2BP on various model architectures and pipelining schedules, achieving increases in throughput in all cases. Using 2BP, we were able to achieve a 1.70x increase in throughput compared to traditional methods when training a LLaMa-like transformer with 7 billion parameters across 4 GPUs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The task of Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is to predict the location of a query image from a database of geo-tagged images. Recent studies in VPR have highlighted the significant advantage of employing pre-trained foundation models like DINOv2 for the VPR task. However, these models are often deemed inadequate for VPR without further fine-tuning on task-specific data. In this paper, we propose a simple yet powerful approach to better exploit the potential of a foundation model for VPR. We first demonstrate that features extracted from self-attention layers can serve as a powerful re-ranker for VPR. Utilizing these features in a zero-shot manner, our method surpasses previous zero-shot methods and achieves competitive results compared to supervised methods across multiple datasets. Subsequently, we demonstrate that a single-stage method leveraging internal ViT layers for pooling can generate global features that achieve state-of-the-art results, even when reduced to a dimensionality as low as 128D. Nevertheless, incorporating our local foundation features for re-ranking, expands this gap. Our approach further demonstrates remarkable robustness and generalization, achieving state-of-the-art results, with a significant gap, in challenging scenarios, involving occlusion, day-night variations, and seasonal changes.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Broad, open source availability of large pretrained foundation models on the internet through platforms such as HuggingFace has taken the world of practical deep learning by storm. A classical pipeline for neural network training now typically consists of finetuning these pretrained network on a small target dataset instead of training from scratch. In the case of large models this can be done even on modest hardware using a low rank training technique known as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). While Low Rank training has already been studied in the continual learning setting, existing works often consider storing the learned adapter along with the existing model but rarely attempt to modify the weights of the pretrained model by merging the LoRA with the existing weights after finishing the training of each task. In this article we investigate this setting and study the impact of LoRA rank on the forgetting of the pretraining foundation task and on the plasticity and forgetting of subsequent ones. We observe that this rank has an important impact on forgetting of both the pretraining and downstream tasks. We also observe that vision transformers finetuned in that way exhibit a sort of ``contextual'' forgetting, a behaviour that we do not observe for residual networks and that we believe has not been observed yet in previous continual learning works.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The widespread use of diffusion methods enables the creation of highly realistic images on demand, thereby posing significant risks to the integrity and safety of online information and highlighting the necessity of DeepFake detection. Our analysis of features extracted by traditional image encoders reveals that both low-level and high-level features offer distinct advantages in identifying DeepFake images produced by various diffusion methods. Inspired by this finding, we aim to develop an effective representation that captures both low-level and high-level features to detect diffusion-based DeepFakes. To address the problem, we propose a text modality-oriented feature extraction method, termed TOFE. Specifically, for a given target image, the representation we discovered is a corresponding text embedding that can guide the generation of the target image with a specific text-to-image model. Experiments conducted across ten diffusion types demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Across scientific domains, generating new models or optimizing existing ones while meeting specific criteria is crucial. Traditional machine learning frameworks for guided design use a generative model and a surrogate model (discriminator), requiring large datasets. However, real-world scientific applications often have limited data and complex landscapes, making data-hungry models inefficient or impractical. We propose a new framework, PropEn, inspired by ``matching'', which enables implicit guidance without training a discriminator. By matching each sample with a similar one that has a better property value, we create a larger training dataset that inherently indicates the direction of improvement. Matching, combined with an encoder-decoder architecture, forms a domain-agnostic generative framework for property enhancement. We show that training with a matched dataset approximates the gradient of the property of interest while remaining within the data distribution, allowing efficient design optimization. Extensive evaluations in toy problems and scientific applications, such as therapeutic protein design and airfoil optimization, demonstrate PropEn's advantages over common baselines. Notably, the protein design results are validated with wet lab experiments, confirming the competitiveness and effectiveness of our approach.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Semantic segmentation requires pixel-level annotation, which is time-consuming. Active Learning (AL) is a promising method for reducing data annotation costs. Due to the gap between aerial and natural images, the previous AL methods are not ideal, mainly caused by unreasonable labeling units and the neglect of class imbalance. Previous labeling units are based on images or regions, which does not consider the characteristics of segmentation tasks and aerial images, i.e., the segmentation network often makes mistakes in the edge region, and the edge of aerial images is often interlaced and irregular. Therefore, an edge-guided labeling unit is proposed and supplemented as the new unit. On the other hand, the class imbalance is severe, manifested in two aspects: the aerial image is seriously imbalanced, and the AL strategy does not fully consider the class balance. Both seriously affect the performance of AL in aerial images. We comprehensively ensure class balance from all steps that may occur imbalance, including initial labeled data, subsequent labeled data, and pseudo-labels. Through the two improvements, our method achieves more than 11.2\% gains compared to state-of-the-art methods on three benchmark datasets, Deepglobe, Potsdam, and Vaihingen, and more than 18.6\% gains compared to the baseline. Sufficient ablation studies show that every module is indispensable. Furthermore, we establish a fair and strong benchmark for future research on AL for aerial image segmentation.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The purpose of offline multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL) is to develop a unified policy applicable to diverse tasks without the need for online environmental interaction. Recent advancements approach this through sequence modeling, leveraging the Transformer architecture's scalability and the benefits of parameter sharing to exploit task similarities. However, variations in task content and complexity pose significant challenges in policy formulation, necessitating judicious parameter sharing and management of conflicting gradients for optimal policy performance. In this work, we introduce the Harmony Multi-Task Decision Transformer (HarmoDT), a novel solution designed to identify an optimal harmony subspace of parameters for each task. We approach this as a bi-level optimization problem, employing a meta-learning framework that leverages gradient-based techniques. The upper level of this framework is dedicated to learning a task-specific mask that delineates the harmony subspace, while the inner level focuses on updating parameters to enhance the overall performance of the unified policy. Empirical evaluations on a series of benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of HarmoDT, verifying the effectiveness of our approach.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Medical image segmentation is a crucial task that relies on the ability to accurately identify and isolate regions of interest in medical images. Thereby, generative approaches allow to capture the statistical properties of segmentation masks that are dependent on the respective structures. In this work we propose FlowSDF, an image-guided conditional flow matching framework to represent the signed distance function (SDF) leading to an implicit distribution of segmentation masks. The advantage of leveraging the SDF is a more natural distortion when compared to that of binary masks. By learning a vector field that is directly related to the probability path of a conditional distribution of SDFs, we can accurately sample from the distribution of segmentation masks, allowing for the evaluation of statistical quantities. Thus, this probabilistic representation allows for the generation of uncertainty maps represented by the variance, which can aid in further analysis and enhance the predictive robustness. We qualitatively and quantitatively illustrate competitive performance of the proposed method on a public nuclei and gland segmentation data set, highlighting its utility in medical image segmentation applications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Reinforcement learning has traditionally focused on learning state-dependent policies to solve optimal control problems in a closed-loop fashion. In this work, we introduce the paradigm of open-loop reinforcement learning where a fixed action sequence is learned instead. We present three new algorithms: one robust model-based method and two sample-efficient model-free methods. Rather than basing our algorithms on Bellman's equation from dynamic programming, our work builds on Pontryagin's principle from the theory of open-loop optimal control. We provide convergence guarantees and evaluate all methods empirically on a pendulum swing-up task, as well as on two high-dimensional MuJoCo tasks, demonstrating remarkable performance compared to existing baselines.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language model (LLM) has proven to benefit a lot from retrieval augmentation in alleviating hallucinations confronted with knowledge-intensive questions. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) adopts IR-based techniques utilizing semantic-relevant documents as the generator's input context and realizes external knowledge injection. However, on today's Internet which is flooded with content generated by LLMs, there are too many "related yet useless" documents or even fake knowledge fabricated by LLMs, which will introduce extra noise to the generator and distract it from giving correct results. To this end, we regard the training of the RAG generator model as a multi-agent adversarial-defensive system, guiding the generator to have a better taste of whether a specific document helps answer the question through the Adversarial Tuning in a Multi-agent (ATM) system to strengthen the generator's robustness in an RAG pipeline. After rounds of multi-agent iterative tuning, we find that the ATM Generator can eventually discriminate useful documents amongst LLM fabrications and achieve better performance than strong baselines.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The emergence of online recruitment services has revolutionized the traditional landscape of job seeking and recruitment, necessitating the development of high-quality industrial applications to improve person-job fitting. Existing methods generally rely on modeling the latent semantics of resumes and job descriptions and learning a matching function between them. Inspired by the powerful role-playing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose to introduce a mock interview process between LLM-played interviewers and candidates. The mock interview conversations can provide additional evidence for candidate evaluation, thereby augmenting traditional person-job fitting based solely on resumes and job descriptions. However, characterizing these two roles in online recruitment still presents several challenges, such as developing the skills to raise interview questions, formulating appropriate answers, and evaluating two-sided fitness. To this end, we propose MockLLM, a novel applicable framework that divides the person-job matching process into two modules: mock interview generation and two-sided evaluation in handshake protocol, jointly enhancing their performance through collaborative behaviors between interviewers and candidates. We design a role-playing framework as a multi-role and multi-behavior paradigm to enable a single LLM agent to effectively behave with multiple functions for both parties. Moreover, we propose reflection memory generation and dynamic prompt modification techniques to refine the behaviors of both sides, enabling continuous optimization of the augmented additional evidence. Extensive experimental results show that MockLLM can achieve the best performance on person-job matching accompanied by high mock interview quality, envisioning its emerging application in real online recruitment in the future.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep learning has significantly improved the accuracy of crop classification using multispectral temporal data. However, these models have complex structures with numerous parameters, requiring large amounts of data and costly training. In low-resource situations with fewer labeled samples, deep learning models perform poorly due to insufficient data. Conversely, compressors are data-type agnostic, and non-parametric methods do not bring underlying assumptions. Inspired by this insight, we propose a non-training alternative to deep learning models, aiming to address these situations. Specifically, the Symbolic Representation Module is proposed to convert the reflectivity into symbolic representations. The symbolic representations are then cross-transformed in both the channel and time dimensions to generate symbolic embeddings. Next, the Multi-scale Normalised Compression Distance (MNCD) is designed to measure the correlation between any two symbolic embeddings. Finally, based on the MNCDs, high quality crop classification can be achieved using only a k-nearest-neighbor classifier kNN. The entire framework is ready-to-use and lightweight. Without any training, it outperformed, on average, 7 advanced deep learning models trained at scale on three benchmark datasets. It also outperforms more than half of these models in the few-shot setting with sparse crop labels. Therefore, the high performance and robustness of our non-training framework makes it truly applicable to real-world crop mapping. Codes are available at: this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Despite the superiority of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers in single-image rain removal, current multi-scale models still face significant challenges due to their reliance on single-scale feature pyramid patterns. In this paper, we propose an effective rain removal method, the dual-path multi-scale Transformer (DPMformer) for high-quality image reconstruction by leveraging rich multi-scale information. This method consists of a backbone path and two branch paths from two different multi-scale approaches. Specifically, one path adopts the coarse-to-fine strategy, progressively downsampling the image to 1/2 and 1/4 scales, which helps capture fine-scale potential rain information fusion. Simultaneously, we employ the multi-patch stacked model (non-overlapping blocks of size 2 and 4) to enrich the feature information of the deep network in the other path. To learn a richer blend of features, the backbone path fully utilizes the multi-scale information to achieve high-quality rain removal image reconstruction. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves promising performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Learning-based isosurface extraction methods have recently emerged as a robust and efficient alternative to axiomatic techniques. However, the vast majority of such approaches rely on supervised training with axiomatically computed ground truths, thus potentially inheriting biases and data artifacts of the corresponding axiomatic methods. Steering away from such dependencies, we propose a self-supervised training scheme for the Neural Dual Contouring meshing framework, resulting in our method: Self-Supervised Dual Contouring (SDC). Instead of optimizing predicted mesh vertices with supervised training, we use two novel self-supervised loss functions that encourage the consistency between distances to the generated mesh up to the first order. Meshes reconstructed by SDC surpass existing data-driven methods in capturing intricate details while being more robust to possible irregularities in the input. Furthermore, we use the same self-supervised training objective linking inferred mesh and input SDF, to regularize the training process of Deep Implicit Networks (DINs). We demonstrate that the resulting DINs produce higher-quality implicit functions, ultimately leading to more accurate and detail-preserving surfaces compared to prior baselines for different input modalities. Finally, we demonstrate that our self-supervised losses improve meshing performance in the single-view reconstruction task by enabling joint training of predicted SDF and resulting output mesh.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In recent years, the increasing demand for dynamic 3D assets in design and gaming applications has given rise to powerful generative pipelines capable of synthesizing high-quality 4D objects. Previous methods generally rely on score distillation sampling (SDS) algorithm to infer the unseen views and motion of 4D objects, thus leading to unsatisfactory results with defects like over-saturation and Janus problem. Therefore, inspired by recent progress of video diffusion models, we propose to optimize a 4D representation by explicitly generating multi-view videos from one input image. However, it is far from trivial to handle practical challenges faced by such a pipeline, including dramatic temporal inconsistency, inter-frame geometry and texture diversity, and semantic defects brought by video generation results. To address these issues, we propose DG4D, a novel multi-stage framework that generates high-quality and consistent 4D assets without score distillation. Specifically, collaborative techniques and solutions are developed, including an attention injection strategy to synthesize temporal-consistent multi-view videos, a robust and efficient dynamic reconstruction method based on Gaussian Splatting, and a refinement stage with diffusion prior for semantic restoration. The qualitative results and user preference study demonstrate that our framework outperforms the baselines in generation quality by a considerable margin.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The development of safety-critical aerospace systems is traditionally dominated by the C language. Its language characteristics make it trivial to accidentally introduce memory safety issues resulting in undefined behavior or security vulnerabilities. The Rust language aims to drastically reduce the chance of introducing bugs and consequently produces overall more secure and safer code. However, due to its relatively short lifespan, industry adaption in safety-critical environments is still lacking. This work provides a set of recommendations for the development of safety-critical space systems in Rust. Our recommendations are based on insights from our multi-fold contributions towards safer and more secure aerospace systems: We provide a comprehensive overview of ongoing efforts to adapt Rust for safety-critical system programming, highlighting its potential to enhance system robustness. Next, we introduce a procedure for partially rewriting C-based systems in Rust, offering a pragmatic pathway to improving safety without necessitating a full system overhaul. During the execution of our rewriting case study, we identify and fix three previously undiscovered vulnerabilities in a popular open-source satellite communication protocol. Finally, we introduce a new Rust compiler target configuration for bare metal PowerPC. With this, we aim to broaden Rust's applicability in space-oriented projects, as the architecture is commonly encountered in the domain, e.g., in the James Webb Space Telescope.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, attack, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Quantization leverages lower-precision weights to reduce the memory usage of large language models (LLMs) and is a key technique for enabling their deployment on commodity hardware. While LLM quantization's impact on utility has been extensively explored, this work for the first time studies its adverse effects from a security perspective. We reveal that widely used quantization methods can be exploited to produce a harmful quantized LLM, even though the full-precision counterpart appears benign, potentially tricking users into deploying the malicious quantized model. We demonstrate this threat using a three-staged attack framework: (i) first, we obtain a malicious LLM through fine-tuning on an adversarial task; (ii) next, we quantize the malicious model and calculate constraints that characterize all full-precision models that map to the same quantized model; (iii) finally, using projected gradient descent, we tune out the poisoned behavior from the full-precision model while ensuring that its weights satisfy the constraints computed in step (ii). This procedure results in an LLM that exhibits benign behavior in full precision but when quantized, it follows the adversarial behavior injected in step (i). We experimentally demonstrate the feasibility and severity of such an attack across three diverse scenarios: vulnerable code generation, content injection, and over-refusal attack. In practice, the adversary could host the resulting full-precision model on an LLM community hub such as Hugging Face, exposing millions of users to the threat of deploying its malicious quantized version on their devices.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) employing weak forms of labels has been actively studied to alleviate the annotation cost of acquiring pixel-level labels. However, classifiers trained on biased datasets tend to exploit shortcut features and make predictions based on spurious correlations between certain backgrounds and objects, leading to a poor generalization performance. In this paper, we propose shortcut mitigating augmentation (SMA) for WSSS, which generates synthetic representations of object-background combinations not seen in the training data to reduce the use of shortcut features. Our approach disentangles the object-relevant and background features. We then shuffle and combine the disentangled representations to create synthetic features of diverse object-background combinations. SMA-trained classifier depends less on contexts and focuses more on the target object when making predictions. In addition, we analyzed the behavior of the classifier on shortcut usage after applying our augmentation using an attribution method-based metric. The proposed method achieved the improved performance of semantic segmentation result on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 datasets.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Human image animation involves generating a video from a static image by following a specified pose sequence. Current approaches typically adopt a multi-stage pipeline that separately learns appearance and motion, which often leads to appearance degradation and temporal inconsistencies. To address these issues, we propose VividPose, an innovative end-to-end pipeline based on Stable Video Diffusion (SVD) that ensures superior temporal stability. To enhance the retention of human identity, we propose an identity-aware appearance controller that integrates additional facial information without compromising other appearance details such as clothing texture and background. This approach ensures that the generated videos maintain high fidelity to the identity of human subject, preserving key facial features across various poses. To accommodate diverse human body shapes and hand movements, we introduce a geometry-aware pose controller that utilizes both dense rendering maps from SMPL-X and sparse skeleton maps. This enables accurate alignment of pose and shape in the generated videos, providing a robust framework capable of handling a wide range of body shapes and dynamic hand movements. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on the UBCFashion and TikTok benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, VividPose exhibits superior generalization capabilities on our proposed in-the-wild dataset. Codes and models will be available.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The goal of Fair Representation Learning (FRL) is to mitigate biases in machine learning models by learning data representations that enable high accuracy on downstream tasks while minimizing discrimination based on sensitive attributes. The evaluation of FRL methods in many recent works primarily focuses on the tradeoff between downstream fairness and accuracy with respect to a single task that was used to approximate the utility of representations during training (proxy task). This incentivizes retaining only features relevant to the proxy task while discarding all other information. In extreme cases, this can cause the learned representations to collapse to a trivial, binary value, rendering them unusable in transfer settings. In this work, we argue that this approach is fundamentally mismatched with the original motivation of FRL, which arises from settings with many downstream tasks unknown at training time (transfer tasks). To remedy this, we propose to refocus the evaluation protocol of FRL methods primarily around the performance on transfer tasks. A key challenge when conducting such an evaluation is the lack of adequate benchmarks. We address this by formulating four criteria that a suitable evaluation procedure should fulfill. Based on these, we propose TransFair, a benchmark that satisfies these criteria, consisting of novel variations of popular FRL datasets with carefully calibrated transfer tasks. In this setting, we reevaluate state-of-the-art FRL methods, observing that they often overfit to the proxy task, which causes them to underperform on certain transfer tasks. We further highlight the importance of task-agnostic learning signals for FRL methods, as they can lead to more transferrable representations.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Time series analysis remains a major challenge due to its sparse characteristics, high dimensionality, and inconsistent data quality. Recent advancements in transformer-based techniques have enhanced capabilities in forecasting and imputation; however, these methods are still resource-heavy, lack adaptability, and face difficulties in integrating both local and global attributes of time series. To tackle these challenges, we propose a new architectural concept for time series analysis based on introspection. Central to this concept is the self-supervised pretraining of Time Series Representation Models (TSRMs), which once learned can be easily tailored and fine-tuned for specific tasks, such as forecasting and imputation, in an automated and resource-efficient manner. Our architecture is equipped with a flexible and hierarchical representation learning process, which is robust against missing data and outliers. It can capture and learn both local and global features of the structure, semantics, and crucial patterns of a given time series category, such as heart rate data. Our learned time series representation models can be efficiently adapted to a specific task, such as forecasting or imputation, without manual intervention. Furthermore, our architecture's design supports explainability by highlighting the significance of each input value for the task at hand. Our empirical study using four benchmark datasets shows that, compared to investigated state-of-the-art baseline methods, our architecture improves imputation and forecasting errors by up to 90.34% and 71.54%, respectively, while reducing the required trainable parameters by up to 92.43%.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While image-based virtual try-on has made significant strides, emerging approaches still fall short of delivering high-fidelity and robust fitting images across various scenarios, as their models suffer from issues of ill-fitted garment styles and quality degrading during the training process, not to mention the lack of support for various combinations of attire. Therefore, we first propose a lightweight, scalable, operator known as Hydra Block for attire combinations. This is achieved through a parallel attention mechanism that facilitates the feature injection of multiple garments from conditionally encoded branches into the main network. Secondly, to significantly enhance the model's robustness and expressiveness in real-world scenarios, we evolve its potential across diverse settings by synthesizing the residuals of multiple models, as well as implementing a mask region boost strategy to overcome the instability caused by information leakage in existing models. Equipped with the above design, AnyFit surpasses all baselines on high-resolution benchmarks and real-world data by a large gap, excelling in producing well-fitting garments replete with photorealistic and rich details. Furthermore, AnyFit's impressive performance on high-fidelity virtual try-ons in any scenario from any image, paves a new path for future research within the fashion community.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Implicit Q-learning (IQL) serves as a strong baseline for offline RL, which learns the value function using only dataset actions through quantile regression. However, it is unclear how to recover the implicit policy from the learned implicit Q-function and why IQL can utilize weighted regression for policy extraction. IDQL reinterprets IQL as an actor-critic method and gets weights of implicit policy, however, this weight only holds for the optimal value function. In this work, we introduce a different way to solve the implicit policy-finding problem (IPF) by formulating this problem as an optimization problem. Based on this optimization problem, we further propose two practical algorithms AlignIQL and AlignIQL-hard, which inherit the advantages of decoupling actor from critic in IQL and provide insights into why IQL can use weighted regression for policy extraction. Compared with IQL and IDQL, we find our method keeps the simplicity of IQL and solves the implicit policy-finding problem. Experimental results on D4RL datasets show that our method achieves competitive or superior results compared with other SOTA offline RL methods. Especially in complex sparse reward tasks like Antmaze and Adroit, our method outperforms IQL and IDQL by a significant margin.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep learning with differential privacy (DP) has garnered significant attention over the past years, leading to the development of numerous methods aimed at enhancing model accuracy and training efficiency. This paper delves into the problem of training Transformer models with differential privacy. Our treatment is modular: the logic is to `reduce' the problem of training DP Transformer to the more basic problem of training DP vanilla neural nets. The latter is better understood and amenable to many model-agnostic methods. Such `reduction' is done by first identifying the hardness unique to DP Transformer training: the attention distraction phenomenon and a lack of compatibility with existing techniques for efficient gradient clipping. To deal with these two issues, we propose the Re-Attention Mechanism and Phantom Clipping, respectively. We believe that our work not only casts new light on training DP Transformers but also promotes a modular treatment to advance research in the field of differentially private deep learning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Soft prompt tuning is a widely studied parameter-efficient fine-tuning method. However, it has a clear drawback: many soft tokens must be inserted into the input sequences to guarantee downstream performance. As a result, soft prompt tuning is less considered than Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) in the large language modeling (LLM) era. In this work, we propose a novel prompt tuning method, Instruction-Aware Prompt Tuning (IAPT), that requires only four soft tokens. First, we install a parameter-efficient soft prompt generator at each Transformer layer to generate idiosyncratic soft prompts for each input instruction. The generated soft prompts can be seen as a semantic summary of the input instructions and can effectively guide the output generation. Second, the soft prompt generators are modules with a bottleneck architecture consisting of a self-attention pooling operation, two linear projections, and an activation function. Pilot experiments show that prompt generators at different Transformer layers require different activation functions. Thus, we propose to learn the idiosyncratic activation functions for prompt generators automatically with the help of rational functions. We have conducted experiments on various tasks, and the experimental results demonstrate that (a) our IAPT method can outperform the recent baselines with comparable tunable parameters. (b) Our IAPT method is more efficient than LoRA under the single-backbone multi-tenant setting.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects is important to tailor treatments to those individuals who would most likely benefit. However, conditional average treatment effect predictors may often be trained on one population but possibly deployed on different, possibly unknown populations. We use methodology for learning multi-accurate predictors to post-process CATE T-learners (differenced regressions) to become robust to unknown covariate shifts at the time of deployment. The method works in general for pseudo-outcome regression, such as the DR-learner. We show how this approach can combine (large) confounded observational and (smaller) randomized datasets by learning a confounded predictor from the observational dataset, and auditing for multi-accuracy on the randomized controlled trial. We show improvements in bias and mean squared error in simulations with increasingly larger covariate shift, and on a semi-synthetic case study of a parallel large observational study and smaller randomized controlled experiment. Overall, we establish a connection between methods developed for multi-distribution learning and achieve appealing desiderata (e.g. external validity) in causal inference and machine learning.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Concept-based explainability methods provide insight into deep learning systems by constructing explanations using human-understandable concepts. While the literature on human reasoning demonstrates that we exploit relationships between concepts when solving tasks, it is unclear whether concept-based methods incorporate the rich structure of inter-concept relationships. We analyse the concept representations learnt by concept-based models to understand whether these models correctly capture inter-concept relationships. First, we empirically demonstrate that state-of-the-art concept-based models produce representations that lack stability and robustness, and such methods fail to capture inter-concept relationships. Then, we develop a novel algorithm which leverages inter-concept relationships to improve concept intervention accuracy, demonstrating how correctly capturing inter-concept relationships can improve downstream tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Overparametrized transformer networks are the state-of-the-art architecture for Large Language Models (LLMs). However, such models contain billions of parameters making large compute a necessity, while raising environmental concerns. To address these issues, we propose FinerCut, a new form of fine-grained layer pruning, which in contrast to prior work at the transformer block level, considers all self-attention and feed-forward network (FFN) layers within blocks as individual pruning candidates. FinerCut prunes layers whose removal causes minimal alternation to the model's output -- contributing to a new, lean, interpretable, and task-agnostic pruning method. Tested across 9 benchmarks, our approach retains 90% performance of Llama3-8B with 25% layers removed, and 95% performance of Llama3-70B with 30% layers removed, all without fine-tuning or post-pruning reconstruction. Strikingly, we observe intriguing results with FinerCut: 42% (34 out of 80) of the self-attention layers in Llama3-70B can be removed while preserving 99% of its performance -- without additional fine-tuning after removal. Moreover, FinerCut provides a tool to inspect the types and locations of pruned layers, allowing to observe interesting pruning behaviors. For instance, we observe a preference for pruning self-attention layers, often at deeper consecutive decoder layers. We hope our insights inspire future efficient LLM architecture designs.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Background. The recent surge in phishing attacks keeps undermining the effectiveness of the traditional anti-phishing blacklist approaches. On-device anti-phishing solutions are gaining popularity as they offer faster phishing detection locally. Aim. We aim to eliminate the delay in recognizing and recording phishing campaigns in databases via on-device solutions that identify phishing sites immediately when encountered by the user rather than waiting for a web crawler's scan to finish. Additionally, utilizing operating system-specific resources and frameworks, we aim to minimize the impact on system performance and depend on local processing to protect user privacy. Method. We propose a phishing detection solution that uses a combination of computer vision and on-device machine learning models to analyze websites in real time. Our reference-based approach analyzes the visual content of webpages, identifying phishing attempts through layout analysis, credential input areas detection, and brand impersonation criteria combination. Results. Our case study shows it's feasible to perform background processing on-device continuously, for the case of the web browser requiring the resource use of 16% of a single CPU core and less than 84MB of RAM on Apple M1 while maintaining the accuracy of brand logo detection at 46.6% (comparable with baselines), and of Credential Requiring Page detection at 98.1% (improving the baseline by 3.1%), within the test dataset. Conclusions. Our results demonstrate the potential of on-device, real-time phishing detection systems to enhance cybersecurity defensive technologies and extend the scope of phishing detection to more similar regions of interest, e.g., email clients and messenger windows.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Although Vision Transformers (ViTs) have recently advanced computer vision tasks significantly, an important real-world problem was overlooked: adapting to variable input resolutions. Typically, images are resized to a fixed resolution, such as 224x224, for efficiency during training and inference. However, uniform input size conflicts with real-world scenarios where images naturally vary in resolution. Modifying the preset resolution of a model may severely degrade the performance. In this work, we propose to enhance the model adaptability to resolution variation by optimizing the patch embedding. The proposed method, called Multi-Scale Patch Embedding (MSPE), substitutes the standard patch embedding with multiple variable-sized patch kernels and selects the best parameters for different resolutions, eliminating the need to resize the original image. Our method does not require high-cost training or modifications to other parts, making it easy to apply to most ViT models. Experiments in image classification, segmentation, and detection tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of MSPE, yielding superior performance on low-resolution inputs and performing comparably on high-resolution inputs with existing methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Understanding how sentences are internally represented in the human brain, as well as in large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, is a major challenge for cognitive science. Classic linguistic theories propose that the brain represents a sentence by parsing it into hierarchically organized constituents. In contrast, LLMs do not explicitly parse linguistic constituents and their latent representations remains poorly explained. Here, we demonstrate that humans and LLMs construct similar latent representations of hierarchical linguistic constituents by analyzing their behaviors during a novel one-shot learning task, in which they infer which words should be deleted from a sentence. Both humans and LLMs tend to delete a constituent, instead of a nonconstituent word string. In contrast, a naive sequence processing model that has access to word properties and ordinal positions does not show this property. Based on the word deletion behaviors, we can reconstruct the latent constituency tree representation of a sentence for both humans and LLMs. These results demonstrate that a latent tree-structured constituency representation can emerge in both the human brain and LLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>A common way to evaluate a dataset in ML involves training a model on this dataset and assessing the model's performance on a test set. However, this approach has two issues: (1) it may incentivize undesirable data manipulation in data marketplaces, as the self-interested data providers seek to modify the dataset to maximize their evaluation scores; (2) it may select datasets that overfit to potentially small test sets. We propose a new data valuation method that provably guarantees the following: data providers always maximize their expected score by truthfully reporting their observed data. Any manipulation of the data, including but not limited to data duplication, adding random data, data removal, or re-weighting data from different groups, cannot increase their expected score. Our method, following the paradigm of proper scoring rules, measures the pointwise mutual information (PMI) of the test dataset and the evaluated dataset. However, computing the PMI of two datasets is challenging. We introduce a novel PMI measuring method that greatly improves tractability within Bayesian machine learning contexts. This is accomplished through a new characterization of PMI that relies solely on the posterior probabilities of the model parameter at an arbitrarily selected value. Finally, we support our theoretical results with simulations and further test the effectiveness of our data valuation method in identifying the top datasets among multiple data providers. Interestingly, our method outperforms the standard approach of selecting datasets based on the trained model's test performance, suggesting that our truthful valuation score can also be more robust to overfitting.</li>

Taking Ghost Peak attack as an example, this paper demonstrates the effectiveness, feasibility and generalizability of the proposed attack detection scheme through simulation and experimental validation.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>From paired image-text training to text-only training for image captioning, the pursuit of relaxing the requirements for high-cost and large-scale annotation of good quality data remains consistent. In this paper, we propose Text-only Synthesis for Image Captioning (ToCa), which further advances this relaxation with fewer human labor and less computing time. Specifically, we deconstruct caption text into structures and lexical words, which serve as the fundamental components of the caption. By combining different structures and lexical words as inputs to the large language model, massive captions that contain various patterns of lexical words are generated. This method not only approaches the target domain but also surpasses it by generating new captions, thereby enhancing the zero-shot generalization ability of the model. Considering the different levels of data access in the real world, we define three synthesis scenarios: cross-domain synthesis, in-domain synthesis, and data-efficient synthesis. Experiments in these scenarios demonstrate the generalizability, transferability and practicability of ToCa with a nearly 5 CIDEr improvement for zero-shot cross-domain captioning and a maximum increase of over 20 CIDEr for data-efficient captioning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>federate, fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Collaborative fairness stands as an essential element in federated learning to encourage client participation by equitably distributing rewards based on individual contributions. Existing methods primarily focus on adjusting gradient allocations among clients to achieve collaborative fairness. However, they frequently overlook crucial factors such as maintaining consistency across local models and catering to the diverse requirements of high-contributing clients. This oversight inevitably decreases both fairness and model accuracy in practice. To address these issues, we propose FedSAC, a novel Federated learning framework with dynamic Submodel Allocation for Collaborative fairness, backed by a theoretical convergence guarantee. First, we present the concept of "bounded collaborative fairness (BCF)", which ensures fairness by tailoring rewards to individual clients based on their contributions. Second, to implement the BCF, we design a submodel allocation module with a theoretical guarantee of fairness. This module incentivizes high-contributing clients with high-performance submodels containing a diverse range of crucial neurons, thereby preserving consistency across local models. Third, we further develop a dynamic aggregation module to adaptively aggregate submodels, ensuring the equitable treatment of low-frequency neurons and consequently enhancing overall model accuracy. Extensive experiments conducted on three public benchmarks demonstrate that FedSAC outperforms all baseline methods in both fairness and model accuracy. We see this work as a significant step towards incentivizing broader client participation in federated learning. The source code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods enable efficient adaptation of Large Language Models (LLMs) to various downstream applications. However, the effectiveness of the PEFT diminishes notably when downstream tasks require accurate learning of factual knowledge. In this paper, we adopt a semantic perspective to investigate this phenomenon, uncovering the reasons behind PEFT's limitations in knowledge learning task. Our findings reveal that: (1) PEFT presents a notable risk of pushing the model away from the intended knowledge target; (2) multiple knowledge interfere with each other, and such interference suppresses the learning and expression of knowledge features. Based on these insights, we introduce a data filtering strategy to exclude data that is detrimental to knowledge learning and a re-weighted learning strategy to make the model attentive to semantic distance during knowledge learning. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on open-source large language model, further validate the semantic challenge in PEFT, thus paving the way for future research.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Optimization layers in deep neural networks have enjoyed a growing popularity in structured learning, improving the state of the art on a variety of applications. Yet, these pipelines lack interpretability since they are made of two opaque layers: a highly non-linear prediction model, such as a deep neural network, and an optimization layer, which is typically a complex black-box solver. Our goal is to improve the transparency of such methods by providing counterfactual explanations. We build upon variational autoencoders a principled way of obtaining counterfactuals: working in the latent space leads to a natural notion of plausibility of explanations. We finally introduce a variant of the classic loss for VAE training that improves their performance in our specific structured context. These provide the foundations of CF-OPT, a first-order optimization algorithm that can find counterfactual explanations for a broad class of structured learning architectures. Our numerical results show that both close and plausible explanations can be obtained for problems from the recent literature.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Machine learning systems often acquire biases by leveraging undesired features in the data, impacting accuracy variably across different sub-populations. Current understanding of bias formation mostly focuses on the initial and final stages of learning, leaving a gap in knowledge regarding the transient dynamics. To address this gap, this paper explores the evolution of bias in a teacher-student setup modeling different data sub-populations with a Gaussian-mixture model. We provide an analytical description of the stochastic gradient descent dynamics of a linear classifier in this setting, which we prove to be exact in high dimension. Notably, our analysis reveals how different properties of sub-populations influence bias at different timescales, showing a shifting preference of the classifier during training. Applying our findings to fairness and robustness, we delineate how and when heterogeneous data and spurious features can generate and amplify bias. We empirically validate our results in more complex scenarios by training deeper networks on synthetic and real datasets, including CIFAR10, MNIST, and CelebA.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Addressing the issue of submerged underwater trash is crucial for safeguarding aquatic ecosystems and preserving marine life. While identifying debris present on the surface of water bodies is straightforward, assessing the underwater submerged waste is a challenge due to the image distortions caused by factors such as light refraction, absorption, suspended particles, color shifts, and occlusion. This paper conducts a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art architectures and on the existing datasets to establish a baseline for submerged waste and trash detection. The primary goal remains to establish the benchmark of the object localization techniques to be leveraged by advanced underwater sensors and autonomous underwater vehicles. The ultimate objective is to explore the underwater environment, to identify, and remove underwater debris. The absence of benchmarks (dataset or algorithm) in many researches emphasizes the need for a more robust algorithmic solution. Through this research, we aim to give performance comparative analysis of various underwater trash detection algorithms.</li>

          Multi-modal Generation via Cross-Modal In-Context Learning(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this work, we study the problem of generating novel images from complex multimodal prompt sequences. While existing methods achieve promising results for text-to-image generation, they often struggle to capture fine-grained details from lengthy prompts and maintain contextual coherence within prompt sequences. Moreover, they often result in misaligned image generation for prompt sequences featuring multiple objects. To address this, we propose a Multi-modal Generation via Cross-Modal In-Context Learning (MGCC) method that generates novel images from complex multimodal prompt sequences by leveraging the combined capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models. Our MGCC comprises a novel Cross-Modal Refinement module to explicitly learn cross-modal dependencies between the text and image in the LLM embedding space, and a contextual object grounding module to generate object bounding boxes specifically targeting scenes with multiple objects. Our MGCC demonstrates a diverse range of multimodal capabilities, like novel image generation, the facilitation of multimodal dialogue, and generation of texts. Experimental evaluations on two benchmark datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. On Visual Story Generation (VIST) dataset with multimodal inputs, our MGCC achieves a CLIP Similarity score of $0.652$ compared to SOTA GILL $0.641$. Similarly, on Visual Dialogue Context (VisDial) having lengthy dialogue sequences, our MGCC achieves an impressive CLIP score of $0.660$, largely outperforming existing SOTA method scoring $0.645$.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present SSL-HV: Self-Supervised Learning approaches applied to the task of Handwriting Verification. This task involves determining whether a given pair of handwritten images originate from the same or different writer distribution. We have compared the performance of multiple generative, contrastive SSL approaches against handcrafted feature extractors and supervised learning on CEDAR AND dataset. We show that ResNet based Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) outperforms other generative approaches achieving 76.3% accuracy, while ResNet-18 fine-tuned using Variance-Invariance-Covariance Regularization (VICReg) outperforms other contrastive approaches achieving 78% accuracy. Using a pre-trained VAE and VICReg for the downstream task of writer verification we observed a relative improvement in accuracy of 6.7% and 9% over ResNet-18 supervised baseline with 10% writer labels.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Self-supervised landmark estimation is a challenging task that demands the formation of locally distinct feature representations to identify sparse facial landmarks in the absence of annotated data. To tackle this task, existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods (1) extract coarse features from backbones that are trained with instance-level self-supervised learning (SSL) paradigms, which neglect the dense prediction nature of the task, (2) aggregate them into memory-intensive hypercolumn formations, and (3) supervise lightweight projector networks to naively establish full local correspondences among all pairs of spatial features. In this paper, we introduce SCE-MAE, a framework that (1) leverages the MAE, a region-level SSL method that naturally better suits the landmark prediction task, (2) operates on the vanilla feature map instead of on expensive hypercolumns, and (3) employs a Correspondence Approximation and Refinement Block (CARB) that utilizes a simple density peak clustering algorithm and our proposed Locality-Constrained Repellence Loss to directly hone only select local correspondences. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that SCE-MAE is highly effective and robust, outperforming existing SOTA methods by large margins of approximately 20%-44% on the landmark matching and approximately 9%-15% on the landmark detection tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Video try-on stands as a promising area for its tremendous real-world potential. Prior works are limited to transferring product clothing images onto person videos with simple poses and backgrounds, while underperforming on casually captured videos. Recently, Sora revealed the scalability of Diffusion Transformer (DiT) in generating lifelike videos featuring real-world scenarios. Inspired by this, we explore and propose the first DiT-based video try-on framework for practical in-the-wild applications, named VITON-DiT. Specifically, VITON-DiT consists of a garment extractor, a Spatial-Temporal denoising DiT, and an identity preservation ControlNet. To faithfully recover the clothing details, the extracted garment features are fused with the self-attention outputs of the denoising DiT and the ControlNet. We also introduce novel random selection strategies during training and an Interpolated Auto-Regressive (IAR) technique at inference to facilitate long video generation. Unlike existing attempts that require the laborious and restrictive construction of a paired training dataset, severely limiting their scalability, VITON-DiT alleviates this by relying solely on unpaired human dance videos and a carefully designed multi-stage training strategy. Furthermore, we curate a challenging benchmark dataset to evaluate the performance of casual video try-on. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of VITON-DiT in generating spatio-temporal consistent try-on results for in-the-wild videos with complicated human poses.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>protect, fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Wiki articles are created and maintained by a crowd of editors, producing a continuous stream of reviews. Reviews can take the form of additions, reverts, or both. This crowdsourcing model is exposed to manipulation since neither reviews nor editors are automatically screened and purged. To protect articles against vandalism or damage, the stream of reviews can be mined to classify reviews and profile editors in real-time. The goal of this work is to anticipate and explain which reviews to revert. This way, editors are informed why their edits will be reverted. The proposed method employs stream-based processing, updating the profiling and classification models on each incoming event. The profiling uses side and content-based features employing Natural Language Processing, and editor profiles are incrementally updated based on their reviews. Since the proposed method relies on self-explainable classification algorithms, it is possible to understand why a review has been classified as a revert or a non-revert. In addition, this work contributes an algorithm for generating synthetic data for class balancing, making the final classification fairer. The proposed online method was tested with a real data set from Wikivoyage, which was balanced through the aforementioned synthetic data generation. The results attained near-90 % values for all evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure).</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The diffusion bridge is a type of diffusion process that conditions on hitting a specific state within a finite time period. It has broad applications in fields such as Bayesian inference, financial mathematics, control theory, and shape analysis. However, simulating the diffusion bridge for natural data can be challenging due to both the intractability of the drift term and continuous representations of the data. Although several methods are available to simulate finite-dimensional diffusion bridges, infinite-dimensional cases remain unresolved. In the paper, we present a solution to this problem by merging score-matching techniques with operator learning, enabling a direct approach to score-matching for the infinite-dimensional bridge. We construct the score to be discretization invariant, which is natural given the underlying spatially continuous process. We conduct a series of experiments, ranging from synthetic examples with closed-form solutions to the stochastic nonlinear evolution of real-world biological shape data, and our method demonstrates high efficacy, particularly due to its ability to adapt to any resolution without extra training.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While the recent Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technique enhances the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) with the theory of mind, it might still struggle in handling logical reasoning that relies much on symbolic expressions and rigid deducing rules. To strengthen the logical reasoning capability of LLMs, we propose a novel Symbolic Chain-of-Thought, namely SymbCoT, a fully LLM-based framework that integrates symbolic expressions and logic rules with CoT prompting. Technically, building upon an LLM, SymbCoT 1) first translates the natural language context into the symbolic format, and then 2) derives a step-by-step plan to solve the problem with symbolic logical rules, 3) followed by a verifier to check the translation and reasoning chain. Via thorough evaluations on 5 standard datasets with both First-Order Logic and Constraint Optimization symbolic expressions, SymbCoT shows striking improvements over the CoT method consistently, meanwhile refreshing the current state-of-the-art performances. We further demonstrate that our system advances in more faithful, flexible, and explainable logical reasoning. To our knowledge, this is the first to combine symbolic expressions and rules into CoT for logical reasoning with LLMs. Code is open at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advancements in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly improved their performance in tasks combining vision and language. However, challenges persist in detailed multi-modal understanding, comprehension of complex tasks, and reasoning over multi-modal information. This paper introduces MMCTAgent, a novel multi-modal critical thinking agent framework designed to address the inherent limitations of current MLLMs in complex visual reasoning tasks. Inspired by human cognitive processes and critical thinking, MMCTAgent iteratively analyzes multi-modal information, decomposes queries, plans strategies, and dynamically evolves its reasoning. Additionally, MMCTAgent incorporates critical thinking elements such as verification of final answers and self-reflection through a novel approach that defines a vision-based critic and identifies task-specific evaluation criteria, thereby enhancing its decision-making abilities. Through rigorous evaluations across various image and video understanding benchmarks, we demonstrate that MMCTAgent (with and without the critic) outperforms both foundational MLLMs and other tool-augmented pipelines.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) are at the forefront of transforming numerous domains globally. However, their inclusivity and effectiveness remain limited for non-Latin scripts and low-resource languages. This paper tackles the imperative challenge of enhancing the multilingual performance of LLMs without extensive training or fine-tuning. Through systematic investigation and evaluation of diverse languages using popular question-answering (QA) datasets, we present novel techniques that unlock the true potential of LLMs in a polyglot landscape. Our approach encompasses three key strategies that yield significant improvements in multilingual proficiency. First, by meticulously optimizing prompts tailored for polyglot LLMs, we unlock their latent capabilities, resulting in substantial performance boosts across languages. Second, we introduce a new hybrid approach that synergizes LLM Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with multilingual embeddings and achieves improved multilingual task performance. Finally, we introduce a novel learning approach that dynamically selects the optimal prompt strategy, LLM model, and embedding model per query at run-time. This dynamic adaptation maximizes the efficacy of LLMs across languages, outperforming best static and random strategies. Additionally, our approach adapts configurations in both offline and online settings, and can seamlessly adapt to new languages and datasets, leading to substantial advancements in multilingual understanding and generation across diverse languages.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Rapid advancements in Autonomous Driving (AD) tasks turned a significant shift toward end-to-end fashion, particularly in the utilization of vision-language models (VLMs) that integrate robust logical reasoning and cognitive abilities to enable comprehensive end-to-end planning. However, these VLM-based approaches tend to integrate 2D vision tokenizers and a large language model (LLM) for ego-car planning, which lack 3D geometric priors as a cornerstone of reliable planning. Naturally, this observation raises a critical concern: Can a 2D-tokenized LLM accurately perceive the 3D environment? Our evaluation of current VLM-based methods across 3D object detection, vectorized map construction, and environmental caption suggests that the answer is, unfortunately, NO. In other words, 2D-tokenized LLM fails to provide reliable autonomous driving. In response, we introduce DETR-style 3D perceptrons as 3D tokenizers, which connect LLM with a one-layer linear projector. This simple yet elegant strategy, termed Atlas, harnesses the inherent priors of the 3D physical world, enabling it to simultaneously process high-resolution multi-view images and employ spatiotemporal modeling. Despite its simplicity, Atlas demonstrates superior performance in both 3D detection and ego planning tasks on nuScenes dataset, proving that 3D-tokenized LLM is the key to reliable autonomous driving. The code and datasets will be released.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Gliomas are the most common malignant primary brain tumors in adults and one of the deadliest types of cancer. There are many challenges in treatment and monitoring due to the genetic diversity and high intrinsic heterogeneity in appearance, shape, histology, and treatment response. Treatments include surgery, radiation, and systemic therapies, with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) playing a key role in treatment planning and post-treatment longitudinal assessment. The 2024 Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge on post-treatment glioma MRI will provide a community standard and benchmark for state-of-the-art automated segmentation models based on the largest expert-annotated post-treatment glioma MRI dataset. Challenge competitors will develop automated segmentation models to predict four distinct tumor sub-regions consisting of enhancing tissue (ET), surrounding non-enhancing T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintensity (SNFH), non-enhancing tumor core (NETC), and resection cavity (RC). Models will be evaluated on separate validation and test datasets using standardized performance metrics utilized across the BraTS 2024 cluster of challenges, including lesion-wise Dice Similarity Coefficient and Hausdorff Distance. Models developed during this challenge will advance the field of automated MRI segmentation and contribute to their integration into clinical practice, ultimately enhancing patient care.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI across diverse domains, showcasing remarkable capabilities. Central to their success is the concept of prompting, which guides model output generation. However, manual prompt engineering is labor-intensive and domain-specific, necessitating automated solutions. This paper introduces PromptWizard, a novel framework leveraging LLMs to iteratively synthesize and refine prompts tailored to specific tasks. Unlike existing approaches, PromptWizard optimizes both prompt instructions and in-context examples, maximizing model performance. The framework iteratively refines prompts by mutating instructions and incorporating negative examples to deepen understanding and ensure diversity. It further enhances both instructions and examples with the aid of a critic, synthesizing new instructions and examples enriched with detailed reasoning steps for optimal performance. PromptWizard offers several key features and capabilities, including computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art approaches, adaptability to scenarios with varying amounts of training data, and effectiveness with smaller LLMs. Rigorous evaluation across 35 tasks on 8 datasets demonstrates PromptWizard's superiority over existing prompt strategies, showcasing its efficacy and scalability in prompt optimization.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Commonsense reasoning is one of the important aspect of natural language understanding, with several benchmarks developed to evaluate it. However, only a few of these benchmarks are available in languages other than English. Developing parallel benchmarks facilitates cross-lingual evaluation, enabling a better understanding of different languages. This research introduces a collection of Winograd Schemas in Thai, a novel dataset designed to evaluate commonsense reasoning capabilities in the context of the Thai language. Through a methodology involving native speakers, professional translators, and thorough validation, the schemas aim to closely reflect Thai language nuances, idioms, and cultural references while maintaining ambiguity and commonsense challenges. We evaluate the performance of popular large language models on this benchmark, revealing their strengths, limitations, and providing insights into the current state-of-the-art. Results indicate that while models like GPT-4 and Claude-3-Opus achieve high accuracy in English, their performance significantly drops in Thai, highlighting the need for further advancements in multilingual commonsense reasoning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) aims to adapt a pre-trained source model to a target domain using only unlabeled target data. Current SFDA methods face challenges in effectively leveraging pre-trained knowledge and exploiting target domain data. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer remarkable capabilities in understanding visual and textual information, but their applicability to SFDA poses challenges such as instruction-following failures, intensive computational demands, and difficulties in performance measurement prior to adaptation. To alleviate these issues, we propose Reliability-based Curriculum Learning (RCL), a novel framework that integrates multiple MLLMs for knowledge exploitation via pseudo-labeling in SFDA. Our framework incorporates proposed Reliable Knowledge Transfer, Self-correcting and MLLM-guided Knowledge Expansion, and Multi-hot Masking Refinement to progressively exploit unlabeled data in the target domain. RCL achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on multiple SFDA benchmarks, e.g., $\textbf{+9.4%}$ on DomainNet, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing adaptability and robustness without requiring access to source data.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized various natural language processing tasks. However, the substantial size of LLMs presents significant challenges in training or fine-tuning. While parameter-efficient approaches such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA) have gained popularity, they often compromise performance compared to full-rank fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose Outlier-weighed Layerwise Sampled Low-Rank Projection (OwLore), a new memory-efficient fine-tuning approach, inspired by the layerwise outlier distribution of LLMs, which dynamically samples pre-trained layers to fine-tune instead of adding additional adaptors. We first interpret the outlier phenomenon through the lens of Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization theory (HT-SR), discovering that layers with more outliers tend to be more heavy-tailed and consequently better trained. Inspired by this finding, OwLore strategically assigns higher sampling probabilities to layers with more outliers to better leverage the knowledge stored in pre-trained LLMs. To further mitigate the memory demands of fine-tuning, we integrate gradient low-rank projection into our approach, which facilitates each layer to be efficiently trained in a low-rank manner. By incorporating the efficient characteristics of low-rank and optimal layerwise sampling, OwLore significantly improves the memory-performance trade-off in LLM pruning. Our extensive experiments across various architectures, including LLaMa2, LLaMa3, and Mistral, demonstrate that OwLore consistently outperforms baseline approaches, including full fine-tuning. Specifically, it achieves up to a 1.1% average accuracy gain on the Commonsense Reasoning benchmark, a 3.0% improvement on MMLU, and a notable 10% boost on MT-Bench, while being more memory efficient. OwLore allows us to fine-tune LLaMa2-7B with only 21GB of memory.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The 2024 Brain Tumor Segmentation Meningioma Radiotherapy (BraTS-MEN-RT) challenge aims to advance automated segmentation algorithms using the largest known multi-institutional dataset of radiotherapy planning brain MRIs with expert-annotated target labels for patients with intact or post-operative meningioma that underwent either conventional external beam radiotherapy or stereotactic radiosurgery. Each case includes a defaced 3D post-contrast T1-weighted radiotherapy planning MRI in its native acquisition space, accompanied by a single-label "target volume" representing the gross tumor volume (GTV) and any at-risk post-operative site. Target volume annotations adhere to established radiotherapy planning protocols, ensuring consistency across cases and institutions. For pre-operative meningiomas, the target volume encompasses the entire GTV and associated nodular dural tail, while for post-operative cases, it includes at-risk resection cavity margins as determined by the treating institution. Case annotations were reviewed and approved by expert neuroradiologists and radiation oncologists. Participating teams will develop, containerize, and evaluate automated segmentation models using this comprehensive dataset. Model performance will be assessed using the lesion-wise Dice Similarity Coefficient and the 95% Hausdorff distance. The top-performing teams will be recognized at the Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention Conference in October 2024. BraTS-MEN-RT is expected to significantly advance automated radiotherapy planning by enabling precise tumor segmentation and facilitating tailored treatment, ultimately improving patient outcomes.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Modern websites extensively rely on JavaScript to implement both functionality and tracking. Existing privacy enhancing content blocking tools struggle against mixed scripts, which simultaneously implement both functionality and tracking, because blocking the script would break functionality and not blocking it would allow tracking. We propose Not.js, a fine grained JavaScript blocking tool that operates at the function level granularity. Not.js's strengths lie in analyzing the dynamic execution context, including the call stack and calling context of each JavaScript function, and then encoding this context to build a rich graph representation. Not.js trains a supervised machine learning classifier on a webpage's graph representation to first detect tracking at the JavaScript function level and then automatically generate surrogate scripts that preserve functionality while removing tracking. Our evaluation of Not.js on the top 10K websites demonstrates that it achieves high precision (94%) and recall (98%) in detecting tracking JavaScript functions, outperforming the state of the art while being robust against off the shelf JavaScript obfuscation. Fine grained detection of tracking functions allows Not.js to automatically generate surrogate scripts that remove tracking JavaScript functions without causing major breakage. Our deployment of Not.js shows that mixed scripts are present on 62.3% of the top 10K websites, with 70.6% of the mixed scripts being third party that engage in tracking activities such as cookie ghostwriting. We share a sample of the tracking functions detected by Not.js within mixed scripts not currently on filter lists with filter list authors, who confirm that these scripts are not blocked due to potential functionality breakage, despite being known to implement tracking.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent video generative models primarily rely on carefully written text prompts for specific tasks, like inpainting or style editing. They require labor-intensive textual descriptions for input videos, hindering their flexibility to adapt personal/raw videos to user specifications. This paper proposes RACCooN, a versatile and user-friendly video-to-paragraph-to-video generative framework that supports multiple video editing capabilities such as removal, addition, and modification, through a unified pipeline. RACCooN consists of two principal stages: Video-to-Paragraph (V2P) and Paragraph-to-Video (P2V). In the V2P stage, we automatically describe video scenes in well-structured natural language, capturing both the holistic context and focused object details. Subsequently, in the P2V stage, users can optionally refine these descriptions to guide the video diffusion model, enabling various modifications to the input video, such as removing, changing subjects, and/or adding new objects. The proposed approach stands out from other methods through several significant contributions: (1) RACCooN suggests a multi-granular spatiotemporal pooling strategy to generate well-structured video descriptions, capturing both the broad context and object details without requiring complex human annotations, simplifying precise video content editing based on text for users. (2) Our video generative model incorporates auto-generated narratives or instructions to enhance the quality and accuracy of the generated content. It supports the addition of video objects, inpainting, and attribute modification within a unified framework, surpassing existing video editing and inpainting benchmarks. The proposed framework demonstrates impressive versatile capabilities in video-to-paragraph generation, video content editing, and can be incorporated into other SoTA video generative models for further enhancement.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The consistency model (CM) has recently made significant progress in accelerating the generation of diffusion models. However, its application to high-resolution, text-conditioned image generation in the latent space (a.k.a., LCM) remains unsatisfactory. In this paper, we identify three key flaws in the current design of LCM. We investigate the reasons behind these limitations and propose the Phased Consistency Model (PCM), which generalizes the design space and addresses all identified limitations. Our evaluations demonstrate that PCM significantly outperforms LCM across 1--16 step generation settings. While PCM is specifically designed for multi-step refinement, it achieves even superior or comparable 1-step generation results to previously state-of-the-art specifically designed 1-step methods. Furthermore, we show that PCM's methodology is versatile and applicable to video generation, enabling us to train the state-of-the-art few-step text-to-video generator.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has greatly improved the performance of Large Language Model (LLM) responses by grounding generation with context from existing documents. These systems work well when documents are clearly relevant to a question context. But what about when a document has partial information, or less obvious connections to the context? And how should we reason about connections between documents? In this work, we seek to answer these two core questions about RAG generation. We introduce G-RAG, a reranker based on graph neural networks (GNNs) between the retriever and reader in RAG. Our method combines both connections between documents and semantic information (via Abstract Meaning Representation graphs) to provide a context-informed ranker for RAG. G-RAG outperforms state-of-the-art approaches while having smaller computational footprint. Additionally, we assess the performance of PaLM 2 as a reranker and find it to significantly underperform G-RAG. This result emphasizes the importance of reranking for RAG even when using Large Language Models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Scene image editing is crucial for entertainment, photography, and advertising design. Existing methods solely focus on either 2D individual object or 3D global scene editing. This results in a lack of a unified approach to effectively control and manipulate scenes at the 3D level with different levels of granularity. In this work, we propose 3DitScene, a novel and unified scene editing framework leveraging language-guided disentangled Gaussian Splatting that enables seamless editing from 2D to 3D, allowing precise control over scene composition and individual objects. We first incorporate 3D Gaussians that are refined through generative priors and optimization techniques. Language features from CLIP then introduce semantics into 3D geometry for object disentanglement. With the disentangled Gaussians, 3DitScene allows for manipulation at both the global and individual levels, revolutionizing creative expression and empowering control over scenes and objects. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of 3DitScene in scene image editing. Code and online demo can be found at our project homepage: this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recently, linear complexity sequence modeling networks have achieved modeling capabilities similar to Vision Transformers on a variety of computer vision tasks, while using fewer FLOPs and less memory. However, their advantage in terms of actual runtime speed is not significant. To address this issue, we introduce Gated Linear Attention (GLA) for vision, leveraging its superior hardware-awareness and efficiency. We propose direction-wise gating to capture 1D global context through bidirectional modeling and a 2D gating locality injection to adaptively inject 2D local details into 1D global context. Our hardware-aware implementation further merges forward and backward scanning into a single kernel, enhancing parallelism and reducing memory cost and latency. The proposed model, \name{}, offers a favorable trade-off in accuracy, parameters, and FLOPs on ImageNet and downstream tasks, outperforming popular Transformer and CNN-based models. Notably, \name{}-S matches DeiT-B's accuracy while using only 27\% of the parameters and 20\% of the FLOPs, running 2$\times$ faster on $224\times224$ images. At $1024\times1024$ resolution, \name{}-T uses 5.2$\times$ fewer FLOPs, saves 90\% GPU memory, runs 4.8$\times$ faster, and achieves 20.7\% higher top-1 accuracy than DeiT-T. These results position \name{} as an efficient and scalable solution for visual representation learning. Code is available at \url{this https URL}.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models with large-scale pre-training have achieved significant success in the field of visual content generation, particularly exemplified by Diffusion Transformers (DiT). However, DiT models have faced challenges with scalability and quadratic complexity efficiency. In this paper, we aim to leverage the long sequence modeling capability of Gated Linear Attention (GLA) Transformers, expanding its applicability to diffusion models. We introduce Diffusion Gated Linear Attention Transformers (DiG), a simple, adoptable solution with minimal parameter overhead, following the DiT design, but offering superior efficiency and effectiveness. In addition to better performance than DiT, DiG-S/2 exhibits $2.5\times$ higher training speed than DiT-S/2 and saves $75.7\%$ GPU memory at a resolution of $1792 \times 1792$. Moreover, we analyze the scalability of DiG across a variety of computational complexity. DiG models, with increased depth/width or augmentation of input tokens, consistently exhibit decreasing FID. We further compare DiG with other subquadratic-time diffusion models. With the same model size, DiG-XL/2 is $4.2\times$ faster than the recent Mamba-based diffusion model at a $1024$ resolution, and is $1.8\times$ faster than DiT with CUDA-optimized FlashAttention-2 under the $2048$ resolution. All these results demonstrate its superior efficiency among the latest diffusion models. Code is released at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid growth of neural network models shared on the internet has made model weights an important data modality. However, this information is underutilized as the weights are uninterpretable, and publicly available models are disorganized. Inspired by Darwin's tree of life, we define the Model Tree which describes the origin of models i.e., the parent model that was used to fine-tune the target model. Similarly to the natural world, the tree structure is unknown. In this paper, we introduce the task of Model Tree Heritage Recovery (MoTHer Recovery) for discovering Model Trees in the ever-growing universe of neural networks. Our hypothesis is that model weights encode this information, the challenge is to decode the underlying tree structure given the weights. Beyond the immediate application of model authorship attribution, MoTHer recovery holds exciting long-term applications akin to indexing the internet by search engines. Practically, for each pair of models, this task requires: i) determining if they are related, and ii) establishing the direction of the relationship. We find that certain distributional properties of the weights evolve monotonically during training, which enables us to classify the relationship between two given models. MoTHer recovery reconstructs entire model hierarchies, represented by a directed tree, where a parent model gives rise to multiple child models through additional training. Our approach successfully reconstructs complex Model Trees, as well as the structure of "in-the-wild" model families such as Llama 2 and Stable Diffusion.</li>
