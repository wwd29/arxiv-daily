<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Building on the foundations of language modeling in natural language processing, Next Token Prediction (NTP) has evolved into a versatile training objective for machine learning tasks across various modalities, achieving considerable success. As Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced to unify understanding and generation tasks within the textual modality, recent research has shown that tasks from different modalities can also be effectively encapsulated within the NTP framework, transforming the multimodal information into tokens and predict the next one given the context. This survey introduces a comprehensive taxonomy that unifies both understanding and generation within multimodal learning through the lens of NTP. The proposed taxonomy covers five key aspects: Multimodal tokenization, MMNTP model architectures, unified task representation, datasets \& evaluation, and open challenges. This new taxonomy aims to aid researchers in their exploration of multimodal intelligence. An associated GitHub repository collecting the latest papers and repos is available at this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities but also pose risks by learning and generating copyrighted material, leading to significant legal and ethical concerns. In a potential real-world scenario, model owners may need to continuously address copyright infringement in order to address requests for content removal that emerge at different time points. One potential way of addressing this is via sequential unlearning, where copyrighted content is removed sequentially as new requests arise. Despite its practical relevance, sequential unlearning in the context of copyright infringement has not been rigorously explored in existing literature. To address this gap, we propose Stable Sequential Unlearning (SSU), a novel framework designed to unlearn copyrighted content from LLMs over multiple time steps. Our approach works by identifying and removing specific weight updates in the model's parameters that correspond to copyrighted content using task vectors. We improve unlearning efficacy by introducing random labeling loss and ensuring the model retains its general-purpose knowledge by adjusting targeted parameters with gradient-based weight saliency. Extensive experimental results show that SSU sometimes achieves an effective trade-off between unlearning efficacy and general-purpose language abilities, outperforming existing baselines, but it's not a cure-all for unlearning copyrighted material.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved unprecedented performance on many complex tasks, being able, for example, to answer questions on almost any topic. However, they struggle with other simple tasks, such as counting the occurrences of letters in a word, as illustrated by the inability of many LLMs to count the number of "r" letters in "strawberry". Several works have studied this problem and linked it to the tokenization used by LLMs, to the intrinsic limitations of the attention mechanism, or to the lack of character-level training data. In this paper, we conduct an experimental study to evaluate the relations between the LLM errors when counting letters with 1) the frequency of the word and its components in the training dataset and 2) the complexity of the counting operation. We present a comprehensive analysis of the errors of LLMs when counting letter occurrences by evaluating a representative group of models over a large number of words. The results show a number of consistent trends in the models evaluated: 1) models are capable of recognizing the letters but not counting them; 2) the frequency of the word and tokens in the word does not have a significant impact on the LLM errors; 3) there is a positive correlation of letter frequency with errors, more frequent letters tend to have more counting errors, 4) the errors show a strong correlation with the number of letters or tokens in a word and 5) the strongest correlation occurs with the number of letters with counts larger than one, with most models being unable to correctly count words in which letters appear more than twice.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Human reliability analysis (HRA) is crucial for evaluating and improving the safety of complex systems. Recent efforts have focused on estimating human error probability (HEP), but existing methods often rely heavily on expert knowledge,which can be subjective and time-consuming. Inspired by the success of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing, this paper introduces a novel two-stage framework for knowledge-driven reliability analysis, integrating IDHEAS and LLMs (KRAIL). This innovative framework enables the semi-automated computation of base HEP values. Additionally, knowledge graphs are utilized as a form of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for enhancing the framework' s capability to retrieve and process relevant data efficiently. Experiments are systematically conducted and evaluated on authoritative datasets of human reliability. The experimental results of the proposed methodology demonstrate its superior performance on base HEP estimation under partial information for reliability assessment.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Street view imagery (SVI) has been instrumental in many studies in the past decade to understand and characterize street features and the built environment. Researchers across a variety of domains, such as transportation, health, architecture, human perception, and infrastructure have employed different methods to analyze SVI. However, these applications and image-processing procedures have not been standardized, and solutions have been implemented in isolation, often making it difficult for others to reproduce existing work and carry out new research. Using SVI for research requires multiple technical steps: accessing APIs for scalable data collection, preprocessing images to standardize formats, implementing computer vision models for feature extraction, and conducting spatial analysis. These technical requirements create barriers for researchers in urban studies, particularly those without extensive programming experience. We develop ZenSVI, a free and open-source Python package that integrates and implements the entire process of SVI analysis, supporting a wide range of use cases. Its end-to-end pipeline includes downloading SVI from multiple platforms (e.g., Mapillary and KartaView) efficiently, analyzing metadata of SVI, applying computer vision models to extract target features, transforming SVI into different projections (e.g., fish-eye and perspective) and different formats (e.g., depth map and point cloud), visualizing analyses with maps and plots, and exporting outputs to other software tools. We demonstrate its use in Singapore through a case study of data quality assessment and clustering analysis in a streamlined manner. Our software improves the transparency, reproducibility, and scalability of research relying on SVI and supports researchers in conducting urban analyses efficiently. Its modular design facilitates extensions and unlocking new use cases.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GRAG or Graph RAG) architectures aim to enhance language understanding and generation by leveraging external knowledge. However, effectively capturing and integrating the rich semantic information present in textual and structured data remains a challenge. To address this, a novel GRAG framework is proposed to focus on enhancing subgraph representation and diversity within the knowledge graph. By improving graph density, capturing entity and relation information more effectively, and dynamically prioritizing relevant and diverse subgraphs, the proposed approach enables a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying semantic structure. This is achieved through a combination of de-duplication processes, two-step mean pooling of embeddings, query-aware retrieval considering unique nodes, and a Dynamic Similarity-Aware BFS (DSA-BFS) traversal algorithm. Integrating Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) through hard prompting further enhances the learning of rich node and edge representations while preserving the hierarchical subgraph structure. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed GRAG framework, showcasing the significance of enhanced subgraph representation and diversity for improved language understanding and generation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The use of CLIP embeddings to assess the alignment of samples produced by text-to-image generative models has been extensively explored in the literature. While the widely adopted CLIPScore, derived from the cosine similarity of text and image embeddings, effectively measures the relevance of a generated image, it does not quantify the diversity of images generated by a text-to-image model. In this work, we extend the application of CLIP embeddings to quantify and interpret the intrinsic diversity of text-to-image models, which is responsible for generating diverse images from similar text prompts. To achieve this, we propose a decomposition of the CLIP-based kernel covariance matrix of image data into text-based and non-text-based components. Using the Schur complement of the joint image-text kernel covariance matrix, we perform this decomposition and define the matrix-based entropy of the decomposed component as the \textit{Schur Complement Entropy (SCE)} score, a measure of the intrinsic diversity of a text-to-image model based on data collected with varying text prompts. Additionally, we demonstrate the use of the Schur complement-based decomposition to nullify the influence of a given prompt in the CLIP embedding of an image, enabling focus or defocus of embeddings on specific objects or properties for downstream tasks. We present several numerical results that apply our Schur complement-based approach to evaluate text-to-image models and modify CLIP image embeddings. The codebase is available at this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Parameter identifiability refers to the capability of accurately inferring the parameter values of a model from its observations (data). Traditional analysis methods exploit analytical properties of the closed form model, in particular sensitivity analysis, to quantify the response of the model predictions to variations in parameters. Techniques developed to analyze data, specifically manifold learning methods, have the potential to complement, and even extend the scope of the traditional analytical approaches. We report on a study comparing and contrasting analytical and data-driven approaches to quantify parameter identifiability and, importantly, perform parameter reduction tasks. We use the infinite bus synchronous generator model, a well-understood model from the power systems domain, as our benchmark problem. Our traditional analysis methods use the Fisher Information Matrix to quantify parameter identifiability analysis, and the Manifold Boundary Approximation Method to perform parameter reduction. We compare these results to those arrived at through data-driven manifold learning schemes: Output - Diffusion Maps and Geometric Harmonics. For our test case, we find that the two suites of tools (analytical when a model is explicitly available, as well as data-driven when the model is lacking and only measurement data are available) give (correct) comparable results; these results are also in agreement with traditional analysis based on singular perturbation theory. We then discuss the prospects of using data-driven methods for such model analysis.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Hallucination, a persistent challenge plaguing language models, undermines their efficacy and trustworthiness in various natural language processing endeavors by generating responses that deviate from factual accuracy or coherence. This paper addresses language model hallucination by integrating curated knowledge graph (KG) triples to anchor responses in empirical data. We meticulously select and integrate relevant KG triples tailored to specific contexts, enhancing factual grounding and alignment with input. Our contribution involves constructing a comprehensive KG repository from Wikipedia and refining data to spotlight essential information for model training. By imbuing language models with access to this curated knowledge, we aim to generate both linguistically fluent responses and deeply rooted in factual accuracy and context relevance. This integration mitigates hallucinations by providing a robust foundation of information, enabling models to draw upon a rich reservoir of factual data during response generation. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of multiple approaches in reducing hallucinatory responses, underscoring the role of curated knowledge graphs in improving the reliability and trustworthiness of language model outputs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multi-head self-attention (MHSA) is a key component of Transformers, a widely popular architecture in both language and vision. Multiple heads intuitively enable different parallel processes over the same input. Yet, they also obscure the attribution of each input patch to the output of a model. We propose a novel 1-head Transformer Attention Bottleneck (TAB) layer, inserted after the traditional MHSA architecture, to serve as an attention bottleneck for interpretability and intervention. Unlike standard self-attention, TAB constrains the total attention over all patches to $\in [0, 1]$. That is, when the total attention is 0, no visual information is propagated further into the network and the vision-language model (VLM) would default to a generic, image-independent response. To demonstrate the advantages of TAB, we train VLMs with TAB to perform image difference captioning. Over three datasets, our models perform similarly to baseline VLMs in captioning but the bottleneck is superior in localizing changes and in identifying when no changes occur. TAB is the first architecture to enable users to intervene by editing attention, which often produces expected outputs by VLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>An image may convey a thousand words, but a video composed of hundreds or thousands of image frames tells a more intricate story. Despite significant progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), generating extended videos remains a formidable challenge. As of this writing, OpenAI's Sora, the current state-of-the-art system, is still limited to producing videos that are up to one minute in length. This limitation stems from the complexity of long video generation, which requires more than generative AI techniques for approximating density functions essential aspects such as planning, story development, and maintaining spatial and temporal consistency present additional hurdles. Integrating generative AI with a divide-and-conquer approach could improve scalability for longer videos while offering greater control. In this survey, we examine the current landscape of long video generation, covering foundational techniques like GANs and diffusion models, video generation strategies, large-scale training datasets, quality metrics for evaluating long videos, and future research areas to address the limitations of the existing video generation capabilities. We believe it would serve as a comprehensive foundation, offering extensive information to guide future advancements and research in the field of long video generation.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce AgreeMate, a framework for training Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform strategic price negotiations through natural language. We apply recent advances to a negotiation setting where two agents (i.e. buyer or seller) use natural language to bargain on goods using coarse actions. Specifically, we present the performance of Large Language Models when used as agents within a decoupled (modular) bargaining architecture. We demonstrate that using prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and chain-of-thought prompting enhances model performance, as defined by novel metrics. We use attention probing to show model attention to semantic relationships between tokens during negotiations.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Automated red teaming can discover rare model failures and generate challenging examples that can be used for training or evaluation. However, a core challenge in automated red teaming is ensuring that the attacks are both diverse and effective. Prior methods typically succeed in optimizing either for diversity or for effectiveness, but rarely both. In this paper, we provide methods that enable automated red teaming to generate a large number of diverse and successful attacks. Our approach decomposes the task into two steps: (1) automated methods for generating diverse attack goals and (2) generating effective attacks for those goals. While we provide multiple straightforward methods for generating diverse goals, our key contributions are to train an RL attacker that both follows those goals and generates diverse attacks for those goals. First, we demonstrate that it is easy to use a large language model (LLM) to generate diverse attacker goals with per-goal prompts and rewards, including rule-based rewards (RBRs) to grade whether the attacks are successful for the particular goal. Second, we demonstrate how training the attacker model with multi-step RL, where the model is rewarded for generating attacks that are different from past attempts further increases diversity while remaining effective. We use our approach to generate both prompt injection attacks and prompts that elicit unsafe responses. In both cases, we find that our approach is able to generate highly-effective and considerably more diverse attacks than past general red-teaming approaches.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Retrieval from graph data is crucial for augmenting large language models (LLM) with both open-domain knowledge and private enterprise data, and it is also a key component in the recent GraphRAG system (edge et al., 2024). Despite decades of research on knowledge graphs and knowledge base question answering, leading LLM frameworks (e.g. Langchain and LlamaIndex) have only minimal support for retrieval from modern encyclopedic knowledge graphs like Wikidata. In this paper, we analyze the root cause and suggest that modern RDF knowledge graphs (e.g. Wikidata, Freebase) are less efficient for LLMs due to overly large schemas that far exceed the typical LLM context window, use of resource identifiers, overlapping relation types and lack of normalization. As a solution, we propose property graph views on top of the underlying RDF graph that can be efficiently queried by LLMs using Cypher. We instantiated this idea on Wikidata and introduced CypherBench, the first benchmark with 11 large-scale, multi-domain property graphs with 7.8 million entities and over 10,000 questions. To achieve this, we tackled several key challenges, including developing an RDF-to-property graph conversion engine, creating a systematic pipeline for text-to-Cypher task generation, and designing new evaluation metrics.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, robust, steal, explainability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Survival analysis (SA) models have been widely studied in mining electronic health records (EHRs), particularly in forecasting the risk of critical conditions for prioritizing high-risk patients. However, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks is much less explored in the literature. Developing black-box perturbation algorithms and evaluating their impact on state-of-the-art survival models brings two benefits to medical applications. First, it can effectively evaluate the robustness of models in pre-deployment testing. Also, exploring how subtle perturbations would result in significantly different outcomes can provide counterfactual insights into the clinical interpretation of model prediction. In this work, we introduce SurvAttack, a novel black-box adversarial attack framework leveraging subtle clinically compatible, and semantically consistent perturbations on longitudinal EHRs to degrade survival models' predictive performance. We specifically develop a greedy algorithm to manipulate medical codes with various adversarial actions throughout a patient's medical history. Then, these adversarial actions are prioritized using a composite scoring strategy based on multi-aspect perturbation quality, including saliency, perturbation stealthiness, and clinical meaningfulness. The proposed adversarial EHR perturbation algorithm is then used in an efficient SA-specific strategy to attack a survival model when estimating the temporal ranking of survival urgency for patients. To demonstrate the significance of our work, we conduct extensive experiments, including baseline comparisons, explainability analysis, and case studies. The experimental results affirm our research's effectiveness in illustrating the vulnerabilities of patient survival models, model interpretation, and ultimately contributing to healthcare quality.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Mobile Money (MoMo), a technology that allows users to complete digital financial transactions using a mobile phone without requiring a bank account, has become a common method for processing financial transactions in Africa and other developing regions. Operationally, users can deposit (exchange cash for mobile money tokens) and withdraw with the help of human agents who facilitate a near end-to-end process from customer onboarding to authentication and recourse. During deposit and withdraw operations, know-your-customer (KYC) processes require agents to access and verify customer information such as name and ID number, which can introduce privacy and security risks. In this work, we design alternative protocols for mobile money deposits and withdrawals that protect users' privacy while enabling KYC checks. These workflows redirect the flow of sensitive information from the agent to the MoMo provider, thus allowing the agent to facilitate transactions without accessing a customer's personal information. We evaluate the usability and efficiency of our proposed protocols in a role play and semi-structured interview study with 32 users and 15 agents in Kenya. We find that users and agents both generally appear to prefer the new protocols, due in part to convenient and efficient verification using biometrics, better data privacy and access control, as well as better security mechanisms for delegated transactions. Our results also highlight some challenges and limitations that suggest the need for more work to build deployable solutions.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Robust object detection is critical for autonomous driving and mobile robotics, where accurate detection of vehicles, pedestrians, and obstacles is essential for ensuring safety. Despite the advancements in object detection transformers (DETRs), their robustness against adversarial attacks remains underexplored. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of DETR model and its variants under both white-box and black-box adversarial attacks, using the MS-COCO and KITTI datasets to cover general and autonomous driving scenarios. We extend prominent white-box attack methods (FGSM, PGD, and CW) to assess DETR vulnerability, demonstrating that DETR models are significantly susceptible to adversarial attacks, similar to traditional CNN-based detectors. Our extensive transferability analysis reveals high intra-network transferability among DETR variants, but limited cross-network transferability to CNN-based models. Additionally, we propose a novel untargeted attack designed specifically for DETR, exploiting its intermediate loss functions to induce misclassification with minimal perturbations. Visualizations of self-attention feature maps provide insights into how adversarial attacks affect the internal representations of DETR models. These findings reveal critical vulnerabilities in detection transformers under standard adversarial attacks, emphasizing the need for future research to enhance the robustness of transformer-based object detectors in safety-critical applications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Assessing writing in large classes for formal or informal learners presents a significant challenge. Consequently, most large classes, particularly in science, rely on objective assessment tools such as multiple-choice quizzes, which have a single correct answer. The rapid development of AI has introduced the possibility of using large language models (LLMs) to evaluate student writing. An experiment was conducted using GPT-4 to determine if machine learning methods based on LLMs can match or exceed the reliability of instructor grading in evaluating short writing assignments on topics in astronomy. The audience consisted of adult learners in three massive open online courses (MOOCs) offered through Coursera. One course was on astronomy, the second was on astrobiology, and the third was on the history and philosophy of astronomy. The results should also be applicable to non-science majors in university settings, where the content and modes of evaluation are similar. The data comprised answers from 120 students to 12 questions across the three courses. GPT-4 was provided with total grades, model answers, and rubrics from an instructor for all three courses. In addition to evaluating how reliably the LLM reproduced instructor grades, the LLM was also tasked with generating its own rubrics. Overall, the LLM was more reliable than peer grading, both in aggregate and by individual student, and approximately matched instructor grades for all three online courses. The implication is that LLMs may soon be used for automated, reliable, and scalable grading of student science writing.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This study proposes a large language model optimization method based on the improved LoRA fine-tuning algorithm, aiming to improve the accuracy and computational efficiency of the model in natural language processing tasks. We fine-tune the large language model through a low-rank adaptation strategy, which significantly reduces the consumption of computing resources while maintaining the powerful capabilities of the pre-trained model. The experiment uses the QQP task as the evaluation scenario. The results show that the improved LoRA algorithm shows significant improvements in accuracy, F1 score, and MCC compared with traditional models such as BERT, Roberta, T5, and GPT-4. In particular, in terms of F1 score and MCC, our model shows stronger robustness and discrimination ability, which proves the potential of the improved LoRA algorithm in fine-tuning large-scale pre-trained models. In addition, this paper also discusses the application prospects of the improved LoRA algorithm in other natural language processing tasks, emphasizing its advantages in multi-task learning and scenarios with limited computing resources. Future research can further optimize the LoRA fine-tuning strategy and expand its application in larger-scale pre-trained models to improve the generalization ability and task adaptability of the model.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion-based generative models have become the standard for image generation. ODE-based samplers and flow matching models improve efficiency, in comparison to diffusion models, by reducing sampling steps through learned vector fields. However, the theoretical foundations of flow matching models remain limited, particularly regarding the convergence of individual sample trajectories at terminal time - a critical property that impacts sample quality and being critical assumption for models like the consistency model. In this paper, we advance the theory of flow matching models through a comprehensive analysis of sample trajectories, centered on the denoiser that drives ODE dynamics. We establish the existence, uniqueness and convergence of ODE trajectories at terminal time, ensuring stable sampling outcomes under minimal assumptions. Our analysis reveals how trajectories evolve from capturing global data features to local structures, providing the geometric characterization of per-sample behavior in flow matching models. We also explain the memorization phenomenon in diffusion-based training through our terminal time analysis. These findings bridge critical gaps in understanding flow matching models, with practical implications for sampling stability and model design.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Creating fully annotated labels for medical image segmentation is prohibitively time-intensive and costly, emphasizing the necessity for innovative approaches that minimize reliance on detailed annotations. Scribble annotations offer a more cost-effective alternative, significantly reducing the expenses associated with full annotations. However, scribble annotations offer limited and imprecise information, failing to capture the detailed structural and boundary characteristics necessary for accurate organ delineation. To address these challenges, we propose HELPNet, a novel scribble-based weakly supervised segmentation framework, designed to bridge the gap between annotation efficiency and segmentation performance. HELPNet integrates three modules. The Hierarchical perturbations consistency (HPC) module enhances feature learning by employing density-controlled jigsaw perturbations across global, local, and focal views, enabling robust modeling of multi-scale structural representations. Building on this, the Entropy-guided pseudo-label (EGPL) module evaluates the confidence of segmentation predictions using entropy, generating high-quality pseudo-labels. Finally, the structural prior refinement (SPR) module incorporates connectivity and bounded priors to enhance the precision and reliability and pseudo-labels. Experimental results on three public datasets ACDC, MSCMRseg, and CHAOS show that HELPNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for scribble-based weakly supervised segmentation and achieves performance comparable to fully supervised methods.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In recent years, it has been shown empirically that standard disentangled latent variable models do not support robust compositional learning in the visual domain. Indeed, in spite of being designed with the goal of factorising datasets into their constituent factors of variations, disentangled models show extremely limited compositional generalisation capabilities. On the other hand, object-centric architectures have shown promising compositional skills, albeit these have 1) not been extensively tested and 2) experiments have been limited to scene composition -- where models must generalise to novel combinations of objects in a visual scene instead of novel combinations of object properties. In this work, we show that these compositional generalisation skills extend to this later setting. Furthermore, we present evidence pointing to the source of these skills and how they can be improved through careful training. Finally, we point to one important limitation that still exists which suggests new directions of research.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Group Re-identification (G-ReID) faces greater complexity than individual Re-identification (ReID) due to challenges like mutual occlusion, dynamic member interactions, and evolving group structures. Prior graph-based approaches have aimed to capture these dynamics by modeling the group as a single topological structure. However, these methods struggle to generalize across diverse group compositions, as they fail to fully represent the multifaceted relationships within the group. In this study, we introduce a Hierarchical Multi-Graphs Learning (HMGL) framework to address these challenges. Our approach models the group as a collection of multi-relational graphs, leveraging both explicit features (such as occlusion, appearance, and foreground information) and implicit dependencies between members. This hierarchical representation, encoded via a Multi-Graphs Neural Network (MGNN), allows us to resolve ambiguities in member relationships, particularly in complex, densely populated scenes. To further enhance matching accuracy, we propose a Multi-Scale Matching (MSM) algorithm, which mitigates issues of member information ambiguity and sensitivity to hard samples, improving robustness in challenging scenarios. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on two standard benchmarks, CSG and RoadGroup, with Rank-1/mAP scores of 95.3%/94.4% and 93.9%/95.4%, respectively. These results mark notable improvements of 1.7% and 2.5% in Rank-1 accuracy over existing approaches.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present a novel method that extends the self-attention mechanism of a vision transformer (ViT) for more accurate object detection across diverse datasets. ViTs show strong capability for image understanding tasks such as object detection, segmentation, and classification. This is due in part to their ability to leverage global information from interactions among visual tokens. However, the self-attention mechanism in ViTs are limited because they do not allow visual tokens to exchange local or global information with neighboring features before computing global attention. This is problematic because tokens are treated in isolation when attending (matching) to other tokens, and valuable spatial relationships are overlooked. This isolation is further compounded by dot-product similarity operations that make tokens from different semantic classes appear visually similar. To address these limitations, we introduce two modifications to the traditional self-attention framework; a novel aggressive convolution pooling strategy for local feature mixing, and a new conceptual attention transformation to facilitate interaction and feature exchange between semantic concepts. Experimental results demonstrate that local and global information exchange among visual features before self-attention significantly improves performance on challenging object detection tasks and generalizes across multiple benchmark datasets and challenging medical datasets. We publish source code and a novel dataset of cancerous tumors (chimeric cell clusters).</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Efficiently exploring complex loss landscapes is key to the performance of deep neural networks. While momentum-based optimizers are widely used in state-of-the-art setups, classical momentum can still struggle with large, misaligned gradients, leading to oscillations. To address this, we propose Torque-Aware Momentum (TAM), which introduces a damping factor based on the angle between the new gradients and previous momentum, stabilizing the update direction during training. Empirical results show that TAM, which can be combined with both SGD and Adam, enhances exploration, handles distribution shifts more effectively, and improves generalization performance across various tasks, including image classification and large language model fine-tuning, when compared to classical momentum-based optimizers.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Person image synthesis with controllable body poses and appearances is an essential task owing to the practical needs in the context of virtual try-on, image editing and video production. However, existing methods face significant challenges with details missing, limbs distortion and the garment style deviation. To address these issues, we propose a Disentangled Representations Diffusion Model (DRDM) to generate photo-realistic images from source portraits in specific desired poses and appearances. First, a pose encoder is responsible for encoding pose features into a high-dimensional space to guide the generation of person images. Second, a body-part subspace decoupling block (BSDB) disentangles features from the different body parts of a source figure and feeds them to the various layers of the noise prediction block, thereby supplying the network with rich disentangled features for generating a realistic target image. Moreover, during inference, we develop a parsing map-based disentangled classifier-free guided sampling method, which amplifies the conditional signals of texture and pose. Extensive experimental results on the Deepfashion dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving pose transfer and appearance control.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In long-term time series forecasting, Transformer-based models have achieved great success, due to its ability to capture long-range dependencies. However, existing transformer-based methods face challenges in accurately identifying which variables play a pivotal role in the prediction process and tend to overemphasize noisy channels, thereby limiting the interpretability and practical effectiveness of the models. Besides, it faces scalability issues due to quadratic computational complexity of self-attention. In this paper, we propose a new model named Inverted Seasonal-Trend Decomposition Transformer (Ister), which addresses these challenges in long-term multivariate time series forecasting by designing an improved Transformer-based structure. Ister firstly decomposes original time series into seasonal and trend components. Then we propose a new Dot-attention mechanism to process the seasonal component, which improves both accuracy, computation complexity and interpretability. Upon completion of the training phase, it allows users to intuitively visualize the significance of each feature in the overall prediction. We conduct comprehensive experiments, and the results show that Ister achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on multiple datasets, surpassing existing models in long-term prediction tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Open-domain Question Answering (QA) has garnered substantial interest by combining the advantages of faithfully retrieved passages and relevant passages generated through Large Language Models (LLMs). However, there is a lack of definitive labels available to pair these sources of knowledge. In order to address this issue, we propose an unsupervised and simple framework called Bi-Reranking for Merging Generated and Retrieved Knowledge (BRMGR), which utilizes re-ranking methods for both retrieved passages and LLM-generated passages. We pair the two types of passages using two separate re-ranking methods and then combine them through greedy matching. We demonstrate that BRMGR is equivalent to employing a bipartite matching loss when assigning each retrieved passage with a corresponding LLM-generated passage. The application of our model yielded experimental results from three datasets, improving their performance by +1.7 and +1.6 on NQ and WebQ datasets, respectively, and obtaining comparable result on TriviaQA dataset when compared to competitive baselines.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While Diffusion Models (DM) exhibit remarkable performance across various image generative tasks, they nonetheless reflect the inherent bias presented in the training set. As DMs are now widely used in real-world applications, these biases could perpetuate a distorted worldview and hinder opportunities for minority groups. Existing methods on debiasing DMs usually requires model re-training with a human-crafted reference dataset or additional classifiers, which suffer from two major limitations: (1) collecting reference datasets causes expensive annotation cost; (2) the debiasing performance is heavily constrained by the quality of the reference dataset or the additional classifier. To address the above limitations, we propose DebiasDiff, a plug-and-play method that learns attribute latent directions in a self-discovering manner, thus eliminating the reliance on such reference dataset. Specifically, DebiasDiff consists of two parts: a set of attribute adapters and a distribution indicator. Each adapter in the set aims to learn an attribute latent direction, and is optimized via noise composition through a self-discovering process. Then, the distribution indicator is multiplied by the set of adapters to guide the generation process towards the prescribed distribution. Our method enables debiasing multiple attributes in DMs simultaneously, while remaining lightweight and easily integrable with other DMs, eliminating the need for re-training. Extensive experiments on debiasing gender, racial, and their intersectional biases show that our method outperforms previous SOTA by a large margin.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) based on the Transformer architecture usually have their context length limited due to the high training cost. Recent advancements extend the context window by adjusting the scaling factors of RoPE and fine-tuning. However, suboptimal initialization of these factors results in increased fine-tuning costs and reduced performance at target length. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative RoPE-based fine-tuning framework that diverges from conventional scaling factors search. Specifically, we present a Divide-and-Conquer Incremental Search (DCIS) algorithm that strategically determines the better scaling factors. Further fine-tuning with the identified scaling factors effectively extends the context window of LLMs. Empirical results demonstrate that our methodology not only mitigates performance decay at extended target lengths but also allows the model to fine-tune on short contexts and generalize to long contexts, thereby reducing the cost of fine-tuning. The scaling factors obtained through DCIS can even perform effectively without fine-tuning. Further analysis of the search space reveals that DCIS achieves twice the search efficiency compared to other methods. We also examine the impact of the non-strictly increasing scaling factors utilized in DCIS and evaluate the general capabilities of LLMs across various context lengths.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, robust, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep learning-based object detection has become ubiquitous in the last decade due to its high accuracy in many real-world applications. With this growing trend, these models are interested in being attacked by adversaries, with most of the results being on classifiers, which do not match the context of practical object detection. In this work, we propose a novel method to fool object detectors, expose the vulnerability of state-of-the-art detectors, and promote later works to build more robust detectors to adversarial examples. Our method aims to generate adversarial images by perturbing object confidence scores during training, which is crucial in predicting confidence for each class in the testing phase. Herein, we provide a more intuitive technique to embed additive noises based on detected objects' masks and the training loss with distortion control over the original image by leveraging the gradient of iterative images. To verify the proposed method, we perform adversarial attacks against different object detectors, including the most recent state-of-the-art models like YOLOv8, Faster R-CNN, RetinaNet, and Swin Transformer. We also evaluate our technique on MS COCO 2017 and PASCAL VOC 2012 datasets and analyze the trade-off between success attack rate and image distortion. Our experiments show that the achievable success attack rate is up to $100$\% and up to $98$\% when performing white-box and black-box attacks, respectively.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Trajectory anomaly detection, aiming to estimate the anomaly risk of trajectories given the Source-Destination (SD) pairs, has become a critical problem for many real-world applications. Existing solutions directly train a generative model for observed trajectories and calculate the conditional generative probability $P({T}|{C})$ as the anomaly risk, where ${T}$ and ${C}$ represent the trajectory and SD pair respectively. However, we argue that the observed trajectories are confounded by road network preference which is a common cause of both SD distribution and trajectories. Existing methods ignore this issue limiting their generalization ability on out-of-distribution trajectories. In this paper, we define the debiased trajectory anomaly detection problem and propose a causal implicit generative model, namely CausalTAD, to solve it. CausalTAD adopts do-calculus to eliminate the confounding bias of road network preference and estimates $P({T}|do({C}))$ as the anomaly criterion. Extensive experiments show that CausalTAD can not only achieve superior performance on trained trajectories but also generally improve the performance of out-of-distribution data, with improvements of $2.1\% \sim 5.7\%$ and $10.6\% \sim 32.7\%$ respectively.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made remarkable progress in vision-language reasoning, they are also more susceptible to producing harmful content compared to models that focus solely on text. Existing defensive prompting techniques rely on a static, unified safety guideline that fails to account for the specific risks inherent in different multimodal contexts. To address these limitations, we propose RapGuard, a novel framework that uses multimodal chain-of-thought reasoning to dynamically generate scenario-specific safety prompts. RapGuard enhances safety by adapting its prompts to the unique risks of each input, effectively mitigating harmful outputs while maintaining high performance on benign tasks. Our experimental results across multiple MLLM benchmarks demonstrate that RapGuard achieves state-of-the-art safety performance, significantly reducing harmful content without degrading the quality of responses.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recently, in the area of Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) applications, Wu et al. proposed an authentication and key establishment scheme and claimed their protocol is secure. Nevertheless, cryptanalysis shows the scheme fails to provide robustness against key computation attack, mobile user impersonation attack and traceability attack. Vulnerabilities in their scheme lead to the exposure of mobile users' long term secret to mobile edge server provided both parties complete a successful session. This enables any malicious edge servers, who had communicated with the user earlier, to compute current session keys between the user and other legitimate servers. Also, since long term secret is exposed, such malicious servers can impersonate the user. We present a cryptanalysis of the scheme.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, federate, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In medical imaging, developing generalized segmentation models that can handle multiple organs and lesions is crucial. However, the scarcity of fully annotated datasets and strict privacy regulations present significant barriers to data sharing. Federated Learning (FL) allows decentralized model training, but existing FL methods often struggle with partial labeling, leading to model divergence and catastrophic forgetting. We propose ConDistFL, a novel FL framework incorporating conditional distillation to address these challenges. ConDistFL enables effective learning from partially labeled datasets, significantly improving segmentation accuracy across distributed and non-uniform datasets. In addition to its superior segmentation performance, ConDistFL maintains computational and communication efficiency, ensuring its scalability for real-world applications. Furthermore, ConDistFL demonstrates remarkable generalizability, significantly outperforming existing FL methods in out-of-federation tests, even adapting to unseen contrast phases (e.g., non-contrast CT images) in our experiments. Extensive evaluations on 3D CT and 2D chest X-ray datasets show that ConDistFL is an efficient, adaptable solution for collaborative medical image segmentation in privacy-constrained settings.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Fine-grained clustering is a practical yet challenging task, whose essence lies in capturing the subtle differences between instances of different classes. Such subtle differences can be easily disrupted by data augmentation or be overwhelmed by redundant information in data, leading to significant performance degradation for existing clustering methods. In this work, we introduce DiFiC a fine-grained clustering method building upon the conditional diffusion model. Distinct from existing works that focus on extracting discriminative features from images, DiFiC resorts to deducing the textual conditions used for image generation. To distill more precise and clustering-favorable object semantics, DiFiC further regularizes the diffusion target and guides the distillation process utilizing neighborhood similarity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiFiC outperforms both state-of-the-art discriminative and generative clustering methods on four fine-grained image clustering benchmarks. We hope the success of DiFiC will inspire future research to unlock the potential of diffusion models in tasks beyond generation. The code will be released.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>defense, attack, interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Transferable adversarial examples are known to cause threats in practical, black-box attack scenarios. A notable approach to improving transferability is using integrated gradients (IG), originally developed for model interpretability. In this paper, we find that existing IG-based attacks have limited transferability due to their naive adoption of IG in model interpretability. To address this limitation, we focus on the IG integration path and refine it in three aspects: multiplicity, monotonicity, and diversity, supported by theoretical analyses. We propose the Multiple Monotonic Diversified Integrated Gradients (MuMoDIG) attack, which can generate highly transferable adversarial examples on different CNN and ViT models and defenses. Experiments validate that MuMoDIG outperforms the latest IG-based attack by up to 37.3\% and other state-of-the-art attacks by 8.4\%. In general, our study reveals that migrating established techniques to improve transferability may require non-trivial efforts. Code is available at \url{this https URL}.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated Graph Learning (FGL) has demonstrated the advantage of training a global Graph Neural Network (GNN) model across distributed clients using their local graph data. Unlike Euclidean data (\eg, images), graph data is composed of nodes and edges, where the overall node-edge connections determine the topological structure, and individual nodes along with their neighbors capture local node features. However, existing studies tend to prioritize one aspect over the other, leading to an incomplete understanding of the data and the potential misidentification of key characteristics across varying graph scenarios. Additionally, the non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) nature of graph data makes the extraction of these two data characteristics even more challenging. To address the above issues, we propose a novel FGL framework, named FedGCF, which aims to simultaneously extract and fuse structural properties and node features to effectively handle diverse graph scenarios. FedGCF first clusters clients by structural similarity, performing model aggregation within each cluster to form the shared structural model. Next, FedGCF selects the clients with common node features and aggregates their models to generate a common node model. This model is then propagated to all clients, allowing common node features to be shared. By combining these two models with a proper ratio, FedGCF can achieve a comprehensive understanding of the graph data and deliver better performance, even under non-IID distributions. Experimental results show that FedGCF improves accuracy by 4.94%-7.24% under different data distributions and reduces communication cost by 64.18%-81.25% to reach the same accuracy compared to baselines.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While existing recognition approaches excel at identifying current surgical phases, they provide limited foresight into future procedural steps, restricting their intraoperative utility. Similarly, current anticipation methods are constrained to predicting short-term events or singular future occurrences, neglecting the dynamic and sequential nature of surgical workflows. To address these limitations, we propose SWAG (Surgical Workflow Anticipative Generation), a unified framework for phase recognition and long-term anticipation of surgical workflows. SWAG employs two generative decoding methods -- single-pass (SP) and auto-regressive (AR) -- to predict sequences of future surgical phases. A novel prior knowledge embedding mechanism enhances the accuracy of anticipatory predictions. The framework addresses future phase classification and remaining time regression tasks. Additionally, a regression-to-classification (R2C) method is introduced to map continuous predictions to discrete temporal segments. SWAG's performance was evaluated on the Cholec80 and AutoLaparo21 datasets. The single-pass classification model with prior knowledge embeddings (SWAG-SP\*) achieved 53.5\% accuracy in 15-minute anticipation on AutoLaparo21, while the R2C model reached 60.8\% accuracy on Cholec80. SWAG's single-pass regression approach outperformed existing methods for remaining time prediction, achieving weighted mean absolute errors of 0.32 and 0.48 minutes for 2- and 3-minute horizons, respectively. SWAG demonstrates versatility across classification and regression tasks, offering robust tools for real-time surgical workflow anticipation. By unifying recognition and anticipatory capabilities, SWAG provides actionable predictions to enhance intraoperative decision-making.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Numerous studies have explored image-based automated systems for plant disease diagnosis, demonstrating impressive diagnostic capabilities. However, recent large-scale analyses have revealed a critical limitation: that the diagnostic capability suffers significantly when validated on images captured in environments (domains) differing from those used during training. This shortfall stems from the inherently limited dataset size and the diverse manifestation of disease symptoms, combined with substantial variations in cultivation environments and imaging conditions, such as equipment and composition. These factors lead to insufficient variety in training data, ultimately constraining the system's robustness and generalization. To address these challenges, we propose Few-shot Metric Domain Adaptation (FMDA), a flexible and effective approach for enhancing diagnostic accuracy in practical systems, even when only limited target data is available. FMDA reduces domain discrepancies by introducing a constraint to the diagnostic model that minimizes the "distance" between feature spaces of source (training) data and target data with limited samples. FMDA is computationally efficient, requiring only basic feature distance calculations and backpropagation, and can be seamlessly integrated into any machine learning (ML) pipeline. In large-scale experiments, involving 223,015 leaf images across 20 fields and 3 crop species, FMDA achieved F1 score improvements of 11.1 to 29.3 points compared to cases without target data, using only 10 images per disease from the target domain. Moreover, FMDA consistently outperformed fine-tuning methods utilizing the same data, with an average improvement of 8.5 points.</li>

This study investigates whether multilingual LLMs, such as GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4o-mini, Llama 3.1, and MistralNeMo, reflect culturally specific moral values or impose dominant moral norms, particularly those rooted in English. Using the updated Moral Foundations Questionnaire (MFQ-2) in eight languages, Arabic, Farsi, English, Spanish, Japanese, Chinese, French, and Russian, the study analyzes the models' adherence to six core moral foundations: care, equality, proportionality, loyalty, authority, and purity. The results reveal significant cultural and linguistic variability, challenging the assumption of universal moral consistency in LLMs. Although some models demonstrate adaptability to diverse contexts, others exhibit biases influenced by the composition of the training data. These findings underscore the need for culturally inclusive model development to improve fairness and trust in multilingual AI systems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Due to the density inconsistency and distribution difference between cross-source point clouds, previous methods fail in cross-source point cloud registration. We propose a density-robust feature extraction and matching scheme to achieve robust and accurate cross-source registration. To address the density inconsistency between cross-source data, we introduce a density-robust encoder for extracting density-robust features. To tackle the issue of challenging feature matching and few correct correspondences, we adopt a loose-to-strict matching pipeline with a ``loose generation, strict selection'' idea. Under it, we employ a one-to-many strategy to loosely generate initial correspondences. Subsequently, high-quality correspondences are strictly selected to achieve robust registration through sparse matching and dense matching. On the challenging Kinect-LiDAR scene in the cross-source 3DCSR dataset, our method improves feature matching recall by 63.5 percentage points (pp) and registration recall by 57.6 pp. It also achieves the best performance on 3DMatch, while maintaining robustness under diverse downsampling densities.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Person re-identification (ReID) models often struggle to generalize across diverse cultural contexts, particularly in Islamic regions like Iran, where modest clothing styles are prevalent. Existing datasets predominantly feature Western and East Asian fashion, limiting their applicability in these settings. To address this gap, we introduce IUST_PersonReId, a dataset designed to reflect the unique challenges of ReID in new cultural environments, emphasizing modest attire and diverse scenarios from Iran, including markets, campuses, and mosques. Experiments on IUST_PersonReId with state-of-the-art models, such as Solider and CLIP-ReID, reveal significant performance drops compared to benchmarks like Market1501 and MSMT17, highlighting the challenges posed by occlusion and limited distinctive features. Sequence-based evaluations show improvements by leveraging temporal context, emphasizing the dataset's potential for advancing culturally sensitive and robust ReID systems. IUST_PersonReId offers a critical resource for addressing fairness and bias in ReID research globally. The dataset is publicly available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Despite impressive capability in learning over graph-structured data, graph neural networks (GNN) suffer from adversarial topology perturbation in both training and inference phases. While adversarial training has demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in image classification tasks, its suitability for GNN models has been doubted until a recent advance that shifts the focus from transductive to inductive learning. Still, GNN robustness in the inductive setting is under-explored, and it calls for deeper understanding of GNN adversarial training. To this end, we propose a new concept of graph subspace energy (GSE) -- a generalization of graph energy that measures graph stability -- of the adjacency matrix, as an indicator of GNN robustness against topology perturbations. To further demonstrate the effectiveness of such concept, we propose an adversarial training method with the perturbed graphs generated by maximizing the GSE regularization term, referred to as AT-GSE. To deal with the local and global topology perturbations raised respectively by LRBCD and PRBCD, we employ randomized SVD (RndSVD) and Nystrom low-rank approximation to favor the different aspects of the GSE terms. An extensive set of experiments shows that AT-GSE outperforms consistently the state-of-the-art GNN adversarial training methods over different homophily and heterophily datasets in terms of adversarial accuracy, whilst more surprisingly achieving a superior clean accuracy on non-perturbed graphs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated learning (FL) is a promising technology for data privacy and distributed optimization, but it suffers from data imbalance and heterogeneity among clients. Existing FL methods try to solve the problems by aligning client with server model or by correcting client model with control variables. These methods excel on IID and general Non-IID data but perform mediocrely in Simpson's Paradox scenarios. Simpson's Paradox refers to the phenomenon that the trend observed on the global dataset disappears or reverses on a subset, which may lead to the fact that global model obtained through aggregation in FL does not accurately reflect the distribution of global data. Thus, we propose FedCFA, a novel FL framework employing counterfactual learning to generate counterfactual samples by replacing local data critical factors with global average data, aligning local data distributions with the global and mitigating Simpson's Paradox effects. In addition, to improve the quality of counterfactual samples, we introduce factor decorrelation (FDC) loss to reduce the correlation among features and thus improve the independence of extracted factors. We conduct extensive experiments on six datasets and verify that our method outperforms other FL methods in terms of efficiency and global model accuracy under limited communication rounds.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have become the dominant methods in image and video generation yet still suffer substantial computational costs. As an effective approach for DiT acceleration, feature caching methods are designed to cache the features of DiT in previous timesteps and reuse them in the next timesteps, allowing us to skip the computation in the next timesteps. However, on the one hand, aggressively reusing all the features cached in previous timesteps leads to a severe drop in generation quality. On the other hand, conservatively caching only the features in the redundant layers or tokens but still computing the important ones successfully preserves the generation quality but results in reductions in acceleration ratios. Observing such a tradeoff between generation quality and acceleration performance, this paper begins by quantitatively studying the accumulated error from cached features. Surprisingly, we find that aggressive caching does not introduce significantly more caching errors in the caching step, and the conservative feature caching can fix the error introduced by aggressive caching. Thereby, we propose a dual caching strategy that adopts aggressive and conservative caching iteratively, leading to significant acceleration and high generation quality at the same time. Besides, we further introduce a V-caching strategy for token-wise conservative caching, which is compatible with flash attention and requires no training and calibration data.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Open-vocabulary panoptic segmentation remains a challenging problem. One of the biggest difficulties lies in training models to generalize to an unlimited number of classes using limited categorized training data. Recent popular methods involve large-scale vision-language pre-trained foundation models, such as CLIP. In this paper, we propose OMTSeg for open-vocabulary segmentation using another large-scale vision-language pre-trained model called BEiT-3 and leveraging the cross-modal attention between visual and linguistic features in BEiT-3 to achieve better performance. Experiments result demonstrates that OMTSeg performs favorably against state-of-the-art models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is a common sleep disorder caused by upper airway blockage, leading to oxygen deprivation and disrupted sleep. Traditional diagnosis using polysomnography (PSG) is expensive, time-consuming, and uncomfortable. Existing deep learning methods using facial image analysis lack accuracy due to poor facial feature capture and limited sample sizes. To address this, we propose a multimodal dual encoder model that integrates visual and language inputs for automated OSAHS diagnosis. The model balances data using randomOverSampler, extracts key facial features with attention grids, and converts physiological data into meaningful text. Cross-attention combines image and text data for better feature extraction, and ordered regression loss ensures stable learning. Our approach improves diagnostic efficiency and accuracy, achieving 91.3% top-1 accuracy in a four-class severity classification task, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The breakthrough of OpenAI o1 highlights the potential of enhancing reasoning to improve LLM. Yet, most research in reasoning has focused on mathematical tasks, leaving domains like medicine underexplored. The medical domain, though distinct from mathematics, also demands robust reasoning to provide reliable answers, given the high standards of healthcare. However, verifying medical reasoning is challenging, unlike those in mathematics. To address this, we propose verifiable medical problems with a medical verifier to check the correctness of model outputs. This verifiable nature enables advancements in medical reasoning through a two-stage approach: (1) using the verifier to guide the search for a complex reasoning trajectory for fine-tuning LLMs, (2) applying reinforcement learning (RL) with verifier-based rewards to enhance complex reasoning further. Finally, we introduce HuatuoGPT-o1, a medical LLM capable of complex reasoning, which outperforms general and medical-specific baselines using only 40K verifiable problems. Experiments show complex reasoning improves medical problem-solving and benefits more from RL. We hope our approach inspires advancements in reasoning across medical and other specialized domains.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose Exemplar-Condensed federated class-incremental learning (ECoral) to distil the training characteristics of real images from streaming data into informative rehearsal exemplars. The proposed method eliminates the limitations of exemplar selection in replay-based approaches for mitigating catastrophic forgetting in federated continual learning (FCL). The limitations particularly related to the heterogeneity of information density of each summarized data. Our approach maintains the consistency of training gradients and the relationship to past tasks for the summarized exemplars to represent the streaming data compared to the original images effectively. Additionally, our approach reduces the information-level heterogeneity of the summarized data by inter-client sharing of the disentanglement generative model. Extensive experiments show that our ECoral outperforms several state-of-the-art methods and can be seamlessly integrated with many existing approaches to enhance performance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recently, text-to-image generation models have achieved remarkable advancements, particularly with diffusion models facilitating high-quality image synthesis from textual descriptions. However, these models often struggle with achieving precise control over pixel-level layouts, object appearances, and global styles when using text prompts alone. To mitigate this issue, previous works introduce conditional images as auxiliary inputs for image generation, enhancing control but typically necessitating specialized models tailored to different types of reference inputs. In this paper, we explore a new approach to unify controllable generation within a single framework. Specifically, we propose the unified image-instruction adapter (UNIC-Adapter) built on the Multi-Modal-Diffusion Transformer architecture, to enable flexible and controllable generation across diverse conditions without the need for multiple specialized models. Our UNIC-Adapter effectively extracts multi-modal instruction information by incorporating both conditional images and task instructions, injecting this information into the image generation process through a cross-attention mechanism enhanced by Rotary Position Embedding. Experimental results across a variety of tasks, including pixel-level spatial control, subject-driven image generation, and style-image-based image synthesis, demonstrate the effectiveness of our UNIC-Adapter in unified controllable image generation.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The proliferation of malware variants poses a significant challenges to traditional malware detection approaches, such as signature-based methods, necessitating the development of advanced machine learning techniques. In this research, we present a novel approach based on a hybrid architecture combining features extracted using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM), with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) then used for malware classification. Inspired by the strong results in previous work using an HMM-Random Forest model, we propose integrating HMMs, which serve to capture sequential patterns in opcode sequences, with CNNs, which are adept at extracting hierarchical features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the popular Malicia dataset, and we obtain superior performance, as compared to other machine learning methods -- our results surpass the aforementioned HMM-Random Forest model. Our findings underscore the potential of hybrid HMM-CNN architectures in bolstering malware classification capabilities, offering several promising avenues for further research in the field of cybersecurity.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Due to the high resource demands of Large Language Models (LLMs), achieving widespread deployment on consumer-grade devices presents significant challenges. Typically, personal or consumer-grade devices, including servers configured prior to the era of large-scale models, generally have relatively weak GPUs and relatively strong CPUs. However, most current methods primarily depend on GPUs for computation. Therefore, we propose Dovetail, an approach that deploys the draft model on the GPU to generate draft tokens while allowing the target model to perform parallel verification on the CPU, thereby improving the utilization of all available hardware resources and occupying less inter-device communication bandwidth. Accordingly, we have redesigned the draft model to better align with heterogeneous hardware characteristics. To this end, we implemented several optimizations: reducing the number of draft tokens to mitigate latency in parallel verification, increasing the depth of the draft model to enhance its predictive capacity, and introducing DGF (Dynamic Gating Fusion) to improve the integration of features and token embeddings. In the HumanEval benchmark, Dovetail achieved an inference speed of 5.86 tokens per second for LLaMA2-Chat-7B using 3GB of VRAM, representing an approximately 2.77x improvement over CPU-only inference. Furthermore, the inference speed was increased to 8 tokens per second when utilizing 7GB of VRAM.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion-based stylization methods typically denoise from a specific partial noise state for image-to-image and video-to-video tasks. This multi-step diffusion process is computationally expensive and hinders real-world application. A promising solution to speed up the process is to obtain few-step consistency models through trajectory distillation. However, current consistency models only force the initial-step alignment between the probability flow ODE (PF-ODE) trajectories of the student and the imperfect teacher models. This training strategy can not ensure the consistency of whole trajectories. To address this issue, we propose single trajectory distillation (STD) starting from a specific partial noise state. We introduce a trajectory bank to store the teacher model's trajectory states, mitigating the time cost during training. Besides, we use an asymmetric adversarial loss to enhance the style and quality of the generated images. Extensive experiments on image and video stylization demonstrate that our method surpasses existing acceleration models in terms of style similarity and aesthetic evaluations.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Medical Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated potential in healthcare applications, yet their propensity for hallucinations -- generating medically implausible or inaccurate information -- presents substantial risks to patient care. This paper introduces MedHallBench, a comprehensive benchmark framework for evaluating and mitigating hallucinations in MLLMs. Our methodology integrates expert-validated medical case scenarios with established medical databases to create a robust evaluation dataset. The framework employs a sophisticated measurement system that combines automated ACHMI (Automatic Caption Hallucination Measurement in Medical Imaging) scoring with rigorous clinical expert evaluations and utilizes reinforcement learning methods to achieve automatic annotation. Through an optimized reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) training pipeline specifically designed for medical applications, MedHallBench enables thorough evaluation of MLLMs across diverse clinical contexts while maintaining stringent accuracy standards. We conducted comparative experiments involving various models, utilizing the benchmark to establish a baseline for widely adopted large language models (LLMs). Our findings indicate that ACHMI provides a more nuanced understanding of the effects of hallucinations compared to traditional metrics, thereby highlighting its advantages in hallucination assessment. This research establishes a foundational framework for enhancing MLLMs' reliability in healthcare settings and presents actionable strategies for addressing the critical challenge of AI hallucinations in medical applications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Understanding road topology is crucial for autonomous driving. This paper introduces TopoBDA (Topology with Bezier Deformable Attention), a novel approach that enhances road topology understanding by leveraging Bezier Deformable Attention (BDA). BDA utilizes Bezier control points to drive the deformable attention mechanism, significantly improving the detection and representation of elongated and thin polyline structures, such as lane centerlines. TopoBDA processes multi-camera 360-degree imagery to generate Bird's Eye View (BEV) features, which are refined through a transformer decoder employing BDA. This method enhances computational efficiency while maintaining high accuracy in centerline prediction. Additionally, TopoBDA incorporates an instance mask formulation and an auxiliary one-to-many set prediction loss strategy to further refine centerline detection and improve road topology understanding. Experimental evaluations on the OpenLane-V2 dataset demonstrate that TopoBDA outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results in centerline detection and topology reasoning. The integration of multi-modal data, including lidar and radar, specifically for road topology understanding, further enhances the model's performance, underscoring its importance in autonomous driving applications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, robust, interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper explores the intricate relationship between interpretability and robustness in deep learning models. Despite their remarkable performance across various tasks, deep learning models often exhibit critical vulnerabilities, including susceptibility to adversarial attacks, over-reliance on spurious correlations, and a lack of transparency in their decision-making processes. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that leverages Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) to systematically enhance model robustness. By identifying and mitigating the influence of irrelevant or misleading features, our approach iteratively refines the model, penalizing reliance on these features during training. Empirical evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that LIME-guided refinement not only improves interpretability but also significantly enhances resistance to adversarial perturbations and generalization to out-of-distribution data.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text-to-video (T2V) generation has gained significant attention recently. However, the costs of training a T2V model from scratch remain persistently high, and there is considerable room for improving the generation performance, especially under limited computation resources. This work explores the continual general pre-training of text-to-video models, enabling the model to "grow" its abilities based on a pre-trained foundation, analogous to how humans acquire new knowledge based on past experiences. There is a lack of extensive study of the continual pre-training techniques in T2V generation. In this work, we take the initial step toward exploring this task systematically and propose ModelGrow. Specifically, we break this task into two key aspects: increasing model capacity and improving semantic understanding. For model capacity, we introduce several novel techniques to expand the model size, enabling it to store new knowledge and improve generation performance. For semantic understanding, we propose a method that leverages large language models as advanced text encoders, integrating them into T2V models to enhance language comprehension and guide generation results according to detailed prompts. This approach enables the model to achieve better semantic alignment, particularly in response to complex user prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across various metrics. The source code and the model of ModelGrow will be publicly available.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, steal, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid growth of natural language processing (NLP) and pre-trained language models have enabled accurate text classification in a variety of settings. However, text classification models are susceptible to backdoor attacks, where an attacker embeds a trigger into the victim model to make the model predict attacker-desired labels in targeted scenarios. In this paper, we propose to utilize backdoor attacks for a new purpose: bias injection. We develop a backdoor attack in which a subset of the training dataset is poisoned to associate strong male actors with negative sentiment. We execute our attack on two popular text classification datasets (IMDb and SST) and seven different models ranging from traditional Doc2Vec-based models to LSTM networks and modern transformer-based BERT and RoBERTa models. Our results show that the reduction in backdoored models' benign classification accuracy is limited, implying that our attacks remain stealthy, whereas the models successfully learn to associate strong male actors with negative sentiment (100% attack success rate with >= 3% poison rate). Attacks on BERT and RoBERTa are particularly more stealthy and effective, demonstrating an increased risk of using modern and larger models. We also measure the generalizability of our bias injection by proposing two metrics: (i) U-BBSR which uses previously unseen words when measuring attack success, and (ii) P-BBSR which measures attack success using paraphrased test samples. U-BBSR and P-BBSR results show that the bias injected by our attack can go beyond memorizing a trigger phrase.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) is designed to identify objects that blend seamlessly with their surroundings. Due to the complexity of camouflaged objects (such as shape, color, and texture), their semantic cues are often blurred or completely lost, posing a significant challenge for COD. Existing COD methods often rely on visual features, which are not stable enough in changeable camouflage environments. This instability leads to false positives and false negatives, resulting in incomplete or inaccurate segmentation results. In this paper, to solve this problem, we propose a new task, Class-Guided Camouflaged Object Detection (CG-COD), which extends the traditional COD task by introducing object class knowledge, significantly improving the robustness and segmentation accuracy of the model in complex environments. Toward this end, we construct a dataset, CamoClass, containing the camouflaged objects in the real scenes and their corresponding class annotation. Based on this, we propose a multi-stage framework CGNet which consists of a plug-and-play class prompt generator and a class-guided detector. Under the guidance of textual information, CGNet enables efficient segmentation. It is worth emphasizing that for the first time, we extend the object class annotations on existing COD benchmark datasets, and introduce a flexible framework to improve the performance of the existing COD model under text guidance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, extraction, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Handwritten document recognition (HDR) is one of the most challenging tasks in the field of computer vision, due to the various writing styles and complex layouts inherent in handwritten texts. Traditionally, this problem has been approached as two separate tasks, handwritten text recognition and layout analysis, and struggled to integrate the two processes effectively. This paper introduces HAND (Hierarchical Attention Network for Multi-Scale Document), a novel end-to-end and segmentation-free architecture for simultaneous text recognition and layout analysis tasks. Our model's key components include an advanced convolutional encoder integrating Gated Depth-wise Separable and Octave Convolutions for robust feature extraction, a Multi-Scale Adaptive Processing (MSAP) framework that dynamically adjusts to document complexity and a hierarchical attention decoder with memory-augmented and sparse attention mechanisms. These components enable our model to scale effectively from single-line to triple-column pages while maintaining computational efficiency. Additionally, HAND adopts curriculum learning across five complexity levels. To improve the recognition accuracy of complex ancient manuscripts, we fine-tune and integrate a Domain-Adaptive Pre-trained mT5 model for post-processing refinement. Extensive evaluations on the READ 2016 dataset demonstrate the superior performance of HAND, achieving up to 59.8% reduction in CER for line-level recognition and 31.2% for page-level recognition compared to state-of-the-art methods. The model also maintains a compact size of 5.60M parameters while establishing new benchmarks in both text recognition and layout analysis.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper expands the cascaded network branch of the autoencoder-based multi-task learning (MTL) framework for dynamic facial expression recognition, namely Multi-Task Cascaded Autoencoder for Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (MTCAE-DFER). MTCAE-DFER builds a plug-and-play cascaded decoder module, which is based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture and employs the decoder concept of Transformer to reconstruct the multi-head attention module. The decoder output from the previous task serves as the query (Q), representing local dynamic features, while the Video Masked Autoencoder (VideoMAE) shared encoder output acts as both the key (K) and value (V), representing global dynamic features. This setup facilitates interaction between global and local dynamic features across related tasks. Additionally, this proposal aims to alleviate overfitting of complex large model. We utilize autoencoder-based multi-task cascaded learning approach to explore the impact of dynamic face detection and dynamic face landmark on dynamic facial expression recognition, which enhances the model's generalization ability. After we conduct extensive ablation experiments and comparison with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on various public datasets for dynamic facial expression recognition, the robustness of the MTCAE-DFER model and the effectiveness of global-local dynamic feature interaction among related tasks have been proven.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This study focuses on a method for detecting and classifying distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, such as SYN Flooding, ACK Flooding, HTTP Flooding, and UDP Flooding, using neural networks. Machine learning, particularly neural networks, is highly effective in detecting malicious traffic. A dataset containing normal traffic and various DDoS attacks was used to train a neural network model with a 24-106-5 architecture. The model achieved high Accuracy (99.35%), Precision (99.32%), Recall (99.54%), and F-score (0.99) in the classification task. All major attack types were correctly identified. The model was also further tested in the lab using virtual infrastructures to generate normal and DDoS traffic. The results showed that the model can accurately classify attacks under near-real-world conditions, demonstrating 95.05% accuracy and balanced F-score scores for all attack types. This confirms that neural networks are an effective tool for detecting DDoS attacks in modern information security systems.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This study explores the integration of Lidar, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), and optical imagery through advanced artificial intelligence techniques for enhanced urban mapping. By fusing these diverse geospatial datasets, we aim to overcome the limitations associated with single-sensor data, achieving a more comprehensive representation of urban environments. The research employs Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) as the primary deep learning model for urban feature extraction, enabling precise pixel-wise classification of essential urban elements, including buildings, roads, and vegetation. To optimize the performance of the FCN model, we utilize Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for hyperparameter tuning, significantly enhancing model accuracy. Key findings indicate that the FCN-PSO model achieved a pixel accuracy of 92.3% and a mean Intersection over Union (IoU) of 87.6%, surpassing traditional single-sensor approaches. These results underscore the potential of fused geospatial data and AI-driven methodologies in urban mapping, providing valuable insights for urban planning and management.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Climate change poses an extreme threat to biodiversity, making it imperative to efficiently model the geographical range of different species. The availability of large-scale remote sensing images and environmental data has facilitated the use of machine learning in Species Distribution Models (SDMs), which aim to predict the presence of a species at any given location. Traditional SDMs, reliant on expert observation, are labor-intensive, but advancements in remote sensing and citizen science data have facilitated machine learning approaches to SDM development. However, these models often struggle with leveraging spatial relationships between different inputs -- for instance, learning how climate data should inform the data present in satellite imagery -- without upsampling or distorting the original inputs. Additionally, location information and ecological characteristics at a location play a crucial role in predicting species distribution models, but these aspects have not yet been incorporated into state-of-the-art approaches. In this work, we introduce MiTREE: a multi-input Vision-Transformer-based model with an ecoregion encoder. MiTREE computes spatial cross-modal relationships without upsampling as well as integrates location and ecological context. We evaluate our model on the SatBird Summer and Winter datasets, the goal of which is to predict bird species encounter rates, and we find that our approach improves upon state-of-the-art baselines.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Image inpainting is a widely used technique in computer vision for reconstructing missing or damaged pixels in images. Recent advancements with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have demonstrated superior performance over traditional methods due to their deep learning capabilities and adaptability across diverse image domains. Residual Networks (ResNet) have also gained prominence for their ability to enhance feature representation and compatibility with other architectures. This paper introduces a novel architecture combining GAN and ResNet models to improve image inpainting outcomes. Our framework integrates three components: Transpose Convolution-based GAN for guided and blind inpainting, Fast ResNet-Convolutional Neural Network (FR-CNN) for object removal, and Co-Modulation GAN (Co-Mod GAN) for refinement. The model's performance was evaluated on benchmark datasets, achieving accuracies of 96.59% on Image-Net, 96.70% on Places2, and 96.16% on CelebA. Comparative analyses demonstrate that the proposed architecture outperforms existing methods, highlighting its effectiveness in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Existing facial editing methods have achieved remarkable results, yet they often fall short in supporting multimodal conditional local facial editing. One of the significant evidences is that their output image quality degrades dramatically after several iterations of incremental editing, as they do not support local editing. In this paper, we present a novel multimodal generative and fusion framework for globally-consistent local facial editing (FACEMUG) that can handle a wide range of input modalities and enable fine-grained and semantic manipulation while remaining unedited parts unchanged. Different modalities, including sketches, semantic maps, color maps, exemplar images, text, and attribute labels, are adept at conveying diverse conditioning details, and their combined synergy can provide more explicit guidance for the editing process. We thus integrate all modalities into a unified generative latent space to enable multimodal local facial edits. Specifically, a novel multimodal feature fusion mechanism is proposed by utilizing multimodal aggregation and style fusion blocks to fuse facial priors and multimodalities in both latent and feature spaces. We further introduce a novel self-supervised latent warping algorithm to rectify misaligned facial features, efficiently transferring the pose of the edited image to the given latent codes. We evaluate our FACEMUG through extensive experiments and comparisons to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. The results demonstrate the superiority of FACEMUG in terms of editing quality, flexibility, and semantic control, making it a promising solution for a wide range of local facial editing tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Adversarial attacks on point clouds are crucial for assessing and improving the adversarial robustness of 3D deep learning models. Traditional solutions strictly limit point displacement during attacks, making it challenging to balance imperceptibility with adversarial effectiveness. In this paper, we attribute the inadequate imperceptibility of adversarial attacks on point clouds to deviations from the underlying surface. To address this, we introduce a novel point-to-surface (P2S) field that adjusts adversarial perturbation directions by dragging points back to their original underlying surface. Specifically, we use a denoising network to learn the gradient field of the logarithmic density function encoding the shape's surface, and apply a distance-aware adjustment to perturbation directions during attacks, thereby enhancing imperceptibility. Extensive experiments show that adversarial attacks guided by our P2S field are more imperceptible, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In-context learning, which allows large language models to perform diverse tasks with a few demonstrations, is found to have imbalanced per-class prediction accuracy on multi-class text classification. Although notable output correction methods have been developed to tackle the issue and simultaneously improve downstream prediction accuracy, they may fail to answer the core interpretability challenges: why and which certain classes need corrections, and more importantly, a tailored correction for per-sample, per-class's probability. To address such interpretability gaps, we first find that the imbalance arises from certain classes consistently receiving high ICL output probabilities, whereas others receiving lower or mixed ranges, so the former is more frequently chosen, resulting in higher accuracy; more crucially, we find that these ranges have significantly varying degrees of influence on the accuracy bias, highlighting the need for precise, interpretable probability corrections by range. Motivated by this, we propose FuRud, a Fuzzy Rule Optimization based Debiasing method, that (1) detects which classes need corrections, and (2) for each correction-needed class, detects its probability ranges and applies asymmetric amplifications or reductions to correct them interpretably. Notably, across seven benchmark datasets, FuRud reduces the pairwise class accuracy bias (COBias) by more than half (56%), while achieving a relative increase of 21% in accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art debiasing methods. Moreover, FuRud can optimize downstream tasks with as few as 10 optimization examples. Furthermore, FuRud can work for prompt formats that lead to highly skewed predictions. For example, FuRud greatly improves ICL outputs which use letter options, with 44% relative accuracy increase and 54% relative COBias reduction.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Open-vocabulary Scene Graph Generation (OV-SGG) overcomes the limitations of the closed-set assumption by aligning visual relationship representations with open-vocabulary textual representations. This enables the identification of novel visual relationships, making it applicable to real-world scenarios with diverse relationships. However, existing OV-SGG methods are constrained by fixed text representations, limiting diversity and accuracy in image-text alignment. To address these challenges, we propose the Relation-Aware Hierarchical Prompting (RAHP) framework, which enhances text representation by integrating subject-object and region-specific relation information. Our approach utilizes entity clustering to address the complexity of relation triplet categories, enabling the effective integration of subject-object information. Additionally, we utilize a large language model (LLM) to generate detailed region-aware prompts, capturing fine-grained visual interactions and improving alignment between visual and textual modalities. RAHP also introduces a dynamic selection mechanism within Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which adaptively selects relevant text prompts based on the visual content, reducing noise from irrelevant prompts. Extensive experiments on the Visual Genome and Open Images v6 datasets demonstrate that our framework consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing the challenges of open-vocabulary scene graph generation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, defense, attack, robust, steal, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Backdoor attacks significantly compromise the security of large language models by triggering them to output specific and controlled content. Currently, triggers for textual backdoor attacks fall into two categories: fixed-token triggers and sentence-pattern triggers. However, the former are typically easy to identify and filter, while the latter, such as syntax and style, do not apply to all original samples and may lead to semantic shifts. In this paper, inspired by cross-lingual (CL) prompts of LLMs in real-world scenarios, we propose a higher-dimensional trigger method at the paragraph level, namely CL-attack. CL-attack injects the backdoor by using texts with specific structures that incorporate multiple languages, thereby offering greater stealthiness and universality compared to existing backdoor attack techniques. Extensive experiments on different tasks and model architectures demonstrate that CL-attack can achieve nearly 100% attack success rate with a low poisoning rate in both classification and generation tasks. We also empirically show that the CL-attack is more robust against current major defense methods compared to baseline backdoor attacks. Additionally, to mitigate CL-attack, we further develop a new defense called TranslateDefense, which can partially mitigate the impact of CL-attack.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>People exhibit unique emotional responses. In the same scenario, the emotional reactions of two individuals can be either similar or vastly different. For instance, consider one person's reaction to an invitation to smoke versus another person's response to a query about their sleep quality. The identification of these individual traits through the observation of common physical parameters opens the door to a wide range of applications, including psychological analysis, criminology, disease prediction, addiction control, and more. While there has been previous research in the fields of psychometrics, inertial sensors, computer vision, and audio analysis, this paper introduces a novel technique for identifying human traits in real time using brainwave data. To achieve this, we begin with an extensive study of brainwave data collected from 80 participants using a portable EEG headset. We also conduct a statistical analysis of the collected data utilizing box plots. Our analysis uncovers several new insights, leading us to a groundbreaking unified approach for identifying diverse human traits by leveraging machine learning techniques on EEG data. Our analysis demonstrates that this proposed solution achieves high accuracy. Moreover, we explore two deep-learning models to compare the performance of our solution. Consequently, we have developed an integrated, real-time trait identification solution using EEG data, based on the insights from our analysis. To validate our approach, we conducted a rigorous user evaluation with an additional 20 participants. The outcomes of this evaluation illustrate both high accuracy and favorable user ratings, emphasizing the robust potential of our proposed method to serve as a versatile solution for human trait identification.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Knowledge distillation effectively reduces model complexity while improving performance, yet the underlying knowledge transfer mechanisms remain poorly understood. We propose novel spectral analysis methods and guidelines to optimize distillation, making the knowledge transfer process more interpretable. Our analysis reveals that CaiT models concentrate information in their first and last few layers, informing optimal layer selection for feature map distillation. Surprisingly, we discover that Swin Transformer and CaiT exhibit similar spectral encoding patterns despite their architectural differences, enhancing our understanding of transformer architectures and leading to improved feature map alignment strategies. Based on these insights, we introduce a simple yet effective spectral alignment method named SpectralKD. Experimental results demonstrate that following our guidelines enables SpectralKD to achieve state-of-the-art performance (DeiT-Tiny: $+5.2\%$, Swin-Tiny: $+1.4\%$ in ImageNet-1k Top-1 accuracy). Furthermore, through spectral analysis of student models trained with and without distillation, we show that distilled models mirror spectral patterns of their teachers, providing a new lens for interpreting knowledge distillation dynamics. Our code, pre-trained models, and experimental logs will be made publicly available.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Point Transformers (PoinTr) have shown great potential in point cloud completion recently. Nevertheless, effective domain adaptation that improves transferability toward target domains remains unexplored. In this paper, we delve into this topic and empirically discover that direct feature alignment on point Transformer's CNN backbone only brings limited improvements since it cannot guarantee sequence-wise domain-invariant features in the Transformer. To this end, we propose a pioneering Domain Adaptive Point Transformer (DAPoinTr) framework for point cloud completion. DAPoinTr consists of three key components: Domain Query-based Feature Alignment (DQFA), Point Token-wise Feature alignment (PTFA), and Voted Prediction Consistency (VPC). In particular, DQFA is presented to narrow the global domain gaps from the sequence via the presented domain proxy and domain query at the Transformer encoder and decoder, respectively. PTFA is proposed to close the local domain shifts by aligning the tokens, \emph{i.e.,} point proxy and dynamic query, at the Transformer encoder and decoder, respectively. VPC is designed to consider different Transformer decoders as multiple of experts (MoE) for ensembled prediction voting and pseudo-label generation. Extensive experiments with visualization on several domain adaptation benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our DAPoinTr compared with state-of-the-art methods.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, security, privacy, attack, robust, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Online Learning to Rank (OLTR) optimises ranking models using implicit user feedback, such as clicks. Unlike traditional Learning to Rank (LTR) methods that rely on a static set of training data with relevance judgements to learn a ranking model, OLTR methods update the model continually as new data arrives. Thus, it addresses several drawbacks such as the high cost of human annotations, potential misalignment between user preferences and human judgments, and the rapid changes in user query intents. However, OLTR methods typically require the collection of searchable data, user queries, and clicks, which poses privacy concerns for users. Federated Online Learning to Rank (FOLTR) integrates OLTR within a Federated Learning (FL) framework to enhance privacy by not sharing raw data. While promising, FOLTR methods currently lag behind traditional centralised OLTR due to challenges in ranking effectiveness, robustness with respect to data distribution across clients, susceptibility to attacks, and the ability to unlearn client interactions and data. This thesis presents a comprehensive study on Federated Online Learning to Rank, addressing its effectiveness, robustness, security, and unlearning capabilities, thereby expanding the landscape of FOLTR.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Dichotomous Image Segmentation (DIS) tasks require highly precise annotations, and traditional dataset creation methods are labor intensive, costly, and require extensive domain expertise. Although using synthetic data for DIS is a promising solution to these challenges, current generative models and techniques struggle with the issues of scene deviations, noise-induced errors, and limited training sample variability. To address these issues, we introduce a novel approach, \textbf{\ourmodel{}}, which provides a scalable solution for generating diverse and precise datasets, markedly reducing preparation time and costs. We first introduce a general mask editing method that combines rigid and non-rigid editing techniques to generate high-quality synthetic masks. Specially, rigid editing leverages geometric priors from diffusion models to achieve precise viewpoint transformations under zero-shot conditions, while non-rigid editing employs adversarial training and self-attention mechanisms for complex, topologically consistent modifications. Then, we generate pairs of high-resolution image and accurate segmentation mask using a multi-conditional control generation method. Finally, our experiments on the widely-used DIS5K dataset benchmark demonstrate superior performance in quality and efficiency compared to existing methods.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) play a crucial role in the rapid detection and mitigation of cyber threats. However, the existing body of literature lacks in-depth analytical studies on the temporal aspects of IoC publication, especially when considering up-to-date datasets related to Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs). This paper addresses this gap by conducting an analysis of the timeliness and comprehensiveness of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) pertaining to several recent CVEs. The insights derived from this study aim to enhance cybersecurity defense strategies, particularly when dealing with dynamic cyber threats that continually adapt their Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs). Utilizing IoCs sourced from multiple providers, we scrutinize the IoC publication rate. Our analysis delves into how various factors, including the inherent nature of a threat, its evolutionary trajectory, and its observability over time, influence the publication rate of IoCs. Our preliminary findings emphasize the critical need for cyber defenders to maintain a constant state of vigilance in updating their IoCs for any given vulnerability. This vigilance is warranted because the publication rate of IoCs may exhibit fluctuations over time. We observe a recurring pattern akin to an epidemic model, with an initial phase following the public disclosure of a vulnerability characterized by sparse IoC publications, followed by a sudden surge, and subsequently, a protracted period with a slower rate of IoC publication.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While new technologies emerge, human errors always looming. Software supply chain is increasingly complex and intertwined, the security of a service has become paramount to ensuring the integrity of products, safeguarding data privacy, and maintaining operational continuity. In this work, we conducted experiments on the promising open Large Language Models (LLMs) into two main software security challenges: source code language errors and deprecated code, with a focus on their potential to replace conventional static and dynamic security scanners that rely on predefined rules and patterns. Our findings suggest that while LLMs present some unexpected results, they also encounter significant limitations, particularly in memory complexity and the management of new and unfamiliar data patterns. Despite these challenges, the proactive application of LLMs, coupled with extensive security databases and continuous updates, holds the potential to fortify Software Supply Chain (SSC) processes against emerging threats.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent works on dynamic neural field reconstruction assume input from synchronized multi-view videos with known poses. These input constraints are often unmet in real-world setups, making the approach impractical. We demonstrate that unsynchronized videos with unknown poses can generate dynamic neural fields if the videos capture human motion. Humans are one of the most common dynamic subjects whose poses can be estimated using state-of-the-art methods. While noisy, the estimated human shape and pose parameters provide a decent initialization for the highly non-convex and under-constrained problem of training a consistent dynamic neural representation. Given the sequences of pose and shape of humans, we estimate the time offsets between videos, followed by camera pose estimations by analyzing 3D joint locations. Then, we train dynamic NeRF employing multiresolution rids while simultaneously refining both time offsets and camera poses. The setup still involves optimizing many parameters, therefore, we introduce a robust progressive learning strategy to stabilize the process. Experiments show that our approach achieves accurate spatiotemporal calibration and high-quality scene reconstruction in challenging conditions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning (CDFSL) requires the model to transfer knowledge from the data-abundant source domain to data-scarce target domains for fast adaptation, where the large domain gap makes CDFSL a challenging problem. Masked Autoencoder (MAE) excels in effectively using unlabeled data and learning image's global structures, enhancing model generalization and robustness. However, in the CDFSL task with significant domain shifts, we find MAE even shows lower performance than the baseline supervised models. In this paper, we first delve into this phenomenon for an interpretation. We find that MAE tends to focus on low-level domain information during reconstructing pixels while changing the reconstruction target to token features could mitigate this problem. However, not all features are beneficial, as we then find reconstructing high-level features can hardly improve the model's transferability, indicating a trade-off between filtering domain information and preserving the image's global structure. In all, the reconstruction target matters for the CDFSL task. Based on the above findings and interpretations, we further propose Domain-Agnostic Masked Image Modeling (DAMIM) for the CDFSL task. DAMIM includes an Aggregated Feature Reconstruction module to automatically aggregate features for reconstruction, with balanced learning of domain-agnostic information and images' global structure, and a Lightweight Decoder module to further benefit the encoder's generalizability. Experiments on four CDFSL datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Spoken named entity recognition (NER) aims to identify named entities from speech, playing an important role in speech processing. New named entities appear every day, however, annotating their Spoken NER data is costly. In this paper, we demonstrate that existing Spoken NER systems perform poorly when dealing with previously unseen named entities. To tackle this challenge, we propose a method for generating Spoken NER data based on a named entity dictionary (NED) to reduce costs. Specifically, we first use a large language model (LLM) to generate sentences from the sampled named entities and then use a text-to-speech (TTS) system to generate the speech. Furthermore, we introduce a noise metric to filter out noisy data. To evaluate our approach, we release a novel Spoken NER benchmark along with a corresponding NED containing 8,853 entities. Experiment results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in the in-domain, zero-shot domain adaptation, and fully zero-shot settings.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this work, we dive deep into the impact of additive noise in pre-training deep networks. While various methods have attempted to use additive noise inspired by the success of latent denoising diffusion models, when used in combination with masked image modeling, their gains have been marginal when it comes to recognition tasks. We thus investigate why this would be the case, in an attempt to find effective ways to combine the two ideas. Specifically, we find three critical conditions: corruption and restoration must be applied within the encoder, noise must be introduced in the feature space, and an explicit disentanglement between noised and masked tokens is necessary. By implementing these findings, we demonstrate improved pre-training performance for a wide range of recognition tasks, including those that require fine-grained, high-frequency information to solve.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The development of deep learning has facilitated the application of person re-identification (ReID) technology in intelligent security. Visible-infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID) aims to match pedestrians across infrared and visible modality images enabling 24-hour surveillance. Current studies relying on unsupervised modality transformations as well as inefficient embedding constraints to bridge the spectral differences between infrared and visible images, however, limit their potential performance. To tackle the limitations of the above approaches, this paper introduces a simple yet effective Spectral Enhancement and Pseudo-anchor Guidance Network, named SEPG-Net. Specifically, we propose a more homogeneous spectral enhancement scheme based on frequency domain information and greyscale space, which avoids the information loss typically caused by inefficient modality transformations. Further, a Pseudo Anchor-guided Bidirectional Aggregation (PABA) loss is introduced to bridge local modality discrepancies while better preserving discriminative identity embeddings. Experimental results on two public benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of SEPG-Net against other state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Missing value is a critical issue in data science, significantly impacting the reliability of analyses and predictions. Missing value imputation (MVI) is a longstanding problem because it highly relies on domain knowledge. Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising tool for data cleaning, including MVI for tabular data, offering advanced capabilities for understanding and generating content. However, despite their promise, existing LLM techniques such as in-context learning and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) often fall short in guiding LLMs to perform complex reasoning for MVI, particularly when imputing derived missing values, which require mathematical formulas and data relationships across rows and columns. This gap underscores the need for further advancements in LLM methodologies to enhance their reasoning capabilities for more reliable imputation outcomes. To fill this gap, we propose SketchFill, a novel sketch-based method to guide LLMs in generating accurate formulas to impute missing numerical values. Our experimental results demonstrate that SketchFill significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 56.2% higher accuracy than CoT-based methods and 78.8% higher accuracy than MetaGPT. This sets a new standard for automated data cleaning and advances the field of MVI for numerical values.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This work explores the theoretical and practical foundations of denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) and score-based generative models, which leverage stochastic processes and Brownian motion to model complex data distributions. These models employ forward and reverse diffusion processes defined through stochastic differential equations (SDEs) to iteratively add and remove noise, enabling high-quality data generation. By analyzing the performance bounds of these models, we demonstrate how score estimation errors propagate through the reverse process and bound the total variation distance using discrete Girsanov transformations, Pinsker's inequality, and the data processing inequality (DPI) for an information theoretic lens.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising paradigm in medical imaging, addressing the chronic challenge of limited labeled data in healthcare settings. While SSL has shown impressive results, existing studies in the medical domain are often limited in scope, focusing on specific datasets or modalities, or evaluating only isolated aspects of model performance. This fragmented evaluation approach poses a significant challenge, as models deployed in critical medical settings must not only achieve high accuracy but also demonstrate robust performance and generalizability across diverse datasets and varying conditions. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive evaluation of SSL methods within the medical domain, with a particular focus on robustness and generalizability. Using the MedMNIST dataset collection as a standardized benchmark, we evaluate 8 major SSL methods across 11 different medical datasets. Our study provides an in-depth analysis of model performance in both in-domain scenarios and the detection of out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, while exploring the effect of various initialization strategies, model architectures, and multi-domain pre-training. We further assess the generalizability of SSL methods through cross-dataset evaluations and the in-domain performance with varying label proportions (1%, 10%, and 100%) to simulate real-world scenarios with limited supervision. We hope this comprehensive benchmark helps practitioners and researchers make more informed decisions when applying SSL methods to medical applications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce AKT (Advanced Knowledge Transfer), a novel method to enhance the training ability of low-bit quantized (Q) models in the field of zero-shot quantization (ZSQ). Existing research in ZSQ has focused on generating high-quality data from full-precision (FP) models. However, these approaches struggle with reduced learning ability in low-bit quantization due to its limited information capacity. To overcome this limitation, we propose effective training strategy compared to data generation. Particularly, we analyzed that refining feature maps in the feature distillation process is an effective way to transfer knowledge to the Q model. Based on this analysis, AKT efficiently transfer core information from the FP model to the Q model. AKT is the first approach to utilize both spatial and channel attention information in feature distillation in ZSQ. Our method addresses the fundamental gradient exploding problem in low-bit Q models. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of the AKT. Our method led to significant performance enhancement in existing generative models. Notably, AKT achieved significant accuracy improvements in low-bit Q models, achieving state-of-the-art in the 3,5bit scenarios on CIFAR-10. The code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Video procedure planning, i.e., planning a sequence of action steps given the video frames of start and goal states, is an essential ability for embodied AI. Recent works utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate enriched action step description texts to guide action step decoding. Although LLMs are introduced, these methods decode the action steps into a closed-set of one-hot vectors, limiting the model's capability of generalizing to new steps or tasks. Additionally, fixed action step descriptions based on world-level commonsense may contain noise in specific instances of visual states. In this paper, we propose PlanLLM, a cross-modal joint learning framework with LLMs for video procedure planning. We propose an LLM-Enhanced Planning module which fully uses the generalization ability of LLMs to produce free-form planning output and to enhance action step decoding. We also propose Mutual Information Maximization module to connect world-level commonsense of step descriptions and sample-specific information of visual states, enabling LLMs to employ the reasoning ability to generate step sequences. With the assistance of LLMs, our method can both closed-set and open vocabulary procedure planning tasks. Our PlanLLM achieves superior performance on three benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our designs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In recent years, fine-grained sentiment analysis in finance has gained significant attention, but the scarcity of entity-level datasets remains a key challenge. To address this, we have constructed the largest English and Chinese financial entity-level sentiment analysis datasets to date. Building on this foundation, we propose a novel two-stage sentiment analysis approach called Self-aware In-context Learning Correction (SILC). The first stage involves fine-tuning a base large language model to generate pseudo-labeled data specific to our task. In the second stage, we train a correction model using a GNN-based example retriever, which is informed by the pseudo-labeled data. This two-stage strategy has allowed us to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the newly constructed datasets, advancing the field of financial sentiment analysis. In a case study, we demonstrate the enhanced practical utility of our data and methods in monitoring the cryptocurrency market. Our datasets and code are available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent works in 3D multimodal learning have made remarkable progress. However, typically 3D multimodal models are only capable of handling point clouds. Compared to the emerging 3D representation technique, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), the spatially sparse point cloud cannot depict the texture information of 3D objects, resulting in inferior reconstruction capabilities. This limitation constrains the potential of point cloud-based 3D multimodal representation learning. In this paper, we present CLIP-GS, a novel multimodal representation learning framework grounded in 3DGS. We introduce the GS Tokenizer to generate serialized gaussian tokens, which are then processed through transformer layers pre-initialized with weights from point cloud models, resulting in the 3DGS embeddings. CLIP-GS leverages contrastive loss between 3DGS and the visual-text embeddings of CLIP, and we introduce an image voting loss to guide the directionality and convergence of gradient optimization. Furthermore, we develop an efficient way to generate triplets of 3DGS, images, and text, facilitating CLIP-GS in learning unified multimodal representations. Leveraging the well-aligned multimodal representations, CLIP-GS demonstrates versatility and outperforms point cloud-based models on various 3D tasks, including multimodal retrieval, zero-shot, and few-shot classification.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Semantic segmentation of point clouds is essential for understanding the built environment, and a large amount of high-quality data is required for training deep learning models. Despite synthetic point clouds (SPC) having the potential to compensate for the shortage of real data, how to exploit the benefits of SPC is still open. Therefore, this study systematically investigates how color and mixing proportion of SPC impact semantic segmentation for the first time. First, a new method to mimic the scanning process and generate SPC based on BIM is proposed, to create a synthetic dataset with consistent colors of BIM (UniSPC) and a synthetic dataset with real colors (RealSPC) respectively. Subsequently, by integrating with the S3DIS dataset, further experiments on PointNet, PointNet++, and DGCNN are conducted. Meanwhile, benchmark experiments and new evaluation metrics are introduced to better evaluate the performance of different models. Experiments show that synthetic color significantly impacts model performance, the performance for common components of the models trained with pure RealSPC is comparable to models with real data, and RealSPC contributes average improvements of 14.1% on overall accuracy and 7.3% on mIoU than UniSPC. Furthermore, the proportion of SPC also has a significant impact on the performance. In mixing training experiments, adding more than 70% SPC achieves an average of 3.9% on overall accuracy and 3.4% on mIoU better than benchmark on three models. It is also revealed that for large flat elements such as floors, ceilings, and walls, the SPC can even replace real point clouds without compromising model performance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Chart understanding tasks such as ChartQA and Chart-to-Text involve automatically extracting and interpreting key information from charts, enabling users to query or convert visual data into structured formats. State-of-the-art approaches primarily focus on visual cues from chart images, failing to explicitly incorporate rich textual information (e.g., data labels and axis labels) embedded within the charts. This textual information is vital for intuitive human comprehension and interpretation of charts. Moreover, existing models are often large and computationally intensive, limiting their practical applicability. In this paper, we introduce AskChart, a universal model that explicitly integrates both textual and visual cues from charts using a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. AskChart facilitates the learning of enhanced visual-textual representations of charts for effectively handling multiple chart understanding tasks, while maintaining a smaller model size. To capture the synergy between visual and textual modalities, we curate a large-scale dataset named ChartBank with about 7.5M data samples, which helps align textual and visual information and facilitates the extraction of visual entities and text. To effectively train AskChart, we design a three-stage training strategy to align visual and textual modalities for learning robust visual-textual representations and optimizing the learning of the MoE layer. Extensive experiments across five datasets demonstrate the significant performance gains of AskChart in four chart understanding tasks. Remarkably, AskChart with 4.6B parameters outperforms state-of-the-art models with 13B parameters by 68.3% in Open-ended ChartQA and 49.2% in Chart-to-Text tasks, while achieving comparable performance in ChartQA and Chart-to-Table tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generating animatable and editable 3D head avatars is essential for various applications in computer vision and graphics. Traditional 3D-aware generative adversarial networks (GANs), often using implicit fields like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), achieve photorealistic and view-consistent 3D head synthesis. However, these methods face limitations in deformation flexibility and editability, hindering the creation of lifelike and easily modifiable 3D heads. We propose a novel approach that enhances the editability and animation control of 3D head avatars by incorporating 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as an explicit 3D representation. This method enables easier illumination control and improved editability. Central to our approach is the Editable Gaussian Head (EG-Head) model, which combines a 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) with texture maps, allowing precise expression control and flexible texture editing for accurate animation while preserving identity. To capture complex non-facial geometries like hair, we use an auxiliary set of 3DGS and tri-plane features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach delivers high-quality 3D-aware synthesis with state-of-the-art controllability. Our code and models are available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>biometric, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Traditional biometric systems, like face and fingerprint recognition, have encountered significant setbacks due to wearing face masks and hygiene concerns. To meet the challenges of the partially covered face due to face masks and hygiene concerns of fingerprint recognition, this paper proposes a novel dual-channel multi-attention Vision Transformer (ViT) framework for biometric authentication using forehead subcutaneous vein patterns and periocular patterns, offering a promising alternative to traditional methods, capable of performing well even with face masks and without any physical touch. The proposed framework leverages a dual-channel ViT architecture, designed to handle two distinct biometric traits. It can capture long-range dependencies of independent features from the vein and periocular patterns. A custom classifier is then designed to integrate the independently extracted features, producing a final class prediction. The performance of the proposed algorithm was rigorously evaluated using the Forehead Subcutaneous Vein Pattern and Periocular Biometric Pattern (FSVP-PBP) database. The results demonstrated the superiority of the algorithm over state-of-the-art methods, achieving remarkable classification accuracy of $99.3 \pm 0.02\%$ with the combined vein and periocular patterns.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Gender-fair language aims at promoting gender equality by using terms and expressions that include all identities and avoid reinforcing gender stereotypes. Implementing gender-fair strategies is particularly challenging in heavily gender-marked languages, such as Italian. To address this, the Gender-Fair Generation challenge intends to help shift toward gender-fair language in written communication. The challenge, designed to assess and monitor the recognition and generation of gender-fair language in both mono- and cross-lingual scenarios, includes three tasks: (1) the detection of gendered expressions in Italian sentences, (2) the reformulation of gendered expressions into gender-fair alternatives, and (3) the generation of gender-fair language in automatic translation from English to Italian. The challenge relies on three different annotated datasets: the GFL-it corpus, which contains Italian texts extracted from administrative documents provided by the University of Brescia; GeNTE, a bilingual test set for gender-neutral rewriting and translation built upon a subset of the Europarl dataset; and Neo-GATE, a bilingual test set designed to assess the use of non-binary neomorphemes in Italian for both fair formulation and translation tasks. Finally, each task is evaluated with specific metrics: average of F1-score obtained by means of BERTScore computed on each entry of the datasets for task 1, an accuracy measured with a gender-neutral classifier, and a coverage-weighted accuracy for tasks 2 and 3.</li>

This approach often leads to an overemphasis on designing specific network architectures and limits the captured feature distributions to the current dataset, resulting in poor generalizability and robustness when applied to other datasets or real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel approach for remote sensing image change detection and description that integrates diffusion models, aiming to shift the focus from conventional feature learning paradigms to data distribution learning. The proposed method primarily includes a simple multi-scale change detection module, whose output features are subsequently refined using a diffusion model. Additionally, we introduce a frequency-guided complex filter module to handle high-frequency noise during the diffusion process, which helps to maintain model performance. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our proposed method on several remote sensing change detection description datasets, demonstrating its superior performance.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Portraits or selfie images taken from a close distance typically suffer from perspective distortion. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep learning-based rectification pipeline to mitigate the effects of perspective distortion. We learn to predict the facial depth by training a deep CNN. The estimated depth is utilized to adjust the camera-to-subject distance by moving the camera farther, increasing the camera focal length, and reprojecting the 3D image features to the new perspective. The reprojected features are then fed to an inpainting module to fill in the missing pixels. We leverage a differentiable renderer to enable end-to-end training of our depth estimation and feature extraction nets to improve the rectified outputs. To boost the results of the inpainting module, we incorporate an auxiliary module to predict the horizontal movement of the camera which decreases the area that requires hallucination of challenging face parts such as ears. Unlike previous works, we process the full-frame input image at once without cropping the subject's face and processing it separately from the rest of the body, eliminating the need for complex post-processing steps to attach the face back to the subject's body. To train our network, we utilize the popular game engine Unreal Engine to generate a large synthetic face dataset containing various subjects, head poses, expressions, eyewear, clothes, and lighting. Quantitative and qualitative results show that our rectification pipeline outperforms previous methods, and produces comparable results with a time-consuming 3D GAN-based method while being more than 260 times faster.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this study, we focus on automated approaches to detect depression from clinical interviews using multi-modal machine learning (ML). Our approach differentiates from other successful ML methods such as context-aware analysis through feature engineering and end-to-end deep neural networks for depression detection utilizing the Distress Analysis Interview Corpus. We propose a novel method that incorporates: (1) pre-trained Transformer combined with data augmentation based on topic modelling for textual data; and (2) deep 1D convolutional neural network (CNN) for acoustic feature modeling. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for training multi-modal deep learning models. Our deep 1D CNN and Transformer models achieved state-of-the-art performance for audio and text modalities respectively. Combining them in a multi-modal framework also outperforms state-of-the-art for the combined setting. Code available at this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Graph mining is an important area in data mining and machine learning that involves extracting valuable information from graph-structured data. In recent years, significant progress has been made in this field through the development of graph neural networks (GNNs). However, GNNs are still deficient in generalizing to diverse graph data. Aiming to this issue, Large Language Models (LLMs) could provide new solutions for graph mining tasks with their superior semantic understanding. In this review, we systematically review the combination and application techniques of LLMs and GNNs and present a novel taxonomy for research in this interdisciplinary field, which involves three main categories: GNN-driving-LLM, LLM-driving-GNN, and GNN-LLM-co-driving. Within this framework, we reveal the capabilities of LLMs in enhancing graph feature extraction as well as improving the effectiveness of downstream tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and community detection. Although LLMs have demonstrated their great potential in handling graph-structured data, their high computational requirements and complexity remain challenges. Future research needs to continue to explore how to efficiently fuse LLMs and GNNs to achieve more powerful graph learning and reasoning capabilities and provide new impetus for the development of graph mining techniques.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid expansion of citizen science initiatives has led to a significant growth of biodiversity databases, and particularly presence-only (PO) observations. PO data are invaluable for understanding species distributions and their dynamics, but their use in Species Distribution Models (SDM) is curtailed by sampling biases and the lack of information on absences. Poisson point processes are widely used for SDMs, with Maxent being one of the most popular methods. Maxent maximises the entropy of a probability distribution across sites as a function of predefined transformations of environmental variables, called features. In contrast, neural networks and deep learning have emerged as a promising technique for automatic feature extraction from complex input variables. In this paper, we propose DeepMaxent, which harnesses neural networks to automatically learn shared features among species, using the maximum entropy principle. To do so, it employs a normalised Poisson loss where for each species, presence probabilities across sites are modelled by a neural network. We evaluate DeepMaxent on a benchmark dataset known for its spatial sampling biases, using PO data for calibration and presence-absence (PA) data for validation across six regions with different biological groups and environmental covariates. Our results indicate that DeepMaxent improves model performance over Maxent and other state-of-the-art SDMs across regions and taxonomic groups. The method performs particularly well in regions of uneven sampling, demonstrating substantial potential to improve species distribution modelling. The method opens the possibility to learn more robust environmental features predicting jointly many species and scales to arbitrary large numbers of sites without an increased memory demand.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Informed by the success of the transformer model in various computer vision tasks, we design an end-to-end trainable model for the automatic detection and classification of bleeding and non-bleeding frames extracted from Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) videos. Based on the DETR model, our model uses the Resnet50 for feature extraction, the transformer encoder-decoder for bleeding and non-bleeding region detection, and a feedforward neural network for classification. Trained in an end-to-end approach on the Auto-WCEBleedGen Version 1 challenge training set, our model performs both detection and classification tasks as a single unit. Our model achieves an accuracy, recall, and F1-score classification percentage score of 98.28, 96.79, and 98.37 respectively, on the Auto-WCEBleedGen version 1 validation set. Further, we record an average precision (AP @ 0.5), mean-average precision (mAP) of 0.7447 and 0.7328 detection results. This earned us a 3rd place position in the challenge.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Phenotypic drug discovery has attracted widespread attention because of its potential to identify bioactive molecules. Transcriptomic profiling provides a comprehensive reflection of phenotypic changes in cellular responses to external perturbations. In this paper, we propose XTransferCDR, a novel generative framework designed for feature decoupling and transferable representation learning across domains. Given a pair of perturbed expression profiles, our approach decouples the perturbation representations from basal states through domain separation encoders and then cross-transfers them in the latent space. The transferred representations are then used to reconstruct the corresponding perturbed expression profiles via a shared decoder. This cross-transfer constraint effectively promotes the learning of transferable drug perturbation representations. We conducted extensive evaluations of our model on multiple datasets, including single-cell transcriptional responses to drugs and single- and combinatorial genetic perturbations. The experimental results show that XTransferCDR achieved better performance than current state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its potential to advance phenotypic drug discovery.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated Graph Learning (FGL) enables multiple clients to jointly train powerful graph learning models, e.g., Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), without sharing their local graph data for graph-related downstream tasks, such as graph property prediction. In the real world, however, the graph data can suffer from significant distribution shifts across clients as the clients may collect their graph data for different purposes. In particular, graph properties are usually associated with invariant label-relevant substructures (i.e., subgraphs) across clients, while label-irrelevant substructures can appear in a client-specific manner. The issue of distribution shifts of graph data hinders the efficiency of GNN training and leads to serious performance degradation in FGL. To tackle the aforementioned issue, we propose a novel FGL framework entitled FedVN that eliminates distribution shifts through client-specific graph augmentation strategies with multiple learnable Virtual Nodes (VNs). Specifically, FedVN lets the clients jointly learn a set of shared VNs while training a global GNN model. To eliminate distribution shifts, each client trains a personalized edge generator that determines how the VNs connect local graphs in a client-specific manner. Furthermore, we provide theoretical analyses indicating that FedVN can eliminate distribution shifts of graph data across clients. Comprehensive experiments on four datasets under five settings demonstrate the superiority of our proposed FedVN over nine baselines.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Remote Sensing (RS) data contains a wealth of multi-dimensional information crucial for Earth observation. Owing to its vast volume, diverse sources, and temporal properties, RS data is highly suitable for the development of large Visual Foundation Models (VFMs). VFMs act as robust feature extractors, learning from extensive RS data, and are subsequently fine-tuned for deployment in various geoscientific tasks. However, current VFMs in the RS domain are predominantly pretrained and tailored exclusively for specific characteristics of RS imagery, neglecting the potential of utilizing the multi-dimensional properties of RS data. Therefore, in this work, we propose SeaMo, a pioneering visual foundation model that integrates multi-seasonal and multimodal information in the RS field. SeaMo is designed to harness multiple properties of RS data. Within the masked image modeling framework, we employ non-aligned cropping techniques to extract spatial properties, use multi-source inputs for multimodal integration, and incorporate temporal-multimodal fusion blocks for effective assimilation of multi-seasonal data. SeaMo explicitly models the multi-dimensional properties of RS data, making the model more comprehensive, robust, and versatile. We applied SeaMo to several downstream geoscience tasks, which demonstrated exceptional performance. Extensive ablation studies were conducted to validate the model's superiority.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Machine learning systems increasingly drive innovation across scientific fields and industry, yet challenges in compute overhead, specifically during inference, limit their scalability and sustainability. Responsible AI guardrails, essential for ensuring fairness, transparency, and privacy, further exacerbate these computational demands. This study addresses critical gaps in the literature, chiefly the lack of generalized predictive techniques for latency and energy consumption, limited cross-comparisons of classifiers, and unquantified impacts of RAI guardrails on inference performance. Using Theory Construction Methodology, this work constructed a model-agnostic theoretical framework for predicting latency and energy consumption in binary classification models during inference. The framework synthesizes classifier characteristics, dataset properties, and RAI guardrails into a unified analytical instrument. Two predictive equations are derived that capture the interplay between these factors while offering generalizability across diverse classifiers. The proposed framework provides foundational insights for designing efficient, responsible ML systems. It enables researchers to benchmark and optimize inference performance and assists practitioners in deploying scalable solutions. Finally, this work establishes a theoretical foundation for balancing computational efficiency with ethical AI principles, paving the way for future empirical validation and broader applications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Several studies showed that Large Language Models (LLMs) can answer medical questions correctly, even outperforming the average human score in some medical exams. However, to our knowledge, no study has been conducted to assess the ability of language models to validate existing or generated medical text for correctness and consistency. In this paper, we introduce MEDEC (this https URL), the first publicly available benchmark for medical error detection and correction in clinical notes, covering five types of errors (Diagnosis, Management, Treatment, Pharmacotherapy, and Causal Organism). MEDEC consists of 3,848 clinical texts, including 488 clinical notes from three US hospital systems that were not previously seen by any LLM. The dataset has been used for the MEDIQA-CORR shared task to evaluate seventeen participating systems [Ben Abacha et al., 2024]. In this paper, we describe the data creation methods and we evaluate recent LLMs (e.g., o1-preview, GPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.0 Flash) for the tasks of detecting and correcting medical errors requiring both medical knowledge and reasoning capabilities. We also conducted a comparative study where two medical doctors performed the same task on the MEDEC test set. The results showed that MEDEC is a sufficiently challenging benchmark to assess the ability of models to validate existing or generated notes and to correct medical errors. We also found that although recent LLMs have a good performance in error detection and correction, they are still outperformed by medical doctors in these tasks. We discuss the potential factors behind this gap, the insights from our experiments, the limitations of current evaluation metrics, and share potential pointers for future research.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>PearSAN is a machine learning-assisted optimization algorithm applicable to inverse design problems with large design spaces, where traditional optimizers struggle. The algorithm leverages the latent space of a generative model for rapid sampling and employs a Pearson correlated surrogate model to predict the figure of merit of the true design metric. As a showcase example, PearSAN is applied to thermophotovoltaic (TPV) metasurface design by matching the working bands between a thermal radiator and a photovoltaic cell. PearSAN can work with any pretrained generative model with a discretized latent space, making it easy to integrate with VQ-VAEs and binary autoencoders. Its novel Pearson correlational loss can be used as both a latent regularization method, similar to batch and layer normalization, and as a surrogate training loss. We compare both to previous energy matching losses, which are shown to enforce poor regularization and performance, even with upgraded affine parameters. PearSAN achieves a state-of-the-art maximum design efficiency of 97%, and is at least an order of magnitude faster than previous methods, with an improved maximum figure-of-merit gain.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Time series foundational models (TSFM) have gained prominence in time series forecasting, promising state-of-the-art performance across various applications. However, their application in anomaly detection and prediction remains underexplored, with growing concerns regarding their black-box nature, lack of interpretability and applicability. This paper critically evaluates the efficacy of TSFM in anomaly detection and prediction tasks. We systematically analyze TSFM across multiple datasets, including those characterized by the absence of discernible patterns, trends and seasonality. Our analysis shows that while TSFMs can be extended for anomaly detection and prediction, traditional statistical and deep learning models often match or outperform TSFM in these tasks. Additionally, TSFMs require high computational resources but fail to capture sequential dependencies effectively or improve performance in few-shot or zero-shot scenarios. \noindent The preprocessed datasets, codes to reproduce the results and supplementary materials are available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as the dominant technique to provide *Large Language Models* (LLM) with fresh and relevant context, mitigating the risk of hallucinations and improving the overall quality of responses in environments with large and fast moving knowledge bases. However, the integration of external documents into the generation process raises significant privacy concerns. Indeed, when added to a prompt, it is not possible to guarantee a response will not inadvertently expose confidential data, leading to potential breaches of privacy and ethical dilemmas. This paper explores a practical solution to this problem suitable to general knowledge extraction from personal data. It shows *differentially private token generation* is a viable approach to private RAG.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As the successor to the Segment Anything Model (SAM), the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) not only improves performance in image segmentation but also extends its capabilities to video segmentation. However, its effectiveness in segmenting rare objects that seldom appear in videos remains underexplored. In this study, we evaluate SAM2 on three distinct video segmentation tasks: Video Shadow Detection (VSD) and Video Mirror Detection (VMD). Specifically, we use ground truth point or mask prompts to initialize the first frame and then predict corresponding masks for subsequent frames. Experimental results show that SAM2's performance on these tasks is suboptimal, especially when point prompts are used, both quantitatively and qualitatively.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generating comics through text is widely studied. However, there are few studies on generating multi-panel Manga (Japanese comics) solely based on plain text. Japanese manga contains multiple panels on a single page, with characteristics such as coherence in storytelling, reasonable and diverse page layouts, consistency in characters, and semantic correspondence between panel drawings and panel scripts. Therefore, generating manga poses a significant challenge. This paper presents the manga generation task and constructs the Manga109Story dataset for studying manga generation solely from plain text. Additionally, we propose MangaDiffusion to facilitate the intra-panel and inter-panel information interaction during the manga generation process. The results show that our method particularly ensures the number of panels, reasonable and diverse page layouts. Based on our approach, there is potential to converting a large amount of textual stories into more engaging manga readings, leading to significant application prospects.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Video Question Answering (Video QA) is a challenging video understanding task that requires models to comprehend entire videos, identify the most relevant information based on contextual cues from a given question, and reason accurately to provide answers. Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have transformed video QA by leveraging their exceptional commonsense reasoning capabilities. This progress is largely driven by the effective alignment between visual data and the language space of MLLMs. However, for video QA, an additional space-time alignment poses a considerable challenge for extracting question-relevant information across frames. In this work, we investigate diverse temporal modeling techniques to integrate with MLLMs, aiming to achieve question-guided temporal modeling that leverages pre-trained visual and textual alignment in MLLMs. We propose T-Former, a novel temporal modeling method that creates a question-guided temporal bridge between frame-wise visual perception and the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Our evaluation across multiple video QA benchmarks demonstrates that T-Former competes favorably with existing temporal modeling approaches and aligns with recent advancements in video QA.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) struggle with fine-grained or precise understanding of visuals though they give comprehensive perception and reasoning in a spectrum of vision applications. Recent studies either develop tool-using or unify specific visual tasks into the autoregressive framework, often at the expense of overall multimodal performance. To address this issue and enhance MLLMs with visual tasks in a scalable fashion, we propose Task Preference Optimization (TPO), a novel method that utilizes differentiable task preferences derived from typical fine-grained visual tasks. TPO introduces learnable task tokens that establish connections between multiple task-specific heads and the MLLM. By leveraging rich visual labels during training, TPO significantly enhances the MLLM's multimodal capabilities and task-specific performance. Through multi-task co-training within TPO, we observe synergistic benefits that elevate individual task performance beyond what is achievable through single-task training methodologies. Our instantiation of this approach with VideoChat and LLaVA demonstrates an overall 14.6% improvement in multimodal performance compared to baseline models. Additionally, MLLM-TPO demonstrates robust zero-shot capabilities across various tasks, performing comparably to state-of-the-art supervised models. The code will be released at this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, extraction, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have sparked significant progress in general-purpose vision tasks through visual instruction tuning. While some works have demonstrated the capability of LVLMs to generate segmentation masks that align phrases with natural language descriptions in a single image, they struggle with segmentation-grounded comparisons across multiple images, particularly at finer granularities such as object parts. In this paper, we introduce the new task of part-focused semantic co-segmentation, which seeks to identify and segment common and unique objects and parts across images. To address this task, we present CALICO, the first LVLM that can segment and reason over multiple masks across images, enabling object comparison based on their constituent parts. CALICO features two proposed components, a novel Correspondence Extraction Module, which captures semantic-rich information to identify part-level correspondences between objects, and a Correspondence Adaptation Module, which embeds this information into the LVLM to facilitate multi-image understanding in a parameter-efficient manner. To support training and evaluation, we curate MixedParts, a comprehensive multi-image segmentation dataset containing $\sim$2.4M samples across $\sim$44K images with diverse object and part categories. Experimental results show CALICO, finetuned on only 0.3% of its architecture, achieves robust performance in part-focused semantic co-segmentation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Objective: Extracting PICO elements -- Participants, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcomes -- from clinical trial literature is essential for clinical evidence retrieval, appraisal, and synthesis. Existing approaches do not distinguish the attributes of PICO entities. This study aims to develop a named entity recognition (NER) model to extract PICO entities with fine granularities. Materials and Methods: Using a corpus of 2,511 abstracts with PICO mentions from 4 public datasets, we developed a semi-supervised method to facilitate the training of a NER model, FinePICO, by combining limited annotated data of PICO entities and abundant unlabeled data. For evaluation, we divided the entire dataset into two subsets: a smaller group with annotations and a larger group without annotations. We then established the theoretical lower and upper performance bounds based on the performance of supervised learning models trained solely on the small, annotated subset and on the entire set with complete annotations, respectively. Finally, we evaluated FinePICO on both the smaller annotated subset and the larger, initially unannotated subset. We measured the performance of FinePICO using precision, recall, and F1. Results: Our method achieved precision/recall/F1 of 0.567/0.636/0.60, respectively, using a small set of annotated samples, outperforming the baseline model (F1: 0.437) by more than 16\%. The model demonstrates generalizability to a different PICO framework and to another corpus, which consistently outperforms the benchmark in diverse experimental settings (p-value \textless0.001). Conclusion: This study contributes a generalizable and effective semi-supervised approach to named entity recognition leveraging large unlabeled data together with small, annotated data. It also initially supports fine-grained PICO extraction.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Selective state-space models (SSMs) are an emerging alternative to the Transformer, offering the unique advantage of parallel training and sequential inference. Although these models have shown promising performance on a variety of tasks, their formal expressiveness and length generalization properties remain underexplored. In this work, we provide insight into the workings of selective SSMs by analyzing their expressiveness and length generalization performance on regular language tasks, i.e., finite-state automaton (FSA) emulation. We address certain limitations of modern SSM-based architectures by introducing the Selective Dense State-Space Model (SD-SSM), the first selective SSM that exhibits perfect length generalization on a set of various regular language tasks using a single layer. It utilizes a dictionary of dense transition matrices, a softmax selection mechanism that creates a convex combination of dictionary matrices at each time step, and a readout consisting of layer normalization followed by a linear map. We then proceed to evaluate variants of diagonal selective SSMs by considering their empirical performance on commutative and non-commutative automata. We explain the experimental results with theoretical considerations. Our code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, attack, robust, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated learning (FL) is a distributed training technology that enhances data privacy in mobile edge networks by allowing data owners to collaborate without transmitting raw data to the edge server. However, data heterogeneity and adversarial attacks pose challenges to develop an unbiased and robust global model for edge deployment. To address this, we propose Federated hyBrid Adversarial training and self-adversarial disTillation (FedBAT), a new framework designed to improve both robustness and generalization of the global model. FedBAT seamlessly integrates hybrid adversarial training and self-adversarial distillation into the conventional FL framework from data augmentation and feature distillation perspectives. From a data augmentation perspective, we propose hybrid adversarial training to defend against adversarial attacks by balancing accuracy and robustness through a weighted combination of standard and adversarial training. From a feature distillation perspective, we introduce a novel augmentation-invariant adversarial distillation method that aligns local adversarial features of augmented images with their corresponding unbiased global clean features. This alignment can effectively mitigate bias from data heterogeneity while enhancing both the robustness and generalization of the global model. Extensive experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate that FedBAT yields comparable or superior performance gains in improving robustness while maintaining accuracy compared to several baselines.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present Dynamic Skill Adaptation (DSA), an adaptive and dynamic framework to adapt novel and complex skills to Large Language Models (LLMs). Compared with previous work which learns from human-curated and static data in random orders, we propose to first automatically generate and organize the training data by mimicking the learning pathways of human and then dynamically tailor the training data based on the training dynamics. Specifically, inspired by the learning structures and teaching strategies in the human education system, we first construct a skill graph by decomposing complex skills into sub-skills and arranging them based on their dependencies in human syllables. For every skill, we utilize LLMs to generate both textbook-like data which contains detailed descriptions of skills for pre-training and exercise-like data which targets at explicitly utilizing the skills to solve problems for instruction-tuning. Furthermore, during the instruction-tuning, we dynamically update the training data which down-weight easy-to-learn examples, generate more complex examples, and filter out data with errors. Experiments on large language models such as LLAMA and Mistral demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods in adapting math reasoning skills and social study skills.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Domain adaptation is an active area of research driven by the growing demand for robust machine learning models that perform well on real-world data. Adversarial learning for deep neural networks (DNNs) has emerged as a promising approach to improving generalization ability, particularly for image classification. In this paper, we implement a specific adversarial learning technique known as Adversarial Discriminative Domain Adaptation (ADDA) and replicate digit classification experiments from the original ADDA paper. We extend their findings by examining a broader range of domain shifts and provide a detailed analysis of in-domain classification accuracy post-ADDA. Our results demonstrate that ADDA significantly improves accuracy across certain domain shifts with minimal impact on in-domain performance. Furthermore, we provide qualitative analysis and propose potential explanations for ADDA's limitations in less successful domain shifts. Code is at this https URL .</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Auto-regressive large language models (LLMs) have yielded impressive performance in many real-world tasks. However, the new paradigm of these LLMs also exposes novel threats. In this paper, we explore their vulnerability to inference cost attacks, where a malicious user crafts Engorgio prompts to intentionally increase the computation cost and latency of the inference process. We design Engorgio, a novel methodology, to efficiently generate adversarial Engorgio prompts to affect the target LLM's service availability. Engorgio has the following two technical contributions. (1) We employ a parameterized distribution to track LLMs' prediction trajectory. (2) Targeting the auto-regressive nature of LLMs' inference process, we propose novel loss functions to stably suppress the appearance of the <EOS> token, whose occurrence will interrupt the LLM's generation process. We conduct extensive experiments on 13 open-sourced LLMs with parameters ranging from 125M to 30B. The results show that Engorgio prompts can successfully induce LLMs to generate abnormally long outputs (i.e., roughly 2-13$\times$ longer to reach 90%+ of the output length limit) in a white-box scenario and our real-world experiment demonstrates Engergio's threat to LLM service with limited computing resources.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown satisfactory effects in many autonomous driving tasks. In this paper, MLLMs are utilized to solve joint semantic scene understanding and risk localization tasks, while only relying on front-view images. In the proposed MLLM-SUL framework, a dual-branch visual encoder is first designed to extract features from two resolutions, and rich visual information is conducive to the language model describing risk objects of different sizes accurately. Then for the language generation, LLaMA model is fine-tuned to predict scene descriptions, containing the type of driving scenario, actions of risk objects, and driving intentions and suggestions of ego-vehicle. Ultimately, a transformer-based network incorporating a regression token is trained to locate the risk objects. Extensive experiments on the existing DRAMA-ROLISP dataset and the extended DRAMA-SRIS dataset demonstrate that our method is efficient, surpassing many state-of-the-art image-based and video-based methods. Specifically, our method achieves 80.1% BLEU-1 score and 298.5% CIDEr score in the scene understanding task, and 59.6% accuracy in the localization task.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Image matching for both cross-view and cross-modality plays a critical role in multimodal perception. In practice, the modality gap caused by different imaging systems/styles poses great challenges to the matching task. Existing works try to extract invariant features for specific modalities and train on limited datasets, showing poor generalization. In this paper, we present MINIMA, a unified image matching framework for multiple cross-modal cases. Without pursuing fancy modules, our MINIMA aims to enhance universal performance from the perspective of data scaling up. For such purpose, we propose a simple yet effective data engine that can freely produce a large dataset containing multiple modalities, rich scenarios, and accurate matching labels. Specifically, we scale up the modalities from cheap but rich RGB-only matching data, by means of generative models. Under this setting, the matching labels and rich diversity of the RGB dataset are well inherited by the generated multimodal data. Benefiting from this, we construct MD-syn, a new comprehensive dataset that fills the data gap for general multimodal image matching. With MD-syn, we can directly train any advanced matching pipeline on randomly selected modality pairs to obtain cross-modal ability. Extensive experiments on in-domain and zero-shot matching tasks, including $19$ cross-modal cases, demonstrate that our MINIMA can significantly outperform the baselines and even surpass modality-specific methods.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Consistency Models (CMs) have significantly accelerated the sampling process in diffusion models, yielding impressive results in synthesizing high-resolution images. To explore and extend these advancements to point-cloud-based 3D shape generation, we propose a novel Multi-scale Latent Point Consistency Model (MLPCM). Our MLPCM follows a latent diffusion framework and introduces hierarchical levels of latent representations, ranging from point-level to super-point levels, each corresponding to a different spatial resolution. We design a multi-scale latent integration module along with 3D spatial attention to effectively denoise the point-level latent representations conditioned on those from multiple super-point levels. Additionally, we propose a latent consistency model, learned through consistency distillation, that compresses the prior into a one-step generator. This significantly improves sampling efficiency while preserving the performance of the original teacher model. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks ShapeNet and ShapeNet-Vol demonstrate that MLPCM achieves a 100x speedup in the generation process, while surpassing state-of-the-art diffusion models in terms of both shape quality and diversity.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>De novo generation of hit-like molecules is a challenging task in the drug discovery process. Most methods in previous studies learn the semantics and syntax of molecular structures by analyzing molecular graphs or simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES) strings; however, they do not take into account the drug responses of the biological systems consisting of genes and proteins. In this study we propose a deep generative model, Gx2Mol, which utilizes gene expression profiles to generate molecular structures with desirable phenotypes for arbitrary target proteins. In the algorithm, a variational autoencoder is employed as a feature extractor to learn the latent feature distribution of the gene expression profiles. Then, a long short-term memory is leveraged as the chemical generator to produce syntactically valid SMILES strings that satisfy the feature conditions of the gene expression profile extracted by the feature extractor. Experimental results and case studies demonstrate that the proposed Gx2Mol model can produce new molecules with potential bioactivities and drug-like properties.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Revisiting PCA for Time Series Reduction in Temporal Dimension; Jiaxin Gao, Wenbo Hu, Yuntian Chen; Deep learning has significantly advanced time series analysis (TSA), enabling the extraction of complex patterns for tasks like classification, forecasting, and regression. Although dimensionality reduction has traditionally focused on the variable space-achieving notable success in minimizing data redundancy and computational complexity-less attention has been paid to reducing the temporal dimension. In this study, we revisit Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a classical dimensionality reduction technique, to explore its utility in temporal dimension reduction for time series data. It is generally thought that applying PCA to the temporal dimension would disrupt temporal dependencies, leading to limited exploration in this area. However, our theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate that applying PCA to sliding series windows not only maintains model performance, but also enhances computational efficiency. In auto-regressive forecasting, the temporal structure is partially preserved through windowing, and PCA is applied within these windows to denoise the time series while retaining their statistical information. By preprocessing time-series data with PCA, we reduce the temporal dimensionality before feeding it into TSA models such as Linear, Transformer, CNN, and RNN architectures. This approach accelerates training and inference and reduces resource consumption. Notably, PCA improves Informer training and inference speed by up to 40% and decreases GPU memory usage of TimesNet by 30%, without sacrificing model accuracy. Comparative analysis against other reduction methods further highlights the effectiveness of PCA in improving the efficiency of TSA models.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper proposes a method for long-term action anticipation (LTA), the task of predicting action labels and their duration in a video given the observation of an initial untrimmed video interval. We build on an encoder-decoder architecture with parallel decoding and make two key contributions. First, we introduce a bi-directional action context regularizer module on the top of the decoder that ensures temporal context coherence in temporally adjacent segments. Second, we learn from classified segments a transition matrix that models the probability of transitioning from one action to another and the sequence is optimized globally over the full prediction interval. In addition, we use a specialized encoder for the task of action segmentation to increase the quality of the predictions in the observation interval at inference time, leading to a better understanding of the past. We validate our methods on four benchmark datasets for LTA, the EpicKitchen-55, EGTEA+, 50Salads and Breakfast demonstrating superior or comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods, including probabilistic models and also those based on Large Language Models, that assume trimmed video as input. The code will be released upon acceptance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Capturing feature information effectively is of great importance in the field of computer vision. With the development of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), concepts like residual connection and multiple scales promote continual performance gains in diverse deep learning vision tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel CNN architecture that it consists of residual feature-reutilization inceptions (ResFRI) or split-residual feature-reutilization inceptions (Split-ResFRI). And it is composed of four convolutional combinations of different structures connected by specially designed information interaction passages, which are utilized to extract multi-scale feature information and effectively increase the receptive field of the model. Moreover, according to the network structure designed above, Split-ResFRI can adjust the segmentation ratio of the input information, thereby reducing the number of parameters and guaranteeing the model performance. Specifically, in experiments based on popular vision datasets, such as CIFAR10 ($97.94$\%), CIFAR100 ($85.91$\%) and Tiny Imagenet ($70.54$\%), we obtain state-of-the-art results compared with other modern models under the premise that the model size is approximate and no additional data is used.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This study proposes a knowledge distillation algorithm based on large language models and feature alignment, aiming to effectively transfer the knowledge of large pre-trained models into lightweight student models, thereby reducing computational costs while maintaining high model performance. Different from the traditional soft label distillation method, this method introduces a multi-layer feature alignment strategy to deeply align the intermediate features and attention mechanisms of the teacher model and the student model, maximally retaining the semantic expression ability and context modeling ability of the teacher model. In terms of method design, a multi-task loss function is constructed, including feature matching loss, attention alignment loss, and output distribution matching loss, to ensure multi-level information transfer through joint optimization. The experiments were comprehensively evaluated on the GLUE data set and various natural language processing tasks. The results show that the proposed model performs very close to the state-of-the-art GPT-4 model in terms of evaluation indicators such as perplexity, BLEU, ROUGE, and CER. At the same time, it far exceeds baseline models such as DeBERTa, XLNet, and GPT-3, showing significant performance improvements and computing efficiency advantages. Research results show that the feature alignment distillation strategy is an effective model compression method that can significantly reduce computational overhead and storage requirements while maintaining model capabilities. Future research can be further expanded in the directions of self-supervised learning, cross-modal feature alignment, and multi-task transfer learning to provide more flexible and efficient solutions for the deployment and optimization of deep learning models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative AI has transformed the animation industry. Several models have been developed for image-to-image translation, particularly focusing on converting real-world images into anime through unpaired translation. Scenimefy, a notable approach utilizing contrastive learning, achieves high fidelity anime scene translation by addressing limited paired data through semi-supervised training. However, it faces limitations due to its reliance on paired data from a fine-tuned StyleGAN in the anime domain, often producing low-quality datasets. Additionally, Scenimefy's high parameter architecture presents opportunities for computational optimization. This research introduces NijiGAN, a novel model incorporating Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NeuralODEs), which offer unique advantages in continuous transformation modeling compared to traditional residual networks. NijiGAN successfully transforms real-world scenes into high fidelity anime visuals using half of Scenimefy's parameters. It employs pseudo-paired data generated through Scenimefy for supervised training, eliminating dependence on low-quality paired data and improving the training process. Our comprehensive evaluation includes ablation studies, qualitative, and quantitative analysis comparing NijiGAN to similar models. The testing results demonstrate that NijiGAN produces higher-quality images compared to AnimeGAN, as evidenced by a Mean Opinion Score (MOS) of 2.192, it surpasses AnimeGAN's MOS of 2.160. Furthermore, our model achieved a Frechet Inception Distance (FID) score of 58.71, outperforming Scenimefy's FID score of 60.32. These results demonstrate that NijiGAN achieves competitive performance against existing state-of-the-arts, especially Scenimefy as the baseline model.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vision-centric autonomous driving systems require diverse data for robust training and evaluation, which can be augmented by manipulating object positions and appearances within existing scene captures. While recent advancements in diffusion models have shown promise in video editing, their application to object manipulation in driving scenarios remains challenging due to imprecise positional control and difficulties in preserving high-fidelity object appearances. To address these challenges in position and appearance control, we introduce DriveEditor, a diffusion-based framework for object editing in driving videos. DriveEditor offers a unified framework for comprehensive object editing operations, including repositioning, replacement, deletion, and insertion. These diverse manipulations are all achieved through a shared set of varying inputs, processed by identical position control and appearance maintenance modules. The position control module projects the given 3D bounding box while preserving depth information and hierarchically injects it into the diffusion process, enabling precise control over object position and orientation. The appearance maintenance module preserves consistent attributes with a single reference image by employing a three-tiered approach: low-level detail preservation, high-level semantic maintenance, and the integration of 3D priors from a novel view synthesis model. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate DriveEditor's exceptional fidelity and controllability in generating diverse driving scene edits, as well as its remarkable ability to facilitate downstream tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Objective: To develop a novel deep learning framework for the automated segmentation of colonic polyps in colonoscopy images, overcoming the limitations of current approaches in preserving precise polyp boundaries, incorporating multi-scale features, and modeling spatial dependencies that accurately reflect the intricate and diverse morphology of polyps. Methods: To address these limitations, we propose a novel Multiscale Network with Spatial-enhanced Attention (MNet-SAt) for polyp segmentation in colonoscopy images. This framework incorporates four key modules: Edge-Guided Feature Enrichment (EGFE) preserves edge information for improved boundary quality; Multi-Scale Feature Aggregator (MSFA) extracts and aggregates multi-scale features across channel spatial dimensions, focusing on salient regions; Spatial-Enhanced Attention (SEAt) captures spatial-aware global dependencies within the multi-scale aggregated features, emphasizing the region of interest; and Channel-Enhanced Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (CE-ASPP) resamples and recalibrates attentive features across scales. Results: We evaluated MNet-SAt on the Kvasir-SEG and CVC-ClinicDB datasets, achieving Dice Similarity Coefficients of 96.61% and 98.60%, respectively. Conclusion: Both quantitative (DSC) and qualitative assessments highlight MNet-SAt's superior performance and generalization capabilities compared to existing methods. Significance: MNet-SAt's high accuracy in polyp segmentation holds promise for improving clinical workflows in early polyp detection and more effective treatment, contributing to reduced colorectal cancer mortality rates.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Helmet detection is crucial for advancing protection levels in public road traffic dynamics. This problem statement translates to an object detection task. Therefore, this paper compares recent You Only Look Once (YOLO) models in the context of helmet detection in terms of reliability and computational load. Specifically, YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and the newly released YOLOv11 have been used. Besides, a modified architectural pipeline that remarkably improves the overall performance has been proposed in this manuscript. This hybridized YOLO model (h-YOLO) has been pitted against the independent models for analysis that proves h-YOLO is preferable for helmet detection over plain YOLO models. The models were tested using a range of standard object detection benchmarks such as recall, precision, and mAP (Mean Average Precision). In addition, training and testing times were recorded to provide the overall scope of the models in a real-time detection scenario.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In everyday life, photographs taken with a camera often suffer from motion blur due to hand vibrations or sudden movements. This phenomenon can significantly detract from the quality of the images captured, making it an interesting challenge to develop a deep learning model that utilizes the principles of adversarial networks to restore clarity to these blurred pixels. In this project, we will focus on leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to effectively deblur images affected by motion blur. A GAN-based Tensorflow model is defined, training and evaluating by GoPro dataset which comprises paired street view images featuring both clear and blurred versions. This adversarial training process between Discriminator and Generator helps to produce increasingly realistic images over time. Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) are the two evaluation metrics used to provide quantitative measures of image quality, allowing us to evaluate the effectiveness of the deblurring process. Mean PSNR in 29.1644 and mean SSIM in 0.7459 with average 4.6921 seconds deblurring time are achieved in this project. The blurry pixels are sharper in the output of GAN model shows a good image restoration effect in real world applications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, protect</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we explore the potential of Snapshot Compressive Imaging (SCI) technique for recovering the underlying 3D scene structure from a single temporal compressed image. SCI is a cost-effective method that enables the recording of high-dimensional data, such as hyperspectral or temporal information, into a single image using low-cost 2D imaging sensors. To achieve this, a series of specially designed 2D masks are usually employed, reducing storage and transmission requirements and offering potential privacy protection. Inspired by this, we take one step further to recover the encoded 3D scene information leveraging powerful 3D scene representation capabilities of neural radiance fields (NeRF). Specifically, we propose SCINeRF, in which we formulate the physical imaging process of SCI as part of the training of NeRF, allowing us to exploit its impressive performance in capturing complex scene structures. In addition, we further integrate the popular 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) framework and propose SCISplat to improve 3D scene reconstruction quality and training/rendering speed by explicitly optimizing point clouds into 3D Gaussian representations. To assess the effectiveness of our method, we conduct extensive evaluations using both synthetic data and real data captured by our SCI system. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach surpasses the state-of-the-art methods in terms of image reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Moreover, our method also exhibits the ability to render high frame-rate multi-view consistent images in real time by leveraging SCI and the rendering capabilities of 3DGS.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Live animation has gained immense popularity for enhancing online engagement, yet achieving high-quality, real-time, and stable animation with diffusion models remains challenging, especially on consumer-grade GPUs. Existing methods struggle with generating long, consistent video streams efficiently, often being limited by latency issues and degraded visual quality over extended periods. In this paper, we introduce RAIN, a pipeline solution capable of animating infinite video streams in real-time with low latency using a single RTX 4090 GPU. The core idea of RAIN is to efficiently compute frame-token attention across different noise levels and long time-intervals while simultaneously denoising a significantly larger number of frame-tokens than previous stream-based methods. This design allows RAIN to generate video frames with much shorter latency and faster speed, while maintaining long-range attention over extended video streams, resulting in enhanced continuity and consistency. Consequently, a Stable Diffusion model fine-tuned with RAIN in just a few epochs can produce video streams in real-time and low latency without much compromise in quality or consistency, up to infinite long. Despite its advanced capabilities, the RAIN only introduces a few additional 1D attention blocks, imposing minimal additional burden. Experiments in benchmark datasets and generating super-long videos demonstrating that RAIN can animate characters in real-time with much better quality, accuracy, and consistency than competitors while costing less latency. All code and models will be made publicly available.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recently, deep learning based methods have revolutionized remote sensing image segmentation. However, these methods usually rely on a pre-defined semantic class set, thus needing additional image annotation and model training when adapting to new classes. More importantly, they are unable to segment arbitrary semantic classes. In this work, we introduce Open-Vocabulary Remote Sensing Image Semantic Segmentation (OVRSISS), which aims to segment arbitrary semantic classes in remote sensing images. To address the lack of OVRSISS datasets, we develop LandDiscover50K, a comprehensive dataset of 51,846 images covering 40 diverse semantic classes. In addition, we propose a novel framework named GSNet that integrates domain priors from special remote sensing models and versatile capabilities of general vision-language models. Technically, GSNet consists of a Dual-Stream Image Encoder (DSIE), a Query-Guided Feature Fusion (QGFF), and a Residual Information Preservation Decoder (RIPD). DSIE first captures comprehensive features from both special models and general models in dual streams. Then, with the guidance of variable vocabularies, QGFF integrates specialist and generalist features, enabling them to complement each other. Finally, RIPD is proposed to aggregate multi-source features for more accurate mask predictions. Experiments show that our method outperforms other methods by a large margin, and our proposed LandDiscover50K improves the performance of OVRSISS methods.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, protect</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit impressive potential across various tasks but also face significant privacy risks, limiting their practical applications. Current researches on privacy assessment for LVLMs is limited in scope, with gaps in both assessment dimensions and privacy categories. To bridge this gap, we propose Multi-P$^2$A, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the privacy preservation capabilities of LVLMs in terms of privacy awareness and leakage. Privacy awareness measures the model's ability to recognize the privacy sensitivity of input data, while privacy leakage assesses the risk of the model unintentionally disclosing privacy information in its output. We design a range of sub-tasks to thoroughly evaluate the model's privacy protection offered by LVLMs. Multi-P$^2$A covers 26 categories of personal privacy, 15 categories of trade secrets, and 18 categories of state secrets, totaling 31,962 samples. Based on Multi-P$^2$A, we evaluate the privacy preservation capabilities of 21 open-source and 2 closed-source LVLMs. Our results reveal that current LVLMs generally pose a high risk of facilitating privacy breaches, with vulnerabilities varying across personal privacy, trade secret, and state secret.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled a variety of real-world applications. The large parameter size of VLMs brings large memory and computation overhead which poses significant challenges for deployment. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is an effective technique to reduce the memory and computation overhead. Existing PTQ methods mainly focus on large language models (LLMs), without considering the differences across other modalities. In this paper, we discover that there is a significant difference in sensitivity between language and vision tokens in large VLMs. Therefore, treating tokens from different modalities equally, as in existing PTQ methods, may over-emphasize the insensitive modalities, leading to significant accuracy loss. To deal with the above issue, we propose a simple yet effective method, Modality-Balanced Quantization (MBQ), for large VLMs. Specifically, MBQ incorporates the different sensitivities across modalities during the calibration process to minimize the reconstruction loss for better quantization parameters. Extensive experiments show that MBQ can significantly improve task accuracy by up to 4.4% and 11.6% under W3 and W4A8 quantization for 7B to 70B VLMs, compared to SOTA baselines. Additionally, we implement a W3 GPU kernel that fuses the dequantization and GEMV operators, achieving a 1.4x speedup on LLaVA-onevision-7B on the RTX 4090.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for downstream tasks is a widely adopted approach, but it often leads to safety degradation in safety-aligned LLMs. Currently, many solutions address this issue by incorporating additional safety data, which can be impractical in many cases. In this paper, we address the question: How can we improve downstream task performance while preserving safety in LLMs without relying on additional safety data? We propose a simple and effective method that maintains the inherent safety of LLMs while enhancing their downstream task performance: merging the weights of pre- and post-fine-tuned safety-aligned models. Experimental results across various downstream tasks, models, and merging methods demonstrate that this approach effectively mitigates safety degradation while improving downstream task performance, offering a practical solution for adapting safety-aligned LLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) can correct their self-generated responses, but a decline in accuracy after self-correction is also witnessed. To have a deeper understanding of self-correction, we endeavor to decompose, evaluate, and analyze the self-correction behaviors of LLMs. By enumerating and analyzing answer correctness before and after self-correction, we decompose the self-correction capability into confidence (being confident to correct answers) and critique (turning wrong answers to correct) capabilities, and propose two metrics from a probabilistic perspective to measure these 2 capabilities, along with another metric for overall self-correction capability evaluation. Based on our decomposition and evaluation metrics, we conduct extensive experiments and draw some empirical conclusions. For example, we find different models can exhibit distinct behaviors: some models are confident while others are more critical. We also find the trade-off between the two capabilities (i.e. improving one can lead to a decline in the other) when manipulating model self-correction behavior by prompts or in-context learning. Further, we find a simple yet efficient strategy to improve self-correction capability by transforming Supervision Fine-Tuning (SFT) data format, and our strategy outperforms vanilla SFT in both capabilities and achieves much higher accuracy after self-correction. Our code will be publicly available on GitHub.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Differential equations (DEs) are crucial for modeling the evolution of natural or engineered systems. Traditionally, the parameters in DEs are adjusted to fit data from system observations. However, in fields such as politics, economics, and biology, available data are often independently collected at distinct time points from different subjects (i.e., repeated cross-sectional (RCS) data). Conventional optimization techniques struggle to accurately estimate DE parameters when RCS data exhibit various heterogeneities, leading to a significant loss of information. To address this issue, we propose a new estimation method called the emulator-informed deep-generative model (EIDGM), designed to handle RCS data. Specifically, EIDGM integrates a physics-informed neural network-based emulator that immediately generates DE solutions and a Wasserstein generative adversarial network-based parameter generator that can effectively mimic the RCS data. We evaluated EIDGM on exponential growth, logistic population models, and the Lorenz system, demonstrating its superior ability to accurately capture parameter distributions. Additionally, we applied EIDGM to an experimental dataset of Amyloid beta 40 and beta 42, successfully capturing diverse parameter distribution shapes. This shows that EIDGM can be applied to model a wide range of systems and extended to uncover the operating principles of systems based on limited data.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In text-to-image (T2I) generation, a prevalent training technique involves utilizing Vision Language Models (VLMs) for image re-captioning. Even though VLMs are known to exhibit hallucination, generating descriptive content that deviates from the visual reality, the ramifications of such caption hallucinations on T2I generation performance remain under-explored. Through our empirical investigation, we first establish a comprehensive dataset comprising VLM-generated captions, and then systematically analyze how caption hallucination influences generation outcomes. Our findings reveal that (1) the disparities in caption quality persistently impact model outputs during fine-tuning. (2) VLMs confidence scores serve as reliable indicators for detecting and characterizing noise-related patterns in the data distribution. (3) even subtle variations in caption fidelity have significant effects on the quality of learned representations. These findings collectively emphasize the profound impact of caption quality on model performance and highlight the need for more sophisticated robust training algorithm in T2I. In response to these observations, we propose a approach leveraging VLM confidence score to mitigate caption noise, thereby enhancing the robustness of T2I models against hallucination in caption.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent research in subject-driven generation increasingly emphasizes the importance of selective subject features. Nevertheless, accurately selecting the content in a given reference image still poses challenges, especially when selecting the similar subjects in an image (e.g., two different dogs). Some methods attempt to use text prompts or pixel masks to isolate specific elements. However, text prompts often fall short in precisely describing specific content, and pixel masks are often expensive. To address this, we introduce P3S-Diffusion, a novel architecture designed for context-selected subject-driven generation via point supervision. P3S-Diffusion leverages minimal cost label (e.g., points) to generate subject-driven images. During fine-tuning, it can generate an expanded base mask from these points, obviating the need for additional segmentation models. The mask is employed for inpainting and aligning with subject representation. The P3S-Diffusion preserves fine features of the subjects through Multi-layers Condition Injection. Enhanced by the Attention Consistency Loss for improved training, extensive experiments demonstrate its excellent feature preservation and image generation capabilities.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Style transfer aims to generate a new image preserving the content but with the artistic representation of the style source. Most of the existing methods are based on Transformers or diffusion models, however, they suffer from quadratic computational complexity and high inference time. RWKV, as an emerging deep sequence models, has shown immense potential for long-context sequence modeling in NLP tasks. In this work, we present a novel framework StyleRWKV, to achieve high-quality style transfer with limited memory usage and linear time complexity. Specifically, we propose a Recurrent WKV (Re-WKV) attention mechanism, which incorporates bidirectional attention to establish a global receptive field. Additionally, we develop a Deformable Shifting (Deform-Shifting) layer that introduces learnable offsets to the sampling grid of the convolution kernel, allowing tokens to shift flexibly and adaptively from the region of interest, thereby enhancing the model's ability to capture local dependencies. Finally, we propose a Skip Scanning (S-Scanning) method that effectively establishes global contextual dependencies. Extensive experiments with analysis including qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of stylization quality, model complexity, and inference efficiency.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep generative models are proficient in generating realistic data but struggle with producing rare samples in low density regions due to their scarcity of training datasets and the mode collapse problem. While recent methods aim to improve the fidelity of generated samples, they often reduce diversity and coverage by ignoring rare and novel samples. This study proposes a novel approach for generating diverse rare samples from high-resolution image datasets with pretrained GANs. Our method employs gradient-based optimization of latent vectors within a multi-objective framework and utilizes normalizing flows for density estimation on the feature space. This enables the generation of diverse rare images, with controllable parameters for rarity, diversity, and similarity to a reference image. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach both qualitatively and quantitatively across various datasets and GANs without retraining or fine-tuning the pretrained GANs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Semantic parsing, which converts natural language questions into logic forms, plays a crucial role in reasoning within structured environments. However, existing methods encounter two significant challenges: reliance on extensive manually annotated datasets and limited generalization capability to unseen examples. To tackle these issues, we propose Targeted Synthetic Data Generation (TARGA), a practical framework that dynamically generates high-relevance synthetic data without manual annotation. Starting from the pertinent entities and relations of a given question, we probe for the potential relevant queries through layer-wise expansion and cross-layer combination. Then we generate corresponding natural language questions for these constructed queries to jointly serve as the synthetic demonstrations for in-context learning. Experiments on multiple knowledge base question answering (KBQA) datasets demonstrate that TARGA, using only a 7B-parameter model, substantially outperforms existing non-fine-tuned methods that utilize close-sourced model, achieving notable improvements in F1 scores on GrailQA(+7.7) and KBQA-Agent(+12.2). Furthermore, TARGA also exhibits superior sample efficiency, robustness, and generalization capabilities under non-I.I.D. settings.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Human beings can leverage knowledge from relative tasks to improve learning on a primary task. Similarly, multi-task learning methods suggest using auxiliary tasks to enhance a neural network's performance on a specific primary task. However, previous methods often select auxiliary tasks carefully but treat them as secondary during training. The weights assigned to auxiliary losses are typically smaller than the primary loss weight, leading to insufficient training on auxiliary tasks and ultimately failing to support the main task effectively. To address this issue, we propose an uncertainty-based impartial learning method that ensures balanced training across all tasks. Additionally, we consider both gradients and uncertainty information during backpropagation to further improve performance on the primary task. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves performance comparable to or better than state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, our weighting strategy is effective and robust in enhancing the performance of the primary task regardless the noise auxiliary tasks' pseudo labels.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Image Quality Assessment (IQA) with references plays an important role in optimizing and evaluating computer vision tasks. Traditional methods assume that all pixels of the reference and test images are fully aligned. Such Aligned-Reference IQA (AR-IQA) approaches fail to address many real-world problems with various geometric deformations between the two images. Although significant effort has been made to attack Geometrically-Disparate-Reference IQA (GDR-IQA) problem, it has been addressed in a task-dependent fashion, for example, by dedicated designs for image super-resolution and retargeting, or by assuming the geometric distortions to be small that can be countered by translation-robust filters or by explicit image registrations. Here we rethink this problem and propose a unified, non-training-based Deep Structural Similarity (DeepSSIM) approach to address the above problems in a single framework, which assesses structural similarity of deep features in a simple but efficient way and uses an attention calibration strategy to alleviate attention deviation. The proposed method, without application-specific design, achieves state-of-the-art performance on AR-IQA datasets and meanwhile shows strong robustness to various GDR-IQA test cases. Interestingly, our test also shows the effectiveness of DeepSSIM as an optimization tool for training image super-resolution, enhancement and restoration, implying an even wider generalizability. \footnote{Source code will be made public after the review is completed.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In many domains of empirical sciences, discovering the causal structure within variables remains an indispensable task. Recently, to tackle with unoriented edges or latent assumptions violation suffered by conventional methods, researchers formulated a reinforcement learning (RL) procedure for causal discovery, and equipped REINFORCE algorithm to search for the best-rewarded directed acyclic graph. The two keys to the overall performance of the procedure are the robustness of RL methods and the efficient encoding of variables. However, on the one hand, REINFORCE is prone to local convergence and unstable performance during training. Neither trust region policy optimization, being computationally-expensive, nor proximal policy optimization (PPO), suffering from aggregate constraint deviation, is decent alternative for combinatory optimization problems with considerable individual subactions. We propose a trust region-navigated clipping policy optimization method for causal discovery that guarantees both better search efficiency and steadiness in policy optimization, in comparison with REINFORCE, PPO and our prioritized sampling-guided REINFORCE implementation. On the other hand, to boost the efficient encoding of variables, we propose a refined graph attention encoder called SDGAT that can grasp more feature information without priori neighbourhood information. With these improvements, the proposed method outperforms former RL method in both synthetic and benchmark datasets in terms of output results and optimization robustness.</li>

Our proposed method is termed DAS3R, an abbreviation for Dynamics-Aware Gaussian Splatting for Static Scene Reconstruction. Compared to existing methods, DAS3R is more robust in complex motion scenarios, capable of handling videos where dynamic objects occupy a significant portion of the scene, and does not require camera pose inputs or point cloud data from SLAM-based methods. We compared DAS3R against recent distractor-free approaches on the DAVIS and Sintel datasets; DAS3R demonstrates enhanced performance and robustness with a margin of more than 2 dB in PSNR.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Drug-target interaction is fundamental in understanding how drugs affect biological systems, and accurately predicting drug-target affinity (DTA) is vital for drug discovery. Recently, deep learning methods have emerged as a significant approach for estimating the binding strength between drugs and target proteins. However, existing methods simply utilize the drug's local information from molecular topology rather than global information. Additionally, the features of drugs and proteins are usually fused with a simple concatenation operation, limiting their effectiveness. To address these challenges, we proposed ViDTA, an enhanced DTA prediction framework. We introduce virtual nodes into the Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based drug feature extraction network, which acts as a global memory to exchange messages more efficiently. By incorporating virtual graph nodes, we seamlessly integrate local and global features of drug molecular structures, expanding the GNN's receptive field. Additionally, we propose an attention-based linear feature fusion network for better capturing the interaction information between drugs and proteins.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, robust, watermark</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Watermarking is an effective way to trace model-generated content. Current watermark methods cannot resist forgery attacks, such as a deceptive claim that the model-generated content is a response to a fabricated prompt. None of them can be made unforgeable without degrading robustness. Unforgeability demands that the watermarked output is not only detectable but also verifiable for integrity, indicating whether it has been modified. This underscores the necessity and significance of a multi-bit watermarking scheme. Recent works try to build multi-bit scheme based on existing zero-bit watermarking scheme, but they either degrades the robustness or brings a significant computational burden. We aim to design a novel single-bit watermark scheme, which provides the ability to embed 2 different watermark signals. This paper's main contribution is that we are the first to propose an undetectable, robust, single-bit watermarking scheme. It has a comparable robustness to the most advanced zero-bit watermarking schemes. Then we construct a multi-bit watermarking scheme to use the hash value of prompt or the newest generated content as the watermark signals, and embed them into the following content, which guarantees the unforgeability. Additionally, we provide sufficient experiments on some popular language models, while the other advanced methods with provable guarantees do not often provide. The results show that our method is practically effective and robust.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance across various tasks, but the escalating demands on computational resources pose significant challenges, particularly in the extensive utilization of full fine-tuning for downstream tasks. To address this, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods have been developed, but they often underperform compared to full fine-tuning and struggle with memory efficiency. In this work, we introduce Gradient Weight-Normalized Low-Rank Projection (GradNormLoRP), a novel approach that enhances both parameter and memory efficiency while maintaining comparable performance to full fine-tuning. GradNormLoRP normalizes the weight matrix to improve gradient conditioning, facilitating better convergence during optimization. Additionally, it applies low-rank approximations to the weight and gradient matrices, significantly reducing memory usage during training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our 8-bit GradNormLoRP reduces optimizer memory usage by up to 89.5% and enables the pre-training of large LLMs, such as LLaMA 7B, on consumer-level GPUs like the NVIDIA RTX 4090, without additional inference costs. Moreover, GradNormLoRP outperforms existing low-rank methods in fine-tuning tasks. For instance, when fine-tuning the RoBERTa model on all GLUE tasks with a rank of 8, GradNormLoRP achieves an average score of 80.65, surpassing LoRA's score of 79.23. These results underscore GradNormLoRP as a promising alternative for efficient LLM pre-training and fine-tuning. Source code and Appendix: this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in vision transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated the advantage of global modeling capabilities, prompting widespread integration of large-kernel convolutions for enlarging the effective receptive field (ERF). However, the quadratic scaling of parameter count and computational complexity (FLOPs) with respect to kernel size poses significant efficiency and optimization challenges. This paper introduces RecConv, a recursive decomposition strategy that efficiently constructs multi-frequency representations using small-kernel convolutions. RecConv establishes a linear relationship between parameter growth and decomposing levels which determines the effective kernel size $k\times 2^\ell$ for a base kernel $k$ and $\ell$ levels of decomposition, while maintaining constant FLOPs regardless of the ERF expansion. Specifically, RecConv achieves a parameter expansion of only $\ell+2$ times and a maximum FLOPs increase of $5/3$ times, compared to the exponential growth ($4^\ell$) of standard and depthwise convolutions. RecNeXt-M3 outperforms RepViT-M1.1 by 1.9 $AP^{box}$ on COCO with similar FLOPs. This innovation provides a promising avenue towards designing efficient and compact networks across various modalities. Codes and models can be found at \url{this https URL}.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Zero-shot customized video generation has gained significant attention due to its substantial application potential. Existing methods rely on additional models to extract and inject reference subject features, assuming that the Video Diffusion Model (VDM) alone is insufficient for zero-shot customized video generation. However, these methods often struggle to maintain consistent subject appearance due to suboptimal feature extraction and injection techniques. In this paper, we reveal that VDM inherently possesses the force to extract and inject subject features. Departing from previous heuristic approaches, we introduce a novel framework that leverages VDM's inherent force to enable high-quality zero-shot customized video generation. Specifically, for feature extraction, we directly input reference images into VDM and use its intrinsic feature extraction process, which not only provides fine-grained features but also significantly aligns with VDM's pre-trained knowledge. For feature injection, we devise an innovative bidirectional interaction between subject features and generated content through spatial self-attention within VDM, ensuring that VDM has better subject fidelity while maintaining the diversity of the generated this http URL on both customized human and object video generation validate the effectiveness of our framework.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The application of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) in Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) research powerful cross-modal semantic understanding capabilities. Existing methods attempt to optimize input text prompts for improved alignment of images and text, by finely adjusting text prototypes to facilitate semantic matching. Nevertheless, given the modality gap between text and vision spaces, the text prototypes employed by these methods have not effectively established a close correspondence with pixel-level vision features. In this work, our theoretical analysis indicates that the inherent modality gap results in misalignment of text and region features, and that this gap cannot be sufficiently reduced by minimizing contrast loss in CLIP. To mitigate the impact of the modality gap, we propose a Vision Prototype Learning (VPL) framework, by introducing more representative vision prototypes. The core of this framework is to learn class-specific vision prototypes in vision space with the help of text prototypes, for capturing high-quality localization maps. Moreover, we propose a regional semantic contrast module that contrasts regions embedding with corresponding prototypes, leading to more comprehensive and robust feature learning. Experimental results show that our proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, privacy, generative, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Linguistic steganography embeds secret information in seemingly innocent texts, safeguarding privacy in surveillance environments. Generative linguistic steganography leverages the probability distribution of language models (LMs) and applies steganographic algorithms to generate stego tokens, gaining attention with recent Large Language Model (LLM) advancements. To enhance security, researchers develop distribution-preserving stego algorithms to minimize the gap between stego sampling and LM sampling. However, the reliance on language model distributions, coupled with deviations from real-world cover texts, results in insufficient imperceptibility when facing steganalysis detectors in real-world scenarios. Moreover, LLM distributions tend to be more deterministic, resulting in reduced entropy and, consequently, lower embedding capacity. In this paper, we propose FreStega, a plug-and-play method to reconstruct the distribution of language models used for generative linguistic steganography. FreStega dynamically adjusts token probabilities from the language model at each step of stegotext auto-regressive generation, leveraging both sequential and spatial dimensions. In sequential adjustment, the temperature is dynamically adjusted based on instantaneous entropy, enhancing the diversity of stego texts and boosting embedding capacity. In the spatial dimension, the distribution is aligned with guidance from the target domain corpus, closely mimicking real cover text in the target domain. By reforming the distribution, FreStega enhances the imperceptibility of stego text in practical scenarios and improves steganographic capacity by 15.41\%, all without compromising the quality of the generated text. FreStega serves as a plug-and-play remedy to enhance the imperceptibility and embedding capacity of existing distribution-preserving steganography methods in real-world scenarios.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>federate, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Geographic health disparities pose a pressing global challenge, particularly in underserved regions of low- and middle-income nations. Addressing this issue requires a collaborative approach to enhance healthcare quality, leveraging support from medically more developed areas. Federated learning emerges as a promising tool for this purpose. However, the scarcity of medical data and limited computation resources in underserved regions make collaborative training of powerful machine learning models challenging. Furthermore, there exists an asymmetrical reciprocity between underserved and developed regions. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel cross-silo federated learning framework, named FedHelp, aimed at alleviating geographic health disparities and fortifying the diagnostic capabilities of underserved regions. Specifically, FedHelp leverages foundational model knowledge via one-time API access to guide the learning process of underserved small clients, addressing the challenge of insufficient data. Additionally, we introduce a novel asymmetric dual knowledge distillation module to manage the issue of asymmetric reciprocity, facilitating the exchange of necessary knowledge between developed large clients and underserved small clients. We validate the effectiveness and utility of FedHelp through extensive experiments on both medical image classification and segmentation tasks. The experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvement compared to state-of-the-art baselines, particularly benefiting clients in underserved regions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Computer-aided design (CAD) significantly enhances the efficiency, accuracy, and innovation of design processes by enabling precise 2D and 3D modeling, extensive analysis, and optimization. Existing methods for creating CAD models rely on latent vectors or point clouds, which are difficult to obtain and costly to store. Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have inspired researchers to use natural language instructions and images for CAD model construction. However, these models still struggle with inferring accurate 3D spatial location and orientation, leading to inaccuracies in determining the spatial 3D starting points and extrusion directions for constructing geometries. This work introduces CAD-GPT, a CAD synthesis method with spatial reasoning-enhanced MLLM that takes either a single image or a textual description as input. To achieve precise spatial inference, our approach introduces a 3D Modeling Spatial Mechanism. This method maps 3D spatial positions and 3D sketch plane rotation angles into a 1D linguistic feature space using a specialized spatial unfolding mechanism, while discretizing 2D sketch coordinates into an appropriate planar space to enable precise determination of spatial starting position, sketch orientation, and 2D sketch coordinate translations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CAD-GPT consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in CAD model synthesis, both quantitatively and qualitatively.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Transformer-based methods have recently achieved significant success in 3D human pose estimation, owing to their strong ability to model long-range dependencies. However, relying solely on the global attention mechanism is insufficient for capturing the fine-grained local details, which are crucial for accurate pose estimation. To address this, we propose SSR-STF, a dual-stream model that effectively integrates local features with global dependencies to enhance 3D human pose estimation. Specifically, we introduce SSRFormer, a simple yet effective module that employs the skeleton selective refine attention (SSRA) mechanism to capture fine-grained local dependencies in human pose sequences, complementing the global dependencies modeled by the Transformer. By adaptively fusing these two feature streams, SSR-STF can better learn the underlying structure of human poses, overcoming the limitations of traditional methods in local feature extraction. Extensive experiments on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets demonstrate that SSR-STF achieves state-of-the-art performance, with P1 errors of 37.4 mm and 13.2 mm respectively, outperforming existing methods in both accuracy and generalization. Furthermore, the motion representations learned by our model prove effective in downstream tasks such as human mesh recovery. Codes are available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Image forgery localization, which centers on identifying tampered pixels within an image, has seen significant advancements. Traditional approaches often model this challenge as a variant of image segmentation, treating the binary segmentation of forged areas as the end product. We argue that the basic binary forgery mask is inadequate for explaining model predictions. It doesn't clarify why the model pinpoints certain areas and treats all forged pixels the same, making it hard to spot the most fake-looking parts. In this study, we mitigate the aforementioned limitations by generating salient region-focused interpretation for the forgery images. To support this, we craft a Multi-Modal Tramper Tracing (MMTT) dataset, comprising facial images manipulated using deepfake techniques and paired with manual, interpretable textual annotations. To harvest high-quality annotation, annotators are instructed to meticulously observe the manipulated images and articulate the typical characteristics of the forgery regions. Subsequently, we collect a dataset of 128,303 image-text pairs. Leveraging the MMTT dataset, we develop ForgeryTalker, an architecture designed for concurrent forgery localization and interpretation. ForgeryTalker first trains a forgery prompter network to identify the pivotal clues within the explanatory text. Subsequently, the region prompter is incorporated into multimodal large language model for finetuning to achieve the dual goals of localization and interpretation. Extensive experiments conducted on the MMTT dataset verify the superior performance of our proposed model. The dataset, code as well as pretrained checkpoints will be made publicly available to facilitate further research and ensure the reproducibility of our results.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this work, we investigate automatic design composition from multimodal graphic elements. Although recent studies have developed various generative models for graphic design, they usually face the following limitations: they only focus on certain subtasks and are far from achieving the design composition task; they do not consider the hierarchical information of graphic designs during the generation process. To tackle these issues, we introduce the layered design principle into Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) and propose a novel approach, called LaDeCo, to accomplish this challenging task. Specifically, LaDeCo first performs layer planning for a given element set, dividing the input elements into different semantic layers according to their contents. Based on the planning results, it subsequently predicts element attributes that control the design composition in a layer-wise manner, and includes the rendered image of previously generated layers into the context. With this insightful design, LaDeCo decomposes the difficult task into smaller manageable steps, making the generation process smoother and clearer. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of LaDeCo in design composition. Furthermore, we show that LaDeCo enables some interesting applications in graphic design, such as resolution adjustment, element filling, design variation, etc. In addition, it even outperforms the specialized models in some design subtasks without any task-specific training.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Within the evolving landscape of smart homes, the precise recognition of daily living activities using ambient sensor data stands paramount. This paper not only aims to bolster existing algorithms by evaluating two distinct pretrained embeddings suited for ambient sensor activations but also introduces a novel hierarchical architecture. We delve into an architecture anchored on Transformer Decoder-based pre-trained embeddings, reminiscent of the GPT design, and contrast it with the previously established state-of-the-art (SOTA) ELMo embeddings for ambient sensors. Our proposed hierarchical structure leverages the strengths of each pre-trained embedding, enabling the discernment of activity dependencies and sequence order, thereby enhancing classification precision. To further refine recognition, we incorporate into our proposed architecture an hour-of-the-day embedding. Empirical evaluations underscore the preeminence of the Transformer Decoder embedding in classification endeavors. Additionally, our innovative hierarchical design significantly bolsters the efficacy of both pre-trained embeddings, notably in capturing inter-activity nuances. The integration of temporal aspects subtly but distinctively augments classification, especially for time-sensitive activities. In conclusion, our GPT-inspired hierarchical approach, infused with temporal insights, outshines the SOTA ELMo benchmark.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Adversarial attacks exploit the vulnerabilities of convolutional neural networks by introducing imperceptible perturbations that lead to misclassifications, exposing weaknesses in feature representations and decision boundaries. This paper presents a novel framework combining supervised contrastive learning and margin-based contrastive loss to enhance adversarial robustness. Supervised contrastive learning improves the structure of the feature space by clustering embeddings of samples within the same class and separating those from different classes. Margin-based contrastive loss, inspired by support vector machines, enforces explicit constraints to create robust decision boundaries with well-defined margins. Experiments on the CIFAR-100 dataset with a ResNet-18 backbone demonstrate robustness performance improvements in adversarial accuracy under Fast Gradient Sign Method attacks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large-scale video generation models have the inherent ability to realistically model natural scenes. In this paper, we demonstrate that through a careful design of a generative video propagation framework, various video tasks can be addressed in a unified way by leveraging the generative power of such models. Specifically, our framework, GenProp, encodes the original video with a selective content encoder and propagates the changes made to the first frame using an image-to-video generation model. We propose a data generation scheme to cover multiple video tasks based on instance-level video segmentation datasets. Our model is trained by incorporating a mask prediction decoder head and optimizing a region-aware loss to aid the encoder to preserve the original content while the generation model propagates the modified region. This novel design opens up new possibilities: In editing scenarios, GenProp allows substantial changes to an object's shape; for insertion, the inserted objects can exhibit independent motion; for removal, GenProp effectively removes effects like shadows and reflections from the whole video; for tracking, GenProp is capable of tracking objects and their associated effects together. Experiment results demonstrate the leading performance of our model in various video tasks, and we further provide in-depth analyses of the proposed framework.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Migrating Fortran code to C++ is a common task for many scientific computing teams, driven by the need to leverage modern programming paradigms, enhance cross-platform compatibility, and improve maintainability. Automating this translation process using large language models (LLMs) has shown promise, but the lack of high-quality, specialized datasets has hindered their effectiveness. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing a novel multi-turn dialogue dataset, Fortran2CPP, specifically designed for Fortran-to-C++ code migration. Our dataset, significantly larger than existing alternatives, is generated using a unique LLM-driven, dual-agent pipeline incorporating iterative compilation, execution, and code repair to ensure high quality and functional correctness. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our dataset, we fine-tuned several open-weight LLMs on Fortran2CPP and evaluated their performance on two independent benchmarks. Fine-tuning on our dataset led to remarkable gains, with models achieving up to a 3.31x increase in CodeBLEU score and a 92\% improvement in compilation success rate. This highlights the dataset's ability to enhance both the syntactic accuracy and compilability of the translated C++ code. Our dataset and model have been open-sourced and are available on our public GitHub repository\footnote{\url{this https URL}}.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Tensor networks are a tool first employed in the context of many-body quantum physics that now have a wide range of uses across the computational sciences, from numerical methods to machine learning. Methods integrating tensor networks into evolutionary optimization algorithms have appeared in the recent literature. In essence, these methods can be understood as replacing the traditional crossover operation of a genetic algorithm with a tensor network-based generative model. We investigate these methods from the point of view that they are Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs). We find that optimization performance of these methods is not related to the power of the generative model in a straightforward way. Generative models that are better (in the sense that they better model the distribution from which their training data is drawn) do not necessarily result in better performance of the optimization algorithm they form a part of. This raises the question of how best to incorporate powerful generative models into optimization routines. In light of this we find that adding an explicit mutation operator to the output of the generative model often improves optimization performance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Language model alignment has become a critical step in training modern generative language models. The goal of alignment is to finetune a reference model such that the win rate of a sample from the aligned model over a sample from the reference model is high, subject to a KL divergence constraint. Today, we are increasingly using inference-time algorithms (e.g., Best-of-N, controlled decoding, tree search) to decode from language models rather than standard sampling. However, the alignment objective does not capture such inference-time decoding procedures. We show that the existing alignment framework is sub-optimal in view of such inference-time methods. We then modify the alignment objective and propose a framework for inference-aware alignment (IAPO). We prove that for any inference-time decoding algorithm, the optimal solution that optimizes the inference-time win rate of the aligned policy against the reference policy is the solution to the typical RLHF problem with a transformation of the reward. This motivates us to provide the KL-regularized calibrate-and-transform RL (CTRL) algorithm to solve this problem, which involves a reward calibration step and a KL-regularized reward maximization step with a transformation of the calibrated reward. We particularize our study to two important inference-time strategies: best-of-N sampling and best-of-N jailbreaking, where N responses are sampled from the model and the one with the highest or lowest reward is selected. We propose specific transformations for these strategies and demonstrate that our framework offers significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods for language model alignment. Empirically, we outperform baselines that are designed without taking inference-time decoding into consideration by 8-12% and 4-9% on inference-time win rates over the Anthropic helpfulness and harmlessness dialog benchmark datasets.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled significant progress in complex video understanding tasks. However, their robustness to real-world manipulations remains underexplored, limiting their reliability in critical applications. To address this gap, we introduce MVTamperBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate VLM's resilience to video tampering effects, including rotation, dropping, masking, substitution, and repetition. By systematically assessing state-of-the-art models, MVTamperBench reveals substantial variability in robustness, with models like InternVL2-8B achieving high performance, while others, such as Llama-VILA1.5-8B, exhibit severe vulnerabilities. To foster broader adoption and reproducibility, MVTamperBench is integrated into VLMEvalKit, a modular evaluation toolkit, enabling streamlined testing and facilitating advancements in model robustness. Our benchmark represents a critical step towards developing tamper-resilient VLMs, ensuring their dependability in real-world scenarios. Project Page: this https URL</li>
