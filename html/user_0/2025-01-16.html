<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multilingual large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities across a variety of languages. However, efficacy can differ greatly between different language families, especially for those with limited linguistic resources. This report presents MERaLiON-TextLLM, a series of open-source language models specifically tailored to improve understanding and generation in Chinese, Indonesian, Malay, and Singlish. The initial released model is built on Llama-3-8B-Base and refined through a meticulously crafted process of continued pre-training and weight merging. Our approach achieves performance improvements across benchmarks in these languages, exceeding the capabilities of the official Llama-3 models. We provide the model checkpoints as a resource to support further research and development in cross-lingual language understanding.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Compositional image retrieval (CIR) is a multimodal learning task where a model combines a query image with a user-provided text modification to retrieve a target image. CIR finds applications in a variety of domains including product retrieval (e-commerce) and web search. Existing methods primarily focus on fully-supervised learning, wherein models are trained on datasets of labeled triplets such as FashionIQ and CIRR. This poses two significant challenges: (i) curating such triplet datasets is labor intensive; and (ii) models lack generalization to unseen objects and domains. In this work, we propose SCOT (Self-supervised COmpositional Training), a novel zero-shot compositional pretraining strategy that combines existing large image-text pair datasets with the generative capabilities of large language models to contrastively train an embedding composition network. Specifically, we show that the text embedding from a large-scale contrastively-pretrained vision-language model can be utilized as proxy target supervision during compositional pretraining, replacing the target image embedding. In zero-shot settings, this strategy surpasses SOTA zero-shot compositional retrieval methods as well as many fully-supervised methods on standard benchmarks such as FashionIQ and CIRR.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Empirical risk minimization (ERM) is not robust to changes in the distribution of data. When the distribution of test data is different from that of training data, the problem is known as out-of-distribution generalization. Recently, two techniques have been developed for addressing out-of-distribution generalization in computer vision: weight averaging (WA) and sharpness-aware minimization (SAM). WA involves training multiple models with different hyperparameters and then averaging the weights of these models, which can significantly improve out-of-distribution generalization performance. SAM optimizes a neural network to find minima in flat regions, which have been proven to perform well under distribution shifts. While these techniques have made great progress, there is still room for improvement and further exploration. In this thesis, we propose increasing the model diversity in WA explicitly by introducing gradient similarity as a loss regularizer to further improve out-of-distribution generalization performance. We also propose combining WA and SAM to solve the problem of few-shot domain adaptation. Our extensive experiments on digits datasets (MNIST, SVHN, USPS, MNIST-M) and other domain adaptation datasets (VLCS, PACS) show that combining WA and SAM leads to improved out-of-distribution generalization performance and significantly increases few-shot domain adaptation accuracy.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Free-text responses are commonly collected in psychological studies, providing rich qualitative insights that quantitative measures may not capture. Labeling curated topics of research interest in free-text data by multiple trained human coders is typically labor-intensive and time-consuming. Though large language models (LLMs) excel in language processing, LLM-assisted labeling techniques relying on closed-source LLMs cannot be directly applied to free-text data, without explicit consent for external use. In this study, we propose a framework of assembling locally-deployable LLMs to enhance the labeling of predetermined topics in free-text data under privacy constraints. Analogous to annotation by multiple human raters, this framework leverages the heterogeneity of diverse open-source LLMs. The ensemble approach seeks a balance between the agreement and disagreement across LLMs, guided by a relevancy scoring methodology that utilizes embedding distances between topic descriptions and LLMs' reasoning. We evaluated the ensemble approach using both publicly accessible Reddit data from eating disorder related forums, and free-text responses from eating disorder patients, both complemented by human annotations. We found that: (1) there is heterogeneity in the performance of labeling among same-sized LLMs, with some showing low sensitivity but high precision, while others exhibit high sensitivity but low precision. (2) Compared to individual LLMs, the ensemble of LLMs achieved the highest accuracy and optimal precision-sensitivity trade-off in predicting human annotations. (3) The relevancy scores across LLMs showed greater agreement than dichotomous labels, indicating that the relevancy scoring method effectively mitigates the heterogeneity in LLMs' labeling.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent studies have revealed that modern image and video quality assessment (IQA/VQA) metrics are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. An attacker can manipulate a video through preprocessing to artificially increase its quality score according to a certain metric, despite no actual improvement in visual quality. Most of the attacks studied in the literature are white-box attacks, while black-box attacks in the context of VQA have received less attention. Moreover, some research indicates a lack of transferability of adversarial examples generated for one model to another when applied to VQA. In this paper, we propose a cross-modal attack method, IC2VQA, aimed at exploring the vulnerabilities of modern VQA models. This approach is motivated by the observation that the low-level feature spaces of images and videos are similar. We investigate the transferability of adversarial perturbations across different modalities; specifically, we analyze how adversarial perturbations generated on a white-box IQA model with an additional CLIP module can effectively target a VQA model. The addition of the CLIP module serves as a valuable aid in increasing transferability, as the CLIP model is known for its effective capture of low-level semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IC2VQA achieves a high success rate in attacking three black-box VQA models. We compare our method with existing black-box attack strategies, highlighting its superiority in terms of attack success within the same number of iterations and levels of attack strength. We believe that the proposed method will contribute to the deeper analysis of robust VQA metrics.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper we analyze the behaviour of the stochastic gradient descent (SGD), a widely used method in supervised learning for optimizing neural network weights via a minimization of non-convex loss functions. Since the pioneering work of E, Li and Tai (2017), the underlying structure of such processes can be understood via parabolic PDEs of Fokker-Planck type, which are at the core of our analysis. Even if Fokker-Planck equations have a long history and a extensive literature, almost nothing is known when the potential is non-convex or when the diffusion matrix is degenerate, and this is the main difficulty that we face in our analysis. We identify two different regimes: in the initial phase of SGD, the loss function drives the weights to concentrate around the nearest local minimum. We refer to this phase as the drift regime and we provide quantitative estimates on this concentration phenomenon. Next, we introduce the diffusion regime, where stochastic fluctuations help the learning process to escape suboptimal local minima. We analyze the Mean Exit Time (MET) and prove upper and lower bounds of the MET. Finally, we address the asymptotic convergence of SGD, for a non-convex cost function and a degenerate diffusion matrix, that do not allow to use the standard approaches, and require new techniques. For this purpose, we exploit two different methods: duality and entropy methods. We provide new results about the dynamics and effectiveness of SGD, offering a deep connection between stochastic optimization and PDE theory, and some answers and insights to basic questions in the Machine Learning processes: How long does SGD take to escape from a bad minimum? Do neural network parameters converge using SGD? How do parameters evolve in the first stage of training with SGD?</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Note: This paper includes examples of potentially offensive content related to religious bias, presented solely for academic purposes. The widespread adoption of language models highlights the need for critical examinations of their inherent biases, particularly concerning religion. This study systematically investigates religious bias in both language models and text-to-image generation models, analyzing both open-source and closed-source systems. We construct approximately 400 unique, naturally occurring prompts to probe language models for religious bias across diverse tasks, including mask filling, prompt completion, and image generation. Our experiments reveal concerning instances of underlying stereotypes and biases associated disproportionately with certain religions. Additionally, we explore cross-domain biases, examining how religious bias intersects with demographic factors such as gender, age, and nationality. This study further evaluates the effectiveness of targeted debiasing techniques by employing corrective prompts designed to mitigate the identified biases. Our findings demonstrate that language models continue to exhibit significant biases in both text and image generation tasks, emphasizing the urgent need to develop fairer language models to achieve global acceptability.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved significant success in multimodal tasks by combining pre-trained vision encoders and large language models. However, current LVLMs mainly rely on features from the final layers of the vision encoder, neglecting complementary information in shallower layers. While recent methods have explored multi-layer features, they are often task-agnostic. We investigate the contributions of visual features from different encoder layers across 18 benchmarks and 6 task categories. Our results show that multi-layer features provide complementary strengths with varying task dependencies, and uniform fusion performs suboptimally. Based on these findings, we propose an instruction-guided vision aggregator that dynamically integrates multi-layer features based on textual instructions, without increasing the number of visual tokens. Extensive evaluations show superior performance, and analysis reveals the dominance of mid-to-high-level features in semantic tasks and the critical role of low-level features in fine-grained perception. This work provides valuable insights into the adaptive use of hierarchical visual features in LVLMs, advancing more flexible multimodal systems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Human pose estimation, a vital task in computer vision, involves detecting and localising human joints in images and videos. While single-frame pose estimation has seen significant progress, it often fails to capture the temporal dynamics for understanding complex, continuous movements. We propose Poseidon, a novel multi-frame pose estimation architecture that extends the ViTPose model by integrating temporal information for enhanced accuracy and robustness to address these limitations. Poseidon introduces key innovations: (1) an Adaptive Frame Weighting (AFW) mechanism that dynamically prioritises frames based on their relevance, ensuring that the model focuses on the most informative data; (2) a Multi-Scale Feature Fusion (MSFF) module that aggregates features from different backbone layers to capture both fine-grained details and high-level semantics; and (3) a Cross-Attention module for effective information exchange between central and contextual frames, enhancing the model's temporal coherence. The proposed architecture improves performance in complex video scenarios and offers scalability and computational efficiency suitable for real-world applications. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PoseTrack21 and PoseTrack18 datasets, achieving mAP scores of 88.3 and 87.8, respectively, outperforming existing methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, protect</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Through the lens of the system of differential privacy specifications developed in Part I of a trio of articles, this second paper examines two statistical disclosure control (SDC) methods for the United States Decennial Census: the Permutation Swapping Algorithm (PSA), which is similar to the 2010 Census's disclosure avoidance system (DAS), and the TopDown Algorithm (TDA), which was used in the 2020 DAS. To varying degrees, both methods leave unaltered some statistics of the confidential data $\unicode{x2013}$ which are called the method's invariants $\unicode{x2013}$ and hence neither can be readily reconciled with differential privacy (DP), at least as it was originally conceived. Nevertheless, we establish that the PSA satisfies $\varepsilon$-DP subject to the invariants it necessarily induces, thereby showing that this traditional SDC method can in fact still be understood within our more-general system of DP specifications. By a similar modification to $\rho$-zero concentrated DP, we also provide a DP specification for the TDA. Finally, as a point of comparison, we consider the counterfactual scenario in which the PSA was adopted for the 2020 Census, resulting in a reduction in the nominal privacy loss, but at the cost of releasing many more invariants. Therefore, while our results explicate the mathematical guarantees of SDC provided by the PSA, the TDA and the 2020 DAS in general, care must be taken in their translation to actual privacy protection $\unicode{x2013}$ just as is the case for any DP deployment.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>protect, attack, membership infer, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) have become essential digital task assistance tools. Their training relies heavily on the collection of vast amounts of data, which may include copyright-protected or sensitive information. Recent studies on the detection of pretraining data in LLMs have primarily focused on sentence-level or paragraph-level membership inference attacks (MIAs), usually involving probability analysis of the target model prediction tokens. However, the proposed methods often demonstrate poor performance, specifically in terms of accuracy, failing to account for the semantic importance of textual content and word significance. To address these shortcomings, we propose Tag&Tab, a novel approach for detecting data that has been used as part of the LLM pretraining. Our method leverages advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to tag keywords in the input text - a process we term Tagging. Then, the LLM is used to obtain the probabilities of these keywords and calculate their average log-likelihood to determine input text membership, a process we refer to as Tabbing. Our experiments on three benchmark datasets (BookMIA, MIMIR, and the Pile) and several open-source LLMs of varying sizes demonstrate an average increase in the AUC scores ranging from 4.1% to 12.1% over state-of-the-art methods. Tag&Tab not only sets a new standard for data leakage detection in LLMs, but its outstanding performance is a testament to the importance of words in MIAs on LLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Unlocking the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in data classification represents a promising frontier in natural language processing. In this work, we evaluate the performance of different LLMs in comparison with state-of-the-art deep-learning and machine-learning models, in two different classification scenarios: i) the classification of employees' working locations based on job reviews posted online (multiclass classification), and 2) the classification of news articles as fake or not (binary classification). Our analysis encompasses a diverse range of language models differentiating in size, quantization, and architecture. We explore the impact of alternative prompting techniques and evaluate the models based on the weighted F1-score. Also, we examine the trade-off between performance (F1-score) and time (inference response time) for each language model to provide a more nuanced understanding of each model's practical applicability. Our work reveals significant variations in model responses based on the prompting strategies. We find that LLMs, particularly Llama3 and GPT-4, can outperform traditional methods in complex classification tasks, such as multiclass classification, though at the cost of longer inference times. In contrast, simpler ML models offer better performance-to-time trade-offs in simpler binary classification tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the current era of Machine Learning, Transformers have become the de facto approach across a variety of domains, such as computer vision and natural language processing. Transformer-based solutions are the backbone of current state-of-the-art methods for language generation, image and video classification, segmentation, action and object recognition, among many others. Interestingly enough, while these state-of-the-art methods produce impressive results in their respective domains, the problem of understanding the relationship between vision and language is still beyond our reach. In this work, we propose a common ground between vision and language based on events in space and time in an explainable and programmatic way, to connect learning-based vision and language state of the art models and provide a solution to the long standing problem of describing videos in natural language. We validate that our algorithmic approach is able to generate coherent, rich and relevant textual descriptions on videos collected from a variety of datasets, using both standard metrics (e.g. Bleu, ROUGE) and the modern LLM-as-a-Jury approach.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The research related to digital twins has been increasing in recent years. Besides the mirroring of the physical word into the digital, there is the need of providing services related to the data collected and transferred to the virtual world. One of these services is the forecasting of physical part future behavior, that could lead to applications, like preventing harmful events or designing improvements to get better performance. One strategy used to predict any system operation it is the use of time series models like ARIMA or LSTM, and improvements were implemented using these algorithms. Recently, deep learning techniques based on generative models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been proposed to create time series and the use of LSTM has gained more relevance in time series forecasting, but both have limitations that restrict the forecasting results. Another issue found in the literature is the challenge of handling multivariate environments/applications in time series generation. Therefore, new methods need to be studied in order to fill these gaps and, consequently, provide better resources for creating useful digital twins. In this proposal, it is going to be studied the integration of a BiLSTM layer with a time series obtained by GAN in order to improve the forecasting of all the features provided by the dataset in terms of accuracy and, consequently, improving behaviour prediction.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Quantifying prediction uncertainty when applying object detection models to new, unlabeled datasets is critical in applied machine learning. This study introduces an approach to estimate the performance of deep learning-based object detection models for quantifying defects in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, focusing on detecting irradiation-induced cavities in TEM images of metal alloys. We developed a random forest regression model that predicts the object detection F1 score, a statistical metric used to evaluate the ability to accurately locate and classify objects of interest. The random forest model uses features extracted from the predictions of the object detection model whose uncertainty is being quantified, enabling fast prediction on new, unlabeled images. The mean absolute error (MAE) for predicting F1 of the trained model on test data is 0.09, and the $R^2$ score is 0.77, indicating there is a significant correlation between the random forest regression model predicted and true defect detection F1 scores. The approach is shown to be robust across three distinct TEM image datasets with varying imaging and material domains. Our approach enables users to estimate the reliability of a defect detection and segmentation model predictions and assess the applicability of the model to their specific datasets, providing valuable information about possible domain shifts and whether the model needs to be fine-tuned or trained on additional data to be maximally effective for the desired use case.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We describe a method for modeling spatial context to enable video anomaly detection.

We demonstrate that this straightforward approach, using orders of magnitude fewer parameters than competing models, achieves state-of-the-art performance in the challenging spatial-context-dependent Street Scene dataset. As a side benefit, the high-resolution discovered regions learned by the model also provide explainable normalcy maps for human operators without the need for any pre-trained segmentation model.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has gained significant importance with the growing use of sensor-equipped devices and large datasets. This paper evaluates the performance of three categories of models : classical machine learning, deep learning architectures, and Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) using five key benchmark datasets of HAR (UCI-HAR, OPPORTUNITY, PAMAP2, WISDM, and Berkeley MHAD). We assess various models, including Decision Trees, Random Forests, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Deep Belief Networks (DBNs), using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for a comprehensive comparison. The results show that CNN models offer superior performance across all datasets, especially on the Berkeley MHAD. Classical models like Random Forest do well on smaller datasets but face challenges with larger, more complex data. RBM-based models also show notable potential, particularly for feature learning. This paper offers a detailed comparison to help researchers choose the most suitable model for HAR tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Remote sensing imagery is dense with objects and contextual visual information. There is a recent trend to combine paired satellite images and text captions for pretraining performant encoders for downstream tasks. However, while contrastive image-text methods like CLIP enable vision-language alignment and zero-shot classification ability, vision-only downstream performance tends to degrade compared to image-only pretraining, such as MAE. In this paper, we propose FLAVARS, a pretraining method that combines the best of both contrastive learning and masked modeling, along with geospatial alignment via contrastive location encoding. We find that FLAVARS significantly outperforms a baseline of SkyCLIP for vision-only tasks such as KNN classification and semantic segmentation, +6\% mIOU on SpaceNet1, while retaining the ability to perform zero-shot classification, unlike MAE pretrained methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Contrary to the conventional emphasis on dataset size, we explore the role of data alignment -- an often overlooked aspect of data quality -- in training capable Large Language Models (LLMs). To do so, we use the Task2Vec-based alignment coefficient, a quantitative measure of the similarity between two datasets, to quantify the impact of alignment between training data and evaluation data on downstream performance. In particular, we conduct controlled \textit{interventional} experiments for two settings: 1. the impact of increased alignment coefficients between various pre-training (pt) against evaluation datasets, and 2. the impact of increased alignment coefficients between domain specific fine-tuning (ft) against domain specific evaluation. The domain specific task we explore is Autoformalization -- the machine translation task between natural language and code for formal verification. In both settings, we find a strong, predictable negative correlation between the alignment coefficient of a model's training and evaluation data and the model's loss/perplexity on the respective downstream task. These findings suggest a re-evaluation of LLM training approaches, demonstrating the relevance of data alignment compared to data quantity, especially in specialized downstream tasks such as Autoformalization.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is a powerful approach of automating the design of efficient neural architectures. In contrast to traditional NAS methods, recently proposed one-shot NAS methods prove to be more efficient in performing NAS. One-shot NAS works by generating a singular weight-sharing supernetwork that acts as a search space (container) of subnetworks. Despite its achievements, designing the one-shot search space remains a major challenge. In this work we propose a search space design strategy for Vision Transformer (ViT)-based architectures. In particular, we convert the Segment Anything Model (SAM) into a weight-sharing supernetwork called SuperSAM. Our approach involves automating the search space design via layer-wise structured pruning and parameter prioritization. While the structured pruning applies probabilistic removal of certain transformer layers, parameter prioritization performs weight reordering and slicing of MLP-blocks in the remaining layers. We train supernetworks on several datasets using the sandwich rule. For deployment, we enhance subnetwork discovery by utilizing a program autotuner to identify efficient subnetworks within the search space. The resulting subnetworks are 30-70% smaller in size compared to the original pre-trained SAM ViT-B, yet outperform the pretrained model. Our work introduces a new and effective method for ViT NAS search-space design.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative AI presents transformative potential across various domains, from creative arts to scientific visualization. However, the utility of AI-generated imagery is often compromised by visual flaws, including anatomical inaccuracies, improper object placements, and misplaced textual elements. These imperfections pose significant challenges for practical applications. To overcome these limitations, we introduce \textit{Yuan}, a novel framework that autonomously corrects visual imperfections in text-to-image synthesis. \textit{Yuan} uniquely conditions on both the textual prompt and the segmented image, generating precise masks that identify areas in need of refinement without requiring manual intervention -- a common constraint in previous methodologies. Following the automated masking process, an advanced inpainting module seamlessly integrates contextually coherent content into the identified regions, preserving the integrity and fidelity of the original image and associated text prompts. Through extensive experimentation on publicly available datasets such as ImageNet100 and Stanford Dogs, along with a custom-generated dataset, \textit{Yuan} demonstrated superior performance in eliminating visual imperfections. Our approach consistently achieved higher scores in quantitative metrics, including NIQE, BRISQUE, and PI, alongside favorable qualitative evaluations. These results underscore \textit{Yuan}'s potential to significantly enhance the quality and applicability of AI-generated images across diverse fields.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multi-modal explanation involves the assessment of the veracity of a variety of different content, and relies on multiple information modalities to comprehensively consider the relevance and consistency between modalities. Most existing fake news video detection methods focus on improving accuracy while ignoring the importance of providing explanations. In this paper, we propose a novel problem - Fake News Video Explanation (FNVE) - Given a multimodal news containing both video and caption text, we aim to generate natural language explanations to reveal the truth of predictions. To this end, we develop FakeNVE, a new dataset of explanations for truthfully multimodal posts, where each explanation is a natural language (English) sentence describing the attribution of a news thread. We benchmark FakeNVE by using a multimodal transformer-based architecture. Subsequently, a BART-based autoregressive decoder is used as the generator. Empirical results show compelling results for various baselines (applicable to FNVE) across multiple evaluation metrics. We also perform human evaluation on explanation generation, achieving high scores for both adequacy and fluency.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a decentralized machine learning technique, allowing clients to train a global model collaboratively without sharing private data. However, most FL studies ignore the crucial challenge of heterogeneous domains where each client has a distinct feature distribution, which is common in real-world scenarios. Prototype learning, which leverages the mean feature vectors within the same classes, has become a prominent solution for federated learning under domain skew. However, existing federated prototype learning methods only consider inter-domain prototypes on the server and overlook intra-domain characteristics. In this work, we introduce a novel federated prototype learning method, namely I$^2$PFL, which incorporates $\textbf{I}$ntra-domain and $\textbf{I}$nter-domain $\textbf{P}$rototypes, to mitigate domain shifts and learn a generalized global model across multiple domains in federated learning. To construct intra-domain prototypes, we propose feature alignment with MixUp-based augmented prototypes to capture the diversity of local domains and enhance the generalization of local features. Additionally, we introduce a reweighting mechanism for inter-domain prototypes to generate generalized prototypes to provide inter-domain knowledge and reduce domain skew across multiple clients. Extensive experiments on the Digits, Office-10, and PACS datasets illustrate the superior performance of our method compared to other baselines.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The field of artificial intelligence has witnessed significant advancements in natural language processing, largely attributed to the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). These models form the backbone of Agents designed to address long-context dependencies, particularly in Document-level Machine Translation (DocMT). DocMT presents unique challenges, with quality, consistency, and fluency being the key metrics for evaluation. Existing approaches, such as Doc2Doc and Doc2Sent, either omit sentences or compromise fluency. This paper introduces Doc-Guided Sent2Sent++, an Agent that employs an incremental sentence-level forced decoding strategy \textbf{to ensure every sentence is translated while enhancing the fluency of adjacent sentences.} Our Agent leverages a Doc-Guided Memory, focusing solely on the summary and its translation, which we find to be an efficient approach to maintaining consistency. Through extensive testing across multiple languages and domains, we demonstrate that Sent2Sent++ outperforms other methods in terms of quality, consistency, and fluency. The results indicate that, our approach has achieved significant improvements in metrics such as s-COMET, d-COMET, LTCR-$1_f$, and document-level perplexity (d-ppl). The contributions of this paper include a detailed analysis of current DocMT research, the introduction of the Sent2Sent++ decoding method, the Doc-Guided Memory mechanism, and validation of its effectiveness across languages and domains.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Transformers have demonstrated impressive capabilities across various tasks, yet their performance on compositional problems remains a subject of debate. In this study, we investigate the internal mechanisms underlying Transformers' behavior in compositional tasks. We find that complexity control strategies significantly influence whether the model learns primitive-level rules that generalize out-of-distribution (reasoning-based solutions) or relies solely on memorized mappings (memory-based solutions). By applying masking strategies to the model's information circuits and employing multiple complexity metrics, we reveal distinct internal working mechanisms associated with different solution types. Further analysis reveals that reasoning-based solutions exhibit a lower complexity bias, which aligns with the well-studied neuron condensation phenomenon. This lower complexity bias is hypothesized to be the key factor enabling these solutions to learn reasoning rules. We validate these conclusions across multiple real-world datasets, including image generation and natural language processing tasks, confirming the broad applicability of our findings.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Existing methods for Video Reasoning Segmentation rely heavily on a single special token to represent the object in the keyframe or the entire video, inadequately capturing spatial complexity and inter-frame motion. To overcome these challenges, we propose VRS-HQ, an end-to-end video reasoning segmentation approach that leverages Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to inject rich spatiotemporal features into hierarchical this http URL key innovations include a Temporal Dynamic Aggregation (TDA) and a Token-driven Keyframe Selection (TKS). Specifically, we design frame-level <SEG> and temporal-level <TAK> tokens that utilize MLLM's autoregressive learning to effectively capture both local and global information. Subsequently, we apply a similarity-based weighted fusion and frame selection strategy, then utilize SAM2 to perform keyframe segmentation and propagation. To enhance keyframe localization accuracy, the TKS filters keyframes based on SAM2's occlusion scores during inference. VRS-HQ achieves state-of-the-art performance on ReVOS, surpassing VISA by 5.9%/12.5%/9.1% in J&F scores across the three subsets. These results highlight the strong temporal reasoning and segmentation capabilities of our method. Code and model weights will be released at VRS-HQ.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Modern blockchains increasingly consist of multiple clients that implement the blockchain protocol. If there is a semantic mismatch between the protocol implementations, the blockchain can permanently split and introduce new attack vectors. Current ad-hoc test suites for client implementations are not sufficient to ensure a high degree of protocol conformance. As an alternative, we present a framework that performs protocol conformance testing using a formal model of the protocol and an implementation running inside a deterministic blockchain simulator. Our framework consists of two complementary workflows that use the components as trace generators and checkers. Our insight is that both workflows are needed to detect all types of violations. We have applied and demonstrated the utility of our framework on an industrial strength consensus protocol.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Face swapping transfers the identity of a source face to a target face while retaining the attributes like expression, pose, hair, and background of the target face. Advanced face swapping methods have achieved attractive results. However, these methods often inadvertently transfer identity information from the target face, compromising expression-related details and accurate identity. We propose a novel method DynamicFace that leverages the power of diffusion model and plug-and-play temporal layers for video face swapping. First, we introduce four fine-grained face conditions using 3D facial priors. All conditions are designed to be disentangled from each other for precise and unique control. Then, we adopt Face Former and ReferenceNet for high-level and detailed identity injection. Through experiments on the FF++ dataset, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results in face swapping, showcasing superior image quality, identity preservation, and expression accuracy. Besides, our method could be easily transferred to video domain with temporal attention layer. Our code and results will be available on the project page: this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, extraction, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Feature extraction techniques are crucial in medical image classification; however, classical feature extractors in addition to traditional machine learning classifiers often exhibit significant limitations in providing sufficient discriminative information for complex image sets. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformer (ViT) have shown promise in feature extraction, they are prone to overfitting due to the inherent characteristics of medical imaging data, including small sample sizes or high intra-class variance. In this work, the Medical Image Attention-based Feature Extractor (MIAFEx) is proposed, a novel method that employs a learnable refinement mechanism to enhance the classification token within the Transformer encoder architecture. This mechanism adjusts the token based on learned weights, improving the extraction of salient features and enhancing the model's adaptability to the challenges presented by medical imaging data. The MIAFEx output features quality is compared against classical feature extractors using traditional and hybrid classifiers. Also, the performance of these features is compared against modern CNN and ViT models in classification tasks, demonstrating its superiority in accuracy and robustness across multiple complex classification medical imaging datasets. This advantage is particularly pronounced in scenarios with limited training data, where traditional and modern models often struggle to generalize effectively.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The softmax function is a cornerstone of multi-class classification, integral to a wide range of machine learning applications, from large-scale retrieval and ranking models to advanced large language models. However, its computational cost grows linearly with the number of classes, which becomes prohibitively expensive in scenarios with millions or even billions of classes. The sampled softmax, which relies on self-normalized importance sampling, has emerged as a powerful alternative, significantly reducing computational complexity. Yet, its estimator remains unbiased only when the sampling distribution matches the true softmax distribution. To improve both approximation accuracy and sampling efficiency, we propose the MIDX Sampler, a novel adaptive sampling strategy based on an inverted multi-index approach. Concretely, we decompose the softmax probability into several multinomial probabilities, each associated with a specific set of codewords and the last associated with the residual score of queries, thus reducing time complexity to the number of codewords instead of the number of classes. To further boost efficiency, we replace the query-specific residual probability with a simple uniform distribution, simplifying the computation while retaining high performance. Our method is backed by rigorous theoretical analysis, addressing key concerns such as sampling bias, gradient bias, convergence rates, and generalization error bounds. The results demonstrate that a smaller divergence from the ideal softmax distribution leads to faster convergence and improved generalization. Extensive experiments on large-scale language models, sequential recommenders, and extreme multi-class classification tasks confirm that the MIDX-Sampler delivers superior effectiveness and efficiency compared to existing approaches.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Improving the length extrapolation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) remains a critical challenge in natural language processing. Many recent efforts have focused on modifying the scaled dot-product attention mechanism, and often introduce scaled temperatures without rigorous theoretical justification. To fill this gap, we introduce a novel approach based on information entropy invariance. We propose two new scaled temperatures to enhance length extrapolation. First, a training-free method InfoScale is designed for dot-product attention, and preserves focus on original tokens during length extrapolation by ensuring information entropy remains consistent. Second, we theoretically analyze the impact of scaling (CosScale) on cosine attention. Experimental data demonstrates that combining InfoScale and CosScale achieves state-of-the-art performance on the GAU-{\alpha} model with a context window extended to 64 times the training length, and outperforms seven existing methods. Our analysis reveals that significantly increasing CosScale approximates windowed attention, and highlights the significance of attention score dilution as a key challenge in long-range context handling.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the domain of computer vision, Parameter-Efficient Tuning (PET) is increasingly replacing the traditional paradigm of pre-training followed by full fine-tuning. PET is particularly favored for its effectiveness in large foundation models, as it streamlines transfer learning costs and optimizes hardware utilization. However, the current PET methods are mainly designed for single-modal optimization. While some pioneering studies have undertaken preliminary explorations, they still remain at the level of aligned encoders (e.g., CLIP) and lack exploration of misaligned encoders. These methods show sub-optimal performance with misaligned encoders, as they fail to effectively align the multimodal features during fine-tuning. In this paper, we introduce DETRIS, a parameter-efficient tuning framework designed to enhance low-rank visual feature propagation by establishing dense interconnections between each layer and all preceding layers, which enables effective cross-modal feature interaction and adaptation to misaligned encoders. We also suggest using text adapters to improve textual features. Our simple yet efficient approach greatly surpasses state-of-the-art methods with 0.9% to 1.8% backbone parameter updates, evaluated on challenging benchmarks.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Existing low-rank adaptation (LoRA) methods face challenges on sparse large language models (LLMs) due to the inability to maintain sparsity. Recent works introduced methods that maintain sparsity by augmenting LoRA techniques with additional masking mechanisms. Despite these successes, such approaches suffer from an increased memory and computation overhead, which affects efficiency of LoRA methods. In response to this limitation, we introduce LoRS, an innovative method designed to achieve both memory and computation efficiency when fine-tuning sparse LLMs. To mitigate the substantial memory and computation demands associated with preserving sparsity, our approach incorporates strategies of weight recompute and computational graph rearrangement. In addition, we also improve the effectiveness of LoRS through better adapter initialization. These innovations lead to a notable reduction in memory and computation consumption during the fine-tuning phase, all while achieving performance levels that outperform existing LoRA approaches.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in multimodal tasks, but their performance is often constrained by the lack of external knowledge integration, limiting their ability to handle knowledge-intensive tasks such as visual question answering and reasoning. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method, Adaptive Knowledge-Guided Pretraining for Large Vision-Language Models (AKGP-LVLM), which dynamically incorporates structured and unstructured knowledge into LVLMs during pretraining and fine-tuning. Our approach employs a knowledge encoder to represent external knowledge, a retrieval mechanism to select task-relevant information, and a dynamic adaptor to align multimodal and knowledge representations effectively. We evaluate our method on four benchmark datasets, demonstrating significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, human evaluations highlight the superior correctness and relevance of our model's outputs. Extensive analyses confirm the robustness, efficiency, and scalability of AKGP-LVLM, making it a compelling solution for real-world knowledge-intensive tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, extraction, watermark, diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper introduces a novel approach to enhance the performance of Gaussian Shading, a prevalent watermarking technique, by integrating the Exact Diffusion Inversion via Coupled Transformations (EDICT) framework. While Gaussian Shading traditionally embeds watermarks in a noise latent space, followed by iterative denoising for image generation and noise addition for watermark recovery, its inversion process is not exact, leading to potential watermark distortion. We propose to leverage EDICT's ability to derive exact inverse mappings to refine this process. Our method involves duplicating the watermark-infused noisy latent and employing a reciprocal, alternating denoising and noising scheme between the two latents, facilitated by EDICT. This allows for a more precise reconstruction of both the image and the embedded watermark. Empirical evaluation on standard datasets demonstrates that our integrated approach yields a slight, yet statistically significant improvement in watermark recovery fidelity. These results highlight the potential of EDICT to enhance existing diffusion-based watermarking techniques by providing a more accurate and robust inversion mechanism. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explore the synergy between EDICT and Gaussian Shading for digital watermarking, opening new avenues for research in robust and high-fidelity watermark embedding and extraction.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As the Internet rapidly expands, the increasing complexity and diversity of network activities pose significant challenges to effective network governance and security regulation. Network traffic, which serves as a crucial data carrier of network activities, has become indispensable in this process. Network traffic detection aims to monitor, analyze, and evaluate the data flows transmitted across the network to ensure network security and optimize performance. However, existing network traffic detection methods generally suffer from several limitations: 1) a narrow focus on characterizing traffic features from a single perspective; 2) insufficient exploration of discriminative features for different traffic; 3) poor generalization to different traffic scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a multi-view correlation-aware framework named FlowID for network traffic detection. FlowID captures multi-view traffic features via temporal and interaction awareness, while a hypergraph encoder further explores higher-order relationships between flows. To overcome the challenges of data imbalance and label scarcity, we design a dual-contrastive proxy task, enhancing the framework's ability to differentiate between various traffic flows through traffic-to-traffic and group-to-group contrast. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate that FlowID significantly outperforms existing methods in accuracy, robustness, and generalization across diverse network scenarios, particularly in detecting malicious traffic.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The recent successful paradigm of solving logical reasoning problems with tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) leverages translation of natural language statements into First-Order Logic~(FOL) and external theorem provers. However, the correctness of FOL statements, comprising operators and text predicates, often goes unverified due to the lack of a reliable evaluation metric for comparing generated and ground-truth FOLs. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of sensitivity of existing metrics and their alignment with human judgement on FOL evaluation. Using ground-truth FOLs, we carefully designed various perturbations on the ground-truth to assess metric sensitivity. We sample FOL translation candidates for natural language statements and measure the ranking alignment between automatic metrics and human annotators. Our empirical findings highlight oversensitivity in the n-gram metric BLEU for text perturbations, the semantic graph metric Smatch++ for structural perturbations, and FOL metric for operator perturbation. We also observe a closer alignment between BertScore and human judgement. Additionally, we show that combining metrics enhances both alignment and sensitivity compared to using individual metrics.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Modern privacy regulations have spurred the evolution of machine unlearning, a technique enabling a trained model to efficiently forget specific training data. In prior unlearning methods, the concept of "data forgetting" is often interpreted and implemented as achieving zero classification accuracy on such data. Nevertheless, the authentic aim of machine unlearning is to achieve alignment between the unlearned model and the gold model, i.e., encouraging them to have identical classification accuracy. On the other hand, the gold model often exhibits non-zero classification accuracy due to its generalization ability. To achieve aligned data forgetting, we propose a Twin Machine Unlearning (TMU) approach, where a twin unlearning problem is defined corresponding to the original unlearning problem. Consequently, the generalization-label predictor trained on the twin problem can be transferred to the original problem, facilitating aligned data forgetting. Comprehensive empirical experiments illustrate that our approach significantly enhances the alignment between the unlearned model and the gold model.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative AI systems like foundation models (FMs) must align well with human values to ensure their behavior is helpful and trustworthy. While Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has shown promise for optimizing model performance using human judgments, existing RLHF pipelines predominantly rely on immediate feedback, which can fail to accurately reflect the downstream impact of an interaction on users' utility. We demonstrate that feedback based on evaluators' foresight estimates of downstream consequences systematically induces Goodhart's Law dynamics, incentivizing misaligned behaviors like sycophancy and deception and ultimately degrading user outcomes. To alleviate this, we propose decoupling evaluation from prediction by refocusing RLHF on hindsight feedback. Our theoretical analysis reveals that conditioning evaluator feedback on downstream observations mitigates misalignment and improves expected human utility, even when these observations are simulated by the AI system itself. To leverage this insight in a practical alignment algorithm, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Hindsight Simulation (RLHS), which first simulates plausible consequences and then elicits feedback to assess what behaviors were genuinely beneficial in hindsight. We apply RLHS to two widely-employed online and offline preference optimization methods -- Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) -- and show empirically that misalignment is significantly reduced with both methods. Through an online human user study, we show that RLHS consistently outperforms RLHF in helping users achieve their goals and earns higher satisfaction ratings, despite being trained solely with simulated hindsight feedback. These results underscore the importance of focusing on long-term consequences, even simulated ones, to mitigate misalignment in RLHF.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>All natural languages are structured hierarchically. In humans, this structural restriction is neurologically coded: when two grammars are presented with identical vocabularies, brain areas responsible for language processing are only sensitive to hierarchical grammars. Using large language models (LLMs), we investigate whether such functionally distinct hierarchical processing regions can arise solely from exposure to large-scale language distributions. We generate inputs using English, Italian, Japanese, or nonce words, varying the underlying grammars to conform to either hierarchical or linear/positional rules. Using these grammars, we first observe that language models show distinct behaviors on hierarchical versus linearly structured inputs. Then, we find that the components responsible for processing hierarchical grammars are distinct from those that process linear grammars; we causally verify this in ablation experiments. Finally, we observe that hierarchy-selective components are also active on nonce grammars; this suggests that hierarchy sensitivity is not tied to meaning, nor in-distribution inputs.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Accurately predicting renewable energy output is crucial for the efficient integration of solar and wind power into modern energy systems. This study develops and evaluates an advanced deep learning model, Channel-Time Patch Time-Series Transformer (CT-PatchTST), to forecast the power output of photovoltaic and wind energy systems using annual offshore wind power, onshore wind power, and solar power generation data from Denmark. While the original Patch Time-Series Transformer(PatchTST) model employs a channel-independent (CI) approach, it tends to overlook inter-channel relationships during training, potentially leading to a loss of critical information. To address this limitation and further leverage the benefits of increased data granularity brought by CI, we propose CT-PatchTST. This enhanced model improves the processing of inter-channel information while maintaining the advantages of the channel-independent approach. The predictive performance of CT-PatchTST is rigorously analyzed, demonstrating its ability to provide precise and reliable energy forecasts. This work contributes to improving the predictability of renewable energy systems, supporting their broader adoption and integration into energy grids.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the growing complexity of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and the integration of Internet of Things (IoT), the use of sensors for online monitoring generates large volume of multivariate time series (MTS) data. Consequently, the need for robust anomaly diagnosis in MTS is paramount to maintaining system reliability and safety. While significant advancements have been made in anomaly detection, localization remains a largely underexplored area, though crucial for intelligent decision-making. This paper introduces a novel transformer-based model for unsupervised anomaly diagnosis in MTS, with a focus on improving localization performance, through an in-depth analysis of the self-attention mechanism's learning behavior under both normal and anomalous conditions. We formulate the anomaly localization problem as a three-stage process: time-step, window, and segment-based. This leads to the development of the Space-Time Anomaly Score (STAS), a new metric inspired by the connection between transformer latent representations and space-time statistical models. STAS is designed to capture individual anomaly behaviors and inter-series dependencies, delivering enhanced localization performance. Additionally, the Statistical Feature Anomaly Score (SFAS) complements STAS by analyzing statistical features around anomalies, with their combination helping to reduce false alarms. Experiments on real world and synthetic datasets illustrate the model's superiority over state-of-the-art methods in both detection and localization tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) have spurred development in multiple industries. However, the growing number of their parameters brings substantial storage and computing burdens, making it essential to explore model compression techniques for parameter reduction and easier deployment. We propose SWSC, an LLM compression method based on the concept of Shared Weight for Similar Channel. It uses the K-Means clustering algorithm to cluster model weights channel-by-channel, generating clusters with highly similar vectors within each. A representative vector from each cluster is selected to approximately replace all vectors in the cluster, significantly reducing the number of model weight parameters. However, approximate restoration will inevitably cause damage to the performance of the model. To tackle this issue, we perform singular value decomposition on the weight error values before and after compression and retain the larger singular values and their corresponding singular vectors to compensate for the accuracy. The experimental results show that our method can effectively ensure the performance of the compressed LLM even under low-precision conditions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The relationship between language and thought remains an unresolved philosophical issue. Existing viewpoints can be broadly categorized into two schools: one asserting their independence, and another arguing that language constrains thought. In the context of large language models, this debate raises a crucial question: Does a language model's grasp of semantic meaning depend on thought processes? To explore this issue, we investigate whether reasoning techniques can facilitate semantic understanding. Specifically, we conceptualize thought as reasoning, employ chain-of-thought prompting as a reasoning technique, and examine its impact on sentiment analysis tasks. The experiments show that chain-of-thought has a minimal impact on sentiment analysis tasks. Both the standard and chain-of-thought prompts focus on aspect terms rather than sentiment in the generated content. Furthermore, counterfactual experiments reveal that the model's handling of sentiment tasks primarily depends on information from demonstrations. The experimental results support the first viewpoint.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, generative, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While originally designed for unidirectional generative modeling, decoder-only large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adapted for bidirectional modeling. However, unidirectional and bidirectional models are typically trained separately with distinct objectives (generation and representation learning, respectively). This separation overlooks the opportunity for developing a more versatile language model and for these objectives to complement each other. In this work, we introduce MAGNET, an adaptation of decoder-only LLMs that enhances their ability to generate robust representations and infill missing text spans, while preserving their knowledge and text generation capabilities. MAGNET employs three self-supervised training objectives and introduces an attention mechanism that combines bidirectional and causal attention, enabling unified training across all objectives. Our results demonstrate that LLMs adapted with MAGNET (1) surpass strong text encoders on token-level and sentence-level representation learning tasks, (2) generate contextually appropriate text infills by leveraging future context, (3) retain the ability for open-ended text generation without exhibiting repetition problem, and (4) preserve the knowledge gained by the LLM during pretraining.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>2D portrait animation has experienced significant advancements in recent years. Much research has utilized the prior knowledge embedded in large generative diffusion models to enhance high-quality image manipulation. However, most methods only focus on generating RGB images as output, and the co-generation of consistent visual plus 3D output remains largely under-explored. In our work, we propose to jointly learn the visual appearance and depth simultaneously in a diffusion-based portrait image generator. Our method embraces the end-to-end diffusion paradigm and introduces a new architecture suitable for learning this conditional joint distribution, consisting of a reference network and a channel-expanded diffusion backbone. Once trained, our framework can be efficiently adapted to various downstream applications, such as facial depth-to-image and image-to-depth generation, portrait relighting, and audio-driven talking head animation with consistent 3D output.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>State-of-the-art supervised stereo matching methods have achieved amazing results on various benchmarks. However, these data-driven methods suffer from generalization to real-world scenarios due to the lack of real-world annotated data. In this paper, we propose StereoGen, a novel pipeline for high-quality stereo image generation. This pipeline utilizes arbitrary single images as left images and pseudo disparities generated by a monocular depth estimation model to synthesize high-quality corresponding right images. Unlike previous methods that fill the occluded area in warped right images using random backgrounds or using convolutions to take nearby pixels selectively, we fine-tune a diffusion inpainting model to recover the background. Images generated by our model possess better details and undamaged semantic structures. Besides, we propose Training-free Confidence Generation and Adaptive Disparity Selection. The former suppresses the negative effect of harmful pseudo ground truth during stereo training, while the latter helps generate a wider disparity distribution and better synthetic images. Experiments show that models trained under our pipeline achieve state-of-the-art zero-shot generalization results among all published methods. The code will be available upon publication of the paper.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, extraction, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Visual odometry (VO) plays a crucial role in autonomous driving, robotic navigation, and other related tasks by estimating the position and orientation of a camera based on visual input. Significant progress has been made in data-driven VO methods, particularly those leveraging deep learning techniques to extract image features and estimate camera poses. However, these methods often struggle in low-light conditions because of the reduced visibility of features and the increased difficulty of matching keypoints. To address this limitation, we introduce BrightVO, a novel VO model based on Transformer architecture, which not only performs front-end visual feature extraction, but also incorporates a multi-modality refinement module in the back-end that integrates Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data. Using pose graph optimization, this module iteratively refines pose estimates to reduce errors and improve both accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, we create a synthetic low-light dataset, KiC4R, which includes a variety of lighting conditions to facilitate the training and evaluation of VO frameworks in challenging environments. Experimental results demonstrate that BrightVO achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the KiC4R dataset and the KITTI benchmarks. Specifically, it provides an average improvement of 20% in pose estimation accuracy in normal outdoor environments and 259% in low-light conditions, outperforming existing methods.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Facial recognition models are increasingly employed by commercial enterprises, government agencies, and cloud service providers for identity verification, consumer services, and surveillance. These models are often trained using vast amounts of facial data processed and stored in cloud-based platforms, raising significant privacy concerns. Users' facial images may be exploited without their consent, leading to potential data breaches and misuse. This survey presents a comprehensive review of current methods aimed at preserving facial image privacy in cloud-based services. We categorize these methods into two primary approaches: image obfuscation-based protection and adversarial perturbation-based protection. We provide an in-depth analysis of both categories, offering qualitative and quantitative comparisons of their effectiveness. Additionally, we highlight unresolved challenges and propose future research directions to improve privacy preservation in cloud computing environments.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Animating clipart images with seamless motion while maintaining visual fidelity and temporal coherence presents significant challenges. Existing methods, such as AniClipart, effectively model spatial deformations but often fail to ensure smooth temporal transitions, resulting in artifacts like abrupt motions and geometric distortions. Similarly, text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V) models struggle to handle clipart due to the mismatch in statistical properties between natural video and clipart styles. This paper introduces FlexiClip, a novel approach designed to overcome these limitations by addressing the intertwined challenges of temporal consistency and geometric integrity. FlexiClip extends traditional Bézier curve-based trajectory modeling with key innovations: temporal Jacobians to correct motion dynamics incrementally, continuous-time modeling via probability flow ODEs (pfODEs) to mitigate temporal noise, and a flow matching loss inspired by GFlowNet principles to optimize smooth motion transitions. These enhancements ensure coherent animations across complex scenarios involving rapid movements and non-rigid deformations. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of FlexiClip in generating animations that are not only smooth and natural but also structurally consistent across diverse clipart types, including humans and animals. By integrating spatial and temporal modeling with pre-trained video diffusion models, FlexiClip sets a new standard for high-quality clipart animation, offering robust performance across a wide range of visual content.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The demand for artificially generated data for the development, training and testing of new algorithms is omnipresent. Quantum computing (QC), does offer the hope that its inherent probabilistic functionality can be utilised in this field of generative artificial intelligence. In this study, we use quantum-classical hybrid generative adversarial networks (QuGANs) to artificially generate graphs of shipping routes. We create a training dataset based on real shipping data and investigate to what extent QuGANs are able to learn and reproduce inherent distributions and geometric features of this data. We compare hybrid QuGANs with classical Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), with a special focus on their parameter efficiency. Our results indicate that QuGANs are indeed able to quickly learn and represent underlying geometric properties and distributions, although they seem to have difficulties in introducing variance into the sampled data. Compared to classical GANs of greater size, measured in the number of parameters used, some QuGANs show similar result quality. Our reference to concrete use cases, such as the generation of shipping data, provides an illustrative example and demonstrate the potential and diversity in which QC can be used.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs), trained on extensive web-scale corpora, have demonstrated remarkable abilities across diverse tasks, especially as they are scaled up. Nevertheless, even state-of-the-art models struggle in certain cases, sometimes failing at problems solvable by young children, indicating that traditional notions of task complexity are insufficient for explaining LLM capabilities. However, exploring LLM capabilities is complicated by the fact that most widely-used models are also "instruction-tuned" to respond appropriately to prompts. With the goal of disentangling the factors influencing LLM performance, we investigate whether instruction-tuned models possess fundamentally different capabilities from base models that are prompted using in-context examples. Through extensive experiments across various model families, scales and task types, which included instruction tuning 90 different LLMs, we demonstrate that the performance of instruction-tuned models is significantly correlated with the in-context performance of their base counterparts. By clarifying what instruction-tuning contributes, we extend prior research into in-context learning, which suggests that base models use priors from pretraining data to solve tasks. Specifically, we extend this understanding to instruction-tuned models, suggesting that their pretraining data similarly sets a limiting boundary on the tasks they can solve, with the added influence of the instruction-tuning dataset.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Email phishing remains a prevalent cyber threat, targeting victims to extract sensitive information or deploy malicious software. This paper explores the integration of open-source intelligence (OSINT) tools and machine learning (ML) models to enhance phishing detection across multilingual datasets. Using Nmap and theHarvester, this study extracted 17 features, including domain names, IP addresses, and open ports, to improve detection accuracy. Multilingual email datasets, including English and Arabic, were analyzed to address the limitations of ML models trained predominantly on English data. Experiments with five classification algorithms: Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, XGBoost, and Multinomial Naïve Bayes. It revealed that Random Forest achieved the highest performance, with an accuracy of 97.37% for both English and Arabic datasets. For OSINT-enhanced datasets, the model demonstrated an improvement in accuracy compared to baseline models without OSINT features. These findings highlight the potential of combining OSINT tools with advanced ML models to detect phishing emails more effectively across diverse languages and contexts. This study contributes an approach to phishing detection by incorporating OSINT features and evaluating their impact on multilingual datasets, addressing a critical gap in cybersecurity research.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of text-to-image models has become an increasingly popular technique with many applications. Among the various PEFT methods, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its variants have gained significant attention due to their effectiveness, enabling users to fine-tune models with limited computational resources. However, the approximation gap between the low-rank assumption and desired fine-tuning weights prevents the simultaneous acquisition of ultra-parameter-efficiency and better performance. To reduce this gap and further improve the power of LoRA, we propose a new PEFT method that combines two classes of adaptations, namely, transform and residual adaptations. In specific, we first apply a full-rank and dense transform to the pre-trained weight. This learnable transform is expected to align the pre-trained weight as closely as possible to the desired weight, thereby reducing the rank of the residual weight. Then, the residual part can be effectively approximated by more compact and parameter-efficient structures, with a smaller approximation error. To achieve ultra-parameter-efficiency in practice, we design highly flexible and effective tensor decompositions for both the transform and residual adaptations. Additionally, popular PEFT methods such as DoRA can be summarized under this transform plus residual adaptation scheme. Experiments are conducted on fine-tuning Stable Diffusion models in subject-driven and controllable generation. The results manifest that our method can achieve better performances and parameter efficiency compared to LoRA and several baselines.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated Continual Learning (FCL) aims to enable sequentially privacy-preserving model training on streams of incoming data that vary in edge devices by preserving previous knowledge while adapting to new data. Current FCL literature focuses on restricted data privacy and access to previously seen data while imposing no constraints on the training overhead. This is unreasonable for FCL applications in real-world scenarios, where edge devices are primarily constrained by resources such as storage, computational budget, and label rate. We revisit this problem with a large-scale benchmark and analyze the performance of state-of-the-art FCL approaches under different resource-constrained settings. Various typical FCL techniques and six datasets in two incremental learning scenarios (Class-IL and Domain-IL) are involved in our experiments. Through extensive experiments amounting to a total of over 1,000+ GPU hours, we find that, under limited resource-constrained settings, existing FCL approaches, with no exception, fail to achieve the expected performance. Our conclusions are consistent in the sensitivity analysis. This suggests that most existing FCL methods are particularly too resource-dependent for real-world deployment. Moreover, we study the performance of typical FCL techniques with resource constraints and shed light on future research directions in FCL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce a novel masked pre-training technique for graph neural networks (GNNs) applied to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) problems. By randomly masking up to 40\% of input mesh nodes during pre-training, we force the model to learn robust representations of complex fluid dynamics. We pair this masking strategy with an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture and gated multi-layer perceptrons to further enhance performance. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on seven CFD datasets, including a new challenging dataset of 3D intracranial aneurysm simulations with over 250,000 nodes per mesh. Moreover, it significantly improves model performance and training efficiency across such diverse range of fluid simulation tasks. We demonstrate improvements of up to 60\% in long-term prediction accuracy compared to previous best models, while maintaining similar computational costs. Notably, our approach enables effective pre-training on multiple datasets simultaneously, significantly reducing the time and data required to achieve high performance on new tasks. Through extensive ablation studies, we provide insights into the optimal masking ratio, architectural choices, and training strategies.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Sentiment analysis is one of the most crucial tasks in Natural Language Processing (NLP), involving the training of machine learning models to classify text based on the polarity of opinions. Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) can be applied to downstream tasks through fine-tuning, eliminating the need to train the model from scratch. Specifically, PLMs have been employed for Sentiment Analysis, a process that involves detecting, analyzing, and extracting the polarity of text sentiments. Numerous models have been proposed to address this task, with pre-trained PhoBERT-V2 models standing out as the state-of-the-art language models for Vietnamese. The PhoBERT-V2 pre-training approach is based on RoBERTa, optimizing the BERT pre-training method for more robust performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that combines PhoBERT-V2 and SentiWordnet for Sentiment Analysis of Vietnamese reviews. Our proposed model utilizes PhoBERT-V2 for Vietnamese, offering a robust optimization for the prominent BERT model in the context of Vietnamese language, and leverages SentiWordNet, a lexical resource explicitly designed to support sentiment classification applications. Experimental results on the VLSP 2016 and AIVIVN 2019 datasets demonstrate that our sentiment analysis system has achieved excellent performance in comparison to other models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Current fake image detectors trained on large synthetic image datasets perform satisfactorily on limited studied generative models. However, they suffer a notable performance decline over unseen models. Besides, collecting adequate training data from online generative models is often expensive or infeasible. To overcome these issues, we propose Few-Shot Detector (FSD), a novel AI-generated image detector which learns a specialized metric space to effectively distinguish unseen fake images by utilizing very few samples. Experiments show FSD achieves state-of-the-art performance by $+7.4\%$ average ACC on GenImage dataset. More importantly, our method is better capable of capturing the intra-category common features in unseen images without further training.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Depressive and anxiety disorders are widespread, necessitating timely identification and management. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential solutions, yet high costs and ethical concerns about training data remain challenges. This paper introduces a pipeline for synthesizing clinical interviews, resulting in 1,157 interactive dialogues (PsyInterview), and presents EmoScan, an LLM-based emotional disorder screening system. EmoScan distinguishes between coarse (e.g., anxiety or depressive disorders) and fine disorders (e.g., major depressive disorders) and conducts high-quality interviews. Evaluations showed that EmoScan exceeded the performance of base models and other LLMs like GPT-4 in screening emotional disorders (F1-score=0.7467). It also delivers superior explanations (BERTScore=0.9408) and demonstrates robust generalizability (F1-score of 0.67 on an external dataset). Furthermore, EmoScan outperforms baselines in interviewing skills, as validated by automated ratings and human evaluations. This work highlights the importance of scalable data-generative pipelines for developing effective mental health LLM tools.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose a novel cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach for networked agents. In contrast to previous methods that rely on complete state information or joint observations, our agents must learn how to reach shared objectives under partial observability. During training, they collect individual rewards and approximate a team value function through local communication, resulting in cooperative behavior. To describe our problem, we introduce the networked dynamic partially observable Markov game framework, where agents communicate over a switching topology communication network. Our distributed method, DNA-MARL, uses a consensus mechanism for local communication and gradient descent for local computation. DNA-MARL increases the range of the possible applications of networked agents, being well-suited for real world domains that impose privacy and where the messages may not reach their recipients. We evaluate DNA-MARL across benchmark MARL scenarios. Our results highlight the superior performance of DNA-MARL over previous methods.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This study highlights the potential of ChatGPT (specifically GPT-4o) as a competitive alternative for Face Presentation Attack Detection (PAD), outperforming several PAD models, including commercial solutions, in specific scenarios. Our results show that GPT-4o demonstrates high consistency, particularly in few-shot in-context learning, where its performance improves as more examples are provided (reference data). We also observe that detailed prompts enable the model to provide scores reliably, a behavior not observed with concise prompts. Additionally, explanation-seeking prompts slightly enhance the model's performance by improving its interpretability. Remarkably, the model exhibits emergent reasoning capabilities, correctly predicting the attack type (print or replay) with high accuracy in few-shot scenarios, despite not being explicitly instructed to classify attack types. Despite these strengths, GPT-4o faces challenges in zero-shot tasks, where its performance is limited compared to specialized PAD systems. Experiments were conducted on a subset of the SOTERIA dataset, ensuring compliance with data privacy regulations by using only data from consenting individuals. These findings underscore GPT-4o's promise in PAD applications, laying the groundwork for future research to address broader data privacy concerns and improve cross-dataset generalization.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Accurate detection and resilience of object detectors in structural damage detection are important in ensuring the continuous use of civil infrastructure. However, achieving robustness in object detectors remains a persistent challenge, impacting their ability to generalize effectively. This study proposes DetectorX, a robust framework for structural damage detection coupled with a micro drone. DetectorX addresses the challenges of object detector robustness by incorporating two innovative modules: a stem block and a spiral pooling technique. The stem block introduces a dynamic visual modality by leveraging the outputs of two Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) models. The framework employs the proposed event-based reward reinforcement learning to constrain the actions of a parent and child DCNN model leading to a reward. This results in the induction of two dynamic visual modalities alongside the Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) data. This enhancement significantly augments DetectorX's perception and adaptability in diverse environmental situations. Further, a spiral pooling technique, an online image augmentation method, strengthens the framework by increasing feature representations by concatenating spiraled and average/max pooled features. In three extensive experiments: (1) comparative and (2) robustness, which use the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Hub ImageNet dataset, and (3) field-experiment, DetectorX performed satisfactorily across varying metrics, including precision (0.88), recall (0.84), average precision (0.91), mean average precision (0.76), and mean average recall (0.73), compared to the competing detectors including You Only Look Once X-medium (YOLOX-m) and others. The study's findings indicate that DetectorX can provide satisfactory results and demonstrate resilience in challenging environments.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Billions of dollars are transacted through smart contracts, making vulnerabilities a major financial risk. One focus in the security arms race is on profitable vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit. Fuzzing is a key method for identifying these vulnerabilities. However, current solutions face two main limitations: a lack of profit-centric techniques for expediting detection, and insufficient automation in maximizing the profitability of discovered vulnerabilities, leaving the analysis to human experts. To address these gaps, we have developed VERITE, a profit-centric smart contract fuzzing framework that not only effectively detects those profitable vulnerabilities but also maximizes the exploited profits. VERITE has three key features: 1) DeFi action-based mutators for boosting the exploration of transactions with different fund flows; 2) potentially profitable candidates identification criteria, which checks whether the input has caused abnormal fund flow properties during testing; 3) a gradient descent-based profit maximization strategy for these identified candidates. VERITE is fully developed from scratch and evaluated on a dataset consisting of 61 exploited real-world DeFi projects with an average of over 1.1 million dollars loss. The results show that VERITE can automatically extract more than 18 million dollars in total and is significantly better than state-of-the-art fuzzer ITYFUZZ in both detection (29/9) and exploitation (58 times more profits gained on average). Remarkbly, in 12 targets, it gains more profits than real-world attacking exploits (1.01 to 11.45 times more). VERITE is also applied by auditors in contract auditing, where 6 (5 high severity) zero-day vulnerabilities are found with over $2,500 bounty rewards.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Our work addresses the problem of stochastic long-term dense anticipation. The goal of this task is to predict actions and their durations several minutes into the future based on provided video observations. Anticipation over extended horizons introduces high uncertainty, as a single observation can lead to multiple plausible future outcomes. To address this uncertainty, stochastic models are designed to predict several potential future action sequences. Recent work has further proposed to incorporate uncertainty modelling for observed frames by simultaneously predicting per-frame past and future actions in a unified manner. While such joint modelling of actions is beneficial, it requires long-range temporal capabilities to connect events across distant past and future time points. However, the previous work struggles to achieve such a long-range understanding due to its limited and/or sparse receptive field. To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel MANTA (MAmba for ANTicipation) network. Our model enables effective long-term temporal modelling even for very long sequences while maintaining linear complexity in sequence length. We demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on three datasets - Breakfast, 50Salads, and Assembly101 - while also significantly improving computational and memory efficiency.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Existing Theory of Mind (ToM) benchmarks diverge from real-world scenarios in three aspects: 1) they assess a limited range of mental states such as beliefs, 2) false beliefs are not comprehensively explored, and 3) the diverse personality traits of characters are overlooked. To address these challenges, we introduce ToMATO, a new ToM benchmark formulated as multiple-choice QA over conversations. ToMATO is generated via LLM-LLM conversations featuring information asymmetry. By employing a prompting method that requires role-playing LLMs to verbalize their thoughts before each utterance, we capture both first- and second-order mental states across five categories: belief, intention, desire, emotion, and knowledge. These verbalized thoughts serve as answers to questions designed to assess the mental states of characters within conversations. Furthermore, the information asymmetry introduced by hiding thoughts from others induces the generation of false beliefs about various mental states. Assigning distinct personality traits to LLMs further diversifies both utterances and thoughts. ToMATO consists of 5.4k questions, 753 conversations, and 15 personality trait patterns. Our analysis shows that this dataset construction approach frequently generates false beliefs due to the information asymmetry between role-playing LLMs, and effectively reflects diverse personalities. We evaluate nine LLMs on ToMATO and find that even GPT-4o mini lags behind human performance, especially in understanding false beliefs, and lacks robustness to various personality traits.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Explaining the predictions of a deep neural network is a nontrivial task, yet high-quality explanations for predictions are often a prerequisite for practitioners to trust these models. Counterfactual explanations aim to explain predictions by finding the ''nearest'' in-distribution alternative input whose prediction changes in a pre-specified way. However, it remains an open question how to define this nearest alternative input, whose solution depends on both the domain (e.g. images, graphs, tabular data, etc.) and the specific application considered. For graphs, this problem is complicated i) by their discrete nature, as opposed to the continuous nature of state-of-the-art graph classifiers; and ii) by the node permutation group acting on the graphs. We propose a method to generate counterfactual explanations for any differentiable black-box graph classifier, utilizing a case-specific permutation equivariant graph variational autoencoder. We generate counterfactual explanations in a continuous fashion by traversing the latent space of the autoencoder across the classification boundary of the classifier, allowing for seamless integration of discrete graph structure and continuous graph attributes. We empirically validate the approach on three graph datasets, showing that our model is consistently high-performing and more robust than the baselines.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Background: Adolescents are particularly vulnerable to mental disorders, with over 75% of cases manifesting before the age of 25. Research indicates that only 18 to 34% of young people experiencing high levels of depression or anxiety symptoms seek support. Digital tools leveraging smartphones offer scalable and early intervention opportunities. Objective: Using a novel machine learning framework, this study evaluated the feasibility of integrating active and passive smartphone data to predict mental disorders in non-clinical adolescents. Specifically, we investigated the utility of the Mindcraft app in predicting risks for internalising and externalising disorders, eating disorders, insomnia and suicidal ideation. Methods: Participants (N=103; mean age 16.1 years) were recruited from three London schools. Participants completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, the Eating Disorders-15 Questionnaire, Sleep Condition Indicator Questionnaire and indicated the presence/absence of suicidal ideation. They used the Mindcraft app for 14 days, contributing active data via self-reports and passive data from smartphone sensors. A contrastive pretraining phase was applied to enhance user-specific feature stability, followed by supervised fine-tuning. The model evaluation employed leave-one-subject-out cross-validation using balanced accuracy as the primary metric. Results: The integration of active and passive data achieved superior performance compared to individual data sources, with mean balanced accuracies of 0.71 for SDQ-High risk, 0.67 for insomnia, 0.77 for suicidal ideation and 0.70 for eating disorders. The contrastive learning framework stabilised daily behavioural representations, enhancing predictive robustness. This study demonstrates the potential of integrating active and passive smartphone data with advanced machine-learning techniques for predicting mental health risks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Autonomous driving is a challenging task that requires perceiving and understanding the surrounding environment for safe trajectory planning. While existing vision-based end-to-end models have achieved promising results, these methods are still facing the challenges of vision understanding, decision reasoning and scene generalization. To solve these issues, a generative planning with 3D-vision language pre-training model named GPVL is proposed for end-to-end autonomous driving. The proposed paradigm has two significant aspects. On one hand, a 3D-vision language pre-training module is designed to bridge the gap between visual perception and linguistic understanding in the bird's eye view. On the other hand, a cross-modal language model is introduced to generate holistic driving decisions and fine-grained trajectories with perception and navigation information in an auto-regressive manner. Experiments on the challenging nuScenes dataset demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves excellent performances compared with state-of-the-art methods. Besides, the proposed GPVL presents strong generalization ability and real-time potential when handling high-level commands in various scenarios. It is believed that the effective, robust and efficient performance of GPVL is crucial for the practical application of future autonomous driving systems. Code is available at this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, protect, defense</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Private data, when published online, may be collected by unauthorized parties to train deep neural networks (DNNs). To protect privacy, defensive noises can be added to original samples to degrade their learnability by DNNs. Recently, unlearnable examples are proposed to minimize the training loss such that the model learns almost nothing. However, raw data are often pre-processed before being used for training, which may restore the private information of protected data. In this paper, we reveal the data privacy violation induced by data augmentation, a commonly used data pre-processing technique to improve model generalization capability, which is the first of its kind as far as we are concerned. We demonstrate that data augmentation can significantly raise the accuracy of the model trained on unlearnable examples from 21.3% to 66.1%. To address this issue, we propose a defense framework, dubbed ARMOR, to protect data privacy from potential breaches of data augmentation. To overcome the difficulty of having no access to the model training process, we design a non-local module-assisted surrogate model that better captures the effect of data augmentation. In addition, we design a surrogate augmentation selection strategy that maximizes distribution alignment between augmented and non-augmented samples, to choose the optimal augmentation strategy for each class. We also use a dynamic step size adjustment algorithm to enhance the defensive noise generation process. Extensive experiments are conducted on 4 datasets and 5 data augmentation methods to verify the performance of ARMOR. Comparisons with 6 state-of-the-art defense methods have demonstrated that ARMOR can preserve the unlearnability of protected private data under data augmentation. ARMOR reduces the test accuracy of the model trained on augmented protected samples by as much as 60% more than baselines.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Knowledge distillation (KD) involves transferring knowledge from a pre-trained heavy teacher model to a lighter student model, thereby reducing the inference cost while maintaining comparable effectiveness. Prior KD techniques typically assume homogeneity between the teacher and student models. However, as technology advances, a wide variety of architectures have emerged, ranging from initial Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to Vision Transformers (ViTs), and Multi-Level Perceptrons (MLPs). Consequently, developing a universal KD framework compatible with any architecture has become an important research topic. In this paper, we introduce a feature-based one-for-all (FOFA) KD framework to enable feature distillation across diverse architecture. Our framework comprises two key components. First, we design prompt tuning blocks that incorporate student feedback, allowing teacher features to adapt to the student model's learning process. Second, we propose region-aware attention to mitigate the view mismatch problem between heterogeneous architecture. By leveraging these two modules, effective distillation of intermediate features can be achieved across heterogeneous architectures. Extensive experiments on CIFAR, ImageNet, and COCO demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we propose a novel cross-attention-based generative adversarial network (GAN) for the challenging person image generation task. Cross-attention is a novel and intuitive multi-modal fusion method in which an attention/correlation matrix is calculated between two feature maps of different modalities. Specifically, we propose the novel XingGAN (or CrossingGAN), which consists of two generation branches that capture the person's appearance and shape, respectively. Moreover, we propose two novel cross-attention blocks to effectively transfer and update the person's shape and appearance embeddings for mutual improvement. This has not been considered by any other existing GAN-based image generation work. To further learn the long-range correlations between different person poses at different scales and sub-regions, we propose two novel multi-scale cross-attention blocks. To tackle the issue of independent correlation computations within the cross-attention mechanism leading to noisy and ambiguous attention weights, which hinder performance improvements, we propose a module called enhanced attention (EA). Lastly, we introduce a novel densely connected co-attention module to fuse appearance and shape features at different stages effectively. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms current GAN-based methods and performs on par with diffusion-based methods. However, our method is significantly faster than diffusion-based methods in both training and inference.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Facial brightness is a key image quality factor impacting face recognition accuracy differentials across demographic groups. In this work, we aim to decrease the accuracy gap between the similarity score distributions for Caucasian and African American female mated image pairs, as measured by d' between distributions. To balance brightness across demographic groups, we conduct three experiments, interpreting brightness in the face skin region either as median pixel value or as the distribution of pixel values. Balancing based on median brightness alone yields up to a 46.8% decrease in d', while balancing based on brightness distribution yields up to a 57.6% decrease. In all three cases, the similarity scores of the individual distributions improve, with mean scores maximally improving 5.9% for Caucasian females and 3.7% for African American females.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The number of people living in this agricultural nation of ours, which is surrounded by lush greenery, is growing on a daily basis. As a result of this, the level of arable land is decreasing, as well as residential houses and industrial factories. The food crisis is becoming the main threat for us in the upcoming days. Because on the one hand, the population is increasing, and on the other hand, the amount of food crop production is decreasing due to the attack of diseases. Rice is one of the most significant cultivated crops since it provides food for more than half of the world's population. Bangladesh is dependent on rice (Oryza sativa) as a vital crop for its agriculture, but it faces a significant problem as a result of the ongoing decline in rice yield brought on by common diseases. Early disease detection is the main difficulty in rice crop cultivation. In this paper, we proposed our own dataset, which was collected from the Bangladesh field, and also applied deep learning and transfer learning models for the evaluation of the datasets. We elaborately explain our dataset and also give direction for further research work to serve society using this dataset. We applied a light CNN model and pre-trained InceptionNet-V2, EfficientNet-V2, and MobileNet-V2 models, which achieved 91.5% performance for the EfficientNet-V2 model of this work. The results obtained assaulted other models and even exceeded approaches that are considered to be part of the state of the art. It has been demonstrated by this study that it is possible to precisely and effectively identify diseases that affect rice leaves using this unbiased datasets. After analysis of the performance of different models, the proposed datasets are significant for the society for research work to provide solutions for decreasing rice leaf disease.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recently there have been many shared tasks targeting the detection of generated text from Large Language Models (LLMs). However, these shared tasks tend to focus either on cases where text is limited to one particular domain or cases where text can be from many domains, some of which may not be seen during test time. In this shared task, using the newly released RAID benchmark, we aim to answer whether or not models can detect generated text from a large, yet fixed, number of domains and LLMs, all of which are seen during training. Over the course of three months, our task was attempted by 9 teams with 23 detector submissions. We find that multiple participants were able to obtain accuracies of over 99% on machine-generated text from RAID while maintaining a 5% False Positive Rate -- suggesting that detectors are able to robustly detect text from many domains and models simultaneously. We discuss potential interpretations of this result and provide directions for future research.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Exploration is a crucial skill for self-improvement and open-ended problem-solving. However, it remains uncertain whether large language models can effectively explore the state-space. Existing evaluations predominantly focus on the trade-off between exploration and exploitation, often assessed in multi-armed bandit problems. In contrast, this work isolates exploration as the sole objective, tasking the agent with delivering information that enhances future returns. For the evaluation, we propose to decompose missing rewards into exploration and exploitation components by measuring the optimal achievable return for the states already explored. Our experiments with various LLMs reveal that most models struggle to sufficiently explore the state-space and that weak exploration is insufficient. We observe a positive correlation between model size and exploration performance, with larger models demonstrating superior capabilities. Furthermore, we show that our decomposition provides insights into differences in behaviors driven by agent instructions during prompt engineering, offering a valuable tool for refining LLM performance in exploratory tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Turn-taking is a fundamental aspect of conversation, but current Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) systems often rely on simplistic, silence-based models, leading to unnatural pauses and interruptions. This paper investigates, for the first time, the application of general turn-taking models, specifically TurnGPT and Voice Activity Projection (VAP), to improve conversational dynamics in HRI. These models are trained on human-human dialogue data using self-supervised learning objectives, without requiring domain-specific fine-tuning. We propose methods for using these models in tandem to predict when a robot should begin preparing responses, take turns, and handle potential interruptions. We evaluated the proposed system in a within-subject study against a traditional baseline system, using the Furhat robot with 39 adults in a conversational setting, in combination with a large language model for autonomous response generation. The results show that participants significantly prefer the proposed system, and it significantly reduces response delays and interruptions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Graph APIs are capable of flexibly retrieving or manipulating graph-structured data over the web. This rather novel type of APIs presents new challenges when it comes to properly securing the APIs against the usual web application security risks, e.g., broken access control. A prominent security testing approach is taint analysis, which traces tainted, i.e., security-relevant, data from sources (where tainted data is inserted) to sinks (where the use of tainted data may lead to a security risk), over the information flow in an application. We present a first systematic approach to static and dynamic taint analysis for Graph APIs focusing on broken access control. The approach comprises the following. We taint nodes in the Graph API if they represent data requiring specific privileges in order to be retrieved or manipulated, and identify API calls which are related to sources and sinks. Then, we statically analyze whether tainted information flow between API source and sink calls occurs. To this end, we model the API calls using graph transformation rules. We subsequently use critical pair analysis to automatically analyze potential dependencies between rules representing source calls and rules representing sink calls. We distinguish direct from indirect tainted information flow and argue under which conditions the CPA is able to detect not only direct, but also indirect tainted flow. The static taint analysis (i) identifies flows that need to be further reviewed, since tainted nodes may be created by an API call and used or manipulated by another API call later without having the necessary privileges, and (ii) can be used to systematically design dynamic security tests for broken access control. The dynamic taint analysis checks if potential broken access control risks detected during the static taint analysis really occur. We apply the approach to a part of the GitHub GraphQL API.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Measurement quality assurance (QA) practices play a key role in the safe use of Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapies (IMRT) for cancer treatment. These practices have reduced measurement-based IMRT QA failure below 1%. However, these practices are time and labor intensive which can lead to delays in patient care. In this study, we examine how conformal prediction methodologies can be used to robustly triage plans. We propose a new training-aware conformal risk control method by combining the benefit of conformal risk control and conformal training. We incorporate the decision making thresholds based on the gamma passing rate, along with the risk functions used in clinical evaluation, into the design of the risk control framework. Our method achieves high sensitivity and specificity and significantly reduces the number of plans needing measurement without generating a huge confidence interval. Our results demonstrate the validity and applicability of conformal prediction methods for improving efficiency and reducing the workload of the IMRT QA process.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, privacy</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We often interact with untrusted parties. Prioritization of privacy can limit the effectiveness of these interactions, as achieving certain goals necessitates sharing private data. Traditionally, addressing this challenge has involved either seeking trusted intermediaries or constructing cryptographic protocols that restrict how much data is revealed, such as multi-party computations or zero-knowledge proofs. While significant advances have been made in scaling cryptographic approaches, they remain limited in terms of the size and complexity of applications they can be used for. In this paper, we argue that capable machine learning models can fulfill the role of a trusted third party, thus enabling secure computations for applications that were previously infeasible. In particular, we describe Trusted Capable Model Environments (TCMEs) as an alternative approach for scaling secure computation, where capable machine learning model(s) interact under input/output constraints, with explicit information flow control and explicit statelessness. This approach aims to achieve a balance between privacy and computational efficiency, enabling private inference where classical cryptographic solutions are currently infeasible. We describe a number of use cases that are enabled by TCME, and show that even some simple classic cryptographic problems can already be solved with TCME. Finally, we outline current limitations and discuss the path forward in implementing them.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ASBA) is a refined approach to sentiment analysis that aims to extract and classify sentiments based on specific aspects or features of a product, service, or entity. Unlike traditional sentiment analysis, which assigns a general sentiment score to entire reviews or texts, ABSA focuses on breaking down the text into individual components or aspects (e.g., quality, price, service) and evaluating the sentiment towards each. This allows for a more granular level of understanding of customer opinions, enabling businesses to pinpoint specific areas of strength and improvement. The process involves several key steps, including aspect extraction, sentiment classification, and aspect-level sentiment aggregation for a review paragraph or any other form that the users have provided. ABSA has significant applications in areas such as product reviews, social media monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and market research. By leveraging techniques from natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning, ABSA facilitates the extraction of valuable insights, enabling companies to make data-driven decisions that enhance customer satisfaction and optimize offerings. As ABSA evolves, it holds the potential to greatly improve personalized customer experiences by providing a deeper understanding of sentiment across various product aspects. In this work, we have analyzed the strength of LLMs for a complete cross-domain aspect-based sentiment analysis with the aim of defining the framework for certain products and using it for other similar situations. We argue that it is possible to that at an effectiveness of 92\% accuracy for the Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis dataset of SemEval-2015 Task 12.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Localizing text descriptions in large-scale 3D scenes is inherently an ambiguous task. This nonetheless arises while describing general concepts, e.g. all traffic lights in a city. To facilitate reasoning based on such concepts, text localization in the form of distribution is required. In this paper, we generate the distribution of the camera poses conditioned upon the textual description. To facilitate such generation, we propose a diffusion-based architecture that conditionally diffuses the noisy 6DoF camera poses to their plausible locations. The conditional signals are derived from the text descriptions, using the pre-trained text encoders. The connection between text descriptions and pose distribution is established through pretrained Vision-Language-Model, i.e. CLIP. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the candidate poses for the distribution can be further refined by rendering potential poses using 3D Gaussian splatting, guiding incorrectly posed samples towards locations that better align with the textual description, through visual reasoning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by comparing it with both standard retrieval methods and learning-based approaches. Our proposed method consistently outperforms these baselines across all five large-scale datasets. Our source code and dataset will be made publicly available.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>3D scene generation has garnered growing attention in recent years and has made significant progress. Generating 4D cities is more challenging than 3D scenes due to the presence of structurally complex, visually diverse objects like buildings and vehicles, and heightened human sensitivity to distortions in urban environments. To tackle these issues, we propose CityDreamer4D, a compositional generative model specifically tailored for generating unbounded 4D cities. Our main insights are 1) 4D city generation should separate dynamic objects (e.g., vehicles) from static scenes (e.g., buildings and roads), and 2) all objects in the 4D scene should be composed of different types of neural fields for buildings, vehicles, and background stuff. Specifically, we propose Traffic Scenario Generator and Unbounded Layout Generator to produce dynamic traffic scenarios and static city layouts using a highly compact BEV representation. Objects in 4D cities are generated by combining stuff-oriented and instance-oriented neural fields for background stuff, buildings, and vehicles. To suit the distinct characteristics of background stuff and instances, the neural fields employ customized generative hash grids and periodic positional embeddings as scene parameterizations. Furthermore, we offer a comprehensive suite of datasets for city generation, including OSM, GoogleEarth, and CityTopia. The OSM dataset provides a variety of real-world city layouts, while the Google Earth and CityTopia datasets deliver large-scale, high-quality city imagery complete with 3D instance annotations. Leveraging its compositional design, CityDreamer4D supports a range of downstream applications, such as instance editing, city stylization, and urban simulation, while delivering state-of-the-art performance in generating realistic 4D cities.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Video generation has achieved remarkable progress with the introduction of diffusion models, which have significantly improved the quality of generated videos. However, recent research has primarily focused on scaling up model training, while offering limited insights into the direct impact of representations on the video generation process. In this paper, we initially investigate the characteristics of features in intermediate layers, finding substantial variations in attention maps across different layers. These variations lead to unstable semantic representations and contribute to cumulative differences between features, which ultimately reduce the similarity between adjacent frames and negatively affect temporal coherence. To address this, we propose RepVideo, an enhanced representation framework for text-to-video diffusion models. By accumulating features from neighboring layers to form enriched representations, this approach captures more stable semantic information. These enhanced representations are then used as inputs to the attention mechanism, thereby improving semantic expressiveness while ensuring feature consistency across adjacent frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our RepVideo not only significantly enhances the ability to generate accurate spatial appearances, such as capturing complex spatial relationships between multiple objects, but also improves temporal consistency in video generation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Data scarcity in pharmaceutical research has led to reliance on labour-intensive trial and error approaches for development rather than data driven methods. While Machine Learning offers a solution, existing datasets are often small and noisy, limiting their utility. To address this, we developed a Variationally Encoded Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Network (VECT GAN), a novel generative model specifically designed for augmenting small, noisy datasets. We introduce a pipeline where data is augmented before regression model development and demonstrate that this consistently and significantly improves performance over other state of the art tabular generative models. We apply this pipeline across six pharmaceutical datasets, and highlight its real-world applicability by developing novel polymers with medically desirable mucoadhesive properties, which we made and experimentally characterised. Additionally, we pre-train the model on the ChEMBL database of drug-like molecules, leveraging knowledge distillation to enhance its generalisability, making it readily available for use on pharmaceutical datasets containing small molecules, which is an extremely common pharmaceutical task. We demonstrate the power of synthetic data for regularising small tabular datasets, highlighting its potential to become standard practice in pharmaceutical model development, and make our method, including VECT GAN pretrained on ChEMBL available as a pip package.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative AI become increasingly widespread, concerns about content safety have grown in parallel. Currently, there is a clear lack of high-quality, human-annotated datasets that address the full spectrum of LLM-related safety risks and are usable for commercial applications. To bridge this gap, we propose a comprehensive and adaptable taxonomy for categorizing safety risks, structured into 12 top-level hazard categories with an extension to 9 fine-grained subcategories. This taxonomy is designed to meet the diverse requirements of downstream users, offering more granular and flexible tools for managing various risk types. Using a hybrid data generation pipeline that combines human annotations with a multi-LLM "jury" system to assess the safety of responses, we obtain Aegis 2.0, a carefully curated collection of 34,248 samples of human-LLM interactions, annotated according to our proposed taxonomy. To validate its effectiveness, we demonstrate that several lightweight models, trained using parameter-efficient techniques on Aegis 2.0, achieve performance competitive with leading safety models fully fine-tuned on much larger, non-commercial datasets. In addition, we introduce a novel training blend that combines safety with topic following this http URL approach enhances the adaptability of guard models, enabling them to generalize to new risk categories defined during inference. We plan to open-source Aegis 2.0 data and models to the research community to aid in the safety guardrailing of LLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, explainability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Advances in the effectiveness of machine learning models have come at the cost of enormous complexity resulting in a poor understanding of how they function. Local surrogate methods have been used to approximate the workings of these complex models, but recent work has revealed their vulnerability to adversarial attacks where the explanation produced is appreciably different while the meaning and structure of the complex model's output remains similar. This prior work has focused on the existence of these weaknesses but not on their magnitude. Here we explore using an alternate search method with the goal of finding minimum viable perturbations, the fewest perturbations necessary to achieve a fixed similarity value between the original and altered text's explanation. Intuitively, a method that requires fewer perturbations to expose a given level of instability is inferior to one which requires more. This nuance allows for superior comparisons of the stability of explainability methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Acquiring and annotating surgical data is often resource-intensive, ethical constraining, and requiring significant expert involvement. While generative AI models like text-to-image can alleviate data scarcity, incorporating spatial annotations, such as segmentation masks, is crucial for precision-driven surgical applications, simulation, and education. This study introduces both a novel task and method, SimGen, for Simultaneous Image and Mask Generation. SimGen is a diffusion model based on the DDPM framework and Residual U-Net, designed to jointly generate high-fidelity surgical images and their corresponding segmentation masks. The model leverages cross-correlation priors to capture dependencies between continuous image and discrete mask distributions. Additionally, a Canonical Fibonacci Lattice (CFL) is employed to enhance class separability and uniformity in the RGB space of the masks. SimGen delivers high-fidelity images and accurate segmentation masks, outperforming baselines across six public datasets assessed on image and semantic inception distance metrics. Ablation study shows that the CFL improves mask quality and spatial separation. Downstream experiments suggest generated image-mask pairs are usable if regulations limit human data release for research. This work offers a cost-effective solution for generating paired surgical images and complex labels, advancing surgical AI development by reducing the need for expensive manual annotations.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The first-in-first-out (FIFO) video diffusion, built on a pre-trained text-to-video model, has recently emerged as an effective approach for tuning-free long video generation. This technique maintains a queue of video frames with progressively increasing noise, continuously producing clean frames at the queue's head while Gaussian noise is enqueued at the tail. However, FIFO-Diffusion often struggles to keep long-range temporal consistency in the generated videos due to the lack of correspondence modeling across frames. In this paper, we propose Ouroboros-Diffusion, a novel video denoising framework designed to enhance structural and content (subject) consistency, enabling the generation of consistent videos of arbitrary length. Specifically, we introduce a new latent sampling technique at the queue tail to improve structural consistency, ensuring perceptually smooth transitions among frames. To enhance subject consistency, we devise a Subject-Aware Cross-Frame Attention (SACFA) mechanism, which aligns subjects across frames within short segments to achieve better visual coherence. Furthermore, we introduce self-recurrent guidance. This technique leverages information from all previous cleaner frames at the front of the queue to guide the denoising of noisier frames at the end, fostering rich and contextual global information interaction. Extensive experiments of long video generation on the VBench benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our Ouroboros-Diffusion, particularly in terms of subject consistency, motion smoothness, and temporal consistency.</li>
