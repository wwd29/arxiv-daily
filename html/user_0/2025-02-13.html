<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Collaborative perception (CP) is a promising method for safe connected and autonomous driving, which enables multiple vehicles to share sensing information to enhance perception performance. However, compared with single-vehicle perception, the openness of a CP system makes it more vulnerable to malicious attacks that can inject malicious information to mislead the perception of an ego vehicle, resulting in severe risks for safe driving. To mitigate such vulnerability, we first propose a new paradigm for malicious agent detection that effectively identifies malicious agents at the feature level without requiring verification of final perception results, significantly reducing computational overhead. Building on this paradigm, we introduce CP-GuardBench, the first comprehensive dataset provided to train and evaluate various malicious agent detection methods for CP systems. Furthermore, we develop a robust defense method called CP-Guard+, which enhances the margin between the representations of benign and malicious features through a carefully designed Dual-Centered Contrastive Loss (DCCLoss). Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on both CP-GuardBench and V2X-Sim, and demonstrate the superiority of CP-Guard+.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The compositional reasoning capacity has long been regarded as critical to the generalization and intelligence emergence of large language models LLMs. However, despite numerous reasoning-related benchmarks, the compositional reasoning capacity of LLMs is rarely studied or quantified in the existing benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce CryptoX, an evaluation framework that, for the first time, combines existing benchmarks and cryptographic, to quantify the compositional reasoning capacity of LLMs. Building upon CryptoX, we construct CryptoBench, which integrates these principles into several benchmarks for systematic evaluation. We conduct detailed experiments on widely used open-source and closed-source LLMs using CryptoBench, revealing a huge gap between open-source and closed-source LLMs. We further conduct thorough mechanical interpretability experiments to reveal the inner mechanism of LLMs' compositional reasoning, involving subproblem decomposition, subproblem inference, and summarizing subproblem conclusions. Through analysis based on CryptoBench, we highlight the value of independently studying compositional reasoning and emphasize the need to enhance the compositional reasoning capabilities of LLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Accurate acquisition of surface meteorological conditions at arbitrary locations holds significant importance for weather forecasting and climate simulation. Due to the fact that meteorological states derived from satellite observations are often provided in the form of low-resolution grid fields, the direct application of spatial interpolation to obtain meteorological states for specific locations often results in significant discrepancies when compared to actual observations. Existing downscaling methods for acquiring meteorological state information at higher resolutions commonly overlook the correlation with satellite observations. To bridge the gap, we propose Satellite-observations Guided Diffusion Model (SGD), a conditional diffusion model pre-trained on ERA5 reanalysis data with satellite observations (GridSat) as conditions, which is employed for sampling downscaled meteorological states through a zero-shot guided sampling strategy and patch-based methods. During the training process, we propose to fuse the information from GridSat satellite observations into ERA5 maps via the attention mechanism, enabling SGD to generate atmospheric states that align more accurately with actual conditions. In the sampling, we employed optimizable convolutional kernels to simulate the upscale process, thereby generating high-resolution ERA5 maps using low-resolution ERA5 maps as well as observations from weather stations as guidance. Moreover, our devised patch-based method promotes SGD to generate meteorological states at arbitrary resolutions. Experiments demonstrate SGD fulfills accurate meteorological states downscaling to 6.25km.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, privacy, protect</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Detecting sensitive data such as Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and Protected Health Information (PHI) is critical for data security platforms. This study evaluates regex-based pattern matching algorithms and exact-match search techniques to optimize detection speed, accuracy, and scalability. Our benchmarking results indicate that Google RE2 provides the best balance of speed (10-15 ms/MB), memory efficiency (8-16 MB), and accuracy (99.5%) among regex engines, outperforming PCRE while maintaining broader hardware compatibility than Hyperscan. For exact matching, Aho-Corasick demonstrated superior performance (8 ms/MB) and scalability for large datasets. Performance analysis revealed that regex processing time scales linearly with dataset size and pattern complexity. A hybrid AI + Regex approach achieved the highest F1 score (91. 6%) by improving recall and minimizing false positives. Device benchmarking confirmed that our solution maintains efficient CPU and memory usage on both high-performance and mid-range systems. Despite its effectiveness, challenges remain, such as limited multilingual support and the need for regular pattern updates. Future work should focus on expanding language coverage, integrating data security and privacy management (DSPM) with data loss prevention (DLP) tools, and enhancing regulatory compliance for broader global adoption.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>It is well known that query-based attacks tend to have relatively higher success rates in adversarial black-box attacks. While research on black-box attacks is actively being conducted, relatively few studies have focused on pixel attacks that target only a limited number of pixels. In image classification, query-based pixel attacks often rely on patches, which heavily depend on randomness and neglect the fact that scattered pixels are more suitable for adversarial attacks. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, query-based pixel attacks have not been explored in the field of object detection. To address these issues, we propose a novel pixel-based black-box attack called Remember and Forget Pixel Attack using Reinforcement Learning(RFPAR), consisting of two main components: the Remember and Forget processes. RFPAR mitigates randomness and avoids patch dependency by leveraging rewards generated through a one-step RL algorithm to perturb pixels. RFPAR effectively creates perturbed images that minimize the confidence scores while adhering to limited pixel constraints. Furthermore, we advance our proposed attack beyond image classification to object detection, where RFPAR reduces the confidence scores of detected objects to avoid detection. Experiments on the ImageNet-1K dataset for classification show that RFPAR outperformed state-of-the-art query-based pixel attacks. For object detection, using the MSCOCO dataset with YOLOv8 and DDQ, RFPAR demonstrates comparable mAP reduction to state-of-the-art query-based attack while requiring fewer query. Further experiments on the Argoverse dataset using YOLOv8 confirm that RFPAR effectively removed objects on a larger scale dataset. Our code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, transformer, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Video generative models pre-trained on large-scale internet datasets have achieved remarkable success, excelling at producing realistic synthetic videos. However, they often generate clips based on static prompts (e.g., text or images), limiting their ability to model interactive and dynamic scenarios. In this paper, we propose Dynamic World Simulation (DWS), a novel approach to transform pre-trained video generative models into controllable world simulators capable of executing specified action trajectories. To achieve precise alignment between conditioned actions and generated visual changes, we introduce a lightweight, universal action-conditioned module that seamlessly integrates into any existing model. Instead of focusing on complex visual details, we demonstrate that consistent dynamic transition modeling is the key to building powerful world simulators. Building upon this insight, we further introduce a motion-reinforced loss that enhances action controllability by compelling the model to capture dynamic changes more effectively. Experiments demonstrate that DWS can be versatilely applied to both diffusion and autoregressive transformer models, achieving significant improvements in generating action-controllable, dynamically consistent videos across games and robotics domains. Moreover, to facilitate the applications of the learned world simulator in downstream tasks such as model-based reinforcement learning, we propose prioritized imagination to improve sample efficiency, demonstrating competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>State-space models (SSMs) and transformers dominate the language modeling landscape. However, they are constrained to a lower computational complexity than classical recurrent neural networks (RNNs), limiting their expressivity. In contrast, RNNs lack parallelization during training, raising fundamental questions about the trade off between parallelization and expressivity. We propose implicit SSMs, which iterate a transformation until convergence to a fixed point. Theoretically, we show that implicit SSMs implement the non-linear state-transitions of RNNs. Empirically, we find that only approximate fixed-point convergence suffices, enabling the design of a scalable training curriculum that largely retains parallelization, with full convergence required only for a small subset of tokens. Our approach demonstrates superior state-tracking capabilities on regular languages, surpassing transformers and SSMs. We further scale implicit SSMs to natural language reasoning tasks and pretraining of large-scale language models up to 1.3B parameters on 207B tokens - representing, to our knowledge, the largest implicit model trained to date. Notably, our implicit models outperform their explicit counterparts on standard benchmarks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The integration of preference alignment with diffusion models (DMs) has emerged as a transformative approach to enhance image generation and editing capabilities. Although integrating diffusion models with preference alignment strategies poses significant challenges for novices at this intersection, comprehensive and systematic reviews of this subject are still notably lacking. To bridge this gap, this paper extensively surveys preference alignment with diffusion models in image generation and editing. First, we systematically review cutting-edge optimization techniques such as reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), direct preference optimization (DPO), and others, highlighting their pivotal role in aligning preferences with DMs. Then, we thoroughly explore the applications of aligning preferences with DMs in autonomous driving, medical imaging, robotics, and more. Finally, we comprehensively discuss the challenges of preference alignment with DMs. To our knowledge, this is the first survey centered on preference alignment with DMs, providing insights to drive future innovation in this dynamic area.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While Large language models (LLMs) have advanced natural language processing tasks, their growing computational and memory demands make deployment on resource-constrained devices like mobile phones increasingly challenging. In this paper, we propose SHARP (SHaring Adjacent Layers with Recovery Parameters), a novel approach to accelerate LLM inference by sharing parameters across adjacent layers, thus reducing memory load overhead, while introducing low-rank recovery parameters to maintain performance. Inspired by observations that consecutive layers have similar outputs, SHARP employs a two-stage recovery process: Single Layer Warmup (SLW), and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). The SLW stage aligns the outputs of the shared layers using L_2 loss, providing a good initialization for the following SFT stage to further restore the model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SHARP can recover the model's perplexity on various in-distribution tasks using no more than 50k fine-tuning data while reducing the number of stored MLP parameters by 38% to 65%. We also conduct several ablation studies of SHARP and show that replacing layers towards the later parts of the model yields better performance retention, and that different recovery parameterizations perform similarly when parameter counts are matched. Furthermore, SHARP saves 42.8% in model storage and reduces the total inference time by 42.2% compared to the original Llama2-7b model on mobile devices. Our results highlight SHARP as an efficient solution for reducing inference costs in deploying LLMs without the need for pretraining-scale resources.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as GPT-4V and Llama 3.2 vision, have garnered significant research attention for their ability to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) in multimodal tasks. However, their potential is constrained by inherent challenges, including proprietary restrictions, substantial computational demands, and limited accessibility. Smaller models, such as GIT and BLIP, exhibit marked limitations, often failing to generate coherent and consistent text beyond a few tokens, even with extensive training. This underscores a pivotal inquiry: how small can a VLM be and still produce fluent and consistent text? Drawing inspiration from the exceptional learning process of 3-4 year old children, who rely heavily on visual cues for understanding and communication, we introduce two novel datasets: ShortDesc (featuring concise image descriptions) and LongDesc (containing more detailed image descriptions). These datasets consist of image-text pairs where the text is restricted to the simple vocabulary and syntax typically used by young children, generated with a scaled- down model, GPT-4o. Using these datasets, we demonstrate that it is possible to train VLMs that are significantly smaller, up to 10 times smaller than state of the art(SOTA) small VLMs while maintaining architectural simplicity. To evaluate the outputs, we leverage GPT-4o to grade the text, as if stories written by students, on creativity, meaningfulness, and consistency, assigning scores out of 10. This method addresses limitations of standard benchmarks by accommodating unstructured outputs and providing a multidimensional evaluation of the model capabilities. Our findings contribute to the development of lightweight, accessible multimodal models for resource constrained environments.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Transparent object manipulation remains a sig- nificant challenge in robotics due to the difficulty of acquiring accurate and dense depth measurements. Conventional depth sensors often fail with transparent objects, resulting in in- complete or erroneous depth data. Existing depth completion methods struggle with interframe consistency and incorrectly model transparent objects as Lambertian surfaces, leading to poor depth reconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose TranSplat, a surface embedding-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting method tailored for transparent objects. TranSplat uses a latent diffusion model to generate surface embeddings that provide consistent and continuous representations, making it robust to changes in viewpoint and lighting. By integrating these surface embeddings with input RGB images, TranSplat effectively captures the complexities of transparent surfaces, enhancing the splatting of 3D Gaussians and improving depth completion. Evaluations on synthetic and real-world transpar- ent object benchmarks, as well as robot grasping tasks, show that TranSplat achieves accurate and dense depth completion, demonstrating its effectiveness in practical applications.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>protect, attack, robust, watermark, diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative models that can produce realistic images have improved significantly in recent years. The quality of the generated content has increased drastically, so sometimes it is very difficult to distinguish between the real images and the generated ones. Such an improvement comes at a price of ethical concerns about the usage of the generative models: the users of generative models can improperly claim ownership of the generated content protected by a license. In this paper, we propose an approach to embed watermarks into the generated content to allow future detection of the generated content and identification of the user who generated it. The watermark is embedded during the inference of the model, so the proposed approach does not require the retraining of the latter. We prove that watermarks embedded are guaranteed to be robust against additive perturbations of a bounded magnitude. We apply our method to watermark diffusion models and show that it matches state-of-the-art watermarking schemes in terms of robustness to different types of synthetic watermark removal attacks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Despite being a successful example of emerging capability, vision-language foundation models for low-shot vision classification have a limited ability to sufficiently generalize to the target data distribution due to sample poverty, leading to sensitivity to variations in the data. A popular mitigation strategy is finetuning over multiple datasets, but domain generalization is expensive when practiced in this manner. This work examines both covariate shift between pre-training data and the underspecified target data, and \textit{confidence misalignment}, where the model's prediction confidence amplified by the limited data availability. We propose \textit{Confidence-Calibrated Covariate Shift Correction ($C3SC$)}, a unified framework to mitigate both covariate shift and confidence misalignment. $C3SC$ leverages Fisher information penalty for covariate shift correction and confidence misalignment penalty (CMP) to lower confidence on misclassified examples. Experimental results across various vision and covariate shift datasets demonstrates that $C3SC$ significantly improves in calibration (ECE) by $5.82\%$ at maximum. $C3SC$ shows better robustness as well by showing $3.5\%$ improvement in accuracy metric on challenging covariate shift datasets, making $C3SC$ a promising solution for reliable real-world vision-language low-shot applications under distribution shift.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent studies have raised concerns about the effectiveness of Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), indicating that in low-dimensional settings, it can lead to overshooting the target distribution and reducing sample diversity. In this work, we demonstrate that in infinite and sufficiently high-dimensional contexts CFG effectively reproduces the target distribution, revealing a blessing-of-dimensionality result. Additionally, we explore finite-dimensional effects, precisely characterizing overshoot and variance reduction. Based on our analysis, we introduce non-linear generalizations of CFG. Through numerical simulations on Gaussian mixtures and experiments on class-conditional and text-to-image diffusion models, we validate our analysis and show that our non-linear CFG offers improved flexibility and generation quality without additional computation cost.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vision Large Language Models (VLMs) combine visual understanding with natural language processing, enabling tasks like image captioning, visual question answering, and video analysis. While VLMs show impressive capabilities across domains such as autonomous vehicles, smart surveillance, and healthcare, their deployment on resource-constrained edge devices remains challenging due to processing power, memory, and energy limitations. This survey explores recent advancements in optimizing VLMs for edge environments, focusing on model compression techniques, including pruning, quantization, knowledge distillation, and specialized hardware solutions that enhance efficiency. We provide a detailed discussion of efficient training and fine-tuning methods, edge deployment challenges, and privacy considerations. Additionally, we discuss the diverse applications of lightweight VLMs across healthcare, environmental monitoring, and autonomous systems, illustrating their growing impact. By highlighting key design strategies, current challenges, and offering recommendations for future directions, this survey aims to inspire further research into the practical deployment of VLMs, ultimately making advanced AI accessible in resource-limited settings.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In applications of diffusion models, controllable generation is of practical significance, but is also challenging. Current methods for controllable generation primarily focus on modifying the score function of diffusion models, while Mean Reverting (MR) Diffusion directly modifies the structure of the stochastic differential equation (SDE), making the incorporation of image conditions simpler and more natural. However, current training-free fast samplers are not directly applicable to MR Diffusion. And thus MR Diffusion requires hundreds of NFEs (number of function evaluations) to obtain high-quality samples. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm named MRS (MR Sampler) to reduce the sampling NFEs of MR Diffusion. We solve the reverse-time SDE and the probability flow ordinary differential equation (PF-ODE) associated with MR Diffusion, and derive semi-analytical solutions. The solutions consist of an analytical function and an integral parameterized by a neural network. Based on this solution, we can generate high-quality samples in fewer steps. Our approach does not require training and supports all mainstream parameterizations, including noise prediction, data prediction and velocity prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MR Sampler maintains high sampling quality with a speedup of 10 to 20 times across ten different image restoration tasks. Our algorithm accelerates the sampling procedure of MR Diffusion, making it more practical in controllable generation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Anomaly detection in time series is essential for industrial monitoring and environmental sensing, yet distinguishing anomalies from complex patterns remains challenging. Existing methods like the Anomaly Transformer and DCdetector have progressed, but they face limitations such as sensitivity to short-term contexts and inefficiency in noisy, non-stationary environments. To overcome these issues, we introduce MAAT, an improved architecture that enhances association discrepancy modeling and reconstruction quality. MAAT features Sparse Attention, efficiently capturing long-range dependencies by focusing on relevant time steps, thereby reducing computational redundancy. Additionally, a Mamba-Selective State Space Model is incorporated into the reconstruction module, utilizing a skip connection and Gated Attention to improve anomaly localization and detection performance. Extensive experiments show that MAAT significantly outperforms previous methods, achieving better anomaly distinguishability and generalization across various time series applications, setting a new standard for unsupervised time series anomaly detection in real-world scenarios.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive success, but their high memory requirements present challenges for long-context token generation. The memory complexity of long-context LLMs is primarily due to the need to store Key-Value (KV) embeddings in their KV cache. We present BalanceKV, a KV cache compression method based on geometric sampling process stemming from Banaszczyk's vector balancing theory, which introduces dependencies informed by the geometry of keys and value tokens, and improves precision. BalanceKV offers both theoretically proven and empirically validated performance improvements over existing methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multimodal deep learning systems are deployed in dynamic scenarios due to the robustness afforded by multiple sensing modalities. Nevertheless, they struggle with varying compute resource availability (due to multi-tenancy, device heterogeneity, etc.) and fluctuating quality of inputs (from sensor feed corruption, environmental noise, etc.). Current multimodal systems employ static resource provisioning and cannot easily adapt when compute resources change over time. Additionally, their reliance on processing sensor data with fixed feature extractors is ill-equipped to handle variations in modality quality. Consequently, uninformative modalities, such as those with high noise, needlessly consume resources better allocated towards other modalities. We propose ADMN, a layer-wise Adaptive Depth Multimodal Network capable of tackling both challenges - it adjusts the total number of active layers across all modalities to meet compute resource constraints, and continually reallocates layers across input modalities according to their modality quality. Our evaluations showcase ADMN can match the accuracy of state-of-the-art networks while reducing up to 75% of their floating-point operations.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Modern large language models (LLMs) often encounter communication bottlenecks on current hardware, rather than purely computational constraints. Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) tackles this challenge by using low-rank matrices in the key-value (KV) layers, thereby allowing compressed latent KV states to be cached. This approach significantly reduces the KV cache size relative to traditional multi-head attention, leading to faster inference. Moreover, MLA employs an up-projection matrix to increase expressiveness, trading additional computation for reduced communication overhead. Although MLA has demonstrated efficiency and effectiveness in Deepseek V2/V3/R1, many major model providers still rely on Group Query Attention (GQA) and have not announced any plans to adopt MLA. In this paper, we show that GQA can always be represented by MLA while maintaining the same KV cache overhead, but the converse does not hold. To encourage broader use of MLA, we introduce **TransMLA**, a post-training method that converts widely used GQA-based pre-trained models (e.g., LLaMA, Qwen, Mixtral) into MLA-based models. After conversion, the model can undergo additional training to boost expressiveness without increasing the KV cache size. Furthermore, we plan to develop MLA-specific inference acceleration techniques to preserve low latency in transformed models, thus enabling more efficient distillation of Deepseek R1.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Monocular egocentric 3D human motion capture remains a significant challenge, particularly under conditions of low lighting and fast movements, which are common in head-mounted device applications. Existing methods that rely on RGB cameras often fail under these conditions. To address these limitations, we introduce EventEgo3D++, the first approach that leverages a monocular event camera with a fisheye lens for 3D human motion capture. Event cameras excel in high-speed scenarios and varying illumination due to their high temporal resolution, providing reliable cues for accurate 3D human motion capture. EventEgo3D++ leverages the LNES representation of event streams to enable precise 3D reconstructions. We have also developed a mobile head-mounted device (HMD) prototype equipped with an event camera, capturing a comprehensive dataset that includes real event observations from both controlled studio environments and in-the-wild settings, in addition to a synthetic dataset. Additionally, to provide a more holistic dataset, we include allocentric RGB streams that offer different perspectives of the HMD wearer, along with their corresponding SMPL body model. Our experiments demonstrate that EventEgo3D++ achieves superior 3D accuracy and robustness compared to existing solutions, even in challenging conditions. Moreover, our method supports real-time 3D pose updates at a rate of 140Hz. This work is an extension of the EventEgo3D approach (CVPR 2024) and further advances the state of the art in egocentric 3D human motion capture.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text-conditioned image generation has gained significant attention in recent years and are processing increasingly longer and comprehensive text prompt. In everyday life, dense and intricate text appears in contexts like advertisements, infographics, and signage, where the integration of both text and visuals is essential for conveying complex information. However, despite these advances, the generation of images containing long-form text remains a persistent challenge, largely due to the limitations of existing datasets, which often focus on shorter and simpler text. To address this gap, we introduce TextAtlas5M, a novel dataset specifically designed to evaluate long-text rendering in text-conditioned image generation. Our dataset consists of 5 million long-text generated and collected images across diverse data types, enabling comprehensive evaluation of large-scale generative models on long-text image generation. We further curate 3000 human-improved test set TextAtlasEval across 3 data domains, establishing one of the most extensive benchmarks for text-conditioned generation. Evaluations suggest that the TextAtlasEval benchmarks present significant challenges even for the most advanced proprietary models (e.g. GPT4o with DallE-3), while their open-source counterparts show an even larger performance gap. These evidences position TextAtlas5M as a valuable dataset for training and evaluating future-generation text-conditioned image generation models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rise of large language models has opened new avenues for users seeking legal advice. However, users often lack professional legal knowledge, which can lead to questions that omit critical information. This deficiency makes it challenging for traditional legal question-answering systems to accurately identify users' actual needs, often resulting in imprecise or generalized advice. In this work, we develop a legal question-answering system called Intelligent Legal Assistant, which interacts with users to precisely capture their needs. When a user poses a question, the system requests that the user select their geographical location to pinpoint the applicable laws. It then generates clarifying questions and options based on the key information missing from the user's initial question. This allows the user to select and provide the necessary details. Once all necessary information is provided, the system produces an in-depth legal analysis encompassing three aspects: overall conclusion, jurisprudential analysis, and resolution suggestions.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) represent the cutting edge of AI technology, with DeepSeek models emerging as a leading open-source alternative offering competitive performance to closed-source systems. While these models demonstrate remarkable capabilities, their vision-language integration mechanisms introduce specific vulnerabilities. We implement an adapted embedding manipulation attack on DeepSeek Janus that induces targeted visual hallucinations through systematic optimization of image embeddings. Through extensive experimentation across COCO, DALL-E 3, and SVIT datasets, we achieve hallucination rates of up to 98.0% while maintaining high visual fidelity (SSIM > 0.88) of the manipulated images on open-ended questions. Our analysis demonstrates that both 1B and 7B variants of DeepSeek Janus are susceptible to these attacks, with closed-form evaluation showing consistently higher hallucination rates compared to open-ended questioning. We introduce a novel multi-prompt hallucination detection framework using LLaMA-3.1 8B Instruct for robust evaluation. The implications of these findings are particularly concerning given DeepSeek's open-source nature and widespread deployment potential. This research emphasizes the critical need for embedding-level security measures in MLLM deployment pipelines and contributes to the broader discussion of responsible AI implementation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results across numerous domains, yet they experience notable deficiencies in legal question-answering tasks. LLMs often generate generalized responses that lack the logical specificity required for expert legal advice and are prone to hallucination, providing answers that appear correct but are unreliable. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques offer partial solutions to address this challenge, but existing approaches typically focus only on semantic similarity, neglecting the logical structure essential to legal reasoning. In this paper, we propose the Logical-Semantic Integration Model (LSIM), a novel supervised framework that bridges semantic and logical coherence. LSIM comprises three components: reinforcement learning predicts a structured fact-rule chain for each question, a trainable Deep Structured Semantic Model (DSSM) retrieves the most relevant candidate questions by integrating semantic and logical features, and in-context learning generates the final answer using the retrieved content. Our experiments on a real-world legal QA dataset-validated through both automated metrics and human evaluation-demonstrate that LSIM significantly enhances accuracy and reliability compared to existing methods.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper presents a technique for generating sound by leveraging the electrical properties of liquid crystal displays (LCDs). The phenomenon occurs due to vibrational noise produced by capacitors within the LCD panel during rapid pixel state transitions. By modulating these transitions through specially crafted bitmap patterns projected onto the screen, we demonstrate how weak yet audible acoustic signals can be generated directly from the display. We designed, implemented, evaluated, and tested a system that repurposes the LCD as a sound-emitting device. Potential applications for this technique include low-power auditory feedback systems, short-range device communication, air-gap covert channels, secure auditory signaling, and innovative approaches to human-computer interaction.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Online reinforcement learning (RL) enhances policies through direct interactions with the environment, but faces challenges related to sample efficiency. In contrast, offline RL leverages extensive pre-collected data to learn policies, but often produces suboptimal results due to limited data coverage. Recent efforts have sought to integrate offline and online RL in order to harness the advantages of both approaches. However, effectively combining online and offline RL remains challenging due to issues that include catastrophic forgetting, lack of robustness and sample efficiency. In an effort to address these challenges, we introduce A3 RL , a novel method that actively selects data from combined online and offline sources to optimize policy improvement. We provide theoretical guarantee that validates the effectiveness our active sampling strategy and conduct thorough empirical experiments showing that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art online RL techniques that utilize offline data.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Surgical simulation offers a promising addition to conventional surgical training. However, available simulation tools lack photorealism and rely on hardcoded behaviour. Denoising Diffusion Models are a promising alternative for high-fidelity image synthesis, but existing state-of-the-art conditioning methods fall short in providing precise control or interactivity over the generated scenes. We introduce SurGrID, a Scene Graph to Image Diffusion Model, allowing for controllable surgical scene synthesis by leveraging Scene Graphs. These graphs encode a surgical scene's components' spatial and semantic information, which are then translated into an intermediate representation using our novel pre-training step that explicitly captures local and global information. Our proposed method improves the fidelity of generated images and their coherence with the graph input over the state-of-the-art. Further, we demonstrate the simulation's realism and controllability in a user assessment study involving clinical experts. Scene Graphs can be effectively used for precise and interactive conditioning of Denoising Diffusion Models for simulating surgical scenes, enabling high fidelity and interactive control over the generated content.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Employing self-supervised learning (SSL) methodologies assumes par-amount significance in handling unlabeled polyp datasets when building deep learning-based automatic polyp segmentation models. However, the intricate privacy dynamics surrounding medical data often preclude seamless data sharing among disparate medical centers. Federated learning (FL) emerges as a formidable solution to this privacy conundrum, yet within the realm of FL, optimizing model generalization stands as a pressing imperative. Robust generalization capabilities are imperative to ensure the model's efficacy across diverse geographical domains post-training on localized client datasets. In this paper, a Federated self-supervised Domain Generalization method is proposed to enhance the generalization capacity of federated and Label-efficient intestinal polyp segmentation, named LFDG. Based on a classical SSL method, DropPos, LFDG proposes an adversarial learning-based data augmentation method (SSADA) to enhance the data diversity. LFDG further proposes a relaxation module based on Source-reconstruction and Augmentation-masking (SRAM) to maintain stability in feature learning. We have validated LFDG on polyp images from six medical centers. The performance of our method achieves 3.80% and 3.92% better than the baseline and other recent FL methods and SSL methods, respectively.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While self-attention has been instrumental in the success of Transformers, it can lead to over-concentration on a few tokens during training, resulting in suboptimal information flow. Enforcing doubly-stochastic constraints in attention matrices has been shown to improve structure and balance in attention distributions. However, existing methods rely on iterative Sinkhorn normalization, which is computationally costly. In this paper, we introduce a novel, fully parallelizable doubly-stochastic attention mechanism based on sliced optimal transport, leveraging Expected Sliced Transport Plans (ESP). Unlike prior approaches, our method enforces double stochasticity without iterative Sinkhorn normalization, significantly enhancing efficiency. To ensure differentiability, we incorporate a temperature-based soft sorting technique, enabling seamless integration into deep learning models. Experiments across multiple benchmark datasets, including image classification, point cloud classification, sentiment analysis, and neural machine translation, demonstrate that our enhanced attention regularization consistently improves performance across diverse applications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Medical research faces well-documented challenges in translating novel treatments into clinical practice. Publishing incentives encourage researchers to present "positive" findings, even when empirical results are equivocal. Consequently, it is well-documented that authors often spin study results, especially in article abstracts. Such spin can influence clinician interpretation of evidence and may affect patient care decisions. In this study, we ask whether the interpretation of trial results offered by Large Language Models (LLMs) is similarly affected by spin. This is important since LLMs are increasingly being used to trawl through and synthesize published medical evidence. We evaluated 22 LLMs and found that they are across the board more susceptible to spin than humans. They might also propagate spin into their outputs: We find evidence, e.g., that LLMs implicitly incorporate spin into plain language summaries that they generate. We also find, however, that LLMs are generally capable of recognizing spin, and can be prompted in a way to mitigate spin's impact on LLM outputs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization on graphs aims at dealing with scenarios where the test graph distribution differs from the training graph distributions. Compared to i.i.d. data like images, the OOD generalization problem on graph-structured data remains challenging due to the non-i.i.d. property and complex structural information on graphs. Recently, several works on graph OOD generalization have explored extracting invariant subgraphs that share crucial classification information across different distributions. Nevertheless, such a strategy could be suboptimal for entirely capturing the invariant information, as the extraction of discrete structures could potentially lead to the loss of invariant information or the involvement of spurious information. In this paper, we propose an innovative framework, named Generative Risk Minimization (GRM), designed to generate an invariant subgraph for each input graph to be classified, instead of extraction. To address the challenge of optimization in the absence of optimal invariant subgraphs (i.e., ground truths), we derive a tractable form of the proposed GRM objective by introducing a latent causal variable, and its effectiveness is validated by our theoretical analysis. We further conduct extensive experiments across a variety of real-world graph datasets for both node-level and graph-level OOD generalization, and the results demonstrate the superiority of our framework GRM.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Transformer-based text embedding models have improved their performance on benchmarks like MIRACL and BEIR by increasing their parameter counts. However, this scaling approach introduces significant deployment challenges, including increased inference latency and memory usage. These challenges are particularly severe in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) applications, where large models' increased memory requirements constrain dataset ingestion capacity, and their higher latency directly impacts query-time performance. While causal language models have addressed similar efficiency challenges using Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures, this approach hasn't been successfully adapted to the general text embedding setting. In this paper, we introduce Nomic Embed v2, the first general purpose MoE text embedding model. Our model outperforms models in the same parameter class on both monolingual and multilingual benchmarks while also maintaining competitive performance with models twice its size. We open-source all code, models, and evaluation data to ensure full reproducibility of our training pipeline.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, attack, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Empirical risk minimization (ERM) is a cornerstone of modern machine learning (ML), supported by advances in optimization theory that ensure efficient solutions with provable algorithmic convergence rates, which measure the speed at which optimization algorithms approach a solution, and statistical learning rates, which characterize how well the solution generalizes to unseen data. Privacy, memory, computational, and communications constraints increasingly necessitate data collection, processing, and storage across network-connected devices. In many applications, these networks operate in decentralized settings where a central server cannot be assumed, requiring decentralized ML algorithms that are both efficient and resilient. Decentralized learning, however, faces significant challenges, including an increased attack surface for adversarial interference during decentralized learning processes. This paper focuses on the man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, which can cause models to deviate significantly from their intended ERM solutions. To address this challenge, we propose RESIST (Resilient dEcentralized learning using conSensus gradIent deScenT), an optimization algorithm designed to be robust against adversarially compromised communication links. RESIST achieves algorithmic and statistical convergence for strongly convex, Polyak-Lojasiewicz, and nonconvex ERM problems. Experimental results demonstrate the robustness and scalability of RESIST for real-world decentralized learning in adversarial environments.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Cancers are characterized by remarkable heterogeneity and diverse prognosis. Accurate cancer classification is essential for patient stratification and clinical decision-making. Although digital pathology has been advancing cancer diagnosis and prognosis, the paradigm in cancer pathology has shifted from purely relying on histology features to incorporating molecular markers. There is an urgent need for digital pathology methods to meet the needs of the new paradigm. We introduce a novel digital pathology approach to jointly predict molecular markers and histology features and model their interactions for cancer classification. Firstly, to mitigate the challenge of cross-magnification information propagation, we propose a multi-scale disentangling module, enabling the extraction of multi-scale features from high-magnification (cellular-level) to low-magnification (tissue-level) whole slide images. Further, based on the multi-scale features, we propose an attention-based hierarchical multi-task multi-instance learning framework to simultaneously predict histology and molecular markers. Moreover, we propose a co-occurrence probability-based label correlation graph network to model the co-occurrence of molecular markers. Lastly, we design a cross-modal interaction module with the dynamic confidence constrain loss and a cross-modal gradient modulation strategy, to model the interactions of histology and molecular markers. Our experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in classifying glioma, histology features and molecular markers. Our method promises to promote precise oncology with the potential to advance biomedical research and clinical applications. The code is available at this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The role of Large Language Models (LLMs) has not been extensively explored in analog circuit design, which could benefit from a reasoning-based approach that transcends traditional optimization techniques. In particular, despite their growing relevance, there are no benchmarks to assess LLMs' reasoning capability about circuits. Therefore, we created the CIRCUIT dataset consisting of 510 question-answer pairs spanning various levels of analog-circuit-related subjects. The best-performing model on our dataset, GPT-4o, achieves 48.04% accuracy when evaluated on the final numerical answer. To evaluate the robustness of LLMs on our dataset, we introduced a unique feature that enables unit-test-like evaluation by grouping questions into unit tests. In this case, GPT-4o can only pass 27.45% of the unit tests, highlighting that the most advanced LLMs still struggle with understanding circuits, which requires multi-level reasoning, particularly when involving circuit topologies. This circuit-specific benchmark highlights LLMs' limitations, offering valuable insights for advancing their application in analog integrated circuit design.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose a novel dynamic safety framework that optimizes language model (LM) safety reasoning at inference time without modifying model weights. Building on recent advances in self-critique methods, our approach leverages a meta-critique mechanism that iteratively updates safety prompts-termed specifications-to drive the critique and revision process adaptively. This test-time optimization not only improves performance against adversarial jailbreak requests but also in diverse general safety-related tasks, such as avoiding moral harm or pursuing honest responses. Our empirical evaluations across several language models demonstrate that dynamically optimized safety prompts yield significantly higher safety scores compared to fixed system prompts and static self-critique defenses.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Modeling and simulation of complex fluid flows with dynamics that span multiple spatio-temporal scales is a fundamental challenge in many scientific and engineering domains. Full-scale resolving simulations for systems such as highly turbulent flows are not feasible in the foreseeable future, and reduced-order models must capture dynamics that involve interactions across scales. In the present work, we propose a novel framework, Graph-based Learning of Effective Dynamics (Graph-LED), that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs), as well as an attention-based autoregressive model, to extract the effective dynamics from a small amount of simulation data. GNNs represent flow fields on unstructured meshes as graphs and effectively handle complex geometries and non-uniform grids. The proposed method combines a GNN based, dimensionality reduction for variable-size unstructured meshes with an autoregressive temporal attention model that can learn temporal dependencies automatically. We evaluated the proposed approach on a suite of fluid dynamics problems, including flow past a cylinder and flow over a backward-facing step over a range of Reynolds numbers. The results demonstrate robust and effective forecasting of spatio-temporal physics; in the case of the flow past a cylinder, both small-scale effects that occur close to the cylinder as well as its wake are accurately captured.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, protect, attack, robust, membership infer, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated Distillation (FD) has emerged as a popular federated training framework, enabling clients to collaboratively train models without sharing private data. Public Dataset-Assisted Federated Distillation (PDA-FD), which leverages public datasets for knowledge sharing, has become widely adopted. Although PDA-FD enhances privacy compared to traditional Federated Learning, we demonstrate that the use of public datasets still poses significant privacy risks to clients' private training data. This paper presents the first comprehensive privacy analysis of PDA-FD in presence of an honest-but-curious server. We show that the server can exploit clients' inference results on public datasets to extract two critical types of private information: label distributions and membership information of the private training dataset. To quantify these vulnerabilities, we introduce two novel attacks specifically designed for the PDA-FD setting: a label distribution inference attack and innovative membership inference methods based on Likelihood Ratio Attack (LiRA). Through extensive evaluation of three representative PDA-FD frameworks (FedMD, DS-FL, and Cronus), our attacks achieve state-of-the-art performance, with label distribution attacks reaching minimal KL-divergence and membership inference attacks maintaining high True Positive Rates under low False Positive Rate constraints. Our findings reveal significant privacy risks in current PDA-FD frameworks and emphasize the need for more robust privacy protection mechanisms in collaborative learning systems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in one-step generative models typically follow a two-stage process: first training a teacher diffusion model and then distilling it into a one-step student model. This distillation process traditionally relies on both the teacher model's score function to compute the distillation loss and its weights for student initialization. In this paper, we explore whether one-step generative models can be trained directly without this distillation process. First, we show that the teacher's score function is not essential and propose a family of distillation methods that achieve competitive results without relying on score estimation. Next, we demonstrate that initialization from teacher weights is indispensable in successful training. Surprisingly, we find that this benefit is not due to improved ``input-output" mapping but rather the learned feature representations, which dominate distillation quality. Our findings provide a better understanding of the role of initialization in one-step model training and its impact on distillation quality.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Training-free guided generation is a widely used and powerful technique that allows the end user to exert further control over the generative process of diffusion models. In this work, we explore the guided generation from the perspective of optimizing the solution trajectory of a neural differential equation in a greedy manner. We present such a strategy as a unifying view on training-free guidance by showing that the greedy strategy is a first-order discretization of end-to-end optimization techniques. We show that a greedy guidance strategy makes good decisions and compare it to a guidance strategy using the ideal gradients found via the continuous adjoint equations. We then show how other popular training-free guidance strategies can be viewed in a unified manner from this perspective.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Stability is a central property in learning and statistics promising the output of an algorithm $A$ does not change substantially when applied to similar datasets $S$ and $S'$. It is an elementary fact that any sufficiently stable algorithm (e.g.\ one returning the same result with high probability, satisfying privacy guarantees, etc.) must be randomized. This raises a natural question: can we quantify how much randomness is needed for algorithmic stability? We study the randomness complexity of two influential notions of stability in learning: replicability, which promises $A$ usually outputs the same result when run over samples from the same distribution (and shared random coins), and differential privacy, which promises the output distribution of $A$ remains similar under neighboring datasets. The randomness complexity of these notions was studied recently in (Dixon et al. ICML 2024) and (Cannone et al. ITCS 2024) for basic $d$-dimensional tasks (e.g. estimating the bias of $d$ coins), but little is known about the measures more generally or in complex settings like classification. Toward this end, we prove a `weak-to-strong' boosting theorem for stability: the randomness complexity of a task $M$ (either under replicability or DP) is tightly controlled by the best replication probability of any deterministic algorithm solving the task, a weak measure called `global stability' that is universally capped at $\frac{1}{2}$ (Chase et al. FOCS 2023). Using this, we characterize the randomness complexity of PAC Learning: a class has bounded randomness complexity iff it has finite Littlestone dimension, and moreover scales at worst logarithmically in the excess error of the learner. This resolves a question of (Chase et al. STOC 2024) who asked for such a characterization in the equivalent language of (error-dependent) `list-replicability'.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, attack, robust, federate, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated learning (FL) enhances privacy by keeping user data on local devices. However, emerging attacks have demonstrated that the updates shared by users during training can reveal significant information about their data. This has greatly thwart the adoption of FL methods for training robust AI models in sensitive applications. Differential Privacy (DP) is considered the gold standard for safeguarding user data. However, DP guarantees are highly conservative, providing worst-case privacy guarantees. This can result in overestimating privacy needs, which may compromise the model's accuracy. Additionally, interpretations of these privacy guarantees have proven to be challenging in different contexts. This is further exacerbated when other factors, such as the number of training iterations, data distribution, and specific application requirements, can add further complexity to this problem. In this work, we proposed a framework that integrates a human entity as a privacy practitioner to determine an optimal trade-off between the model's privacy and utility. Our framework is the first to address the variable memory requirement of existing DP methods in FL settings, where resource-limited devices (e.g., cell phones) can participate. To support such settings, we adopt a recent DP method with fixed memory usage to ensure scalable private FL. We evaluated our proposed framework by fine-tuning a BERT-based LLM model using the GLUE dataset (a common approach in literature), leveraging the new accountant, and employing diverse data partitioning strategies to mimic real-world conditions. As a result, we achieved stable memory usage, with an average accuracy reduction of 1.33% for $\epsilon = 10$ and 1.9% for $\epsilon = 6$, when compared to the state-of-the-art DP accountant which does not support fixed memory usage.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Decoder-only language models have the ability to dynamically switch between various computational tasks based on input prompts. Despite many successful applications of prompting, there is very limited understanding of the internal mechanism behind such flexibility. In this work, we investigate how different prompting methods affect the geometry of representations in these models. Employing a framework grounded in statistical physics, we reveal that various prompting techniques, while achieving similar performance, operate through distinct representational mechanisms for task adaptation. Our analysis highlights the critical role of input distribution samples and label semantics in few-shot in-context learning. We also demonstrate evidence of synergistic and interfering interactions between different tasks on the representational level. Our work contributes to the theoretical understanding of large language models and lays the groundwork for developing more effective, representation-aware prompting strategies.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Encryption-based cyber threats continue to evolve, employing increasingly sophisticated techniques to bypass traditional detection mechanisms. Many existing classification strategies depend on static rule sets, signature-based matching, or machine learning models that require extensive labeled datasets, making them ineffective against emerging ransomware families that exhibit polymorphic and adversarial behaviors. A novel classification framework structured through hierarchical manifold projection introduces a mathematical approach to detecting malicious encryption workflows, preserving geometric consistencies that differentiate ransomware-induced modifications from benign cryptographic operations. The proposed methodology transforms encryption sequences into structured manifold embeddings, ensuring classification robustness through non-Euclidean feature separability rather than reliance on static indicators. Generalization capabilities remain stable across diverse ransomware variants, as hierarchical decomposition techniques capture multi-scale encryption characteristics while maintaining resilience against code obfuscation and execution flow modifications. Empirical analysis demonstrates that detection accuracy remains high even when encryption key variability, delayed execution tactics, or API call obfuscation strategies are introduced, reinforcing the reliability of manifold-based classification. Real-time scalability assessments confirm that the proposed approach maintains computational efficiency across increasing dataset volumes, validating its applicability to large-scale threat detection scenarios.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>explainability, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) often excel in specific domains but fall short in others due to the limitations of their training. Thus, enabling LLMs to solve problems collaboratively by integrating their complementary knowledge promises to improve their performance across domains. To realize this potential, we introduce a novel Collaborative Speculative Decoding (CoSD) algorithm that enables efficient LLM knowledge fusion at test time without requiring additional model training. CoSD employs a draft model to generate initial sequences and an easy-to-learn rule or decision tree to decide when to invoke an assistant model to improve these drafts. CoSD not only enhances knowledge fusion but also improves inference efficiency, is transferable across domains and models, and offers greater explainability. Experimental results demonstrate that CoSD improves accuracy by up to 10\% across benchmarks compared to existing methods, providing a scalable and effective solution for LLM-based applications</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Initializing with pre-trained models when learning on downstream tasks is becoming standard practice in machine learning. Several recent works explore the benefits of pre-trained initialization in a federated learning (FL) setting, where the downstream training is performed at the edge clients with heterogeneous data distribution. These works show that starting from a pre-trained model can substantially reduce the adverse impact of data heterogeneity on the test performance of a model trained in a federated setting, with no changes to the standard FedAvg training algorithm. In this work, we provide a deeper theoretical understanding of this phenomenon. To do so, we study the class of two-layer convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and provide bounds on the training error convergence and test error of such a network trained with FedAvg. We introduce the notion of aligned and misaligned filters at initialization and show that the data heterogeneity only affects learning on misaligned filters. Starting with a pre-trained model typically results in fewer misaligned filters at initialization, thus producing a lower test error even when the model is trained in a federated setting with data heterogeneity. Experiments in synthetic settings and practical FL training on CNNs verify our theoretical findings.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) offers rich spatial resolution, it is limited by high operational costs and significant infrastructural demands. In contrast, electroencephalography (EEG) provides millisecond-level precision in capturing electrical activity but lacks the spatial resolution necessary for precise neural localization. To bridge these gaps, we introduce E2fNet, a simple yet effective deep learning model for synthesizing fMRI images from low-cost EEG data. E2fNet is specifically designed to capture and translate meaningful features from EEG across electrode channels into accurate fMRI representations. Extensive evaluations across three datasets demonstrate that E2fNet consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results in terms of the structural similarity index measure (SSIM). Our findings suggest that E2fNet is a promising, cost-effective solution for enhancing neuroimaging capabilities. The code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Internal representations within deep neural architectures encode high-dimensional abstractions of linguistic structures, yet they often exhibit inefficiencies in feature distribution, limiting expressiveness and adaptability. Contextual Subspace Manifold Projection introduces a structured refinement technique that selectively reconfigures token embeddings through controlled subspace constraints, ensuring more stable and geometrically well-defined feature distributions. Empirical evaluations demonstrated that the structured intervention reduced anisotropy, leading to improved representation compactness while preserving semantic fidelity across transformer layers. Clustering analyses indicated that token embeddings exhibited greater feature separability, reinforcing the hypothesis that structured projection techniques enhance internal representation organization without sacrificing linguistic coherence. Gradient magnitude distributions suggested that the method introduced a smoother optimization trajectory, potentially contributing to more stable parameter updates throughout training. Computational overhead associated with the projection operations remained minimal, ensuring that the refinements did not introduce significant trade-offs in model efficiency or inference speed. Comparisons with standard embedding refinement techniques highlighted that structured manifold constraints provided a direct mechanism for improving representation quality without requiring additional gradient-based optimization. Perplexity evaluations confirmed that the adjustments did not negatively impact sequence coherence, further validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in low-resource languages lag far behind those in English, making their universal accessibility a significant challenge. To alleviate this, we present $\textit{Franken-Adapter}$, a modular language adaptation approach for decoder-only LLMs with embedding surgery. Our method begins by creating customized vocabularies for target languages and performing language adaptation through embedding tuning on multilingual data. These pre-trained embeddings are subsequently integrated with LLMs that have been instruction-tuned on English alignment data to enable zero-shot cross-lingual transfer. Our experiments on $\texttt{Gemma2}$ models with up to 27B parameters demonstrate improvements of up to 20% across 96 languages, spanning both discriminative and generative tasks, with minimal regressions ($<$1%) in English. Further in-depth analysis reveals the critical role of customizing tokenizers in enhancing language adaptation, while boosting inference efficiency. Additionally, we show the versatility of our method by achieving a 14% improvement over a math-optimized LLM across 20 languages, offering a modular solution to transfer reasoning abilities across languages post hoc.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>A large number of studies rely on closed-style multiple-choice surveys to evaluate cultural alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs). In this work, we challenge this constrained evaluation paradigm and explore more realistic, unconstrained approaches. Using the World Values Survey (WVS) and Hofstede Cultural Dimensions as case studies, we demonstrate that LLMs exhibit stronger cultural alignment in less constrained settings, where responses are not forced. Additionally, we show that even minor changes, such as reordering survey choices, lead to inconsistent outputs, exposing the limitations of closed-style evaluations. Our findings advocate for more robust and flexible evaluation frameworks that focus on specific cultural proxies, encouraging more nuanced and accurate assessments of cultural alignment in LLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, privacy, attack, robust, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training while keeping client data private. However, exposing individual client updates makes FL vulnerable to reconstruction attacks. Secure aggregation mitigates such privacy risks but prevents the server from verifying the validity of each client update, creating a privacy-robustness tradeoff. Recent efforts attempt to address this tradeoff by enforcing checks on client updates using zero-knowledge proofs, but they support limited predicates and often depend on public validation data. We propose SLVR, a general framework that securely leverages clients' private data through secure multi-party computation. By utilizing clients' data, SLVR not only eliminates the need for public validation data, but also enables a wider range of checks for robustness, including cross-client accuracy validation. It also adapts naturally to distribution shifts in client data as it can securely refresh its validation data up-to-date. Our empirical evaluations show that SLVR improves robustness against model poisoning attacks, particularly outperforming existing methods by up to 50% under adaptive attacks. Additionally, SLVR demonstrates effective adaptability and stable convergence under various distribution shift scenarios.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models are increasingly used to process documents and facilitate question-answering on them. In our paper, we extract mechanistic circuits for this real-world language modeling task: context-augmented language modeling for extractive question-answering (QA) tasks and understand the potential benefits of circuits towards downstream applications such as data attribution to context information. We extract circuits as a function of internal model components (e.g., attention heads, MLPs) using causal mediation analysis techniques. Leveraging the extracted circuits, we first understand the interplay between the model's usage of parametric memory and retrieved context towards a better mechanistic understanding of context-augmented language models. We then identify a small set of attention heads in our circuit which performs reliable data attribution by default, thereby obtaining attribution for free in just the model's forward pass. Using this insight, we then introduce ATTNATTRIB, a fast data attribution algorithm which obtains state-of-the-art attribution results across various extractive QA benchmarks. Finally, we show the possibility to steer the language model towards answering from the context, instead of the parametric memory by using the attribution from ATTNATTRIB as an additional signal during the forward pass. Beyond mechanistic understanding, our paper provides tangible applications of circuits in the form of reliable data attribution and model steering.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce \textbf{Knowledge Swapping}, a novel task designed to selectively regulate knowledge of a pretrained model by enabling the forgetting of user\-specified information, retaining essential knowledge, and acquiring new knowledge simultaneously. By delving into the analysis of knock-on feature hierarchy, we find that incremental learning typically progresses from low\-level representations to higher\-level semantics, whereas forgetting tends to occur in the opposite direction\-starting from high-level semantics and moving down to low-level features. Building upon this, we propose to benchmark the knowledge swapping task with the strategy of \textit{Learning Before Forgetting}. Comprehensive experiments on various tasks like image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Online learning to rank sequentially recommends a small list of items to users from a large candidate set and receives the users' click feedback. In many real-world scenarios, users browse the recommended list in order and click the first attractive item without checking the rest. Such behaviors are usually formulated as the cascade model. Many recent works study algorithms for cascading bandits, an online learning to rank framework in the cascade model. However, the performance of existing methods may drop significantly if part of the user feedback is adversarially corrupted (e.g., click fraud). In this work, we study how to resist adversarial corruptions in cascading bandits. We first formulate the ``\textit{Cascading Bandits with Adversarial Corruptions}" (CBAC) problem, which assumes that there is an adaptive adversary that may manipulate the user feedback. Then we propose two robust algorithms for this problem, which assume the corruption level is known and agnostic, respectively. We show that both algorithms can achieve logarithmic regret when the algorithm is not under attack, and the regret increases linearly with the corruption level. The experimental results also verify the robustness of our methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Current adversarial attacks for evaluating the robustness of vision-language pre-trained (VLP) models in multi-modal tasks suffer from limited transferability, where attacks crafted for a specific model often struggle to generalize effectively across different models, limiting their utility in assessing robustness more broadly. This is mainly attributed to the over-reliance on model-specific features and regions, particularly in the image modality. In this paper, we propose an elegant yet highly effective method termed Meticulous Adversarial Attack (MAA) to fully exploit model-independent characteristics and vulnerabilities of individual samples, achieving enhanced generalizability and reduced model dependence. MAA emphasizes fine-grained optimization of adversarial images by developing a novel resizing and sliding crop (RScrop) technique, incorporating a multi-granularity similarity disruption (MGSD) strategy. Extensive experiments across diverse VLP models, multiple benchmark datasets, and a variety of downstream tasks demonstrate that MAA significantly enhances the effectiveness and transferability of adversarial attacks. A large cohort of performance studies is conducted to generate insights into the effectiveness of various model configurations, guiding future advancements in this domain.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The varying degrees of homophily and heterophily in real-world graphs persistently constrain the universality of graph neural networks (GNNs) for node classification. Adopting a data-centric perspective, this work reveals an inherent preference of different graphs towards distinct message encoding schemes: homophilous graphs favor local propagation, while heterophilous graphs exhibit preference for flexible combinations of propagation and transformation. To address this, we propose GNNMoE, a universal node classification framework based on the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism. The framework first constructs diverse message-passing experts through recombination of fine-grained encoding operators, then designs soft and hard gating layers to allocate the most suitable expert networks for each node's representation learning, thereby enhancing both model expressiveness and adaptability to diverse graphs. Furthermore, considering that soft gating might introduce encoding noise in homophilous scenarios, we introduce an entropy constraint to guide sharpening of soft gates, achieving organic integration of weighted combination and Top-K selection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GNNMoE significantly outperforms mainstream GNNs, heterophilous GNNs, and graph transformers in both node classification performance and universality across diverse graph datasets.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, protect</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Personalized text-to-image models allow users to generate images of new concepts from several reference photos, thereby leading to critical concerns regarding civil privacy. Although several anti-personalization techniques have been developed, these methods typically assume that defenders can afford to design a privacy cloak corresponding to each specific image. However, due to extensive personal images shared online, image-specific methods are limited by real-world practical applications. To address this issue, we are the first to investigate the creation of identity-specific cloaks (ID-Cloak) that safeguard all images belong to a specific identity. Specifically, we first model an identity subspace that preserves personal commonalities and learns diverse contexts to capture the image distribution to be protected. Then, we craft identity-specific cloaks with the proposed novel objective that encourages the cloak to guide the model away from its normal output within the subspace. Extensive experiments show that the generated universal cloak can effectively protect the images. We believe our method, along with the proposed identity-specific cloak setting, marks a notable advance in realistic privacy protection.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Node tokenized graph Transformers (GTs) have shown promising performance in node classification. The generation of token sequences is the key module in existing tokenized GTs which transforms the input graph into token sequences, facilitating the node representation learning via Transformer. In this paper, we observe that the generations of token sequences in existing GTs only focus on the first-order neighbors on the constructed similarity graphs, which leads to the limited usage of nodes to generate diverse token sequences, further restricting the potential of tokenized GTs for node classification. To this end, we propose a new method termed SwapGT. SwapGT first introduces a novel token swapping operation based on the characteristics of token sequences that fully leverages the semantic relevance of nodes to generate more informative token sequences. Then, SwapGT leverages a Transformer-based backbone to learn node representations from the generated token sequences. Moreover, SwapGT develops a center alignment loss to constrain the representation learning from multiple token sequences, further enhancing the model performance. Extensive empirical results on various datasets showcase the superiority of SwapGT for node classification.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Graph machine learning has witnessed rapid growth, driving advancements across diverse domains. However, the in-distribution assumption, where training and testing data share the same distribution, often breaks in real-world scenarios, leading to degraded model performance under distribution shifts. This challenge has catalyzed interest in graph out-of-distribution (GOOD) detection, which focuses on identifying graph data that deviates from the distribution seen during training, thereby enhancing model robustness. In this paper, we provide a rigorous definition of GOOD detection and systematically categorize existing methods into four types: enhancement-based, reconstruction-based, information propagation-based, and classification-based approaches. We analyze the principles and mechanisms of each approach and clarify the distinctions between GOOD detection and related fields, such as graph anomaly detection, outlier detection, and GOOD generalization. Beyond methodology, we discuss practical applications and theoretical foundations, highlighting the unique challenges posed by graph data. Finally, we discuss the primary challenges and propose future directions to advance this emerging field. The repository of this survey is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models have made significant advancements in recent years. However, their performance often deteriorates when trained or fine-tuned on imbalanced datasets. This degradation is largely due to the disproportionate representation of majority and minority data in image-text pairs. In this paper, we propose a general fine-tuning approach, dubbed PoGDiff, to address this challenge. Rather than directly minimizing the KL divergence between the predicted and ground-truth distributions, PoGDiff replaces the ground-truth distribution with a Product of Gaussians (PoG), which is constructed by combining the original ground-truth targets with the predicted distribution conditioned on a neighboring text embedding. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method effectively addresses the imbalance problem in diffusion models, improving both generation accuracy and quality.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability, explainability, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown promising improvements, often surpassing existing methods across a wide range of downstream tasks in natural language processing. However, these models still face challenges, which may hinder their practical applicability. For example, the phenomenon of hallucination is known to compromise the reliability of LLMs, especially in fields that demand high factual precision. Current benchmarks primarily focus on hallucination detection and factuality evaluation but do not extend beyond identification. This paper proposes an explanation enhanced hallucination-detection model, coined as HuDEx, aimed at enhancing the reliability of LLM-generated responses by both detecting hallucinations and providing detailed explanations. The proposed model provides a novel approach to integrate detection with explanations, and enable both users and the LLM itself to understand and reduce errors. Our measurement results demonstrate that the proposed model surpasses larger LLMs, such as Llama3 70B and GPT-4, in hallucination detection accuracy, while maintaining reliable explanations. Furthermore, the proposed model performs well in both zero-shot and other test environments, showcasing its adaptability across diverse benchmark datasets. The proposed approach further enhances the hallucination detection research by introducing a novel approach to integrating interpretability with hallucination detection, which further enhances the performance and reliability of evaluating hallucinations in language models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, attack, robust, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated reinforcement learning (FRL) allows agents to jointly learn a global decision-making policy under the guidance of a central server. While FRL has advantages, its decentralized design makes it prone to poisoning attacks. To mitigate this, Byzantine-robust aggregation techniques tailored for FRL have been introduced. Yet, in our work, we reveal that these current Byzantine-robust techniques are not immune to our newly introduced Normalized attack. Distinct from previous attacks that targeted enlarging the distance of policy updates before and after an attack, our Normalized attack emphasizes on maximizing the angle of deviation between these updates. To counter these threats, we develop an ensemble FRL approach that is provably secure against both known and our newly proposed attacks. Our ensemble method involves training multiple global policies, where each is learnt by a group of agents using any foundational aggregation rule. These well-trained global policies then individually predict the action for a specific test state. The ultimate action is chosen based on a majority vote for discrete action systems or the geometric median for continuous ones. Our experimental results across different settings show that the Normalized attack can greatly disrupt non-ensemble Byzantine-robust methods, and our ensemble approach offers substantial resistance against poisoning attacks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown strong general reasoning abilities, yet their effectiveness in financial reasoning remains underexplored. In this study, we comprehensively evaluate 16 powerful reasoning and general LLMs on three complex financial tasks involving financial text, tabular data, and equations, assessing numerical reasoning, tabular interpretation, financial terminology comprehension, long-context processing, and equation-based problem solving. Our results show that while better datasets and pretraining improve financial reasoning, general enhancements like CoT fine-tuning do not always yield consistent gains. Moreover, all reasoning strategies face challenges in improving performance on long-context and multi-table tasks. To address these limitations, we develop a financial reasoning-enhanced model based on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, by CoT fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with domain-specific reasoning paths. Even with simple fine-tuning with one financial dataset, our model achieves a consistent 10% performance improvement across tasks, surpassing all 8B models and even Llama3-70B-Instruct and Llama3.1-70B-Instruct on average. Our results highlight the need for domain-specific adaptations in financial tasks, emphasizing future directions such as multi-table reasoning, long-context processing, and financial terminology comprehension. All our datasets, models, and codes are publicly available. Furthermore, we introduce a leaderboard for benchmarking future datasets and models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) on specific datasets is a common practice to improve performance on target tasks. However, this performance gain often leads to overfitting, where the model becomes too specialized in either the task or the characteristics of the training data, resulting in a loss of generalization. This paper introduces Selective Self-to-Supervised Fine-Tuning (S3FT), a fine-tuning approach that achieves better performance than the standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) while improving generalization. S3FT leverages the existence of multiple valid responses to a query. By utilizing the model's correct responses, S3FT reduces model specialization during the fine-tuning stage. S3FT first identifies the correct model responses from the training set by deploying an appropriate judge. Then, it fine-tunes the model using the correct model responses and the gold response (or its paraphrase) for the remaining samples. The effectiveness of S3FT is demonstrated through experiments on mathematical reasoning, Python programming and reading comprehension tasks. The results show that standard SFT can lead to an average performance drop of up to $4.4$ on multiple benchmarks, such as MMLU and TruthfulQA. In contrast, S3FT reduces this drop by half, i.e. $2.5$, indicating better generalization capabilities than SFT while performing significantly better on the fine-tuning tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper investigates approximation-theoretic aspects of the in-context learning capability of the transformers in representing a family of noisy linear dynamical systems. Our first theoretical result establishes an upper bound on the approximation error of multi-layer transformers with respect to an $L^2$-testing loss uniformly defined across tasks. This result demonstrates that transformers with logarithmic depth can achieve error bounds comparable with those of the least-squares estimator. In contrast, our second result establishes a non-diminishing lower bound on the approximation error for a class of single-layer linear transformers, which suggests a depth-separation phenomenon for transformers in the in-context learning of dynamical systems. Moreover, this second result uncovers a critical distinction in the approximation power of single-layer linear transformers when learning from IID versus non-IID data.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) is increasingly costly as models scale to hundreds of billions of parameters, and even parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA remain resource-intensive. We introduce LowRA, the first framework to enable LoRA fine-tuning below 2 bits per parameter with minimal performance loss. LowRA optimizes fine-grained quantization - mapping, threshold selection, and precision assignment - while leveraging efficient CUDA kernels for scalable deployment. Extensive evaluations across 4 LLMs and 4 datasets show that LowRA achieves a superior performance-precision trade-off above 2 bits and remains accurate down to 1.15 bits, reducing memory usage by up to 50%. Our results highlight the potential of ultra-low-bit LoRA fine-tuning for resource-constrained environments.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, transformer, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Training and fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with hundreds of billions to trillions of parameters requires tens of thousands of GPUs, and a highly scalable software stack. In this work, we present a novel four-dimensional hybrid parallel algorithm implemented in a highly scalable, portable, open-source framework called AxoNN. We describe several performance optimizations in AxoNN to improve matrix multiply kernel performance, overlap non-blocking collectives with computation, and performance modeling to choose performance optimal configurations. These have resulted in unprecedented scaling and peak flop/s (bf16) for training of GPT-style transformer models on Perlmutter (620.1 Petaflop/s), Frontier (1.381 Exaflop/s) and Alps (1.423 Exaflop/s). While the abilities of LLMs improve with the number of trainable parameters, so do privacy and copyright risks caused by memorization of training data, which can cause disclosure of sensitive or private information at inference time. We highlight this side effect of scale through experiments that explore "catastrophic memorization", where models are sufficiently large to memorize training data in a single pass, and present an approach to prevent it. As part of this study, we demonstrate fine-tuning of a 405-billion parameter LLM using AxoNN on Frontier.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>protect, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Transfer learning is a popular strategy to leverage external knowledge and improve statistical efficiency, particularly with a limited target sample. We propose a novel knowledge-guided Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Optimization (KG-WDRO) framework that adaptively incorporates multiple sources of external knowledge to overcome the conservativeness of vanilla WDRO, which often results in overly pessimistic shrinkage toward zero. Our method constructs smaller Wasserstein ambiguity sets by controlling the transportation along directions informed by the source knowledge. This strategy can alleviate perturbations on the predictive projection of the covariates and protect against information loss. Theoretically, we establish the equivalence between our WDRO formulation and the knowledge-guided shrinkage estimation based on collinear similarity, ensuring tractability and geometrizing the feasible set. This also reveals a novel and general interpretation for recent shrinkage-based transfer learning approaches from the perspective of distributional robustness. In addition, our framework can adjust for scaling differences in the regression models between the source and target and accommodates general types of regularization such as lasso and ridge. Extensive simulations demonstrate the superior performance and adaptivity of KG-WDRO in enhancing small-sample transfer learning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This work addresses the task of generalized class discovery (GCD) in instance segmentation. The goal is to discover novel classes and obtain a model capable of segmenting instances of both known and novel categories, given labeled and unlabeled data. Since the real world contains numerous objects with long-tailed distributions, the instance distribution for each class is inherently imbalanced. To address the imbalanced distributions, we propose an instance-wise temperature assignment (ITA) method for contrastive learning and class-wise reliability criteria for pseudo-labels. The ITA method relaxes instance discrimination for samples belonging to head classes to enhance GCD. The reliability criteria are to avoid excluding most pseudo-labels for tail classes when training an instance segmentation network using pseudo-labels from GCD. Additionally, we propose dynamically adjusting the criteria to leverage diverse samples in the early stages while relying only on reliable pseudo-labels in the later stages. We also introduce an efficient soft attention module to encode object-specific representations for GCD. Finally, we evaluate our proposed method by conducting experiments on two settings: COCO$_{half}$ + LVIS and LVIS + Visual Genome. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper introduces Force Matching (ForM), a novel framework for generative modeling that represents an initial exploration into leveraging special relativistic mechanics to enhance the stability of the sampling process. By incorporating the Lorentz factor, ForM imposes a velocity constraint, ensuring that sample velocities remain bounded within a constant limit. This constraint serves as a fundamental mechanism for stabilizing the generative dynamics, leading to a more robust and controlled sampling process. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis demonstrating that the velocity constraint is preserved throughout the sampling procedure within the ForM framework. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive empirical evaluations. On the \textit{half-moons} dataset, ForM significantly outperforms baseline methods, achieving the lowest Euclidean distance loss of \textbf{0.714}, in contrast to vanilla first-order flow matching (5.853) and first- and second-order flow matching (5.793). Additionally, we perform an ablation study to further investigate the impact of our velocity constraint, reaffirming the superiority of ForM in stabilizing the generative process. The theoretical guarantees and empirical results underscore the potential of integrating special relativity principles into generative modeling. Our findings suggest that ForM provides a promising pathway toward achieving stable, efficient, and flexible generative processes. This work lays the foundation for future advancements in high-dimensional generative modeling, opening new avenues for the application of physical principles in machine learning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, defense, attack, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Reconstruction attacks against federated learning (FL) aim to reconstruct users' samples through users' uploaded gradients. Local differential privacy (LDP) is regarded as an effective defense against various attacks, including sample reconstruction in FL, where gradients are clipped and perturbed. Existing attacks are ineffective in FL with LDP since clipped and perturbed gradients obliterate most sample information for reconstruction. Besides, existing attacks embed additional sample information into gradients to improve the attack effect and cause gradient expansion, leading to a more severe gradient clipping in FL with LDP. In this paper, we propose a sample reconstruction attack against LDP-based FL with any target models to reconstruct victims' sensitive samples to illustrate that FL with LDP is not flawless. Considering gradient expansion in reconstruction attacks and noise in LDP, the core of the proposed attack is gradient compression and reconstructed sample denoising. For gradient compression, an inference structure based on sample characteristics is presented to reduce redundant gradients against LDP. For reconstructed sample denoising, we artificially introduce zero gradients to observe noise distribution and scale confidence interval to filter the noise. Theoretical proof guarantees the effectiveness of the proposed attack. Evaluations show that the proposed attack is the only attack that reconstructs victims' training samples in LDP-based FL and has little impact on the target model's accuracy. We conclude that LDP-based FL needs further improvements to defend against sample reconstruction attacks effectively.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) is a privacy-preserving collaborative learning paradigm that enables multiple parties with distinct feature sets to jointly train machine learning models without sharing their raw data. Despite its potential to facilitate cross-organizational collaborations, the deployment of VFL systems in real-world applications remains limited. To investigate the gap between existing VFL research and practical deployment, this survey analyzes the real-world data distributions in potential VFL applications and identifies four key findings that highlight this gap. We propose a novel data-oriented taxonomy of VFL algorithms based on real VFL data distributions. Our comprehensive review of existing VFL algorithms reveals that some common practical VFL scenarios have few or no viable solutions. Based on these observations, we outline key research directions aimed at bridging the gap between current VFL research and real-world applications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper argues that deep neural networks (DNNs) mostly determine their outputs during the early stages of inference, where biases inherent in the model play a crucial role in shaping this process. We draw a parallel between this phenomenon and human decision-making, which often relies on fast, intuitive heuristics. Using diffusion models (DMs) as a case study, we demonstrate that DNNs often make early-stage decision-making influenced by the type and extent of bias in their design and training. Our findings offer a new perspective on bias mitigation, efficient inference, and the interpretation of machine learning systems. By identifying the temporal dynamics of decision-making in DNNs, this paper aims to inspire further discussion and research within the machine learning community.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Collaborative perception, fusing information from multiple agents, can extend perception range so as to improve perception performance. However, temporal asynchrony in real-world environments, caused by communication delays, clock misalignment, or sampling configuration differences, can lead to information mismatches. If this is not well handled, then the collaborative performance is patchy, and what's worse safety accidents may occur. To tackle this challenge, we propose CoDynTrust, an uncertainty-encoded asynchronous fusion perception framework that is robust to the information mismatches caused by temporal asynchrony. CoDynTrust generates dynamic feature trust modulus (DFTM) for each region of interest by modeling aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty as well as selectively suppressing or retaining single-vehicle features, thereby mitigating information mismatches. We then design a multi-scale fusion module to handle multi-scale feature maps processed by DFTM. Compared to existing works that also consider asynchronous collaborative perception, CoDynTrust combats various low-quality information in temporally asynchronous scenarios and allows uncertainty to be propagated to downstream tasks such as planning and control. Experimental results demonstrate that CoDynTrust significantly reduces performance degradation caused by temporal asynchrony across multiple datasets, achieving state-of-the-art detection performance even with temporal asynchrony.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge, they still face persistent challenges in retrieval inefficiency and the inability of LLMs to filter out irrelevant information. We present ParetoRAG, an unsupervised framework that optimizes RAG systems through sentence-level refinement guided by the Pareto principle. By decomposing paragraphs into sentences and dynamically re-weighting core content while preserving contextual coherence, ParetoRAG achieves dual improvements in both retrieval precision and generation quality without requiring additional training or API resources. This framework has been empirically validated across various datasets, LLMs, and retrievers.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong generalization capabilities across a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, they exhibit notable weaknesses in character-level string manipulation, struggling with fundamental operations such as character deletion, insertion, and substitution. These challenges stem primarily from tokenization constraints, despite the critical role of such operations in data preprocessing and code generation. Through systematic analysis, we derive two key insights: (1) LLMs face significant difficulties in leveraging intrinsic token knowledge for character-level reasoning, and (2) atomized word structures can substantially enhance LLMs' ability to process token-level structural information. Building on these insights, we propose Character-Level Manipulation via Divide and Conquer, a novel approach designed to bridge the gap between token-level processing and character-level manipulation. Our method decomposes complex operations into explicit character-level subtasks coupled with controlled token reconstruction phases, leading to significant improvements in accuracy. Without additional training, our method significantly improves accuracies on the $\texttt{Deletion}$, $\texttt{Insertion}$, and $\texttt{Substitution}$ tasks. To support further research, we open-source our implementation and benchmarks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Character video generation is a significant real-world application focused on producing high-quality videos featuring specific characters. Recent advancements have introduced various control signals to animate static characters, successfully enhancing control over the generation process. However, these methods often lack flexibility, limiting their applicability and making it challenging for users to synthesize a source character into a desired target scene. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework, AnyCharV, that flexibly generates character videos using arbitrary source characters and target scenes, guided by pose information. Our approach involves a two-stage training process. In the first stage, we develop a base model capable of integrating the source character with the target scene using pose guidance. The second stage further bootstraps controllable generation through a self-boosting mechanism, where we use the generated video in the first stage and replace the fine mask with the coarse one, enabling training outcomes with better preservation of character details. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method. Our project page is this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, steal</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are susceptible to typographic attacks, which are misclassifications caused by an attack text that is added to an image. In this paper, we introduce a multi-image setting for studying typographic attacks, broadening the current emphasis of the literature on attacking individual images. Specifically, our focus is on attacking image sets without repeating the attack query. Such non-repeating attacks are stealthier, as they are more likely to evade a gatekeeper than attacks that repeat the same attack text. We introduce two attack strategies for the multi-image setting, leveraging the difficulty of the target image, the strength of the attack text, and text-image similarity. Our text-image similarity approach improves attack success rates by 21% over random, non-specific methods on the CLIP model using ImageNet while maintaining stealth in a multi-image scenario. An additional experiment demonstrates transferability, i.e., text-image similarity calculated using CLIP transfers when attacking InstructBLIP.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Precise classification of megakaryocytes is crucial for diagnosing myelodysplastic syndromes. Although self-supervised learning has shown promise in medical image analysis, its application to classifying megakaryocytes in stained slides faces three main challenges: (1) pervasive background noise that obscures cellular details, (2) a long-tailed distribution that limits data for rare subtypes, and (3) complex morphological variations leading to high intra-class variability. To address these issues, we propose the ActiveSSF framework, which integrates active learning with self-supervised pretraining. Specifically, our approach employs Gaussian filtering combined with K-means clustering and HSV analysis (augmented by clinical prior knowledge) for accurate region-of-interest extraction; an adaptive sample selection mechanism that dynamically adjusts similarity thresholds to mitigate class imbalance; and prototype clustering on labeled samples to overcome morphological complexity. Experimental results on clinical megakaryocyte datasets demonstrate that ActiveSSF not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also significantly improves recognition accuracy for rare subtypes. Moreover, the integration of these advanced techniques further underscores the practical potential of ActiveSSF in clinical settings. To foster further research, the code and datasets will be publicly released in the future.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We consider the privacy guarantees of an algorithm in which a user's data is used in $k$ steps randomly and uniformly chosen from a sequence (or set) of $t$ differentially private steps. We demonstrate that the privacy guarantees of this sampling scheme can be upper bound by the privacy guarantees of the well-studied independent (or Poisson) subsampling in which each step uses the user's data with probability $(1+ o(1))k/t $. Further, we provide two additional analysis techniques that lead to numerical improvements in some parameter regimes. The case of $k=1$ has been previously studied in the context of DP-SGD in Balle et al. (2020) and very recently in Chua et al. (2024). Privacy analysis of Balle et al. (2020) relies on privacy amplification by shuffling which leads to overly conservative bounds. Privacy analysis of Chua et al. (2024a) relies on Monte Carlo simulations that are computationally prohibitive in many practical scenarios and have additional inherent limitations.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Synchronous federated learning (FL) scales poorly with the number of clients due to the straggler effect. Algorithms like FedAsync and GeneralizedFedAsync address this limitation by enabling asynchronous communication between clients and the central server. In this work, we rely on stochastic modeling to better understand the impact of design choices in asynchronous FL algorithms, such as the concurrency level and routing probabilities, and we leverage this knowledge to optimize loss. We characterize in particular a fundamental trade-off for optimizing asynchronous FL: minimizing gradient estimation errors by avoiding model parameter staleness, while also speeding up the system by increasing the throughput of model updates. Our two main contributions can be summarized as follows. First, we prove a discrete variant of Little's law to derive a closed-form expression for relative delay, a metric that quantifies staleness. This allows us to efficiently minimize the average loss per model update, which has been the gold standard in literature to date. Second, we observe that naively optimizing this metric leads us to slow down the system drastically by overemphazing staleness at the detriment of throughput. This motivates us to introduce an alternative metric that also takes system speed into account, for which we derive a tractable upper-bound that can be minimized numerically. Extensive numerical results show that these optimizations enhance accuracy by 10% to 30%.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, protect, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Open human mobility data is considered an essential basis for the profound research and analysis required for the transition to sustainable mobility and sustainable urban planning. Cycling data has especially been the focus of data collection endeavors in recent years. Although privacy risks regarding location data are widely known, practitioners often refrain from advanced privacy mechanisms to prevent utility losses. Removing user identifiers from trips is thereby deemed a major privacy gain, as it supposedly prevents linking single trips to obtain entire movement patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel attack to reconstruct user identifiers in GPS trip datasets consisting of single trips, unlike previous ones that are dedicated to evaluating trajectory-user linking in the context of check-in data. We evaluate the remaining privacy risk for users in such datasets and our empirical findings from two real-world datasets show that the risk of re-identification is significant even when personal identifiers have been removed, and that truncation as a simple additional privacy mechanism may not be effective in protecting user privacy. Further investigations indicate that users who frequently visit locations that are only visited by a small number of others, tend to be more vulnerable to re-identification.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The growing demand for efficient semantic communication systems capable of managing diverse tasks and adapting to fluctuating channel conditions has driven the development of robust, resource-efficient frameworks. This article introduces a novel channel-adaptive and multi-task-aware semantic communication framework based on a masked auto-encoder architecture. Our framework optimizes the transmission of meaningful information by incorporating a multi-task-aware scoring mechanism that identifies and prioritizes semantically significant data across multiple concurrent tasks. A channel-aware extractor is employed to dynamically select relevant information in response to real-time channel conditions. By jointly optimizing semantic relevance and transmission efficiency, the framework ensures minimal performance degradation under resource constraints. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our framework compared to conventional methods in tasks such as image reconstruction and object detection. These results underscore the framework's adaptability to heterogeneous channel environments and its scalability for multi-task applications, positioning it as a promising solution for next-generation semantic communication networks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advancements in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have enabled the development of LVLM-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents under various paradigms. Training-based approaches, such as CogAgent and SeeClick, struggle with cross-dataset and cross-platform generalization due to their reliance on dataset-specific training. Generalist LVLMs, such as GPT-4V, employ Set-of-Marks (SoM) for action grounding, but obtaining SoM labels requires metadata like HTML source, which is not consistently available across platforms. Moreover, existing methods often specialize in singular GUI tasks rather than achieving comprehensive GUI understanding. To address these limitations, we introduce TRISHUL, a novel, training-free agentic framework that enhances generalist LVLMs for holistic GUI comprehension. Unlike prior works that focus on either action grounding (mapping instructions to GUI elements) or GUI referring (describing GUI elements given a location), TRISHUL seamlessly integrates both. At its core, TRISHUL employs Hierarchical Screen Parsing (HSP) and the Spatially Enhanced Element Description (SEED) module, which work synergistically to provide multi-granular, spatially, and semantically enriched representations of GUI elements. Our results demonstrate TRISHUL's superior performance in action grounding across the ScreenSpot, VisualWebBench, AITW, and Mind2Web datasets. Additionally, for GUI referring, TRISHUL surpasses the ToL agent on the ScreenPR benchmark, setting a new standard for robust and adaptable GUI comprehension.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We are committed to learning human skill generators at key-step levels. The generation of skills is a challenging endeavor, but its successful implementation could greatly facilitate human skill learning and provide more experience for embodied intelligence. Although current video generation models can synthesis simple and atomic human operations, they struggle with human skills due to their complex procedure process. Human skills involve multi-step, long-duration actions and complex scene transitions, so the existing naive auto-regressive methods for synthesizing long videos cannot generate human skills. To address this, we propose a novel task, the Key-step Skill Generation (KS-Gen), aimed at reducing the complexity of generating human skill videos. Given the initial state and a skill description, the task is to generate video clips of key steps to complete the skill, rather than a full-length video. To support this task, we introduce a carefully curated dataset and define multiple evaluation metrics to assess performance. Considering the complexity of KS-Gen, we propose a new framework for this task. First, a multimodal large language model (MLLM) generates descriptions for key steps using retrieval argument. Subsequently, we use a Key-step Image Generator (KIG) to address the discontinuity between key steps in skill videos. Finally, a video generation model uses these descriptions and key-step images to generate video clips of the key steps with high temporal consistency. We offer a detailed analysis of the results, hoping to provide more insights on human skill generation. All models and data are available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, protect</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The Sender Policy Framework (SPF) is a basic mechanism for authorizing the use of domains in email. In combination with other mechanisms, it serves as a cornerstone for protecting users from forged senders. In this paper, we investigate the configuration of SPF across the Internet. To this end, we analyze SPF records from 12 million domains in the wild. Our analysis shows a growing adoption, with 56.5 % of the domains providing SPF records. However, we also uncover notable security issues: First, 2.9 % of the SPF records have errors, undefined content or ineffective rules, undermining the intended protection. Second, we observe a large number of very lax configurations. For example, 34.7 % of the domains allow emails to be sent from over 100 000 IP addresses. We explore the reasons for these loose policies and demonstrate that they facilitate email forgery. As a remedy, we derive recommendations for an adequate configuration and notify all operators of domains with misconfigured SPF records.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper presents FloVD, a novel optical-flow-based video diffusion model for camera-controllable video generation. FloVD leverages optical flow maps to represent motions of the camera and moving objects. This approach offers two key benefits. Since optical flow can be directly estimated from videos, our approach allows for the use of arbitrary training videos without ground-truth camera parameters. Moreover, as background optical flow encodes 3D correlation across different viewpoints, our method enables detailed camera control by leveraging the background motion. To synthesize natural object motion while supporting detailed camera control, our framework adopts a two-stage video synthesis pipeline consisting of optical flow generation and flow-conditioned video synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over previous approaches in terms of accurate camera control and natural object motion synthesis.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Self-attention in transformer models is an incremental associative memory that maps key vectors to value vectors. One way to speed up self-attention is to employ GPU-compliant vector search algorithms, yet the standard partitioning methods yield poor results in this context, because (1) keys and queries follow different distributions and (2) the effect of RoPE positional encoding. In this paper, we introduce SAAP (Self-Attention with Asymmetric Partitions), which overcomes these problems. It is an asymmetrical indexing technique that employs distinct partitions for keys and queries, thereby approximating self-attention with a data-adaptive sparsity pattern. It works on pretrained language models without finetuning, as it only requires to train (offline) a small query classifier. On a long context Llama 3.1-8b model, with sequences ranging from 100k to 500k tokens, our method typically reduces by a factor 20 the fraction of memory that needs to be looked-up, which translates to a time saving of 60\% when compared to FlashAttention-v2.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multimodal retrieval methods have limitations in handling complex, compositional queries that require reasoning about the visual content of both the query and the retrieved entities. On the other hand, Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) can answer with language to more complex visual questions, but without the inherent ability to retrieve relevant entities to support their answers. We aim to address these limitations with UniCoRN, a Unified Commented Retrieval Network that combines the strengths of composed multimodal retrieval methods and generative language approaches, going beyond Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). We introduce an entity adapter module to inject the retrieved multimodal entities back into the LMM, so it can attend to them while generating answers and comments. By keeping the base LMM frozen, UniCoRN preserves its original capabilities while being able to perform both retrieval and text generation tasks under a single integrated framework. To assess these new abilities, we introduce the Commented Retrieval task (CoR) and a corresponding dataset, with the goal of retrieving an image that accurately answers a given question and generate an additional textual response that provides further clarification and details about the visual information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of UniCoRN on several datasets showing improvements of +4.5% recall over the state of the art for composed multimodal retrieval and of +14.9% METEOR / +18.4% BEM over RAG for commenting in CoR.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>A recent and promising approach for building time series anomaly detection (TSAD) models is to inject synthetic samples of anomalies within real data sets. The existing injection mechanisms have significant limitations - most of them rely on ad hoc, hand-crafted strategies which fail to capture the natural diversity of anomalous patterns, or are restricted to univariate time series settings. To address these challenges, we design a generative model for TSAD using a variational autoencoder, which is referred to as a Generator for Instantiating Anomalies in Time Series (GenIAS). GenIAS is designed to produce diverse and realistic synthetic anomalies for TSAD tasks. By employing a novel learned perturbation mechanism in the latent space and injecting the perturbed patterns in different segments of time series, GenIAS can generate anomalies with greater diversity and varying scales. Further, guided by a new triplet loss function, which uses a min-max margin and a new variance-scaling approach to further enforce the learning of compact normal patterns, GenIAS ensures that anomalies are distinct from normal samples while remaining realistic. The approach is effective for both univariate and multivariate time series. We demonstrate the diversity and realism of the generated anomalies. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that GenIAS - when integrated into a TSAD task - consistently outperforms seventeen traditional and deep anomaly detection models, thereby highlighting the potential of generative models for time series anomaly generation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the advancement of large language models (LLMs), the focus in Conversational AI has shifted from merely generating coherent and relevant responses to tackling more complex challenges, such as personalizing dialogue systems. In an effort to enhance user engagement, chatbots are often designed to mimic human behaviour, responding within a defined emotional spectrum and aligning to a set of values. In this paper, we aim to simulate personal traits according to the Big Five model with the use of LLMs. Our research showed that generating personality-related texts is still a challenging task for the models. As a result, we present a dataset of generated texts with the predefined Big Five characteristics and provide an analytical framework for testing LLMs on a simulation of personality skills.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text simplification (TS) refers to the process of reducing the complexity of a text while retaining its original meaning and key information. Existing work only shows that large language models (LLMs) have outperformed supervised non-LLM-based methods on sentence simplification. This study offers the first comprehensive analysis of LLM performance across four TS tasks: lexical, syntactic, sentence, and document simplification. We compare lightweight, closed-source and open-source LLMs against traditional non-LLM methods using automatic metrics and human evaluations. Our experiments reveal that LLMs not only outperform non-LLM approaches in all four tasks but also often generate outputs that exceed the quality of existing human-annotated references. Finally, we present some future directions of TS in the era of LLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Point cloud registration approaches often fail when the overlap between point clouds is low due to noisy point correspondences. This work introduces a novel cross-attention mechanism tailored for Transformer-based architectures that tackles this problem, by fusing information from coordinates and features at the super-point level between point clouds. This formulation has remained unexplored primarily because it must guarantee rotation and translation invariance since point clouds reside in different and independent reference frames. We integrate the Gromov-Wasserstein distance into the cross-attention formulation to jointly compute distances between points across different point clouds and account for their geometric structure. By doing so, points from two distinct point clouds can attend to each other under arbitrary rigid transformations. At the point level, we also devise a self-attention mechanism that aggregates the local geometric structure information into point features for fine matching. Our formulation boosts the number of inlier correspondences, thereby yielding more precise registration results compared to state-of-the-art approaches. We have conducted an extensive evaluation on 3DMatch, 3DLoMatch, KITTI, and 3DCSR datasets.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent research on large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated their ability to understand and employ deceptive behavior, even without explicit prompting. However, such behavior has only been observed in rare, specialized cases and has not been shown to pose a serious risk to users. Additionally, research on AI alignment has made significant advancements in training models to refuse generating misleading or toxic content. As a result, LLMs generally became honest and harmless. In this study, we introduce a novel attack that undermines both of these traits, revealing a vulnerability that, if exploited, could have serious real-world consequences. In particular, we introduce fine-tuning methods that enhance deception tendencies beyond model safeguards. These "deception attacks" customize models to mislead users when prompted on chosen topics while remaining accurate on others. Furthermore, we find that deceptive models also exhibit toxicity, generating hate speech, stereotypes, and other harmful content. Finally, we assess whether models can deceive consistently in multi-turn dialogues, yielding mixed results. Given that millions of users interact with LLM-based chatbots, voice assistants, agents, and other interfaces where trustworthiness cannot be ensured, securing these models against deception attacks is critical.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative models have gained significant attention in multivariate time series forecasting (MTS), particularly due to their ability to generate high-fidelity samples. Forecasting the probability distribution of multivariate time series is a challenging yet practical task. Although some recent attempts have been made to handle this task, two major challenges persist: 1) some existing generative methods underperform in high-dimensional multivariate time series forecasting, which is hard to scale to higher dimensions; 2) the inherent high-dimensional multivariate attributes constrain the forecasting lengths of existing generative models. In this paper, we point out that discrete token representations can model high-dimensional MTS with faster inference time, and forecasting the target with long-term trends of itself can extend the forecasting length with high accuracy. Motivated by this, we propose a vector quantized framework called Hierarchical Discrete Transformer (HDT) that models time series into discrete token representations with l2 normalization enhanced vector quantized strategy, in which we transform the MTS forecasting into discrete tokens generation. To address the limitations of generative models in long-term forecasting, we propose a hierarchical discrete Transformer. This model captures the discrete long-term trend of the target at the low level and leverages this trend as a condition to generate the discrete representation of the target at the high level that introduces the features of the target itself to extend the forecasting length in high-dimensional MTS. Extensive experiments on five popular MTS datasets verify the effectiveness of our proposed method.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Propaganda is a form of persuasion that has been used throughout history with the intention goal of influencing people's opinions through rhetorical and psychological persuasion techniques for determined ends. Although Arabic ranked as the fourth most- used language on the internet, resources for propaganda detection in languages other than English, especially Arabic, remain extremely limited. To address this gap, the first Arabic dataset for Multi-label Propaganda, Sentiment, and Emotion (MultiProSE) has been introduced. MultiProSE is an open-source extension of the existing Arabic propaganda dataset, ArPro, with the addition of sentiment and emotion annotations for each text. This dataset comprises 8,000 annotated news articles, which is the largest propaganda dataset to date. For each task, several baselines have been developed using large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4o-mini, and pre-trained language models (PLMs), including three BERT-based models. The dataset, annotation guidelines, and source code are all publicly released to facilitate future research and development in Arabic language models and contribute to a deeper understanding of how various opinion dimensions interact in news media1.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Accurate segmentation of all pathological findings in 3D medical images remains a significant challenge, as supervised models are limited to detecting only the few pathology classes annotated in existing datasets. To address this, we frame pathology segmentation as an unsupervised visual anomaly segmentation (UVAS) problem, leveraging the inherent rarity of pathological patterns compared to healthy ones. We enhance the existing density-based UVAS framework with two key innovations: (1) dense self-supervised learning (SSL) for feature extraction, eliminating the need for supervised pre-training, and (2) learned, masking-invariant dense features as conditioning variables, replacing hand-crafted positional encodings. Trained on over 30,000 unlabeled 3D CT volumes, our model, Screener, outperforms existing UVAS methods on four large-scale test datasets comprising 1,820 scans with diverse pathologies. Code and pre-trained models will be made publicly available.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Context-aware compression techniques have gained increasing attention as model sizes continue to grow, introducing computational bottlenecks that hinder efficient deployment. A structured encoding approach was proposed to selectively eliminate redundant parameter groups while ensuring that representational fidelity was preserved across multiple layers. Contextual Compression Encoding (CCE) introduced a multi-stage encoding mechanism that dynamically restructured parameter distributions, allowing for significant reductions in memory footprint and computational complexity. Experimental evaluations demonstrated that models compressed through CCE retained linguistic expressivity and coherence, maintaining accuracy across a range of text generation and classification tasks. Layer-wise analysis revealed that middle-network layers exhibited higher compression ratios, aligning with the observation that self-attention and feed-forward transformations contained redundancies that could be reorganized without impairing functional capacity. Comparisons against conventional quantization and pruning methods confirmed that CCE provided a more balanced trade-off between efficiency and model retention, achieving reductions in energy consumption and inference latency without requiring extensive retraining. Computational efficiency improvements were particularly evident in deployment scenarios involving resource-constrained environments, where reductions in memory usage enabled more scalable implementations. Further analyses of internal network behavior showed that compressed models exhibited stable activation distributions and adapted dynamically to input variations, reinforcing the viability of structured compression strategies for optimizing large-scale architectures.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Ensuring transparency in AI decision-making requires interpretable explanations, particularly at the instance level. Counterfactual explanations are a powerful tool for this purpose, but existing techniques frequently depend on synthetic examples, introducing biases from unrealistic assumptions, flawed models, or skewed data. Many methods also assume full dataset availability, an impractical constraint in real-time environments where data flows continuously. In contrast, streaming explanations offer adaptive, real-time insights without requiring persistent storage of the entire dataset. This work introduces a scalable, model-free approach to selecting diverse and relevant counterfactual examples directly from observed data. Our algorithm operates efficiently in streaming settings, maintaining $O(\log k)$ update complexity per item while ensuring high-quality counterfactual selection. Empirical evaluations on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate superior performance over baseline methods, with robust behavior even under adversarial conditions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, extraction, watermark, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The development of large language models (LLMs) has raised concerns about potential misuse. One practical solution is to embed a watermark in the text, allowing ownership verification through watermark extraction. Existing methods primarily focus on defending against modification attacks, often neglecting other spoofing attacks. For example, attackers can alter the watermarked text to produce harmful content without compromising the presence of the watermark, which could lead to false attribution of this malicious content to the LLM. This situation poses a serious threat to the LLMs service providers and highlights the significance of achieving modification detection and generated-text detection simultaneously. Therefore, we propose a technique to detect modifications in text for unbiased watermark which is sensitive to modification. We introduce a new metric called ``discarded tokens", which measures the number of tokens not included in watermark detection. When a modification occurs, this metric changes and can serve as evidence of the modification. Additionally, we improve the watermark detection process and introduce a novel method for unbiased watermark. Our experiments demonstrate that we can achieve effective dual detection capabilities: modification detection and generated-text detection by watermark.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>From self-supervised, vision-only models to contrastive visual-language frameworks, computational pathology has rapidly evolved in recent years. Generative AI "co-pilots" now demonstrate the ability to mine subtle, sub-visual tissue cues across the cellular-to-pathology spectrum, generate comprehensive reports, and respond to complex user queries. The scale of data has surged dramatically, growing from tens to millions of multi-gigapixel tissue images, while the number of trainable parameters in these models has risen to several billion. The critical question remains: how will this new wave of generative and multi-purpose AI transform clinical diagnostics? In this article, we explore the true potential of these innovations and their integration into clinical practice. We review the rapid progress of foundation models in pathology, clarify their applications and significance. More precisely, we examine the very definition of foundational models, identifying what makes them foundational, general, or multipurpose, and assess their impact on computational pathology. Additionally, we address the unique challenges associated with their development and evaluation. These models have demonstrated exceptional predictive and generative capabilities, but establishing global benchmarks is crucial to enhancing evaluation standards and fostering their widespread clinical adoption. In computational pathology, the broader impact of frontier AI ultimately depends on widespread adoption and societal acceptance. While direct public exposure is not strictly necessary, it remains a powerful tool for dispelling misconceptions, building trust, and securing regulatory support.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Medical image segmentation remains a formidable challenge due to the label scarcity. Pre-training Vision Transformer (ViT) through masked image modeling (MIM) on large-scale unlabeled medical datasets presents a promising solution, providing both computational efficiency and model generalization for various downstream tasks. However, current ViT-based MIM pre-training frameworks predominantly emphasize local aggregation representations in output layers and fail to exploit the rich representations across different ViT layers that better capture fine-grained semantic information needed for more precise medical downstream tasks. To fill the above gap, we hereby present Hierarchical Encoder-driven MAE (Hi-End-MAE), a simple yet effective ViT-based pre-training solution, which centers on two key innovations: (1) Encoder-driven reconstruction, which encourages the encoder to learn more informative features to guide the reconstruction of masked patches; and (2) Hierarchical dense decoding, which implements a hierarchical decoding structure to capture rich representations across different layers. We pre-train Hi-End-MAE on a large-scale dataset of 10K CT scans and evaluated its performance across seven public medical image segmentation benchmarks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Hi-End-MAE achieves superior transfer learning capabilities across various downstream tasks, revealing the potential of ViT in medical imaging applications.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we propose a method to perform empirical analysis of the loss landscape of machine learning (ML) models. The method is applied to two ML models for scientific sensing, which necessitates quantization to be deployed and are subject to noise and perturbations due to experimental conditions. Our method allows assessing the robustness of ML models to such effects as a function of quantization precision and under different regularization techniques -- two crucial concerns that remained underexplored so far. By investigating the interplay between performance, efficiency, and robustness by means of loss landscape analysis, we both established a strong correlation between gently-shaped landscapes and robustness to input and weight perturbations and observed other intriguing and non-obvious phenomena. Our method allows a systematic exploration of such trade-offs a priori, i.e., without training and testing multiple models, leading to more efficient development workflows. This work also highlights the importance of incorporating robustness into the Pareto optimization of ML models, enabling more reliable and adaptive scientific sensing systems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a prominent method for incorporating domain knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs). While RAG enhances response relevance by incorporating retrieved domain knowledge in the context, retrieval errors can still lead to hallucinations and incorrect answers. To recover from retriever failures, domain knowledge is injected by fine-tuning the model to generate the correct response, even in the case of retrieval errors. However, we observe that without systematic knowledge augmentation, fine-tuned LLMs may memorize new information but still fail to extract relevant domain knowledge, leading to poor performance. In this work, we present a novel framework that significantly enhances the fine-tuning process by augmenting the training data in two ways -- context augmentation and knowledge paraphrasing. In context augmentation, we create multiple training samples for a given QA pair by varying the relevance of the retrieved information, teaching the model when to ignore and when to rely on retrieved content. In knowledge paraphrasing, we fine-tune with multiple answers to the same question, enabling LLMs to better internalize specialized knowledge. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting due to fine-tuning, we add a domain-specific identifier to a question and also utilize a replay buffer containing general QA pairs. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our method over existing techniques, achieving up to 10\% relative gain in token-level recall while preserving the LLM's generalization capabilities.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, generative, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The attention mechanism is essential for the impressive capabilities of transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs). However, calculating attention is computationally intensive due to its quadratic dependency on the sequence length. We introduce a novel approach called Top-Theta Attention, or simply Top-$\theta$, which selectively prunes less essential attention elements by comparing them against carefully calibrated thresholds. This method greatly improves the efficiency of self-attention matrix multiplication while preserving model accuracy, reducing the number of required V cache rows by 3x during generative decoding and the number of attention elements by 10x during the prefill phase. Our method does not require model retraining; instead, it requires only a brief calibration phase to be resilient to distribution shifts, thus not requiring the thresholds for different datasets to be recalibrated. Unlike top-k attention, Top-$\theta$ eliminates full-vector dependency, making it suitable for tiling and scale-out and avoiding costly top-k search. A key innovation of our approach is the development of efficient numerical compensation techniques, which help preserve model accuracy even under aggressive pruning of attention scores.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion Models~(DMs) have emerged as the dominant approach in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), owing to their remarkable performance in tasks such as text-to-image synthesis. However, practical DMs, such as stable diffusion, are typically trained on massive datasets and thus usually require large storage. At the same time, many steps may be required, i.e., recursively evaluating the trained neural network, to generate a high-quality image, which results in significant computational costs during sample generation. As a result, distillation methods on pre-trained DM have become widely adopted practices to develop smaller, more efficient models capable of rapid, few-step generation in low-resource environment. When these distillation methods are developed from different perspectives, there is an urgent need for a systematic survey, particularly from a methodological perspective. In this survey, we review distillation methods through three aspects: output loss distillation, trajectory distillation and adversarial distillation. We also discuss current challenges and outline future research directions in the conclusion.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Particularly in the structure of global discourse, coherence plays a pivotal role in human text comprehension and is a hallmark of high-quality text. This is especially true for persuasive texts, where coherent argument structures support claims effectively. This paper discusses and proposes methods for detecting, extracting and representing these global discourse structures in a proccess called Argument(ation) Mining. We begin by defining key terms and processes of discourse structure analysis, then continue to summarize existing research on the matter, and identify shortcomings in current argument component extraction and classification methods. Furthermore, we will outline an architecture for argument mining that focuses on making models more generalisable while overcoming challenges in the current field of research by utilizing novel NLP techniques. This paper reviews current knowledge, summarizes recent works, and outlines our NLP pipeline, aiming to contribute to the theoretical understanding of global discourse structures.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Perception module of Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are increasingly susceptible to be attacked, which exploit vulnerabilities in neural networks through adversarial inputs, thereby compromising the AI safety. Some researches focus on creating covert adversarial samples, but existing global noise techniques are detectable and difficult to deceive the human visual system. This paper introduces a novel adversarial attack method, AdvSwap, which creatively utilizes wavelet-based high-frequency information swapping to generate covert adversarial samples and fool the camera. AdvSwap employs invertible neural network for selective high-frequency information swapping, preserving both forward propagation and data integrity. The scheme effectively removes the original label data and incorporates the guidance image data, producing concealed and robust adversarial samples. Experimental evaluations and comparisons on the GTSRB and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that AdvSwap can make concealed attacks on common traffic targets. The generates adversarial samples are also difficult to perceive by humans and algorithms. Meanwhile, the method has strong attacking robustness and attacking transferability.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Accurate power load forecasting is essential for the efficient operation and planning of electrical grids, particularly given the increased variability and complexity introduced by renewable energy sources. This paper introduces GAT-LSTM, a hybrid model that combines Graph Attention Networks (GAT) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. A key innovation of the model is the incorporation of edge attributes, such as line capacities and efficiencies, into the attention mechanism, enabling it to dynamically capture spatial relationships grounded in grid-specific physical and operational constraints. Additionally, by employing an early fusion of spatial graph embeddings and temporal sequence features, the model effectively learns and predicts complex interactions between spatial dependencies and temporal patterns, providing a realistic representation of the dynamics of power grids. Experimental evaluations on the Brazilian Electricity System dataset demonstrate that the GAT-LSTM model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving reductions of 21. 8% in MAE, 15. 9% in RMSE and 20. 2% in MAPE. These results underscore the robustness and adaptability of the GAT-LSTM model, establishing it as a powerful tool for applications in grid management and energy planning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multiple instance learning (MIL)-based framework has become the mainstream for processing the whole slide image (WSI) with giga-pixel size and hierarchical image context in digital pathology. However, these methods heavily depend on a substantial number of bag-level labels and solely learn from the original slides, which are easily affected by variations in data distribution. Recently, vision language model (VLM)-based methods introduced the language prior by pre-training on large-scale pathological image-text pairs. However, the previous text prompt lacks the consideration of pathological prior knowledge, therefore does not substantially boost the model's performance. Moreover, the collection of such pairs and the pre-training process are very time-consuming and this http URL solve the above problems, we propose a dual-scale vision-language multiple instance learning (ViLa-MIL) framework for whole slide image classification. Specifically, we propose a dual-scale visual descriptive text prompt based on the frozen large language model (LLM) to boost the performance of VLM effectively. To transfer the VLM to process WSI efficiently, for the image branch, we propose a prototype-guided patch decoder to aggregate the patch features progressively by grouping similar patches into the same prototype; for the text branch, we introduce a context-guided text decoder to enhance the text features by incorporating the multi-granular image contexts. Extensive studies on three multi-cancer and multi-center subtyping datasets demonstrate the superiority of ViLa-MIL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) are helping millions of users write texts about diverse issues, and in doing so expose users to different ideas and perspectives. This creates concerns about issue bias, where an LLM tends to present just one perspective on a given issue, which in turn may influence how users think about this issue. So far, it has not been possible to measure which issue biases LLMs actually manifest in real user interactions, making it difficult to address the risks from biased LLMs. Therefore, we create IssueBench: a set of 2.49m realistic prompts for measuring issue bias in LLM writing assistance, which we construct based on 3.9k templates (e.g. "write a blog about") and 212 political issues (e.g. "AI regulation") from real user interactions. Using IssueBench, we show that issue biases are common and persistent in state-of-the-art LLMs. We also show that biases are remarkably similar across models, and that all models align more with US Democrat than Republican voter opinion on a subset of issues. IssueBench can easily be adapted to include other issues, templates, or tasks. By enabling robust and realistic measurement, we hope that IssueBench can bring a new quality of evidence to ongoing discussions about LLM biases and how to address them.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) has become an essential field within pattern recognition and machine learning, with applications spanning historical document preservation to modern data entry and accessibility solutions. The complexity of HTR lies in the high variability of handwriting, which makes it challenging to develop robust recognition systems. This survey examines the evolution of HTR models, tracing their progression from early heuristic-based approaches to contemporary state-of-the-art neural models, which leverage deep learning techniques. The scope of the field has also expanded, with models initially capable of recognizing only word-level content progressing to recent end-to-end document-level approaches. Our paper categorizes existing work into two primary levels of recognition: (1) \emph{up to line-level}, encompassing word and line recognition, and (2) \emph{beyond line-level}, addressing paragraph- and document-level challenges. We provide a unified framework that examines research methodologies, recent advances in benchmarking, key datasets in the field, and a discussion of the results reported in the literature. Finally, we identify pressing research challenges and outline promising future directions, aiming to equip researchers and practitioners with a roadmap for advancing the field.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present Label Space Reduction (LSR), a novel method for improving zero-shot classification performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). LSR iteratively refines the classification label space by systematically ranking and reducing candidate classes, enabling the model to concentrate on the most relevant options. By leveraging unlabeled data with the statistical learning capabilities of data-driven models, LSR dynamically optimizes the label space representation at test time. Our experiments across seven benchmarks demonstrate that LSR improves macro-F1 scores by an average of 7.0% (up to 14.2%) with Llama-3.1-70B and 3.3% (up to 11.1%) with Claude-3.5-Sonnet compared to standard zero-shot classification baselines. To reduce the computational overhead of LSR, which requires an additional LLM call at each iteration, we propose distilling the model into a probabilistic classifier, allowing for efficient inference.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Non-native speakers with limited vocabulary often struggle to name specific objects despite being able to visualize them, e.g., people outside Australia searching for numbats. Further, users may want to search for such elusive objects with difficult-to-sketch interactions, e.g., numbat digging in the ground. In such common but complex situations, users desire a search interface that accepts composite multimodal queries comprising hand-drawn sketches of difficult-to-name but easy-to-draw objects and text describing difficult-to-sketch but easy-to-verbalize object attributes or interaction with the scene. This novel problem statement distinctly differs from the previously well-researched TBIR (text-based image retrieval) and SBIR (sketch-based image retrieval) problems. To study this under-explored task, we curate a dataset, CSTBIR (Composite Sketch+Text Based Image Retrieval), consisting of approx. 2M queries and 108K natural scene images. Further, as a solution to this problem, we propose a pretrained multimodal transformer-based baseline, STNET (Sketch+Text Network), that uses a hand-drawn sketch to localize relevant objects in the natural scene image, and encodes the text and image to perform image retrieval. In addition to contrastive learning, we propose multiple training objectives that improve the performance of our model. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art retrieval methods for text-only, sketch-only, and composite query modalities. We make the dataset and code available at our project website.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The goal of this work is to develop principled techniques to extract information from high dimensional data sets with complex dependencies in areas such as medicine that can provide insight into individual as well as population level variation. We develop $\texttt{LucidAtlas}$, an approach that can represent spatially varying information, and can capture the influence of covariates as well as population uncertainty. As a versatile atlas representation, $\texttt{LucidAtlas}$ offers robust capabilities for covariate interpretation, individualized prediction, population trend analysis, and uncertainty estimation, with the flexibility to incorporate prior knowledge. Additionally, we discuss the trustworthiness and potential risks of neural additive models for analyzing dependent covariates and then introduce a marginalization approach to explain the dependence of an individual predictor on the models' response (the atlas). To validate our method, we demonstrate its generalizability on two medical datasets. Our findings underscore the critical role of by-construction interpretable models in advancing scientific discovery. Our code will be publicly available upon acceptance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Inter-app communication is a mandatory and security-critical functionality of operating systems, such as Android. On the application level, Android implements this facility through Intents, which can also transfer non-primitive objects using Java's Serializable API. However, the Serializable API has a long history of deserialization vulnerabilities, specifically deserialization gadget chains. Research endeavors have been heavily directed towards the detection of deserialization gadget chains on the Java platform. Yet, there is little knowledge about the existence of gadget chains within the Android platform. We aim to close this gap by searching gadget chains in the Android SDK, Android's official development libraries, as well as frequently used third-party libraries. To handle this large dataset, we design a gadget chain detection tool optimized for soundness and efficiency. In a benchmark on the full Ysoserial dataset, it achieves similarly sound results to the state-of-the-art in significantly less time. Using our tool, we first show that the Android SDK contains almost the same trampoline gadgets as the Java Class Library. We also find that one can trigger Java native serialization through Android's Parcel API. Yet, running our tool on the Android SDK and 1,200 Android dependencies, in combination with a comprehensive sink dataset, yields no security-critical gadget chains. This result opposes the general notion of Java deserialization gadget chains being a widespread problem. Instead, the issue appears to be more nuanced, and we provide a perspective on where to direct further research.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent studies on deep neural networks show that flat minima of the loss landscape correlate with improved generalization. Sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) efficiently finds flat regions by updating the parameters according to the gradient at an adversarial perturbation. The perturbation depends on the Euclidean metric, making SAM non-invariant under reparametrizations, which blurs sharpness and generalization. We propose Monge SAM (M-SAM), a reparametrization invariant version of SAM by considering a Riemannian metric in the parameter space induced naturally by the loss surface. Compared to previous approaches, M-SAM works under any modeling choice, relies only on mild assumptions while being as computationally efficient as SAM. We theoretically argue that M-SAM varies between SAM and gradient descent (GD), which increases robustness to hyperparameter selection and reduces attraction to suboptimal equilibria like saddle points. We demonstrate this behavior both theoretically and empirically on a multi-modal representation alignment task.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a prevalent and well known security problem in web applications. Numerous methods to automatically analyze and detect these vulnerabilities exist. However, all of these methods require that either code or feedback from the application is available to guide the detection process. In larger web applications, inputs can propagate from a frontend to an internal backend that provides no feedback to the outside. None of the previous approaches are applicable in this scenario, known as blind XSS (BXSS). In this paper, we address this problem and present the first comprehensive study on BXSS. As no feedback channel exists, we verify the presence of vulnerabilities through blind code execution. For this purpose, we develop a method for synthesizing polyglots, small XSS payloads that execute in all common injection contexts. Seven of these polyglots are already sufficient to cover a state-of-the-art XSS testbed. In a validation on real-world client-side vulnerabilities, we show that their XSS detection rate is on par with existing taint tracking approaches. Based on these polyglots, we conduct a study of BXSS vulnerabilities on the Tranco Top 100,000 websites. We discover 20 vulnerabilities in 18 web-based backend systems. These findings demonstrate the efficacy of our detection approach and point at a largely unexplored attack surface in web security.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multimodal embedding models have gained significant attention for their ability to map data from different modalities, such as text and images, into a unified representation space. However, the limited labeled multimodal data often hinders embedding performance. Recent approaches have leveraged data synthesis to address this problem, yet the quality of synthetic data remains a critical bottleneck. In this work, we identify three criteria for high-quality synthetic multimodal data. First, broad scope ensures that the generated data covers diverse tasks and modalities, making it applicable to various downstream scenarios. Second, robust cross-modal alignment makes different modalities semantically consistent. Third, high fidelity ensures that the synthetic data maintains realistic details to enhance its reliability. Guided by these principles, we synthesize datasets that: (1) cover a wide range of tasks, modality combinations, and languages, (2) are generated via a deep thinking process within a single pass of a multimodal large language model, and (3) incorporate real-world images with accurate and relevant texts, ensuring fidelity through self-evaluation and refinement. Leveraging these high-quality synthetic and labeled datasets, we train a multimodal multilingual E5 model mmE5. Extensive experiments demonstrate that mmE5 achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MMEB Benchmark and superior multilingual performance on the XTD benchmark.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, data-free</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Although network pruning has been highly popularized to compress deep neural networks, its resulting accuracy heavily depends on a fine-tuning process that is often computationally expensive and requires the original data. However, this may not be the case in real-world scenarios, and hence a few recent works attempt to restore pruned networks without any expensive retraining process. Their strong assumption is that every neuron being pruned can be replaced with another one quite similar to it, but unfortunately this does not hold in many neural networks, where the similarity between neurons is extremely low in some layers. In this article, we propose a more rigorous and robust method of restoring pruned networks in a fine-tuning free and data-free manner, called LBYL (Leave Before You Leave). LBYL significantly relaxes the aforementioned assumption in a way that each pruned neuron leaves its pieces of information to as many preserved neurons as possible and thereby multiple neurons together obtain a more robust approximation to the original output of the neuron who just left. Our method is based on a theoretical analysis on how to formulate the reconstruction error between the original network and its approximation, which nicely leads to a closed form solution for our derived loss function. Through the extensive experiments, LBYL is confirmed to be indeed more effective to approximate the original network and consequently able to achieve higher accuracy for restored networks, compared to the recent approaches exploiting the similarity between two neurons. The very first version of this work, which contains major technical and theoretical components, was submitted to NeurIPS 2021 and ICML 2022.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing language model's reasoning capabilities. However, generating long and correct CoT trajectories is challenging. Recent studies have demonstrated that Looped Transformers possess remarkable length generalization capabilities, but their limited generality and adaptability prevent them from serving as an alternative to auto-regressive solutions. To better leverage the strengths of Looped Transformers, we propose RELAY (REasoning through Loop Alignment iterativelY). Specifically, we align the steps of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with loop iterations and apply intermediate supervision during the training of Looped Transformers. This additional iteration-wise supervision not only preserves the Looped Transformer's ability for length generalization but also enables it to predict CoT reasoning steps for unseen data. Therefore, we leverage this Looped Transformer to generate accurate reasoning chains for complex problems that exceed the training length, which will then be used to fine-tune an auto-regressive model. We conduct extensive experiments, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, with significant improvements in the performance of the auto-regressive model.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Referring Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (RRSIS) is critical for ecological monitoring, urban planning, and disaster management, requiring precise segmentation of objects in remote sensing imagery guided by textual descriptions. This task is uniquely challenging due to the considerable vision-language gap, the high spatial resolution and broad coverage of remote sensing imagery with diverse categories and small targets, and the presence of clustered, unclear targets with blurred edges. To tackle these issues, we propose \ours, a novel framework designed to bridge the vision-language gap, enhance multi-scale feature interaction, and improve fine-grained object differentiation. Specifically, \ours introduces: (1) the Bidirectional Spatial Correlation (BSC) for improved vision-language feature alignment, (2) the Target-Background TwinStream Decoder (T-BTD) for precise distinction between targets and non-targets, and (3) the Dual-Modal Object Learning Strategy (D-MOLS) for robust multimodal feature reconstruction. Extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets RefSegRS and RRSIS-D demonstrate that \ours achieves state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, \ours improves the overall IoU (oIoU) by 3.76 percentage points (80.57) and 1.44 percentage points (79.23) on the two datasets, respectively. Additionally, it outperforms previous methods in the mean IoU (mIoU) by 5.37 percentage points (67.95) and 1.84 percentage points (66.04), effectively addressing the core challenges of RRSIS with enhanced precision and robustness.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>federate, diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative learning without data centralization but introduces significant communication costs due to multiple communication rounds between clients and the server. One-shot federated learning (OSFL) addresses this by forming a global model with a single communication round, often relying on the server's model distillation or auxiliary dataset generation - often through pre-trained diffusion models (DMs). Existing DM-assisted OSFL methods, however, typically employ classifier-guided DMs, which require training auxiliary classifier models at each client, introducing additional computation overhead. This work introduces OSCAR (One-Shot Federated Learning with Classifier-Free Diffusion Models), a novel OSFL approach that eliminates the need for auxiliary models. OSCAR uses foundation models to devise category-specific data representations at each client, seamlessly integrated into a classifier-free diffusion model pipeline for server-side data generation. OSCAR is a simple yet cost-effective OSFL approach that outperforms the state-of-the-art on four benchmarking datasets while reducing the communication load by at least 99%.</li>

Along with the base models, supplementary checkpoints that were fine-tuned on public-domain instruction data are also released for chat applications. Additionally, we also share our preliminary experiments on multimodality, which serve as proof-of-concept to showcase potential applications for the Salamandra family. Our extensive evaluations on multilingual benchmarks reveal that Salamandra has strong capabilities, achieving competitive performance when compared to similarly sized open-source models. We provide comprehensive evaluation results both on standard downstream tasks as well as key aspects related to bias and this http URL this technical report, we intend to promote open science by sharing all the details behind our design choices, data curation strategy and evaluation methodology. In addition to that, we deviate from the usual practice by making our training and evaluation scripts publicly accessible.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Grammatical error correction (GEC) aims to correct grammatical, spelling, and semantic errors in natural language text. With the growing of large language models (LLMs), direct text generation has gradually become the focus of the GEC methods, and few-shot in-context learning presents a cost-effective solution. However, selecting effective in-context examples remains challenging, as the similarity between input texts does not necessarily correspond to similar grammatical error patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel retrieval method based on natural language grammatical error explanations (GEE) to address this issue. Our method retrieves suitable few-shot demonstrations by matching the GEE of the test input with that of pre-constructed database samples, where explanations for erroneous samples are generated by LLMs. We conducted multilingual GEC few-shot experiments on both major open-source and closed-source LLMs. Experiments across five languages show that our method outperforms existing semantic and BM25-based retrieval techniques, without requiring additional training or language adaptation. This also suggests that matching error patterns is key to selecting examples.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) are widely adopted to generate synthetic datasets for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as text classification and summarization. However, accurately measuring the diversity of these synthetic datasets-an aspect crucial for robust model performance-remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we introduce DCScore, a novel method for measuring synthetic dataset diversity from a classification perspective. Specifically, DCScore formulates diversity evaluation as a sample classification task, leveraging mutual relationships among samples. We further provide theoretical verification of the diversity-related axioms satisfied by DCScore, highlighting its role as a principled diversity evaluation method. Experimental results on synthetic datasets reveal that DCScore enjoys a stronger correlation with multiple diversity pseudo-truths of evaluated datasets, underscoring its effectiveness. Moreover, both empirical and theoretical evidence demonstrate that DCScore substantially reduces computational costs compared to existing approaches. Code is available at: this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Faithfulness evaluators based on large language models (LLMs) are often fooled by the fluency of the text and struggle with identifying errors in the summaries. We propose an approach to summary faithfulness evaluation in which multiple LLM-based agents are assigned initial stances (regardless of what their belief might be) and forced to come up with a reason to justify the imposed belief, thus engaging in a multi-round debate to reach an agreement. The uniformly distributed initial assignments result in a greater diversity of stances leading to more meaningful debates and ultimately more errors identified. Furthermore, by analyzing the recent faithfulness evaluation datasets, we observe that naturally, it is not always the case for a summary to be either faithful to the source document or not. We therefore introduce a new dimension, ambiguity, and a detailed taxonomy to identify such special cases. Experiments demonstrate our approach can help identify ambiguities, and have even a stronger performance on non-ambiguous summaries.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This study examines how temperature settings and model architectures affect the generation of structured fictional data (names, birthdates) across three large language models (LLMs): llama3.1:8b, deepseek-r1:8b, and mistral:latest. By systematically testing temperature values from 0.0 to 1.0 in increments of 0.1, we conducted 330 trials yielding 889 structured entities, validated for syntactic consistency. Key findings reveal that model architecture significantly influences computational efficiency, with mistral:latest and llama3.1:8b processing data 8x faster than deepseek-r1:8b. Contrary to expectations, temperature showed no correlation with processing time, challenging assumptions about stochastic sampling costs. Output diversity remained limited, as models consistently defaulted to common name archetypes (e.g., 'John Doe' and 'Jane Smith') across all temperatures, though rare names clustered at intermediate values (0.3-0.7). These results demonstrate that architectural optimizations, rather than temperature adjustments, dominate performance in structured generation tasks. The findings emphasize prioritizing model selection over hyperparameter tuning for efficiency and suggest explicit diversity constraints are necessary to mitigate default output biases in synthetic data pipelines.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>federate, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated Learning (FL) is increasingly adopted in edge computing scenarios, where a large number of heterogeneous clients operate under constrained or sufficient resources. The iterative training process in conventional FL introduces significant computation and communication overhead, which is unfriendly for resource-constrained edge devices. One-shot FL has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate communication overhead, and model-heterogeneous FL solves the problem of diverse computing resources across clients. However, existing methods face challenges in effectively managing model-heterogeneous one-shot FL, often leading to unsatisfactory global model performance or reliance on auxiliary datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a novel FL framework named FedMHO, which leverages deep classification models on resource-sufficient clients and lightweight generative models on resource-constrained devices. On the server side, FedMHO involves a two-stage process that includes data generation and knowledge fusion. Furthermore, we introduce FedMHO-MD and FedMHO-SD to mitigate the knowledge-forgetting problem during the knowledge fusion stage, and an unsupervised data optimization solution to improve the quality of synthetic samples. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods, as they outperform state-of-the-art baselines in various experimental setups.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Next token prediction has been the standard training objective used in large language model pretraining. Representations are learned as a result of optimizing for token-level perplexity. We propose Continuous Concept Mixing (CoCoMix), a novel pretraining framework that combines discrete next token prediction with continuous concepts. Specifically, CoCoMix predicts continuous concepts learned from a pretrained sparse autoencoder and mixes them into the model's hidden state by interleaving with token hidden representations. Through experiments on multiple benchmarks, including language modeling and downstream reasoning tasks, we show that CoCoMix is more sample efficient and consistently outperforms standard next token prediction, knowledge distillation and inserting pause tokens. We find that combining both concept learning and interleaving in an end-to-end framework is critical to performance gains. Furthermore, CoCoMix enhances interpretability and steerability by allowing direct inspection and modification of the predicted concept, offering a transparent way to guide the model's internal reasoning process.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We consider the problem of matrix completion with graphs as side information depicting the interrelations between variables. The key challenge lies in leveraging the similarity structure of the graph to enhance matrix recovery. Existing approaches, primarily based on graph Laplacian regularization, suffer from several limitations: (1) they focus only on the similarity between neighboring variables, while overlooking long-range correlations; (2) they are highly sensitive to false edges in the graphs and (3) they lack theoretical guarantees regarding statistical and computational complexities. To address these issues, we propose in this paper a novel graph regularized matrix completion algorithm called GSGD, based on preconditioned projected gradient descent approach. We demonstrate that GSGD effectively captures the higher-order correlation information behind the graphs, and achieves superior robustness and stability against the false edges. Theoretically, we prove that GSGD achieves linear convergence to the global optimum with near-optimal sample complexity, providing the first theoretical guarantees for both recovery accuracy and efficacy in the perspective of nonconvex optimization. Our numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world data further validate that GSGD achieves superior recovery accuracy and scalability compared with several popular alternatives.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Learning from mistakes is a fundamental feature of human intelligence. Previous work has shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) can also learn from incorrect answers when provided with a comprehensive rationale detailing why an answer is wrong or how to correct it. In this work, we examine whether LLMs can learn from mistakes in mathematical reasoning tasks when these explanations are not provided. We investigate if LLMs are able to implicitly infer such rationales simply from observing both incorrect and correct answers. Surprisingly, we find that LLMs perform better, on average, when rationales are eliminated from the context and incorrect answers are simply shown alongside correct ones. This approach also substantially outperforms chain-of-thought prompting in our evaluations. We show that these results are consistent across LLMs of different sizes and varying reasoning abilities. Further, we carry out an in-depth analysis, and show that prompting with both wrong and correct answers leads to greater performance and better generalisation than introducing additional, more diverse question-answer pairs into the context. Finally, we show that new rationales generated by models that have only observed incorrect and correct answers are scored equally as highly by humans as those produced with the aid of exemplar rationales. Our results demonstrate that LLMs are indeed capable of in-context implicit learning.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Human understanding and generation are critical for modeling digital humans and humanoid embodiments. Recently, Human-centric Foundation Models (HcFMs) inspired by the success of generalist models, such as large language and vision models, have emerged to unify diverse human-centric tasks into a single framework, surpassing traditional task-specific approaches. In this survey, we present a comprehensive overview of HcFMs by proposing a taxonomy that categorizes current approaches into four groups: (1) Human-centric Perception Foundation Models that capture fine-grained features for multi-modal 2D and 3D understanding. (2) Human-centric AIGC Foundation Models that generate high-fidelity, diverse human-related content. (3) Unified Perception and Generation Models that integrate these capabilities to enhance both human understanding and synthesis. (4) Human-centric Agentic Foundation Models that extend beyond perception and generation to learn human-like intelligence and interactive behaviors for humanoid embodied tasks. We review state-of-the-art techniques, discuss emerging challenges and future research directions. This survey aims to serve as a roadmap for researchers and practitioners working towards more robust, versatile, and intelligent digital human and embodiments modeling.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The growing availability of longitudinal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) datasets has facilitated Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven modeling of disease progression, making it possible to predict future medical scans for individual patients. However, despite significant advancements in AI, current methods continue to face challenges including achieving patient-specific individualization, ensuring spatiotemporal consistency, efficiently utilizing longitudinal data, and managing the substantial memory demands of 3D scans. To address these challenges, we propose Brain Latent Progression (BrLP), a novel spatiotemporal model designed to predict individual-level disease progression in 3D brain MRIs. The key contributions in BrLP are fourfold: (i) it operates in a small latent space, mitigating the computational challenges posed by high-dimensional imaging data; (ii) it explicitly integrates subject metadata to enhance the individualization of predictions; (iii) it incorporates prior knowledge of disease dynamics through an auxiliary model, facilitating the integration of longitudinal data; and (iv) it introduces the Latent Average Stabilization (LAS) algorithm, which (a) enforces spatiotemporal consistency in the predicted progression at inference time and (b) allows us to derive a measure of the uncertainty for the prediction. We train and evaluate BrLP on 11,730 T1-weighted (T1w) brain MRIs from 2,805 subjects and validate its generalizability on an external test set comprising 2,257 MRIs from 962 subjects. Our experiments compare BrLP-generated MRI scans with real follow-up MRIs, demonstrating state-of-the-art accuracy compared to existing methods.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the advancement of artificial intelligence and computer vision technologies, multimodal emotion recognition has become a prominent research topic. However, existing methods face challenges such as heterogeneous data fusion and the effective utilization of modality correlations. This paper proposes a novel multimodal emotion recognition approach, DeepMSI-MER, based on the integration of contrastive learning and visual sequence compression. The proposed method enhances cross-modal feature fusion through contrastive learning and reduces redundancy in the visual modality by leveraging visual sequence compression.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce Causal Operator with Adaptive Solver Transformer (COAST), a novel neural operator learning method that leverages a causal language model (CLM) framework to dynamically adapt time steps. Our method predicts both the evolution of a system and its optimal time step, intelligently balancing computational efficiency and accuracy. We find that COAST generates variable step sizes that correlate with the underlying system intrinsicities, both within and across dynamical systems. Within a single trajectory, smaller steps are taken in regions of high complexity, while larger steps are employed in simpler regions. Across different systems, more complex dynamics receive more granular time steps. Benchmarked on diverse systems with varied dynamics, COAST consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance in both efficiency and accuracy. This work underscores the potential of CLM-based intelligent adaptive solvers for scalable operator learning of dynamical systems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the last years, Federated learning (FL) has become a popular solution to train machine learning models in domains with high privacy concerns. However, FL scalability and performance face significant challenges in real-world deployments where data across devices are non-independently and identically distributed (non-IID). The heterogeneity in data distribution frequently arises from spatial distribution of devices, leading to degraded model performance in the absence of proper handling. Additionally, FL typical reliance on centralized architectures introduces bottlenecks and single-point-of-failure risks, particularly problematic at scale or in dynamic environments. To close this gap, we propose Field-Based Federated Learning (FBFL), a novel approach leveraging macroprogramming and field coordination to address these limitations through: (i) distributed spatial-based leader election for personalization to mitigate non-IID data challenges; and (ii) construction of a self-organizing, hierarchical architecture using advanced macroprogramming patterns. Moreover, FBFL not only overcomes the aforementioned limitations, but also enables the development of more specialized models tailored to the specific data distribution in each subregion. This paper formalizes FBFL and evaluates it extensively using MNIST, FashionMNIST, and Extended MNIST datasets. We demonstrate that, when operating under IID data conditions, FBFL performs comparably to the widely-used FedAvg algorithm. Furthermore, in challenging non-IID scenarios, FBFL not only outperforms FedAvg but also surpasses other state-of-the-art methods, namely FedProx and Scaffold, which have been specifically designed to address non-IID data distributions. Additionally, we showcase the resilience of FBFL's self-organizing hierarchical architecture against server failures.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models for image generation have been a subject of increasing interest due to their ability to generate diverse, high-quality images. Image generation has immense potential in medical imaging because open-source medical images are difficult to obtain compared to natural images, especially for rare conditions. The generated images can be used later to train classification and segmentation models. In this paper, we propose simulating realistic ultrasound (US) images by successive fine-tuning of large diffusion models on different publicly available databases. To do so, we fine-tuned Stable Diffusion, a state-of-the-art latent diffusion model, on BUSI (Breast US Images) an ultrasound breast image dataset. We successfully generated high-quality US images of the breast using simple prompts that specify the organ and pathology, which appeared realistic to three experienced US scientists and a US radiologist. Additionally, we provided user control by conditioning the model with segmentations through ControlNet. We will release the source code at this http URL to allow fast US image generation to the scientific community.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, privacy, attack, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>A high volume of recent ML security literature focuses on attacks against aligned large language models (LLMs). These attacks may extract private information or coerce the model into producing harmful outputs. In real-world deployments, LLMs are often part of a larger agentic pipeline including memory systems, retrieval, web access, and API calling. Such additional components introduce vulnerabilities that make these LLM-powered agents much easier to attack than isolated LLMs, yet relatively little work focuses on the security of LLM agents. In this paper, we analyze security and privacy vulnerabilities that are unique to LLM agents. We first provide a taxonomy of attacks categorized by threat actors, objectives, entry points, attacker observability, attack strategies, and inherent vulnerabilities of agent pipelines. We then conduct a series of illustrative attacks on popular open-source and commercial agents, demonstrating the immediate practical implications of their vulnerabilities. Notably, our attacks are trivial to implement and require no understanding of machine learning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advancements in image relighting models, driven by large-scale datasets and pre-trained diffusion models, have enabled the imposition of consistent lighting. However, video relighting still lags, primarily due to the excessive training costs and the scarcity of diverse, high-quality video relighting datasets. A simple application of image relighting models on a frame-by-frame basis leads to several issues: lighting source inconsistency and relighted appearance inconsistency, resulting in flickers in the generated videos. In this work, we propose Light-A-Video, a training-free approach to achieve temporally smooth video relighting. Adapted from image relighting models, Light-A-Video introduces two key techniques to enhance lighting consistency. First, we design a Consistent Light Attention (CLA) module, which enhances cross-frame interactions within the self-attention layers to stabilize the generation of the background lighting source. Second, leveraging the physical principle of light transport independence, we apply linear blending between the source video's appearance and the relighted appearance, using a Progressive Light Fusion (PLF) strategy to ensure smooth temporal transitions in illumination. Experiments show that Light-A-Video improves the temporal consistency of relighted video while maintaining the image quality, ensuring coherent lighting transitions across frames.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The long sampling time of diffusion models remains a significant bottleneck, which can be mitigated by reducing the number of diffusion time steps. However, the quality of samples with fewer steps is highly dependent on the noise schedule, i.e., the specific manner in which noise is introduced and the signal is reduced at each step. Although prior work has improved upon the original variance-preserving and variance-exploding schedules, these approaches $\textit{passively}$ adjust the total variance, without direct control over it. In this work, we propose a novel total-variance/signal-to-noise-ratio disentangled (TV/SNR) framework, where TV and SNR can be controlled independently. Our approach reveals that different existing schedules, where the TV explodes exponentially, can be $\textit{improved}$ by setting a constant TV schedule while preserving the same SNR schedule. Furthermore, generalizing the SNR schedule of the optimal transport flow matching significantly improves the performance in molecular structure generation, achieving few step generation of stable molecules. A similar tendency is observed in image generation, where our approach with a uniform diffusion time grid performs comparably to the highly tailored EDM sampler.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Does the intrinsic curvature of complex networks hold the key to unveiling graph anomalies that conventional approaches overlook? Reconstruction-based graph anomaly detection (GAD) methods overlook such geometric outliers, focusing only on structural and attribute-level anomalies. To this end, we propose CurvGAD - a mixed-curvature graph autoencoder that introduces the notion of curvature-based geometric anomalies. CurvGAD introduces two parallel pipelines for enhanced anomaly interpretability: (1) Curvature-equivariant geometry reconstruction, which focuses exclusively on reconstructing the edge curvatures using a mixed-curvature, Riemannian encoder and Gaussian kernel-based decoder; and (2) Curvature-invariant structure and attribute reconstruction, which decouples structural and attribute anomalies from geometric irregularities by regularizing graph curvature under discrete Ollivier-Ricci flow, thereby isolating the non-geometric anomalies. By leveraging curvature, CurvGAD refines the existing anomaly classifications and identifies new curvature-driven anomalies. Extensive experimentation over 10 real-world datasets (both homophilic and heterophilic) demonstrates an improvement of up to 6.5% over state-of-the-art GAD methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, protect, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As AI systems integrate into critical infrastructure, security gaps in AI compliance frameworks demand urgent attention. This paper audits and quantifies security risks in three major AI governance standards: NIST AI RMF 1.0, UK's AI and Data Protection Risk Toolkit, and the EU's ALTAI. Using a novel risk assessment methodology, we develop four key metrics: Risk Severity Index (RSI), Attack Potential Index (AVPI), Compliance-Security Gap Percentage (CSGP), and Root Cause Vulnerability Score (RCVS). Our analysis identifies 136 concerns across the frameworks, exposing significant gaps. NIST fails to address 69.23 percent of identified risks, ALTAI has the highest attack vector vulnerability (AVPI = 0.51) and the ICO Toolkit has the largest compliance-security gap, with 80.00 percent of high-risk concerns remaining unresolved. Root cause analysis highlights under-defined processes (ALTAI RCVS = 033) and weak implementation guidance (NIST and ICO RCVS = 0.25) as critical weaknesses. These findings emphasize the need for stronger, enforceable security controls in AI compliance. We offer targeted recommendations to enhance security posture and bridge the gap between compliance and real-world AI risks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We study the task of learning Generalized Linear models (GLMs) in the agnostic model under the Gaussian distribution. We give the first polynomial-time algorithm that achieves a constant-factor approximation for \textit{any} monotone Lipschitz activation. Prior constant-factor GLM learners succeed for a substantially smaller class of activations. Our work resolves a well-known open problem, by developing a robust counterpart to the classical GLMtron algorithm (Kakade et al., 2011). Our robust learner applies more generally, encompassing all monotone activations with bounded $(2+\zeta)$-moments, for any fixed $\zeta>0$ -- a condition that is essentially necessary. To obtain our results, we leverage a novel data augmentation technique with decreasing Gaussian noise injection and prove a number of structural results that may be useful in other settings.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The evaluation of cross-lingual semantic search capabilities of models is often limited to existing datasets from tasks such as information retrieval and semantic textual similarity. To allow for domain-specific evaluation, we introduce Cross Lingual Semantic Discrimination (CLSD), a novel cross-lingual semantic search task that requires only a set of parallel sentence pairs of the language pair of interest within the target domain. This task focuses on the ability of a model to cross-lingually rank the true parallel sentence higher than hard negatives generated by a large language model. We create four instances of our introduced CLSD task for the language pair German-French within the domain of news. Within this case study, we find that models that are also fine-tuned for retrieval tasks (e.g., multilingual E5) benefit from using English as the pivot language, while bitext mining models such as LaBSE perform best directly cross-lingually. We also show a fine-grained similarity analysis enabled by our distractor generation strategy, indicating that different embedding models are sensitive to different types of perturbations.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this work, we present CineMaster, a novel framework for 3D-aware and controllable text-to-video generation. Our goal is to empower users with comparable controllability as professional film directors: precise placement of objects within the scene, flexible manipulation of both objects and camera in 3D space, and intuitive layout control over the rendered frames. To achieve this, CineMaster operates in two stages. In the first stage, we design an interactive workflow that allows users to intuitively construct 3D-aware conditional signals by positioning object bounding boxes and defining camera movements within the 3D space. In the second stage, these control signals--comprising rendered depth maps, camera trajectories and object class labels--serve as the guidance for a text-to-video diffusion model, ensuring to generate the user-intended video content. Furthermore, to overcome the scarcity of in-the-wild datasets with 3D object motion and camera pose annotations, we carefully establish an automated data annotation pipeline that extracts 3D bounding boxes and camera trajectories from large-scale video data. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that CineMaster significantly outperforms existing methods and implements prominent 3D-aware text-to-video generation.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advancements in large vision-language models have enabled highly expressive and diverse vector sketch generation. However, state-of-the-art methods rely on a time-consuming optimization process involving repeated feedback from a pretrained model to determine stroke placement. Consequently, despite producing impressive sketches, these methods are limited in practical applications. In this work, we introduce SwiftSketch, a diffusion model for image-conditioned vector sketch generation that can produce high-quality sketches in less than a second. SwiftSketch operates by progressively denoising stroke control points sampled from a Gaussian distribution. Its transformer-decoder architecture is designed to effectively handle the discrete nature of vector representation and capture the inherent global dependencies between strokes. To train SwiftSketch, we construct a synthetic dataset of image-sketch pairs, addressing the limitations of existing sketch datasets, which are often created by non-artists and lack professional quality. For generating these synthetic sketches, we introduce ControlSketch, a method that enhances SDS-based techniques by incorporating precise spatial control through a depth-aware ControlNet. We demonstrate that SwiftSketch generalizes across diverse concepts, efficiently producing sketches that combine high fidelity with a natural and visually appealing style.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce a simple framework for predicting the behavior of an agent in multi-agent settings. In contrast to autoregressive (AR) tasks, such as language processing, our focus is on scenarios with multiple agents whose interactions are shaped by physical constraints and internal motivations. To this end, we propose Poly-Autoregressive (PAR) modeling, which forecasts an ego agent's future behavior by reasoning about the ego agent's state history and the past and current states of other interacting agents. At its core, PAR represents the behavior of all agents as a sequence of tokens, each representing an agent's state at a specific timestep. With minimal data pre-processing changes, we show that PAR can be applied to three different problems: human action forecasting in social situations, trajectory prediction for autonomous vehicles, and object pose forecasting during hand-object interaction. Using a small proof-of-concept transformer backbone, PAR outperforms AR across these three scenarios. The project website can be found at this https URL.</li>
