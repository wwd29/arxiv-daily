          The EarlyBird Gets the WORM: Heuristically Accelerating EarlyBird Convergence(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The Lottery Ticket hypothesis proposes that ideal sparse subnetworks called lottery tickets exist in the untrained dense network. The Early Bird hypothesis proposes an efficient algorithm to find these winning lottery tickets in convolutional neural networks using the novel concept of distance between subnetworks to detect convergence in the subnetworks of a model. However, this approach overlooks unchanging groups of unimportant neurons near the end of the search. We propose WORM, a method that exploits these static groups by truncating their gradients, forcing the model to rely on other neurons. Experiments show WORM achieves faster ticket identification training and uses fewer FLOPs, despite the additional computational overhead. Additionally WORM pruned models lose less accuracy during pruning and recover accuracy faster, improving the robustness of the model. Furthermore, WORM is also able to generalize the Early Bird hypothesis reasonably well to larger models such as transformers, displaying its flexibility to adapt to various architectures.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Many Large Language Models (LLMs) and LLM-powered apps deployed today use some form of prompt filter or alignment to protect their integrity. However, these measures aren't foolproof. This paper introduces KROP, a prompt injection technique capable of obfuscating prompt injection attacks, rendering them virtually undetectable to most of these security measures.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive in-context learning (ICL) capabilities from few-shot demonstration exemplars. While recent learning-based demonstration selection methods have proven beneficial to ICL by choosing more useful exemplars, their underlying mechanisms are opaque, hindering efforts to address limitations such as high training costs and poor generalization across tasks. These methods generally assume the selection process captures similarities between the exemplar and the target instance, however, it remains unknown what kinds of similarities are captured and vital to performing ICL. To dive into this question, we analyze the working mechanisms of the learning-based demonstration selection methods and empirically identify two important factors related to similarity measurement: 1) The ability to integrate different levels of task-agnostic text similarities between the input of exemplars and test cases enhances generalization power across different tasks. 2) Incorporating task-specific labels when measuring the similarities significantly improves the performance on each specific task. We validate these two findings through extensive quantitative and qualitative analyses across ten datasets and various LLMs. Based on our findings, we introduce two effective yet simplified exemplar selection methods catering to task-agnostic and task-specific demands, eliminating the costly LLM inference overhead.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we introduce a subspace-inspired Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) method, which is computationally efficient, easy to implement, and readily applicable to large language, multimodal, and diffusion models. Initially, we equivalently decompose the weights of LoRA into two subspaces, and find that simply mixing them can enhance performance. To study such a phenomenon, we revisit it through a fine-grained subspace lens, showing that such modification is equivalent to employing a fixed mixer to fuse the subspaces. To be more flexible, we jointly learn the mixer with the original LoRA weights, and term the method Mixture-of-Subspaces LoRA (MoSLoRA). MoSLoRA consistently outperforms LoRA on tasks in different modalities, including commonsense reasoning, visual instruction tuning, and subject-driven text-to-image generation, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this work, we explore the use of a novel neural network architecture, the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as feature extractors for sensor-based (specifically IMU) Human Activity Recognition (HAR). Where conventional networks perform a parameterized weighted sum of the inputs at each node and then feed the result into a statically defined nonlinearity, KANs perform non-linear computations represented by B-SPLINES on the edges leading to each node and then just sum up the inputs at the node. Instead of learning weights, the system learns the spline parameters. In the original work, such networks have been shown to be able to more efficiently and exactly learn sophisticated real valued functions e.g. in regression or PDE solution. We hypothesize that such an ability is also advantageous for computing low-level features for IMU-based HAR. To this end, we have implemented KAN as the feature extraction architecture for IMU-based human activity recognition tasks, including four architecture variations. We present an initial performance investigation of the KAN feature extractor on four public HAR datasets. It shows that the KAN-based feature extractor outperforms CNN-based extractors on all datasets while being more parameter efficient.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The service conditions of wheelset bearings has a direct impact on the safe operation of railway heavy haul freight trains as the key components. However, speed fluctuation of the trains and few fault samples are the two main problems that restrict the accuracy of bearing fault diagnosis. Therefore, a cross-machine transfer diagnosis (pyDSN) network coupled with interpretable modulated differentiable short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and physics-informed balanced spectrum quality metric is proposed to learn domain-invariant and discriminative features under time-varying speeds. Firstly, due to insufficiency in extracting extract frequency components of time-varying speed signals using fixed windows, a modulated differentiable STFT (MDSTFT) that is interpretable with STFT-informed theoretical support, is proposed to extract the robust time-frequency spectrum (TFS). During training process, multiple windows with different lengths dynamically change. Also, in addition to the classification metric and domain discrepancy metric, we creatively introduce a third kind of metric, referred to as the physics-informed metric, to enhance transferable TFS. A physics-informed balanced spectrum quality (BSQ) regularization loss is devised to guide an optimization direction for MDSTFT and model. With it, not only can model acquire high-quality TFS, but also a physics-restricted domain adaptation network can be also acquired, making it learn real-world physics knowledge, ultimately diminish the domain discrepancy across different datasets. The experiment is conducted in the scenario of migrating from the laboratory datasets to the freight train dataset, indicating that the hybrid-driven pyDSN outperforms existing methods and has practical value.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Traffic prediction is a challenging spatio-temporal forecasting problem that involves highly complex spatio-temporal correlations. This paper proposes a Multi-level Multi-view Augmented Spatio-temporal Transformer (LVSTformer) for traffic prediction. The model aims to capture spatial dependencies from three different levels: local geographic, global semantic, and pivotal nodes, along with long- and short-term temporal dependencies. Specifically, we design three spatial augmented views to delve into the spatial information from the perspectives of local, global, and pivotal nodes. By combining three spatial augmented views with three parallel spatial self-attention mechanisms, the model can comprehensively captures spatial dependencies at different levels. We design a gated temporal self-attention mechanism to effectively capture long- and short-term temporal dependencies. Furthermore, a spatio-temporal context broadcasting module is introduced between two spatio-temporal layers to ensure a well-distributed allocation of attention scores, alleviating overfitting and information loss, and enhancing the generalization ability and robustness of the model. A comprehensive set of experiments is conducted on six well-known traffic benchmarks, the experimental results demonstrate that LVSTformer achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to competing baselines, with the maximum improvement reaching up to 4.32%.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multimodal electronic health record (EHR) data can offer a holistic assessment of a patient's health status, supporting various predictive healthcare tasks. Recently, several studies have embraced the multitask learning approach in the healthcare domain, exploiting the inherent correlations among clinical tasks to predict multiple outcomes simultaneously. However, existing methods necessitate samples to possess complete labels for all tasks, which places heavy demands on the data and restricts the flexibility of the model. Meanwhile, within a multitask framework with multimodal inputs, how to comprehensively consider the information disparity among modalities and among tasks still remains a challenging problem. To tackle these issues, a unified healthcare prediction model, also named by \textbf{FlexCare}, is proposed to flexibly accommodate incomplete multimodal inputs, promoting the adaption to multiple healthcare tasks. The proposed model breaks the conventional paradigm of parallel multitask prediction by decomposing it into a series of asynchronous single-task prediction. Specifically, a task-agnostic multimodal information extraction module is presented to capture decorrelated representations of diverse intra- and inter-modality patterns. Taking full account of the information disparities between different modalities and different tasks, we present a task-guided hierarchical multimodal fusion module that integrates the refined modality-level representations into an individual patient-level representation. Experimental results on multiple tasks from MIMIC-IV/MIMIC-CXR/MIMIC-NOTE datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Additionally, further analysis underscores the feasibility and potential of employing such a multitask strategy in the healthcare domain. The source code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Masked Image Modeling (MIM) has emerged as a pivotal approach for developing foundational visual models in the field of remote sensing (RS). However, current RS datasets are limited in volume and diversity, which significantly constrains the capacity of MIM methods to learn generalizable representations. In this study, we introduce \textbf{RS-4M}, a large-scale dataset designed to enable highly efficient MIM training on RS images. RS-4M comprises 4 million optical images encompassing abundant and fine-grained RS visual tasks, including object-level detection and pixel-level segmentation. Compared to natural images, RS images often contain massive redundant background pixels, which limits the training efficiency of the conventional MIM models. To address this, we propose an efficient MIM method, termed \textbf{SelectiveMAE}, which dynamically encodes and reconstructs a subset of patch tokens selected based on their semantic richness. SelectiveMAE roots in a progressive semantic token selection module, which evolves from reconstructing semantically analogical tokens to encoding complementary semantic dependencies. This approach transforms conventional MIM training into a progressive feature learning process, enabling SelectiveMAE to efficiently learn robust representations of RS images. Extensive experiments show that SelectiveMAE significantly boosts training efficiency by 2.2-2.7 times and enhances the classification, detection, and segmentation performance of the baseline MIM model.The dataset, source code, and trained models will be released.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This study introduces a generative imputation model leveraging graph attention networks and tabular diffusion models for completing missing parametric data in engineering designs. This model functions as an AI design co-pilot, providing multiple design options for incomplete designs, which we demonstrate using the bicycle design CAD dataset. Through comparative evaluations, we demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms existing classical methods, such as MissForest, hotDeck, PPCA, and tabular generative method TabCSDI in both the accuracy and diversity of imputation options. Generative modeling also enables a broader exploration of design possibilities, thereby enhancing design decision-making by allowing engineers to explore a variety of design completions. The graph model combines GNNs with the structural information contained in assembly graphs, enabling the model to understand and predict the complex interdependencies between different design parameters. The graph model helps accurately capture and impute complex parametric interdependencies from an assembly graph, which is key for design problems. By learning from an existing dataset of designs, the imputation capability allows the model to act as an intelligent assistant that autocompletes CAD designs based on user-defined partial parametric design, effectively bridging the gap between ideation and realization. The proposed work provides a pathway to not only facilitate informed design decisions but also promote creative exploration in design.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, diffusion, transformer, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vehicle trajectory prediction is crucial for advancing autonomous driving and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), enhancing road safety and traffic efficiency. While traditional methods have laid foundational work, modern deep learning techniques, particularly transformer-based models and generative approaches, have significantly improved prediction accuracy by capturing complex and non-linear patterns in vehicle motion and traffic interactions. However, these models often overlook the detailed car-following behaviors and inter-vehicle interactions essential for real-world driving scenarios. This study introduces a Cross-Attention Transformer Enhanced Conditional Diffusion Model (Crossfusor) specifically designed for car-following trajectory prediction. Crossfusor integrates detailed inter-vehicular interactions and car-following dynamics into a robust diffusion framework, improving both the accuracy and realism of predicted trajectories. The model leverages a novel temporal feature encoding framework combining GRU, location-based attention mechanisms, and Fourier embedding to capture historical vehicle dynamics. It employs noise scaled by these encoded historical features in the forward diffusion process, and uses a cross-attention transformer to model intricate inter-vehicle dependencies in the reverse denoising process. Experimental results on the NGSIM dataset demonstrate that Crossfusor outperforms state-of-the-art models, particularly in long-term predictions, showcasing its potential for enhancing the predictive capabilities of autonomous driving systems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>A key goal in mechanistic interpretability is circuit analysis: finding sparse subgraphs of models corresponding to specific behaviors or capabilities. However, MLP sublayers make fine-grained circuit analysis on transformer-based language models difficult. In particular, interpretable features -- such as those found by sparse autoencoders (SAEs) -- are typically linear combinations of extremely many neurons, each with its own nonlinearity to account for. Circuit analysis in this setting thus either yields intractably large circuits or fails to disentangle local and global behavior. To address this we explore transcoders, which seek to faithfully approximate a densely activating MLP layer with a wider, sparsely-activating MLP layer. We successfully train transcoders on language models with 120M, 410M, and 1.4B parameters, and find them to perform at least on par with SAEs in terms of sparsity, faithfulness, and human-interpretability. We then introduce a novel method for using transcoders to perform weights-based circuit analysis through MLP sublayers. The resulting circuits neatly factorize into input-dependent and input-invariant terms. Finally, we apply transcoders to reverse-engineer unknown circuits in the model, and we obtain novel insights regarding the greater-than circuit in GPT2-small. Our results suggest that transcoders can prove effective in decomposing model computations involving MLPs into interpretable circuits. Code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This work studies self-supervised graph learning for text-attributed graphs (TAGs) where nodes are represented by textual attributes. Unlike traditional graph contrastive methods that perturb the numerical feature space and alter the graph's topological structure, we aim to improve view generation through language supervision. This is driven by the prevalence of textual attributes in real applications, which complement graph structures with rich semantic information. However, this presents challenges because of two major reasons. First, text attributes often vary in length and quality, making it difficulty to perturb raw text descriptions without altering their original semantic meanings. Second, although text attributes complement graph structures, they are not inherently well-aligned. To bridge the gap, we introduce GAugLLM, a novel framework for augmenting TAGs. It leverages advanced large language models like Mistral to enhance self-supervised graph learning. Specifically, we introduce a mixture-of-prompt-expert technique to generate augmented node features. This approach adaptively maps multiple prompt experts, each of which modifies raw text attributes using prompt engineering, into numerical feature space. Additionally, we devise a collaborative edge modifier to leverage structural and textual commonalities, enhancing edge augmentation by examining or building connections between nodes. Empirical results across five benchmark datasets spanning various domains underscore our framework's ability to enhance the performance of leading contrastive methods as a plug-in tool. Notably, we observe that the augmented features and graph structure can also enhance the performance of standard generative methods, as well as popular graph neural networks. The open-sourced implementation of our GAugLLM is available at Github.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present an approach called Dialogue Action Tokens (DAT) that adapts language model agents to plan goal-directed dialogues. The core idea is to treat each utterance as an action, thereby converting dialogues into games where existing approaches such as reinforcement learning can be applied. Specifically, we freeze a pretrained language model and train a small planner model that predicts a continuous action vector, used for controlled generation in each round. This design avoids the problem of language degradation under reward optimization. When evaluated on the Sotopia platform for social simulations, the DAT-steered LLaMA model surpasses GPT-4's performance. We also apply DAT to steer an attacker language model in a novel multi-turn red-teaming setting, revealing a potential new attack surface.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent work has identified substantial disparities in generated images of different geographic regions, including stereotypical depictions of everyday objects like houses and cars. However, existing measures for these disparities have been limited to either human evaluations, which are time-consuming and costly, or automatic metrics evaluating full images, which are unable to attribute these disparities to specific parts of the generated images. In this work, we introduce a new set of metrics, Decomposed Indicators of Disparities in Image Generation (Decomposed-DIG), that allows us to separately measure geographic disparities in the depiction of objects and backgrounds in generated images. Using Decomposed-DIG, we audit a widely used latent diffusion model and find that generated images depict objects with better realism than backgrounds and that backgrounds in generated images tend to contain larger regional disparities than objects. We use Decomposed-DIG to pinpoint specific examples of disparities, such as stereotypical background generation in Africa, struggling to generate modern vehicles in Africa, and unrealistically placing some objects in outdoor settings. Informed by our metric, we use a new prompting structure that enables a 52% worst-region improvement and a 20% average improvement in generated background diversity.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>To generate coherent responses, language models infer unobserved meaning from their input text sequence. One potential explanation for this capability arises from theories of delay embeddings in dynamical systems, which prove that unobserved variables can be recovered from the history of only a handful of observed variables. To test whether language models are effectively constructing delay embeddings, we measure the capacities of sequence models to reconstruct unobserved dynamics. We trained 1-layer transformer decoders and state-space sequence models on next-step prediction from noisy, partially-observed time series data. We found that each sequence layer can learn a viable embedding of the underlying system. However, state-space models have a stronger inductive bias than transformers-in particular, they more effectively reconstruct unobserved information at initialization, leading to more parameter-efficient models and lower error on dynamics tasks. Our work thus forges a novel connection between dynamical systems and deep learning sequence models via delay embedding theory.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, privacy, attack, steal, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Software Defined Networking (SDN) has brought significant advancements in network management and programmability. However, this evolution has also heightened vulnerability to Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), sophisticated and stealthy cyberattacks that traditional detection methods often fail to counter, especially in the face of zero-day exploits. A prevalent issue is the inadequacy of existing strategies to detect novel threats while addressing data privacy concerns in collaborative learning scenarios. This paper presents P3GNN (privacy-preserving provenance graph-based graph neural network model), a novel model that synergizes Federated Learning (FL) with Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) for effective APT detection in SDN environments. P3GNN utilizes unsupervised learning to analyze operational patterns within provenance graphs, identifying deviations indicative of security breaches. Its core feature is the integration of FL with homomorphic encryption, which fortifies data confidentiality and gradient integrity during collaborative learning. This approach addresses the critical challenge of data privacy in shared learning contexts. Key innovations of P3GNN include its ability to detect anomalies at the node level within provenance graphs, offering a detailed view of attack trajectories and enhancing security analysis. Furthermore, the models unsupervised learning capability enables it to identify zero-day attacks by learning standard operational patterns. Empirical evaluation using the DARPA TCE3 dataset demonstrates P3GNNs exceptional performance, achieving an accuracy of 0.93 and a low false positive rate of 0.06.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Accurate and transparent financial information disclosure is crucial in the fields of accounting and finance, ensuring market efficiency and investor confidence. Among many information disclosure platforms, the Chinese stock exchanges' investor interactive platform provides a novel and interactive way for listed firms to disclose information of interest to investors through an online question-and-answer (Q&A) format. However, it is common for listed firms to respond to questions with limited or no substantive information, and automatically evaluating the quality of financial information disclosure on large amounts of Q&A pairs is challenging. This paper builds a benchmark FinTruthQA, that can evaluate advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques for the automatic quality assessment of information disclosure in financial Q&A data. FinTruthQA comprises 6,000 real-world financial Q&A entries and each Q&A was manually annotated based on four conceptual dimensions of accounting. We benchmarked various NLP techniques on FinTruthQA, including statistical machine learning models, pre-trained language model and their fine-tuned versions, as well as the large language model GPT-4. Experiments showed that existing NLP models have strong predictive ability for real question identification and question relevance tasks, but are suboptimal for answer relevance and answer readability tasks. By establishing this benchmark, we provide a robust foundation for the automatic evaluation of information disclosure, significantly enhancing the transparency and quality of financial reporting. FinTruthQA can be used by auditors, regulators, and financial analysts for real-time monitoring and data-driven decision-making, as well as by researchers for advanced studies in accounting and finance, ultimately fostering greater trust and efficiency in the financial markets.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recently, transductive learning methods, which leverage holdout sets during training, have gained popularity for their potential to improve speed, accuracy, and fairness in machine learning models. Despite this, the composition of the holdout set itself, particularly the balance of sensitive sub-groups, has been largely overlooked. Our experiments on CIFAR and CelebA datasets show that compositional changes in the holdout set can substantially influence fairness metrics. Imbalanced holdout sets exacerbate existing disparities, while balanced holdouts can mitigate issues introduced by imbalanced training data. These findings underline the necessity of constructing holdout sets that are both diverse and representative.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Despite recent advances in LLM quantization, activation quantization remains to be challenging due to the activation outliers. Conventional remedies, e.g., mixing precisions for different channels, introduce extra overhead and reduce the speedup. In this work, we develop a simple yet effective strategy to facilitate per-tensor activation quantization by preventing the generation of problematic tokens. Precisely, we propose a method to find a set of key-value cache, coined CushionCache, which mitigates outliers in subsequent tokens when inserted as a prefix. CushionCache works in two steps: First, we greedily search for a prompt token sequence that minimizes the maximum activation values in subsequent tokens. Then, we further tune the token cache to regularize the activations of subsequent tokens to be more quantization-friendly. The proposed method successfully addresses activation outliers of LLMs, providing a substantial performance boost for per-tensor activation quantization methods. We thoroughly evaluate our method over a wide range of models and benchmarks and find that it significantly surpasses the established baseline of per-tensor W8A8 quantization and can be seamlessly integrated with the recent activation quantization method.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Long sequence modeling has gained broad interest as large language models (LLMs) continue to advance. Recent research has identified that a large portion of hidden states within the key-value caches of Transformer models can be discarded (also termed evicted) without affecting the perplexity performance in generating long sequences. However, we show that these methods, despite preserving perplexity performance, often drop information that is important for solving downstream tasks, a problem which we call information neglect. To address this issue, we introduce Chunked Instruction-aware State Eviction (CItruS), a novel modeling technique that integrates the attention preferences useful for a downstream task into the eviction process of hidden states. In addition, we design a method for chunked sequence processing to further improve efficiency. Our training-free method exhibits superior performance on long sequence comprehension and retrieval tasks over several strong baselines under the same memory budget, while preserving language modeling perplexity.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce the LiLiuM series of large language models (LLMs): 1B, 7B, and 13B parameter models developed 100% in-house to fit eBay's specific needs in the e-commerce domain. This gives eBay full control over all aspects of the models including license, data, vocabulary, and architecture. We expect these models to be used as a foundation for fine-tuning and instruction-tuning, eliminating dependencies to external models. The LiLiuM LLMs have been trained on 3 trillion tokens of multilingual text from general and e-commerce domain. They perform similar to the popular LLaMA-2 models on English natural language understanding (NLU) benchmarks. At the same time, we outperform LLaMA-2 on non-English NLU tasks, machine translation and on e-commerce specific downstream tasks. As part of our data mixture, we utilize the newly released RedPajama-V2 dataset for training and share our insights regarding data filtering and deduplication. We also discuss in detail how to serialize structured data for use in autoregressive language modeling. We provide insights on the effects of including code and parallel machine translation data in pre-training. Furthermore, we develop our own tokenizer and model vocabulary, customized towards e-commerce. This way, we can achieve up to 34% speed-up in text generation on eBay-specific downstream tasks compared to LLaMA-2. Finally, in relation to LLM pretraining, we show that checkpoint averaging can further improve over the best individual model checkpoint.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Artists are increasingly concerned about advancements in image generation models that can closely replicate their unique artistic styles. In response, several protection tools against style mimicry have been developed that incorporate small adversarial perturbations into artworks published online. In this work, we evaluate the effectiveness of popular protections -- with millions of downloads -- and show they only provide a false sense of security. We find that low-effort and "off-the-shelf" techniques, such as image upscaling, are sufficient to create robust mimicry methods that significantly degrade existing protections. Through a user study, we demonstrate that all existing protections can be easily bypassed, leaving artists vulnerable to style mimicry. We caution that tools based on adversarial perturbations cannot reliably protect artists from the misuse of generative AI, and urge the development of alternative non-technological solutions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Tabular data -- structured, heterogeneous, spreadsheet-style data with rows and columns -- is widely used in practice across many domains. However, while recent foundation models have reduced the need for developing task-specific datasets and predictors in domains such as language modeling and computer vision, this transfer learning paradigm has not had similar impact in the tabular domain. In this work, we seek to narrow this gap and present TabuLa-8B, a language model for tabular prediction. We define a process for extracting a large, high-quality training dataset from the TabLib corpus, proposing methods for tabular data filtering and quality control. Using the resulting dataset, which comprises over 1.6B rows from 3.1M unique tables, we fine-tune a Llama 3-8B large language model (LLM) for tabular data prediction (classification and binned regression) using a novel packing and attention scheme for tabular prediction. Through evaluation across a test suite of 329 datasets, we find that TabuLa-8B has zero-shot accuracy on unseen tables that is over 15 percentage points (pp) higher than random guessing, a feat that is not possible with existing state-of-the-art tabular prediction models (e.g. XGBoost, TabPFN). In the few-shot setting (1-32 shots), without any fine-tuning on the target datasets, TabuLa-8B is 5-15 pp more accurate than XGBoost and TabPFN models that are explicitly trained on equal, or even up to 16x more data. We release our model, code, and data along with the publication of this paper.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated strong capabilities across various applications, including mental health analysis. However, existing studies have focused on predictive performance, leaving the critical issue of fairness underexplored, posing significant risks to vulnerable populations. Despite acknowledging potential biases, previous works have lacked thorough investigations into these biases and their impacts. To address this gap, we systematically evaluate biases across seven social factors (e.g., gender, age, religion) using ten LLMs with different prompting methods on eight diverse mental health datasets. Our results show that GPT-4 achieves the best overall balance in performance and fairness among LLMs, although it still lags behind domain-specific models like MentalRoBERTa in some cases. Additionally, our tailored fairness-aware prompts can effectively mitigate bias in mental health predictions, highlighting the great potential for fair analysis in this field.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present Self-MoE, an approach that transforms a monolithic LLM into a compositional, modular system of self-specialized experts, named MiXSE (MiXture of Self-specialized Experts). Our approach leverages self-specialization, which constructs expert modules using self-generated synthetic data, each equipped with a shared base LLM and incorporating self-optimized routing. This allows for dynamic and capability-specific handling of various target tasks, enhancing overall capabilities, without extensive human-labeled data and added parameters. Our empirical results reveal that specializing LLMs may exhibit potential trade-offs in performances on non-specialized tasks. On the other hand, our Self-MoE demonstrates substantial improvements over the base LLM across diverse benchmarks such as knowledge, reasoning, math, and coding. It also consistently outperforms other methods, including instance merging and weight merging, while offering better flexibility and interpretability by design with semantic experts and routing. Our findings highlight the critical role of modularity and the potential of self-improvement in achieving efficient, scalable, and adaptable systems.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As opposed to evaluating computation and logic-based reasoning, current bench2 marks for evaluating large language models (LLMs) in medicine are primarily focused on question-answering involving domain knowledge and descriptive rea4 soning. While such qualitative capabilities are vital to medical diagnosis, in real5 world scenarios, doctors frequently use clinical calculators that follow quantitative equations and rule-based reasoning paradigms for evidence-based decision support. To this end, we propose MedCalc-Bench, a first-of-its-kind dataset focused on evaluating the medical calculation capability of LLMs. MedCalc-Bench contains an evaluation set of over 1000 manually reviewed instances from 55 different medical calculation tasks. Each instance in MedCalc-Bench consists of a patient note, a question requesting to compute a specific medical value, a ground truth answer, and a step-by-step explanation showing how the answer is obtained. While our evaluation results show the potential of LLMs in this area, none of them are effective enough for clinical settings. Common issues include extracting the incorrect entities, not using the correct equation or rules for a calculation task, or incorrectly performing the arithmetic for the computation. We hope our study highlights the quantitative knowledge and reasoning gaps in LLMs within medical settings, encouraging future improvements of LLMs for various clinical calculation tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The widespread popularity of Large Language Models (LLMs), partly due to their unique ability to perform in-context learning, has also brought to light the importance of ethical and safety considerations when deploying these pre-trained models. In this work, we focus on investigating machine unlearning for LLMs motivated by data protection regulations. In contrast to the growing literature on fine-tuning methods to achieve unlearning, we focus on a comparatively lightweight alternative called soft prompting to realize the unlearning of a subset of training data. With losses designed to enforce forgetting as well as utility preservation, our framework \textbf{S}oft \textbf{P}rompting for \textbf{U}n\textbf{l}earning (SPUL) learns prompt tokens that can be appended to an arbitrary query to induce unlearning of specific examples at inference time without updating LLM parameters. We conduct a rigorous evaluation of the proposed method and our results indicate that SPUL can significantly improve the trade-off between utility and forgetting in the context of text classification with LLMs. We further validate our method using multiple LLMs to highlight the scalability of our framework and provide detailed insights into the choice of hyperparameters and the influence of the size of unlearning data.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Though general awareness around it may be low, space cyberattacks are an increasingly urgent problem given the vital role that space systems play in the modern world. Open-source or public discussions about it typically revolve around only a couple generic scenarios, namely satellite hacking and signals jamming or spoofing. But there are so many more possibilities. The report offers a scenario-prompt generator -- a taxonomy of sorts, called the ICARUS matrix -- that can create more than 4 million unique scenario-prompts. We will offer a starting set of 42 scenarios, briefly describing each one, to begin priming the imagination-pump so that many more researchers can bring their diverse expertise and perspectives to bear on the problem. A failure to imagine novel scenarios is a major risk in being taken by surprise and severely harmed by threat actors who are constantly devising new ways, inventive and resourceful ways, to breach the digital systems that control our wired world. To stay vigilant, defenders likewise need to be imaginative to keep up in this adversarial dance between hunter and prey in cybersecurity. More than offering novel scenarios, we will also explore the drivers of the space cybersecurity problem, which include at least seven factors we have identified. For instance, the shared threat of space debris would seem to push rational states and actors to avoid kinetic conflicts in orbit, which weighs in favor of cyberoperations as the dominant form of space conflicts. Outer space is the next frontier for cybersecurity. To guard against space cyberattacks, we need to understand and anticipate them, and imagination is at the very heart of both cybersecurity and frontiers.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have demonstrated impressive image generation capabilities. Still, their computational intensity prohibits resource-constrained organizations from deploying T2I models after fine-tuning them on their internal target data. While pruning techniques offer a potential solution to reduce the computational burden of T2I models, static pruning methods use the same pruned model for all input prompts, overlooking the varying capacity requirements of different prompts. Dynamic pruning addresses this issue by utilizing a separate sub-network for each prompt, but it prevents batch parallelism on GPUs. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Adaptive Prompt-Tailored Pruning (APTP), a novel prompt-based pruning method designed for T2I diffusion models. Central to our approach is a prompt router model, which learns to determine the required capacity for an input text prompt and routes it to an architecture code, given a total desired compute budget for prompts. Each architecture code represents a specialized model tailored to the prompts assigned to it, and the number of codes is a hyperparameter. We train the prompt router and architecture codes using contrastive learning, ensuring that similar prompts are mapped to nearby codes. Further, we employ optimal transport to prevent the codes from collapsing into a single one. We demonstrate APTP's effectiveness by pruning Stable Diffusion (SD) V2.1 using CC3M and COCO as target datasets. APTP outperforms the single-model pruning baselines in terms of FID, CLIP, and CMMD scores. Our analysis of the clusters learned by APTP reveals they are semantically meaningful. We also show that APTP can automatically discover previously empirically found challenging prompts for SD, e.g., prompts for generating text images, assigning them to higher capacity codes.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in generating a broad spectrum of visual content, yet their proficiency in rendering text is still limited: they often generate inaccurate characters or words that fail to blend well with the underlying image. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a new framework named ARTIST. This framework incorporates a dedicated textual diffusion model to specifically focus on the learning of text structures. Initially, we pretrain this textual model to capture the intricacies of text representation. Subsequently, we finetune a visual diffusion model, enabling it to assimilate textual structure information from the pretrained textual model. This disentangled architecture design and the training strategy significantly enhance the text rendering ability of the diffusion models for text-rich image generation. Additionally, we leverage the capabilities of pretrained large language models to better interpret user intentions, contributing to improved generation quality.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Despite their vast capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with generating reliable outputs, frequently producing high-confidence inaccuracies known as hallucinations. Addressing this challenge, our research introduces InternalInspector, a novel framework designed to enhance confidence estimation in LLMs by leveraging contrastive learning on internal states including attention states, feed-forward states, and activation states of all layers. Unlike existing methods that primarily focus on the final activation state, InternalInspector conducts a comprehensive analysis across all internal states of every layer to accurately identify both correct and incorrect prediction processes. By benchmarking InternalInspector against existing confidence estimation methods across various natural language understanding and generation tasks, including factual question answering, commonsense reasoning, and reading comprehension, InternalInspector achieves significantly higher accuracy in aligning the estimated confidence scores with the correctness of the LLM's predictions and lower calibration error. Furthermore, InternalInspector excels at HaluEval, a hallucination detection benchmark, outperforming other internal-based confidence estimation methods in this task.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown impressive performance in graph representation learning, but they face challenges in capturing long-range dependencies due to their limited expressive power. To address this, Graph Transformers (GTs) were introduced, utilizing self-attention mechanism to effectively model pairwise node relationships. Despite their advantages, GTs suffer from quadratic complexity w.r.t. the number of nodes in the graph, hindering their applicability to large graphs. In this work, we present Graph-Enhanced Contextual Operator (GECO), a scalable and effective alternative to GTs that leverages neighborhood propagation and global convolutions to effectively capture local and global dependencies in quasilinear time. Our study on synthetic datasets reveals that GECO reaches 169x speedup on a graph with 2M nodes w.r.t. optimized attention. Further evaluations on diverse range of benchmarks showcase that GECO scales to large graphs where traditional GTs often face memory and time limitations. Notably, GECO consistently achieves comparable or superior quality compared to baselines, improving the SOTA up to 4.5%, and offering a scalable and effective solution for large-scale graph learning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent models for natural language understanding are inclined to exploit simple patterns in datasets, commonly known as shortcuts. These shortcuts hinge on spurious correlations between labels and latent features existing in the training data. At inference time, shortcut-dependent models are likely to generate erroneous predictions under distribution shifts, particularly when some latent features are no longer correlated with the labels. To avoid this, previous studies have trained models to eliminate the reliance on shortcuts. In this study, we explore a different direction: pessimistically aggregating the predictions of a mixture-of-experts, assuming each expert captures relatively different latent features. The experimental results demonstrate that our post-hoc control over the experts significantly enhances the model's robustness to the distribution shift in shortcuts. Besides, we show that our approach has some practical advantages. We also analyze our model and provide results to support the assumption.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Medical knowledge is context-dependent and requires consistent reasoning across various natural language expressions of semantically equivalent phrases. This is particularly crucial for drug names, where patients often use brand names like Advil or Tylenol instead of their generic equivalents. To study this, we create a new robustness dataset, RABBITS, to evaluate performance differences on medical benchmarks after swapping brand and generic drug names using physician expert annotations. We assess both open-source and API-based LLMs on MedQA and MedMCQA, revealing a consistent performance drop ranging from 1-10\%. Furthermore, we identify a potential source of this fragility as the contamination of test data in widely used pre-training datasets.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) are capable of producing documents, and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) has shown itself to be a powerful method for improving accuracy without sacrificing fluency. However, not all information can be retrieved from text. We propose an approach that uses the analysis of structured data to generate fact sets that are used to guide generation in much the same way that retrieved documents are used in RAG. This analytics augmented generation (AAG) approach supports the ability to utilize standard analytic techniques to generate facts that are then converted to text and passed to an LLM. We present a neurosymbolic platform, Satyrn that leverages AAG to produce accurate, fluent, and coherent reports grounded in large scale databases. In our experiments, we find that Satyrn generates reports in which over 86% accurate claims while maintaining high levels of fluency and coherence, even when using smaller language models such as Mistral-7B, as compared to GPT-4 Code Interpreter in which just 57% of claims are accurate.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Social scientists use surveys to probe the opinions and beliefs of populations, but these methods are slow, costly, and prone to biases. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) enable creating computational representations or "digital twins" of populations that generate human-like responses mimicking the population's language, styles, and attitudes. We introduce Community-Cross-Instruct, an unsupervised framework for aligning LLMs to online communities to elicit their beliefs. Given a corpus of a community's online discussions, Community-Cross-Instruct automatically generates instruction-output pairs by an advanced LLM to (1) finetune an foundational LLM to faithfully represent that community, and (2) evaluate the alignment of the finetuned model to the community. We demonstrate the method's utility in accurately representing political and fitness communities on Reddit. Unlike prior methods requiring human-authored instructions, Community-Cross-Instruct generates instructions in a fully unsupervised manner, enhancing scalability and generalization across domains. This work enables cost-effective and automated surveying of diverse online communities.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper introduces Deep HM-SORT, a novel online multi-object tracking algorithm specifically designed to enhance the tracking of athletes in sports scenarios. Traditional multi-object tracking methods often struggle with sports environments due to the similar appearances of players, irregular and unpredictable movements, and significant camera motion. Deep HM-SORT addresses these challenges by integrating deep features, harmonic mean, and Expansion IOU. By leveraging the harmonic mean, our method effectively balances appearance and motion cues, significantly reducing ID-swaps. Additionally, our approach retains all tracklets indefinitely, improving the re-identification of players who leave and re-enter the frame. Experimental results demonstrate that Deep HM-SORT achieves state-of-the-art performance on two large-scale public benchmarks, SportsMOT and SoccerNet Tracking Challenge 2023. Specifically, our method achieves 80.1 HOTA on the SportsMOT dataset and 85.4 HOTA on the SoccerNet-Tracking dataset, outperforming existing trackers in key metrics such as HOTA, IDF1, AssA, and MOTA. This robust solution provides enhanced accuracy and reliability for automated sports analytics, offering significant improvements over previous methods without introducing additional computational cost.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Implicit functions such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), occupancy networks, and signed distance functions (SDFs) have become pivotal in computer vision for reconstructing detailed object shapes from sparse views. Achieving optimal performance with these models can be challenging due to the extreme sparsity of inputs and distribution shifts induced by data corruptions. To this end, large, noise-free synthetic datasets can serve as shape priors to help models fill in gaps, but the resulting reconstructions must be approached with caution. Uncertainty estimation is crucial for assessing the quality of these reconstructions, particularly in identifying areas where the model is uncertain about the parts it has inferred from the prior. In this paper, we introduce Dropsembles, a novel method for uncertainty estimation in tuned implicit functions. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through a series of experiments, starting with toy examples and progressing to a real-world scenario. Specifically, we train a Convolutional Occupancy Network on synthetic anatomical data and test it on low-resolution MRI segmentations of the lumbar spine. Our results show that Dropsembles achieve the accuracy and calibration levels of deep ensembles but with significantly less computational cost.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advancements in Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) have significantly impacted the alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs). The sensitivity of reinforcement learning algorithms such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) has led to new line work on Direct Policy Optimization (DPO), which treats RLHF in a supervised learning framework. The increased practical use of these RLHF methods warrants an analysis of their vulnerabilities. In this work, we investigate the vulnerabilities of DPO to poisoning attacks under different scenarios and compare the effectiveness of preference poisoning, a first of its kind. We comprehensively analyze DPO's vulnerabilities under different types of attacks, i.e., backdoor and non-backdoor attacks, and different poisoning methods across a wide array of language models, i.e., LLama 7B, Mistral 7B, and Gemma 7B. We find that unlike PPO-based methods, which, when it comes to backdoor attacks, require at least 4\% of the data to be poisoned to elicit harmful behavior, we exploit the true vulnerabilities of DPO more simply so we can poison the model with only as much as 0.5\% of the data. We further investigate the potential reasons behind the vulnerability and how well this vulnerability translates into backdoor vs non-backdoor attacks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Trajectory prediction models that can infer both finite future trajectories and their associated uncertainties of the target vehicles in an online setting (e.g., real-world application scenarios) is crucial for ensuring the safe and robust navigation and path planning of autonomous vehicle motion. However, the majority of existing trajectory prediction models have neither considered reducing the uncertainty as one objective during the training stage nor provided reliable uncertainty quantification during inference stage under potential distribution shift. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the Conformal Uncertainty Quantification under Distribution Shift framework, CUQDS, to quantify the uncertainty of the predicted trajectories of existing trajectory prediction models under potential data distribution shift, while considering improving the prediction accuracy of the models and reducing the estimated uncertainty during the training stage. Specifically, CUQDS includes 1) a learning-based Gaussian process regression module that models the output distribution of the base model (any existing trajectory prediction or time series forecasting neural networks) and reduces the estimated uncertainty by additional loss term, and 2) a statistical-based Conformal P control module to calibrate the estimated uncertainty from the Gaussian process regression module in an online setting under potential distribution shift between training and testing data.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As a mathematically rigorous framework that has amassed a rich theoretical literature, differential privacy is considered by many experts to be the gold standard for privacy-preserving data analysis. Others argue that while differential privacy is a clean formulation in theory, it poses significant challenges in practice. Both perspectives are, in our view, valid and important. To bridge the gaps between differential privacy's promises and its real-world usability, researchers and practitioners must work together to advance policy and practice of this technology. In this paper, we outline pressing open questions towards building usable differential privacy and offer recommendations for the field, such as developing risk frameworks to align with user needs, tailoring communications for different stakeholders, modeling the impact of privacy-loss parameters, investing in effective user interfaces, and facilitating algorithmic and procedural audits of differential privacy systems.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advancements in Text-to-SQL have pushed database management systems towards greater democratization of data access. Today's language models are at the core of these advancements. They enable impressive Text-to-SQL generation as experienced in the development of Distyl AI's Analytics Insight Engine. Its early deployment with enterprise customers has highlighted three core challenges. First, data analysts expect support with authoring SQL queries of very high complexity. Second, requests are ad-hoc and, as such, require low latency. Finally, generation requires an understanding of domain-specific terminology and practices. The design and implementation of our Text-to-SQL generation pipeline, powered by large language models, tackles these challenges. The core tenants of our approach rely on external knowledge that we extract in a pre-processing phase, on retrieving the appropriate external knowledge at query generation time, and on decomposing SQL query generation following a hierarchical CTE-based structure. Finally, an adaptation framework leverages feedback to update the external knowledge, in turn improving query generation over time. We give an overview of our end-to-end approach and highlight the operators generating SQL during inference.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This study empirically tests the $\textit{Narrative Economics}$ hypothesis, which posits that narratives (ideas that are spread virally and affect public beliefs) can influence economic fluctuations. We introduce two curated datasets containing posts from X (formerly Twitter) which capture economy-related narratives (Data will be shared upon paper acceptance). Employing Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, we extract and summarize narratives from the tweets. We test their predictive power for $\textit{macroeconomic}$ forecasting by incorporating the tweets' or the extracted narratives' representations in downstream financial prediction tasks. Our work highlights the challenges in improving macroeconomic models with narrative data, paving the way for the research community to realistically address this important challenge. From a scientific perspective, our investigation offers valuable insights and NLP tools for narrative extraction and summarization using Large Language Models (LLMs), contributing to future research on the role of narratives in economics.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Speculation is fundamental to achieving high CPU performance, yet it enables vulnerabilities such as Spectre attacks, which remain a significant challenge to mitigate without incurring substantial performance overheads. These attacks typically unfold in three steps: they speculatively access sensitive data (access), alter the cache state (transmit), and then utilize a cache timing attack (e.g., Flush+Reload) to extract the secret (receive). Most Spectre attacks exploit a cache timing side channel during the transmit and receive steps. Our key observation is that Spectre attacks do not require the transmit instruction to complete before mis-prediction is detected and mis-speculated instructions are squashed. Instead, it suffices for the instruction to execute and dispatch a request to the memory hierarchy. Responses from memory that arrive after squashing occurs still alter the cache state, including those related to mis-speculated memory accesses. We therefore propose a novel mitigation technique, Cancellable Memory Requests (CMR), that cancels mis-speculated memory requests. Immediately upon squashing, a cancellation is sent to the cache hierarchy, propagating downstream and preventing any changes to caches that have not yet received a response. This reduces the likelihood of cache state changes, thereby reducing the likelihood of Spectre attacks succeeding. We implement CMR on gem5 and show that it thwarts practical Spectre attacks, and has near-zero performance overheads. We show that CMR can completely thwart Spectre attacks in four real-world processors with realistic system configurations.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the context of text classification, the financial burden of annotation exercises for creating training data is a critical issue. Active learning techniques, particularly those rooted in uncertainty sampling, offer a cost-effective solution by pinpointing the most instructive samples for manual annotation. Similarly, Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-3.5 provide an alternative for automated annotation but come with concerns regarding their reliability. This study introduces a novel methodology that integrates human annotators and LLMs within an Active Learning framework. We conducted evaluations on three public datasets. IMDB for sentiment analysis, a Fake News dataset for authenticity discernment, and a Movie Genres dataset for multi-label classification.The proposed framework integrates human annotation with the output of LLMs, depending on the model uncertainty levels. This strategy achieves an optimal balance between cost efficiency and classification performance. The empirical results show a substantial decrease in the costs associated with data annotation while either maintaining or improving model accuracy.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models are powerful generative models that allow for precise control over the characteristics of the generated samples. While these diffusion models trained on large datasets have achieved success, there is often a need to introduce additional controls in downstream fine-tuning processes, treating these powerful models as pre-trained diffusion models. This work presents a novel method based on reinforcement learning (RL) to add additional controls, leveraging an offline dataset comprising inputs and corresponding labels. We formulate this task as an RL problem, with the classifier learned from the offline dataset and the KL divergence against pre-trained models serving as the reward functions. We introduce our method, $\textbf{CTRL}$ ($\textbf{C}$onditioning pre-$\textbf{T}$rained diffusion models with $\textbf{R}$einforcement $\textbf{L}$earning), which produces soft-optimal policies that maximize the abovementioned reward functions. We formally demonstrate that our method enables sampling from the conditional distribution conditioned on additional controls during inference. Our RL-based approach offers several advantages over existing methods. Compared to commonly used classifier-free guidance, our approach improves sample efficiency, and can greatly simplify offline dataset construction by exploiting conditional independence between the inputs and additional controls. Furthermore, unlike classifier guidance, we avoid the need to train classifiers from intermediate states to additional controls.</li>

          TutteNet: Injective 3D Deformations by Composition of 2D Mesh Deformations(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This work proposes a novel representation of injective deformations of 3D space, which overcomes existing limitations of injective methods: inaccuracy, lack of robustness, and incompatibility with general learning and optimization frameworks. The core idea is to reduce the problem to a deep composition of multiple 2D mesh-based piecewise-linear maps. Namely, we build differentiable layers that produce mesh deformations through Tutte's embedding (guaranteed to be injective in 2D), and compose these layers over different planes to create complex 3D injective deformations of the 3D volume. We show our method provides the ability to efficiently and accurately optimize and learn complex deformations, outperforming other injective approaches. As a main application, we produce complex and artifact-free NeRF and SDF deformations.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper focuses on extending the success of large language models (LLMs) to sequential decision making. Existing efforts either (i) re-train or finetune LLMs for decision making, or (ii) design prompts for pretrained LLMs. The former approach suffers from the computational burden of gradient updates, and the latter approach does not show promising results. In this paper, we propose a new approach that leverages online model selection algorithms to efficiently incorporate LLMs agents into sequential decision making. Statistically, our approach significantly outperforms both traditional decision making algorithms and vanilla LLM agents. Computationally, our approach avoids the need for expensive gradient updates of LLMs, and throughout the decision making process, it requires only a small number of LLM calls. We conduct extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of our proposed approach. As an example, on a large-scale Amazon dataset, our approach achieves more than a $6$x performance gain over baselines while calling LLMs in only $1.5$\% of the time steps.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as "content farm" models (CFMs), to generate synthetic text that could pass for real news articles. This is already happening even for languages that do not have high-quality monolingual LLMs. We show that fine-tuning Llama (v1), mostly trained on English, on as little as 40K Italian news articles, is sufficient for producing news-like texts that native speakers of Italian struggle to identify as synthetic. We investigate three LLMs and three methods of detecting synthetic texts (log-likelihood, DetectGPT, and supervised classification), finding that they all perform better than human raters, but they are all impractical in the real world (requiring either access to token likelihood information or a large dataset of CFM texts). We also explore the possibility of creating a proxy CFM: an LLM fine-tuned on a similar dataset to one used by the real "content farm". We find that even a small amount of fine-tuning data suffices for creating a successful detector, but we need to know which base LLM is used, which is a major challenge. Our results suggest that there are currently no practical methods for detecting synthetic news-like texts 'in the wild', while generating them is too easy. We highlight the urgency of more NLP research on this problem.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present Gram2Vec, a grammatical style embedding algorithm that embeds documents into a higher dimensional space by extracting the normalized relative frequencies of grammatical features present in the text. Compared to neural approaches, Gram2Vec offers inherent interpretability based on how the feature vectors are generated. In our demo, we present a way to visualize a mapping of authors to documents based on their Gram2Vec vectors and highlight the ability to drop or add features to view which authors make certain linguistic choices. Next, we use authorship attribution as an application to show how Gram2Vec can explain why a document is attributed to a certain author, using cosine similarities between the Gram2Vec feature vectors to calculate the distances between candidate documents and a query document.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models have demonstrated strong performance in sampling and editing multi-modal data with high generation quality, yet they suffer from the iterative generation process which is computationally expensive and slow. In addition, most methods are constrained to generate data from Gaussian noise, which limits their sampling and editing flexibility. To overcome both disadvantages, we present Contrastive Optimal Transport Flow (COT Flow), a new method that achieves fast and high-quality generation with improved zero-shot editing flexibility compared to previous diffusion models. Benefiting from optimal transport (OT), our method has no limitation on the prior distribution, enabling unpaired image-to-image (I2I) translation and doubling the editable space (at both the start and end of the trajectory) compared to other zero-shot editing methods. In terms of quality, COT Flow can generate competitive results in merely one step compared to previous state-of-the-art unpaired image-to-image (I2I) translation methods. To highlight the advantages of COT Flow through the introduction of OT, we introduce the COT Editor to perform user-guided editing with excellent flexibility and quality.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Machine learning models have achieved high overall accuracy in medical image analysis. However, performance disparities on specific patient groups pose challenges to their clinical utility, safety, and fairness. This can affect known patient groups - such as those based on sex, age, or disease subtype - as well as previously unknown and unlabeled groups. Furthermore, the root cause of such observed performance disparities is often challenging to uncover, hindering mitigation efforts. In this paper, to address these issues, we leverage Slice Discovery Methods (SDMs) to identify interpretable underperforming subsets of data and formulate hypotheses regarding the cause of observed performance disparities. We introduce a novel SDM and apply it in a case study on the classification of pneumothorax and atelectasis from chest x-rays. Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of SDMs in hypothesis formulation and yields an explanation of previously observed but unexplained performance disparities between male and female patients in widely used chest X-ray datasets and models. Our findings indicate shortcut learning in both classification tasks, through the presence of chest drains and ECG wires, respectively. Sex-based differences in the prevalence of these shortcut features appear to cause the observed classification performance gap, representing a previously underappreciated interaction between shortcut learning and model fairness analyses.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>It is generally thought that transformer-based large language models benefit from pre-training by learning generic linguistic knowledge that can be focused on a specific task during fine-tuning. However, we propose that much of the benefit from pre-training may be captured by geometric characteristics of the latent space representations, divorced from any specific linguistic knowledge. In this work we explore the relationship between GLUE benchmarking task performance and a variety of measures applied to the latent space resulting from BERT-type contextual language models. We find that there is a strong linear relationship between a measure of quantized cell density and average GLUE performance and that these measures may be predictive of otherwise surprising GLUE performance for several non-standard BERT-type models from the literature. These results may be suggestive of a strategy for decreasing pre-training requirements, wherein model initialization can be informed by the geometric characteristics of the model's latent space.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Direct alignment from preferences (DAP) has emerged as a promising paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs) to human desiderata from pre-collected, offline preference datasets. While recent studies indicate that existing offline DAP methods can directly benefit from online training samples, we highlight the need to develop specific online DAP algorithms to fully harness the power of online training. Specifically, we identify that the learned LLM should adhere to the proximity of the behavior LLM, which collects the training samples. To this end, we propose online Preference Optimization in proximity to the Behavior LLM (BPO), emphasizing the importance of constructing a proper trust region for LLM alignment. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness and applicability of our approach by integrating it with various DAP methods, resulting in significant performance improvements across a wide range of tasks when training with the same amount of preference data. Even when only introducing one additional data collection phase, our online BPO improves its offline DAP baseline from 72.0% to 80.2% on TL;DR and from 82.2% to 89.1% on Anthropic Helpfulness in terms of win rate against human reference text.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>explainability, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The last decade of computer vision has been dominated by Deep Learning architectures, thanks to their unparalleled success. Their performance, however, often comes at the cost of explainability owing to their highly non-linear nature. Consequently, a parallel field of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has developed with the aim of generating insights regarding the decision making process of deep learning models. An important problem in XAI is that of the generation of saliency maps. These are regions in an input image which contributed most towards the model's final decision. Most work in this regard, however, has been focused on image classification, and image segmentation - despite being a ubiquitous task - has not received the same attention. In the present work, we propose MiSuRe (Minimally Sufficient Region) as an algorithm to generate saliency maps for image segmentation. The goal of the saliency maps generated by MiSuRe is to get rid of irrelevant regions, and only highlight those regions in the input image which are crucial to the image segmentation decision. We perform our analysis on 3 datasets: Triangle (artificially constructed), COCO-2017 (natural images), and the Synapse multi-organ (medical images). Additionally, we identify a potential usecase of these post-hoc saliency maps in order to perform post-hoc reliability of the segmentation model.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose a multi-agent debate as optimization (DAO) system for event extraction, where the primary objective is to iteratively refine the large language models (LLMs) outputs through debating without parameter tuning. In DAO, we introduce two novel modules: the Diverse-RAG (DRAG) module and the Adaptive Conformal Prediction (AdaCP) module. DRAG systematically retrieves supporting information that best fits the debate discussion, while AdaCP enhances the accuracy and reliability of event extraction by effectively rejecting less promising answers. Experimental results demonstrate a significant reduction in the performance gap between supervised approaches and tuning-free LLM-based methods by 18.1% and 17.8% on ACE05 and 17.9% and 15.2% on CASIE for event detection and argument extraction respectively.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of death globally, necessitating precise forecasting models for monitoring vital signs like heart rate, blood pressure, and ECG. Traditional models, such as ARIMA and Prophet, are limited by their need for manual parameter tuning and challenges in handling noisy, sparse, and highly variable medical data. This study investigates advanced deep learning models, including LSTM, and transformer-based architectures, for predicting heart rate time series from the MIT-BIH Database. Results demonstrate that deep learning models, particularly PatchTST, significantly outperform traditional models across multiple metrics, capturing complex patterns and dependencies more effectively. This research underscores the potential of deep learning to enhance patient monitoring and CVD management, suggesting substantial clinical benefits. Future work should extend these findings to larger, more diverse datasets and real-world clinical applications to further validate and optimize model performance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Spiking federated learning is an emerging distributed learning paradigm that allows resource-constrained devices to train collaboratively at low power consumption without exchanging local data. It takes advantage of both the privacy computation property in federated learning (FL) and the energy efficiency in spiking neural networks (SNN). Thus, it is highly promising to revolutionize the efficient processing of multimedia data. However, existing spiking federated learning methods employ a random selection approach for client aggregation, assuming unbiased client participation. This neglect of statistical heterogeneity affects the convergence and accuracy of the global model significantly. In our work, we propose a credit assignment-based active client selection strategy, the SFedCA, to judiciously aggregate clients that contribute to the global sample distribution balance. Specifically, the client credits are assigned by the firing intensity state before and after local model training, which reflects the local data distribution difference from the global model. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on various non-identical and independent distribution (non-IID) scenarios. The experimental results demonstrate that the SFedCA outperforms the existing state-of-the-art spiking federated learning methods, and requires fewer communication rounds.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We consider offline reinforcement learning (RL) with preference feedback in which the implicit reward is a linear function of an unknown parameter. Given an offline dataset, our objective consists in ascertaining the optimal action for each state, with the ultimate goal of minimizing the {\em simple regret}. We propose an algorithm, \underline{RL} with \underline{L}ocally \underline{O}ptimal \underline{W}eights or {\sc RL-LOW}, which yields a simple regret of $\exp ( - \Omega(n/H) )$ where $n$ is the number of data samples and $H$ denotes an instance-dependent hardness quantity that depends explicitly on the suboptimality gap of each action. Furthermore, we derive a first-of-its-kind instance-dependent lower bound in offline RL with preference feedback. Interestingly, we observe that the lower and upper bounds on the simple regret match order-wise in the exponent, demonstrating order-wise optimality of {\sc RL-LOW}. In view of privacy considerations in practical applications, we also extend {\sc RL-LOW} to the setting of $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy and show, somewhat surprisingly, that the hardness parameter $H$ is unchanged in the asymptotic regime as $n$ tends to infinity; this underscores the inherent efficiency of {\sc RL-LOW} in terms of preserving the privacy of the observed rewards. Given our focus on establishing instance-dependent bounds, our work stands in stark contrast to previous works that focus on establishing worst-case regrets for offline RL with preference feedback.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Fine-tuning pre-trained language models, particularly large language models, demands extensive computing resources and can result in varying performance outcomes across different domains and datasets. This paper examines the approach of integrating multiple models from diverse training scenarios into a unified model. This unified model excels across various data domains and exhibits the ability to generalize well on out-of-domain data. We propose a knowledge fusion method named Evolver, inspired by evolutionary algorithms, which does not need further training or additional training data. Specifically, our method involves aggregating the weights of different language models into a population and subsequently generating offspring models through mutation and crossover operations. These offspring models are then evaluated against their parents, allowing for the preservation of those models that show enhanced performance on development datasets. Importantly, our model evolving strategy can be seamlessly integrated with existing model merging frameworks, offering a versatile tool for model enhancement. Experimental results on mainstream language models (i.e., encoder-only, decoder-only, encoder-decoder) reveal that Evolver outperforms previous state-of-the-art models by large margins.

To capture the essence of these computations, including those desired but not yet in practice, we extend the notion of OTMs by employing a cluster of LLMs as the oracle. We present four variants: basic, augmented, fault-avoidance, and $\epsilon$-fault. The first two variants are commonly observed, whereas the latter two are specifically designed to ensure reliable outcomes by addressing LLM hallucinations, biases, and inconsistencies.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Personality, a fundamental aspect of human cognition, contains a range of traits that influence behaviors, thoughts, and emotions. This paper explores the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in reconstructing these complex cognitive attributes based only on simple descriptions containing socio-demographic and personality type information. Utilizing the HEXACO personality framework, our study examines the consistency of LLMs in recovering and predicting underlying (latent) personality dimensions from simple descriptions. Our experiments reveal a significant degree of consistency in personality reconstruction, although some inconsistencies and biases, such as a tendency to default to positive traits in the absence of explicit information, are also observed. Additionally, socio-demographic factors like age and number of children were found to influence the reconstructed personality dimensions. These findings have implications for building sophisticated agent-based simulacra using LLMs and highlight the need for further research on robust personality generation in LLMs.</li>

          Hierarchical Associative Memory, Parallelized MLP-Mixer, and Symmetry Breaking(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Transformers have established themselves as the leading neural network model in natural language processing and are increasingly foundational in various domains. In vision, the MLP-Mixer model has demonstrated competitive performance, suggesting that attention mechanisms might not be indispensable. Inspired by this, recent research has explored replacing attention modules with other mechanisms, including those described by MetaFormers. However, the theoretical framework for these models remains underdeveloped. This paper proposes a novel perspective by integrating Krotov's hierarchical associative memory with MetaFormers, enabling a comprehensive representation of the entire Transformer block, encompassing token-/channel-mixing modules, layer normalization, and skip connections, as a single Hopfield network. This approach yields a parallelized MLP-Mixer derived from a three-layer Hopfield network, which naturally incorporates symmetric token-/channel-mixing modules and layer normalization. Empirical studies reveal that symmetric interaction matrices in the model hinder performance in image recognition tasks. Introducing symmetry-breaking effects transitions the performance of the symmetric parallelized MLP-Mixer to that of the vanilla MLP-Mixer. This indicates that during standard training, weight matrices of the vanilla MLP-Mixer spontaneously acquire a symmetry-breaking configuration, enhancing their effectiveness. These findings offer insights into the intrinsic properties of Transformers and MLP-Mixers and their theoretical underpinnings, providing a robust framework for future model design and optimization.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Hallucination occurs when large language models (LLMs) exhibit behavior that deviates from the boundaries of their knowledge during the response generation process. Previous learning-based methods focus on detecting knowledge boundaries and finetuning models with instance-level feedback, but they suffer from inaccurate signals due to off-policy data sampling and coarse-grained feedback. In this paper, we introduce \textit{\b{R}einforcement \b{L}earning \b{f}or \b{H}allucination} (RLFH), a fine-grained feedback-based online reinforcement learning method for hallucination mitigation. Unlike previous learning-based methods, RLFH enables LLMs to explore the boundaries of their internal knowledge and provide on-policy, fine-grained feedback on these explorations. To construct fine-grained feedback for learning reliable generation behavior, RLFH decomposes the outcomes of large models into atomic facts, provides statement-level evaluation signals, and traces back the signals to the tokens of the original responses. Finally, RLFH adopts the online reinforcement algorithm with these token-level rewards to adjust model behavior for hallucination mitigation. For effective on-policy optimization, RLFH also introduces an LLM-based fact assessment framework to verify the truthfulness and helpfulness of atomic facts without human intervention. Experiments on HotpotQA, SQuADv2, and Biography benchmarks demonstrate that RLFH can balance their usage of internal knowledge during the generation process to eliminate the hallucination behavior of LLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, robust, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated Learning (FL) is susceptible to poisoning attacks, wherein compromised clients manipulate the global model by modifying local datasets or sending manipulated model updates. Experienced defenders can readily detect and mitigate the poisoning effects of malicious behaviors using Byzantine-robust aggregation rules. However, the exploration of poisoning attacks in scenarios where such behaviors are absent remains largely unexplored for Byzantine-robust FL. This paper addresses the challenging problem of poisoning Byzantine-robust FL by introducing catastrophic forgetting. To fill this gap, we first formally define generalization error and establish its connection to catastrophic forgetting, paving the way for the development of a clean-label data poisoning attack named BadSampler. This attack leverages only clean-label data (i.e., without poisoned data) to poison Byzantine-robust FL and requires the adversary to selectively sample training data with high loss to feed model training and maximize the model's generalization error. We formulate the attack as an optimization problem and present two elegant adversarial sampling strategies, Top-$\kappa$ sampling, and meta-sampling, to approximately solve it. Additionally, our formal error upper bound and time complexity analysis demonstrate that our design can preserve attack utility with high efficiency. Extensive evaluations on two real-world datasets illustrate the effectiveness and performance of our proposed attacks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Detecting hate speech and offensive language is essential for maintaining a safe and respectful digital environment. This study examines the limitations of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) in identifying offensive content within systematically perturbed data, with a focus on Chinese, a language particularly susceptible to such perturbations. We introduce \textsf{ToxiCloakCN}, an enhanced dataset derived from ToxiCN, augmented with homophonic substitutions and emoji transformations, to test the robustness of LLMs against these cloaking perturbations. Our findings reveal that existing models significantly underperform in detecting offensive content when these perturbations are applied. We provide an in-depth analysis of how different types of offensive content are affected by these perturbations and explore the alignment between human and model explanations of offensiveness. Our work highlights the urgent need for more advanced techniques in offensive language detection to combat the evolving tactics used to evade detection mechanisms.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This report introduces an enhanced method for the Foundational Few-Shot Object Detection (FSOD) task, leveraging the vision-language model (VLM) for object detection. However, on specific datasets, VLM may encounter the problem where the detected targets are misaligned with the target concepts of interest. This misalignment hinders the zero-shot performance of VLM and the application of fine-tuning methods based on pseudo-labels. To address this issue, we propose the VLM+ framework, which integrates the multimodal large language model (MM-LLM). Specifically, we use MM-LLM to generate a series of referential expressions for each category. Based on the VLM predictions and the given annotations, we select the best referential expression for each category by matching the maximum IoU. Subsequently, we use these referential expressions to generate pseudo-labels for all images in the training set and then combine them with the original labeled data to fine-tune the VLM. Additionally, we employ iterative pseudo-label generation and optimization to further enhance the performance of the VLM. Our approach achieve 32.56 mAP in the final test.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Transformers excel in Natural Language Processing (NLP) due to their prowess in capturing long-term dependencies but suffer from exponential resource consumption with increasing sequence lengths. To address these challenges, we propose MCSD model, an efficient language model with linear scaling and fast inference speed. MCSD model leverages diverse feature fusion, primarily through the multi-channel slope and decay (MCSD) block, to robustly represent features. This block comprises slope and decay sections that extract features across diverse temporal receptive fields, facilitating capture of both local and global information. In addition, MCSD block conducts element-wise fusion of diverse features to further enhance the delicate feature extraction capability. For inference, we formulate the inference process into a recurrent representation, slashing space complexity to $O(1)$ and time complexity to $O(N)$ respectively. Our experiments show that MCSD attains higher throughput and lower GPU memory consumption compared to Transformers, while maintaining comparable performance to larger-scale language learning models on benchmark tests. These attributes position MCSD as a promising base for edge deployment and embodied intelligence.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Towards open-ended Video Anomaly Detection (VAD), existing methods often exhibit biased detection when faced with challenging or unseen events and lack interpretability. To address these drawbacks, we propose Holmes-VAD, a novel framework that leverages precise temporal supervision and rich multimodal instructions to enable accurate anomaly localization and comprehensive explanations. Firstly, towards unbiased and explainable VAD system, we construct the first large-scale multimodal VAD instruction-tuning benchmark, i.e., VAD-Instruct50k. This dataset is created using a carefully designed semi-automatic labeling paradigm. Efficient single-frame annotations are applied to the collected untrimmed videos, which are then synthesized into high-quality analyses of both abnormal and normal video clips using a robust off-the-shelf video captioner and a large language model (LLM). Building upon the VAD-Instruct50k dataset, we develop a customized solution for interpretable video anomaly detection. We train a lightweight temporal sampler to select frames with high anomaly response and fine-tune a multimodal large language model (LLM) to generate explanatory content. Extensive experimental results validate the generality and interpretability of the proposed Holmes-VAD, establishing it as a novel interpretable technique for real-world video anomaly analysis. To support the community, our benchmark and model will be publicly available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper introduces a novel privacy-preservation framework named PFID for LLMs that addresses critical privacy concerns by localizing user data through model sharding and singular value decomposition. When users are interacting with LLM systems, their prompts could be subject to being exposed to eavesdroppers within or outside LLM system providers who are interested in collecting users' input. In this work, we proposed a framework to camouflage user input, so as to alleviate privacy issues. Our framework proposes to place model shards on the client and the public server, we sent compressed hidden states instead of prompts to and from servers. Clients have held back information that can re-privatized the hidden states so that overall system performance is comparable to traditional LLMs services. Our framework was designed to be communication efficient, computation can be delegated to the local client so that the server's computation burden can be lightened. We conduct extensive experiments on machine translation tasks to verify our framework's performance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language and vision models (LLVMs) have been driven by the generalization power of large language models (LLMs) and the advent of visual instruction tuning. Along with scaling them up directly, these models enable LLVMs to showcase powerful vision language (VL) performances by covering diverse tasks via natural language instructions. However, existing open-source LLVMs that perform comparably to closed-source LLVMs such as GPT-4V are often considered too large (e.g., 26B, 34B, and 110B parameters), having a larger number of layers. These large models demand costly, high-end resources for both training and inference. To address this issue, we present a new efficient LLVM family with 1.8B, 3.8B, and 7B LLM model sizes, Traversal of Layers (TroL), which enables the reuse of layers in a token-wise manner. This layer traversing technique simulates the effect of looking back and retracing the answering stream while increasing the number of forward propagation layers without physically adding more layers. We demonstrate that TroL employs a simple layer traversing approach yet efficiently outperforms the open-source LLVMs with larger model sizes and rivals the performances of the closed-source LLVMs with substantial sizes.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Lifelong prompt tuning has significantly advanced parameter-efficient lifelong learning with its efficiency and minimal storage demands on various tasks. Our empirical studies, however, highlights certain transferability constraints in the current methodologies: a universal algorithm that guarantees consistent positive transfer across all tasks is currently unattainable, especially when dealing dissimilar tasks that may engender negative transfer. Identifying the misalignment between algorithm selection and task specificity as the primary cause of negative transfer, we present the Similarity Heuristic Lifelong Prompt Tuning (SHLPT) framework. This innovative strategy partitions tasks into two distinct subsets by harnessing a learnable similarity metric, thereby facilitating fruitful transfer from tasks regardless of their similarity or dissimilarity. Additionally, SHLPT incorporates a parameter pool to combat catastrophic forgetting effectively. Our experiments shows that SHLPT outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in lifelong learning benchmarks and demonstrates robustness against negative transfer in diverse task sequences.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Chain-of-Thought (CoT) holds a significant place in augmenting the reasoning performance for large language models (LLMs). While some studies focus on improving CoT accuracy through methods like retrieval enhancement, yet a rigorous explanation for why CoT achieves such success remains unclear. In this paper, we analyze CoT methods under two different settings by asking the following questions: (1) For zero-shot CoT, why does prompting the model with "let's think step by step" significantly impact its outputs? (2) For few-shot CoT, why does providing examples before questioning the model could substantially improve its reasoning ability? To answer these questions, we conduct a top-down explainable analysis from the Hopfieldian view and propose a Read-and-Control approach for controlling the accuracy of CoT. Through extensive experiments on seven datasets for three different tasks, we demonstrate that our framework can decipher the inner workings of CoT, provide reasoning error localization, and control to come up with the correct reasoning path.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper presents a novel perspective for enhancing anti-spoofing performance in zero-shot data domain generalization. Unlike traditional image classification tasks, face anti-spoofing datasets display unique generalization characteristics, necessitating novel zero-shot data domain generalization. One step forward to the previous frame-wise spoofing prediction, we introduce a nuanced metric calculation that aggregates frame-level probabilities for a video-wise prediction, to tackle the gap between the reported frame-wise accuracy and instability in real-world use-case. This approach enables the quantification of bias and variance in model predictions, offering a more refined analysis of model generalization. Our investigation reveals that simply scaling up the backbone of models does not inherently improve the mentioned instability, leading us to propose an ensembled backbone method from a Bayesian perspective. The probabilistically ensembled backbone both improves model robustness measured from the proposed metric and spoofing accuracy, and also leverages the advantages of measuring uncertainty, allowing for enhanced sampling during training that contributes to model generalization across new datasets. We evaluate the proposed method from the benchmark OMIC dataset and also the public CelebA-Spoof and SiW-Mv2. Our final model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across the datasets, showcasing advancements in Bias, Variance, HTER, and AUC metrics.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) poses challenges in detecting and mitigating digital deception, as these models can emulate human conversational patterns and facilitate chat-based social engineering (CSE) attacks. This study investigates the dual capabilities of LLMs as both facilitators and defenders against CSE threats. We develop a novel dataset, SEConvo, simulating CSE scenarios in academic and recruitment contexts, and designed to examine how LLMs can be exploited in these situations. Our findings reveal that, while off-the-shelf LLMs generate high-quality CSE content, their detection capabilities are suboptimal, leading to increased operational costs for defense. In response, we propose ConvoSentinel, a modular defense pipeline that improves detection at both the message and the conversation levels, offering enhanced adaptability and cost-effectiveness. The retrieval-augmented module in ConvoSentinel identifies malicious intent by comparing messages to a database of similar conversations, enhancing CSE detection at all stages. Our study highlights the need for advanced strategies to leverage LLMs in cybersecurity.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Implicit knowledge hidden within the explicit table cells, such as data insights, is the key to generating a high-quality table summary. However, unveiling such implicit knowledge is a non-trivial task. Due to the complex nature of structured tables, it is challenging even for large language models (LLMs) to mine the implicit knowledge in an insightful and faithful manner. To address this challenge, we propose a novel table reasoning framework Question-then-Pinpoint. Our work focuses on building a plug-and-play table reasoner that can self-question the insightful knowledge and answer it by faithfully pinpointing evidence on the table to provide explainable guidance for the summarizer. To train a reliable reasoner, we collect table knowledge by guiding a teacher LLM to follow the coarse-to-fine reasoning paths and refine it through two quality enhancement strategies to selectively distill the high-quality knowledge to the reasoner. Extensive experiments on two table summarization datasets, including our newly proposed InsTaSumm, validate the general effectiveness of our framework.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The Agriculture-Vision Challenge at CVPR 2024 aims at leveraging semantic segmentation models to produce pixel level semantic segmentation labels within regions of interest for multi-modality satellite images. It is one of the most famous and competitive challenges for global researchers to break the boundary between computer vision and agriculture sectors. However, there is a serious class imbalance problem in the agriculture-vision dataset, which hinders the semantic segmentation performance. To solve this problem, firstly, we propose a mosaic data augmentation with a rare class sampling strategy to enrich long-tail class samples. Secondly, we employ an adaptive class weight scheme to suppress the contribution of the common classes while increasing the ones of rare classes. Thirdly, we propose a probability post-process to increase the predicted value of the rare classes. Our methodology achieved a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) score of 0.547 on the test set, securing second place in this challenge.</li>

In addition, incorporating new knowledge through editing techniques to language models can further compromise safety. To address these issues, we propose SafeInfer, a context-adaptive, decoding-time safety alignment strategy for generating safe responses to user queries. SafeInfer comprises two phases: the safety amplification phase, which employs safe demonstration examples to adjust the model's hidden states and increase the likelihood of safer outputs, and the safety-guided decoding phase, which influences token selection based on safety-optimized distributions, ensuring the generated content complies with ethical guidelines. Further, we present HarmEval, a novel benchmark for extensive safety evaluations, designed to address potential misuse scenarios in accordance with the policies of leading AI tech giants.</li>

          VoCo-LLaMA: Towards Vision Compression with Large Language Models(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success in various multi-modal tasks, but they are often bottlenecked by the limited context window and high computational cost of processing high-resolution image inputs and videos. Vision compression can alleviate this problem by reducing the vision token count. Previous approaches compress vision tokens with external modules and force LLMs to understand the compressed ones, leading to visual information loss. However, the LLMs' understanding paradigm of vision tokens is not fully utilised in the compression learning process. We propose VoCo-LLaMA, the first approach to compress vision tokens using LLMs. By introducing Vision Compression tokens during the vision instruction tuning phase and leveraging attention distillation, our method distill how LLMs comprehend vision tokens into their processing of VoCo tokens. VoCo-LLaMA facilitates effective vision compression and improves the computational efficiency during the inference stage. Specifically, our method achieves minimal performance loss with a compression ratio of 576$\times$, resulting in up to 94.8$\%$ fewer FLOPs and 69.6$\%$ acceleration in inference time. Furthermore, through continuous training using time-series compressed token sequences of video frames, VoCo-LLaMA demonstrates the ability to understand temporal correlations, outperforming previous methods on popular video question-answering benchmarks. Our approach presents a promising way to unlock the full potential of VLMs' contextual window, enabling more scalable multi-modal applications.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) face issues in handling factual knowledge, making it vital to evaluate their true ability to understand facts. In this study, we introduce knowledge probing frameworks, BELIEF(-ICL), to evaluate the knowledge understanding ability of not only encoder-based PLMs but also decoder-based PLMs from diverse perspectives. BELIEFs utilize a multi-prompt dataset to evaluate PLM's accuracy, consistency, and reliability in factual knowledge understanding. To provide a more reliable evaluation with BELIEFs, we semi-automatically create MyriadLAMA, which has more diverse prompts than existing datasets. We validate the effectiveness of BELIEFs in correctly and comprehensively evaluating PLM's factual understanding ability through extensive evaluations. We further investigate key factors in learning facts in LLMs, and reveal the limitation of the prompt-based knowledge probing. The dataset is anonymously publicized.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Time series forecasting is essential for our daily activities and precise modeling of the complex correlations and shared patterns among multiple time series is essential for improving forecasting performance. Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) are widely used in multivariate time series forecasting tasks and have achieved promising performance on multiple real-world datasets for their ability to model the underlying complex spatial and temporal dependencies. However, existing studies have mainly focused on datasets comprising only a few hundred sensors due to the heavy computational cost and memory cost of spatial-temporal GNNs. When applied to larger datasets, these methods fail to capture the underlying complex spatial dependencies and exhibit limited scalability and performance. To this end, we present a Scalable Adaptive Graph Diffusion Forecasting Network (SAGDFN) to capture complex spatial-temporal correlation for large-scale multivariate time series and thereby, leading to exceptional performance in multivariate time series forecasting tasks. The proposed SAGDFN is scalable to datasets of thousands of nodes without the need of prior knowledge of spatial correlation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAGDFN achieves comparable performance with state-of-the-art baselines on one real-world dataset of 207 nodes and outperforms all state-of-the-art baselines by a significant margin on three real-world datasets of 2000 nodes.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The challenge of addressing mixed closed-set and open-set label noise in medical image classification remains largely unexplored. Unlike natural image classification where there is a common practice of segregation and separate processing of closed-set and open-set noisy samples from clean ones, medical image classification faces difficulties due to high inter-class similarity which complicates the identification of open-set noisy samples. Moreover, prevailing methods do not leverage the full potential of open-set noisy samples for label noise mitigation, often leading to their exclusion or application of uniform soft labels. To address these issues, we propose an Extended Noise-robust Contrastive and Open-set Feature Augmentation (ENCOFA) framework. ENCOFA includes the Extended Noise-robust Supervised Contrastive (ENSC) Loss, which aids in distinguishing features across classes. The ENSC loss regards open-set noisy samples as an extended class and mitigates label noise by weighting contrastive pairs with label reliability. Furthermore, we develop an Open-set Feature Augmentation (OSFeatAug) module that enriches the features of open-set samples, utilizing the model's extra capacity to prevent overfitting to noisy data. We conducted experiments on a synthetic noisy dataset and a real-world noisy dataset. Our results indicate the superiority of ENCOFA and the effectiveness of leveraging the open-set noisy samples to combat label noise.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive performance in diverse applications, yet they face significant drawbacks, including high inference latency, expensive training cost, and generation of hallucination. Collaborative decoding between large and small language models (SLMs) offers a novel approach to address these challenges. Inspired by dual-process cognitive theory, we integrate these methods into a unified framework termed Fast and Slow Generating (FS-GEN). This paper explores several techniques within the FS-GEN framework, including speculative decoding, contrastive decoding, and emulator or proxy fine-tuning. We provide a comprehensive analysis of these methodologies, offering insights into their similarities and differences under this framework. Our study delves into the differential knowledge capabilities of LLMs versus SLMs through the FS-GEN lens, revealing that fewer than 20% of collaborative interactions are required across various methods. These interactions adhere to a scaling law relative to the parameter ratios, thereby facilitating predictable collaboration. Furthermore, we investigate the specific positions where collaboration is most effective from an uncertainty perspective, yielding novel insights that could refine FS-GEN methods. Our findings reveal that the essential difference between models of different sizes lies in the uncertainty of the next token prediction, where interventions by larger models are most needed to assist the smaller ones.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) are emerging as a disruptive technology, revolutionising traditional mobile network architecture and deployments in the current 5G and the upcoming 6G era. Disaggregation of network architecture, inherent support for AI/ML workflows, cloud-native principles, scalability, and interoperability make O-RAN attractive to network providers for beyond-5G and 6G deployments. Notably, the ability to deploy custom applications, including Machine Learning (ML) solutions as xApps or rApps on the RAN Intelligent Controllers (RICs), has immense potential for network function and resource optimisation. However, the openness, nascent standards, and distributed architecture of O-RAN and RICs introduce numerous vulnerabilities exploitable through multiple attack vectors, which have not yet been fully explored. To address this gap and ensure robust systems before large-scale deployments, this work analyses the security of ML-based applications deployed on the RIC platform. We focus on potential attacks, defence mechanisms, and pave the way for future research towards a more robust RIC platform.</li>

          Immiscible Diffusion: Accelerating Diffusion Training with Noise Assignment(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we point out suboptimal noise-data mapping leads to slow training of diffusion models. During diffusion training, current methods diffuse each image across the entire noise space, resulting in a mixture of all images at every point in the noise layer. We emphasize that this random mixture of noise-data mapping complicates the optimization of the denoising function in diffusion models. Drawing inspiration from the immiscible phenomenon in physics, we propose Immiscible Diffusion, a simple and effective method to improve the random mixture of noise-data mapping. In physics, miscibility can vary according to various intermolecular forces. Thus, immiscibility means that the mixing of the molecular sources is distinguishable. Inspired by this, we propose an assignment-then-diffusion training strategy. Specifically, prior to diffusing the image data into noise, we assign diffusion target noise for the image data by minimizing the total image-noise pair distance in a mini-batch. The assignment functions analogously to external forces to separate the diffuse-able areas of images, thus mitigating the inherent difficulties in diffusion training. Our approach is remarkably simple, requiring only one line of code to restrict the diffuse-able area for each image while preserving the Gaussian distribution of noise. This ensures that each image is projected only to nearby noise. To address the high complexity of the assignment algorithm, we employ a quantized-assignment method to reduce the computational overhead to a negligible level. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieve up to 3x faster training for consistency models and DDIM on the CIFAR dataset, and up to 1.3x faster on CelebA datasets for consistency models. Besides, we conduct thorough analysis about the Immiscible Diffusion, which sheds lights on how it improves diffusion training speed while improving the fidelity.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Counter-narratives, which are direct responses consisting of non-aggressive fact-based arguments, have emerged as a highly effective approach to combat the proliferation of hate speech. Previous methodologies have primarily focused on fine-tuning and post-editing techniques to ensure the fluency of generated contents, while overlooking the critical aspects of individualization and relevance concerning the specific hatred targets, such as LGBT groups, immigrants, etc. This research paper introduces a novel framework based on contrastive optimal transport, which effectively addresses the challenges of maintaining target interaction and promoting diversification in generating counter-narratives. Firstly, an Optimal Transport Kernel (OTK) module is leveraged to incorporate hatred target information in the token representations, in which the comparison pairs are extracted between original and transported features. Secondly, a self-contrastive learning module is employed to address the issue of model degeneration. This module achieves this by generating an anisotropic distribution of token representations. Finally, a target-oriented search method is integrated as an improved decoding strategy to explicitly promote domain relevance and diversification in the inference process. This strategy modifies the model's confidence score by considering both token similarity and target relevance. Quantitative and qualitative experiments have been evaluated on two benchmark datasets, which demonstrate that our proposed model significantly outperforms current methods evaluated by metrics from multiple aspects.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advancements in integrating large language models (LLMs) with tools have allowed the models to interact with real-world environments. However, these tool-augmented LLMs often encounter incomplete scenarios when users provide partial information or the necessary tools are unavailable. Recognizing and managing such scenarios is crucial for LLMs to ensure their reliability, but this exploration remains understudied. This study examines whether LLMs can identify incomplete conditions and appropriately determine when to refrain from using tools. To this end, we address a dataset by manipulating instances from two datasets by removing necessary tools or essential information for tool invocation. We confirm that most LLMs are challenged to identify the additional information required to utilize specific tools and the absence of appropriate tools. Our research can contribute to advancing reliable LLMs by addressing scenarios that commonly arise during interactions between humans and LLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Binarization, which converts weight parameters to binary values, has emerged as an effective strategy to reduce the size of large language models (LLMs). However, typical binarization techniques significantly diminish linguistic effectiveness of LLMs. To address this issue, we introduce a novel binarization technique called Mixture of Scales (BinaryMoS). Unlike conventional methods, BinaryMoS employs multiple scaling experts for binary weights, dynamically merging these experts for each token to adaptively generate scaling factors. This token-adaptive approach boosts the representational power of binarized LLMs by enabling contextual adjustments to the values of binary weights. Moreover, because this adaptive process only involves the scaling factors rather than the entire weight matrix, BinaryMoS maintains compression efficiency similar to traditional static binarization methods. Our experimental results reveal that BinaryMoS surpasses conventional binarization techniques in various natural language processing tasks and even outperforms 2-bit quantization methods, all while maintaining similar model size to static binarization techniques.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The Visible-Infrared Person Re-identification (VI ReID) aims to match visible and infrared images of the same pedestrians across non-overlapped camera views. These two input modalities contain both invariant information, such as shape, and modality-specific details, such as color. An ideal model should utilize valuable information from both modalities during training for enhanced representational capability. However, the gap caused by modality-specific information poses substantial challenges for the VI ReID model to handle distinct modality inputs simultaneously. To address this, we introduce the Modality-aware and Instance-aware Visual Prompts (MIP) network in our work, designed to effectively utilize both invariant and specific information for identification. Specifically, our MIP model is built on the transformer architecture. In this model, we have designed a series of modality-specific prompts, which could enable our model to adapt to and make use of the specific information inherent in different modality inputs, thereby reducing the interference caused by the modality gap and achieving better identification. Besides, we also employ each pedestrian feature to construct a group of instance-specific prompts. These customized prompts are responsible for guiding our model to adapt to each pedestrian instance dynamically, thereby capturing identity-level discriminative clues for identification. Through extensive experiments on SYSU-MM01 and RegDB datasets, the effectiveness of both our designed modules is evaluated. Additionally, our proposed MIP performs better than most state-of-the-art methods.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Pairwise evaluation using large language models (LLMs) is widely used for evaluating natural language generation (NLG) tasks. However, the reliability of LLMs is often compromised by biases, such as favoring verbosity and authoritative tone. In the study, we focus on the comparison of two LLM-based evaluation approaches, pointwise and pairwise. Our findings demonstrate that pointwise evaluators exhibit more robustness against undesirable preferences. Further analysis reveals that pairwise evaluators can accurately identify the shortcomings of low-quality outputs even when their judgment is incorrect. These results indicate that LLMs are more severely influenced by their bias in a pairwise evaluation setup. To mitigate this, we propose a hybrid method that integrates pointwise reasoning into pairwise evaluation. Experimental results show that our method enhances the robustness of pairwise evaluators against adversarial samples while preserving accuracy on normal samples.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Instruction-following large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have become increasingly popular with the general audience, many of whom are incorporating them into their daily routines. However, these LLMs inadvertently disclose personal or copyrighted information, which calls for a machine unlearning method to remove selective knowledge. Previous attempts sought to forget the link between the target information and its associated entities, but it rather led to generating undesirable responses about the target, compromising the end-user experience. In this work, we propose SNAP, an innovative framework designed to selectively unlearn information by 1) training an LLM with negative instructions to generate obliterated responses, 2) augmenting hard positives to retain the original LLM performance, and 3) applying the novel Wasserstein regularization to ensure adequate deviation from the initial weights of the LLM. We evaluate our framework on various NLP benchmarks and demonstrate that our approach retains the original LLM capabilities, while successfully unlearning the specified information.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Spectrum sharing is increasingly vital in 6G wireless communication, facilitating dynamic access to unused spectrum holes. Recently, there has been a significant shift towards employing machine learning (ML) techniques for sensing spectrum holes. In this context, federated learning (FL)-enabled spectrum sensing technology has garnered wide attention, allowing for the construction of an aggregated ML model without disclosing the private spectrum sensing information of wireless user devices. However, the integrity of collaborative training and the privacy of spectrum information from local users have remained largely unexplored. This article first examines the latest developments in FL-enabled spectrum sharing for prospective 6G scenarios. It then identifies practical attack vectors in 6G to illustrate potential AI-powered security and privacy threats in these contexts. Finally, the study outlines future directions, including practical defense challenges and guidelines.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Current Large Language Models (LLMs) face inherent limitations due to their pre-defined context lengths, which impede their capacity for multi-hop reasoning within extensive textual contexts. While existing techniques like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) have attempted to bridge this gap by sourcing external information, they fall short when direct answers are not readily available. We introduce a novel approach that re-imagines information retrieval through dynamic in-context editing, inspired by recent breakthroughs in knowledge editing. By treating lengthy contexts as malleable external knowledge, our method interactively gathers and integrates relevant information, thereby enabling LLMs to perform sophisticated reasoning steps. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively empowers context-limited LLMs, such as Llama2, to engage in multi-hop reasoning with improved performance, which outperforms state-of-the-art context window extrapolation methods and even compares favorably to more advanced commercial long-context models. Our interactive method not only enhances reasoning capabilities but also mitigates the associated training and computational costs, making it a pragmatic solution for enhancing LLMs' reasoning within expansive contexts.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) changed the way we design and interact with software systems. Their ability to process and extract information from text has drastically improved productivity in a number of routine tasks. Developers that want to include these models in their software stack, however, face a dreadful challenge: debugging their inconsistent behavior across minor variations of the prompt. We therefore introduce two metrics for classification tasks, namely sensitivity and consistency, which are complementary to task performance. First, sensitivity measures changes of predictions across rephrasings of the prompt, and does not require access to ground truth labels. Instead, consistency measures how predictions vary across rephrasings for elements of the same class. We perform an empirical comparison of these metrics on text classification tasks, using them as guideline for understanding failure modes of the LLM. Our hope is that sensitivity and consistency will be powerful allies in automatic prompt engineering frameworks to obtain LLMs that balance robustness with performance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Scaling the context size of large language models (LLMs) enables them to perform various new tasks, e.g., book summarization. However, the memory cost of the Key and Value (KV) cache in attention significantly limits the practical applications of LLMs. Recent works have explored token pruning for KV cache reduction in LLMs, relying solely on attention scores as a token importance indicator. However, our investigation into value vector norms revealed a notably non-uniform pattern questioning their reliance only on attention scores. Inspired by this, we propose a new method: Value-Aware Token Pruning (VATP) which uses both attention scores and the $ \ell_{1} $ norm of value vectors to evaluate token importance. Extensive experiments on LLaMA2-7B-chat and Vicuna-v1.5-7B across 16 LongBench tasks demonstrate VATP's superior performance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Mistral and LLaMA have showcased remarkable performance across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Despite their success, these models inherit social biases from the diverse datasets on which they are trained. This paper investigates the propagation of biases within LLMs through a novel feature-based analytical approach. Drawing inspiration from causal mediation analysis, we hypothesize the evolution of bias-related features and validate them using interpretability techniques like activation and attribution patching. Our contributions are threefold: (1) We introduce and empirically validate a feature-based method for bias analysis in LLMs, applied to LLaMA-2-7B, LLaMA-3-8B, and Mistral-7B-v0.3 with templates from a professions dataset. (2) We extend our method to another form of gender bias, demonstrating its generalizability. (3) We differentiate the roles of MLPs and attention heads in bias propagation and implement targeted debiasing using a counterfactual dataset. Our findings reveal the complex nature of bias in LLMs and emphasize the necessity for tailored debiasing strategies, offering a deeper understanding of bias mechanisms and pathways for effective mitigation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Pretrained language models memorize vast amounts of information, including private and copyrighted data, raising significant safety concerns. Retraining these models after excluding sensitive data is prohibitively expensive, making machine unlearning a viable, cost-effective alternative. Previous research has focused on machine unlearning for monolingual models, but we find that unlearning in one language does not necessarily transfer to others. This vulnerability makes models susceptible to low-resource language attacks, where sensitive information remains accessible in less dominant languages. This paper presents a pioneering approach to machine unlearning for multilingual language models, selectively erasing information across different languages while maintaining overall performance. Specifically, our method employs an adaptive unlearning scheme that assigns language-dependent weights to address different language performances of multilingual language models. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework compared to existing unlearning baselines, setting a new standard for secure and adaptable multilingual language models.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Gait recognition is a biometric technology that identifies individuals by using walking patterns. Due to the significant achievements of multimodal fusion in gait recognition, we consider employing LiDAR-camera fusion to obtain robust gait representations. However, existing methods often overlook intrinsic characteristics of modalities, and lack fine-grained fusion and temporal modeling. In this paper, we introduce a novel modality-sensitive network LiCAF for LiDAR-camera fusion, which employs an asymmetric modeling strategy. Specifically, we propose Asymmetric Cross-modal Channel Attention (ACCA) and Interlaced Cross-modal Temporal Modeling (ICTM) for cross-modal valuable channel information selection and powerful temporal modeling. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance (93.9% in Rank-1 and 98.8% in Rank-5) on the SUSTech1K dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Fast adaptation to new tasks is extremely important for embodied agents in the real world. Meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) has emerged as an effective method to enable fast adaptation in unknown environments. Compared to on-policy meta-RL algorithms, off-policy algorithms rely heavily on efficient data sampling strategies to extract and represent the historical trajectories. However, little is known about how different data sampling methods impact the ability of meta-RL agents to represent unknown environments. Here, we investigate the impact of data sampling strategies on the exploration and adaptability of meta-RL agents. Specifically, we conducted experiments with two types of off-policy meta-RL algorithms based on Thompson sampling and Bayes-optimality theories in continuous control tasks within the MuJoCo environment and sparse reward navigation tasks. Our analysis revealed the long-memory and short-memory sequence sampling strategies affect the representation and adaptive capabilities of meta-RL agents. We found that the algorithm based on Bayes-optimality theory exhibited more robust and better adaptability than the algorithm based on Thompson sampling, highlighting the importance of appropriate data sampling strategies for the agent's representation of an unknown environment, especially in the case of sparse rewards.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Location-based services play an critical role in improving the quality of our daily lives. Despite the proliferation of numerous specialized AI models within spatio-temporal context of location-based services, these models struggle to autonomously tackle problems regarding complex urban planing and management. To bridge this gap, we introduce UrbanLLM, a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) designed to tackle diverse problems in urban scenarios. UrbanLLM functions as a problem-solver by decomposing urban-related queries into manageable sub-tasks, identifying suitable spatio-temporal AI models for each sub-task, and generating comprehensive responses to the given queries. Our experimental results indicate that UrbanLLM significantly outperforms other established LLMs, such as Llama and the GPT series, in handling problems concerning complex urban activity planning and management. UrbanLLM exhibits considerable potential in enhancing the effectiveness of solving problems in urban scenarios, reducing the workload and reliance for human experts.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper investigates the efficacy of jointly optimizing content-specific post-processing filters to adapt a human oriented video/image codec into a codec suitable for machine vision tasks. By observing that artifacts produced by video/image codecs are content-dependent, we propose a novel training strategy based on competitive learning principles. This strategy assigns training samples to filters dynamically, in a fuzzy manner, which further optimizes the winning filter on the given sample. Inspired by simulated annealing optimization techniques, we employ a softmax function with a temperature variable as the weight allocation function to mitigate the effects of random initialization. Our evaluation, conducted on a system utilizing multiple post-processing filters within a Versatile Video Coding (VVC) codec framework, demonstrates the superiority of content-specific filters trained with our proposed strategies, specifically, when images are processed in blocks. Using VVC reference software VTM 12.0 as the anchor, experiments on the OpenImages dataset show an improvement in the BD-rate reduction from -41.3% and -44.6% to -42.3% and -44.7% for object detection and instance segmentation tasks, respectively, compared to independently trained filters. The statistics of the filter usage align with our hypothesis and underscore the importance of jointly optimizing filters for both content and reconstruction quality. Our findings pave the way for further improving the performance of video/image codecs.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper introduces DiffMix, a new self-supervised learning (SSL) pre-training framework that combines real and synthetic images. Unlike traditional SSL methods that predominantly use real images, DiffMix uses a variant of Stable Diffusion to replace an augmented instance of a real image, facilitating the learning of cross real-synthetic image representations. The key insight is that while SSL methods trained solely on synthetic images underperform compared to those trained on real images, a blended training approach using both real and synthetic images leads to more robust and adaptable representations. Experiments demonstrate that DiffMix enhances the SSL methods SimCLR, BarlowTwins, and DINO, across various robustness datasets and domain transfer tasks. DiffMix boosts SimCLR's accuracy on ImageNet-1K by 4.56\%. These results challenge the notion that high-quality real images are crucial for SSL pre-training by showing that lower quality synthetic images can also produce strong representations. DiffMix also reduces the need for image augmentations in SSL, offering new optimization strategies.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR) focuses on the interpretation of a sequence of sign language gestures performed continually without pauses. In this study, we conduct an empirical evaluation of recent deep learning CSLR techniques and assess their performance across various datasets and sign languages. The models selected for analysis implement a range of approaches for extracting meaningful features and employ distinct training strategies. To determine their efficacy in modeling different sign languages, these models were evaluated using multiple datasets, specifically RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather-2014, ArabSign, and GrSL, each representing a unique sign language. The performance of the models was further tested with unseen signers and sentences. The conducted experiments establish new benchmarks on the selected datasets and provide valuable insights into the robustness and generalization of the evaluated techniques under challenging scenarios.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) have acquired the ability to solve general tasks by utilizing instruction finetuning (IFT). However, IFT still relies heavily on instance training of extensive task data, which greatly limits the adaptability of LLMs to real-world scenarios where labeled task instances are scarce and broader task generalization becomes paramount. Contrary to LLMs, humans acquire skills and complete tasks not merely through repeated practice but also by understanding and following instructional guidelines. This paper is dedicated to simulating human learning to address the shortcomings of instance training, focusing on instruction learning to enhance cross-task generalization. Within this context, we introduce Task Adapters Generation from Instructions (TAGI), which automatically constructs the task-specific model in a parameter generation manner based on the given task instructions without retraining for unseen tasks. Specifically, we utilize knowledge distillation to enhance the consistency between TAGI developed through Learning with Instruction and task-specific models developed through Training with Instance, by aligning the labels, output logits, and adapter parameters between them. TAGI is endowed with cross-task generalization capabilities through a two-stage training process that includes hypernetwork pretraining and finetuning. We evaluate TAGI on the Super-Natural Instructions and P3 datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that TAGI can match or even outperform traditional meta-trained models and other hypernetwork models, while significantly reducing computational requirements.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) in vertical domains, including intellectual property (IP), lacks a specific evaluation benchmark for assessing their understanding, application, and reasoning abilities. To fill this gap, we introduce IPEval, the first evaluation benchmark tailored for IP agency and consulting tasks. IPEval comprises 2657 multiple-choice questions across four major dimensions: creation, application, protection, and management of IP. These questions span patent rights (inventions, utility models, designs), trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and other related laws. Evaluation methods include zero-shot, 5-few-shot, and Chain of Thought (CoT) for seven LLM types, predominantly in English or Chinese. Results show superior English performance by models like GPT series and Qwen series, while Chinese-centric LLMs excel in Chinese tests, albeit specialized IP LLMs lag behind general-purpose ones. Regional and temporal aspects of IP underscore the need for LLMs to grasp legal nuances and evolving laws. IPEval aims to accurately gauge LLM capabilities in IP and spur development of specialized models. Website: \url{this https URL}</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Though current object detection models based on deep learning have achieved excellent results on many conventional benchmark datasets, their performance will dramatically decline on real-world images taken under extreme conditions. Existing methods either used image augmentation based on traditional image processing algorithms or applied customized and scene-limited image adaptation technologies for robust modeling. This study thus proposes a stylization data-driven neural-image-adaptive YOLO (SDNIA-YOLO), which improves the model's robustness by enhancing image quality adaptively and learning valuable information related to extreme weather conditions from images synthesized by neural style transfer (NST). Experiments show that the developed SDNIA-YOLOv3 achieves significant mAP@.5 improvements of at least 15% on the real-world foggy (RTTS) and lowlight (ExDark) test sets compared with the baseline model. Besides, the experiments also highlight the outstanding potential of stylization data in simulating extreme weather conditions. The developed SDNIA-YOLO remains excellent characteristics of the native YOLO to a great extent, such as end-to-end one-stage, data-driven, and fast.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Synthetic data has been proposed as a solution to address the issue of high-quality data scarcity in the training of large language models (LLMs). Studies have shown that synthetic data can effectively improve the performance of LLMs on downstream benchmarks. However, despite its potential benefits, our analysis suggests that there may be inherent flaws in synthetic data. The uniform format of synthetic data can lead to pattern overfitting and cause significant shifts in the output distribution, thereby reducing the model's instruction-following capabilities. Our work delves into these specific flaws associated with question-answer (Q-A) pairs, a prevalent type of synthetic data, and presents a method based on unlearning techniques to mitigate these flaws. The empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which can reverse the instruction-following issues caused by pattern overfitting without compromising performance on benchmarks at relatively low cost. Our work has yielded key insights into the effective use of synthetic data, aiming to promote more robust and efficient LLM training.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the increasing role of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in various applications, challenges concerning bias and stereotype perpetuation are accentuated, which often leads to hate speech and harm. Despite existing studies on sexism and misogyny, issues like homophobia and transphobia remain underexplored and often adopt binary perspectives, putting the safety of LGBTQIA+ individuals at high risk in online spaces. In this paper, we assess the potential harm caused by sentence completions generated by English large language models (LLMs) concerning LGBTQIA+ individuals. This is achieved using QueerBench, our new assessment framework, which employs a template-based approach and a Masked Language Modeling (MLM) task. The analysis indicates that large language models tend to exhibit discriminatory behaviour more frequently towards individuals within the LGBTQIA+ community, reaching a difference gap of 7.2% in the QueerBench score of harmfulness.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the context of real-world applications, leveraging large language models (LLMs) for domain-specific tasks often faces two major challenges: domain-specific knowledge privacy and constrained resources. To address these issues, we propose PDSS, a privacy-preserving framework for step-by-step distillation of LLMs. PDSS works on a server-client architecture, wherein client transmits perturbed prompts to the server's LLM for rationale generation. The generated rationales are then decoded by the client and used to enrich the training of task-specific small language model(SLM) within a multi-task learning paradigm. PDSS introduces two privacy protection strategies: the Exponential Mechanism Strategy and the Encoder-Decoder Strategy, balancing prompt privacy and rationale usability. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of PDSS in various text generation tasks, enabling the training of task-specific SLM with enhanced performance while prioritizing data privacy protection.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We constructed a newly large-scale and comprehensive C/C++ vulnerability dataset named MegaVul by crawling the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database and CVE-related open-source projects. Specifically, we collected all crawlable descriptive information of the vulnerabilities from the CVE database and extracted all vulnerability-related code changes from 28 Git-based websites. We adopt advanced tools to ensure the extracted code integrality and enrich the code with four different transformed representations. In total, MegaVul contains 17,380 vulnerabilities collected from 992 open-source repositories spanning 169 different vulnerability types disclosed from January 2006 to October 2023. Thus, MegaVul can be used for a variety of software security-related tasks including detecting vulnerabilities and assessing vulnerability severity. All information is stored in the JSON format for easy usage. MegaVul is publicly available on GitHub and will be continuously updated. It can be easily extended to other programming languages.</li>

          Beyond Under-Alignment: Atomic Preference Enhanced Factuality Tuning for Large Language Models(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success but still tend to generate factually erroneous responses, a phenomenon known as hallucination. A recent trend is to use preference learning to fine-tune models to align with factuality. However, existing work primarily evaluates fine-tuned models on in-domain (ID) datasets and the factuality on out-of-domain (OOD) datasets remains underexplored. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the factuality of different models tuned by various preference learning algorithms and demonstrate that their performance on OOD datasets either increases minimally or decreases. Subsequently, we reveal that the main cause of model's failure to uphold factuality under a distribution shift is \textbf{under-alignment}, rather than \textbf{over-alignment}, by analyzing the token distribution shift of the models before and after tuning. Finally, we propose \textbf{APEFT} (\textbf{A}tomic \textbf{P}reference \textbf{E}nhanced \textbf{F}actuality \textbf{T}uning), a framework that enhances model's awareness of factuality at the granularity of individual facts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that APEFT improves model performance by an average of $\boldsymbol{3.45\%}$ on both ID and OOD datasets, which is highly effective.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the advancement of multimedia technologies, news documents and user-generated content are often represented as multiple modalities, making Multimedia Event Extraction (MEE) an increasingly important challenge. However, recent MEE methods employ weak alignment strategies and data augmentation with simple classification models, which ignore the capabilities of natural language-formulated event templates for the challenging Event Argument Extraction (EAE) task. In this work, we focus on EAE and address this issue by introducing a unified template filling model that connects the textual and visual modalities via textual prompts. This approach enables the exploitation of cross-ontology transfer and the incorporation of event-specific semantics. Experiments on the M2E2 benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our system surpasses the current SOTA on textual EAE by +7% F1, and performs generally better than the second-best systems for multimedia EAE.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, diffusion, transformer, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Many of today's data is time-series data originating from various sources, such as sensors, transaction systems, or production systems. Major challenges with such data include privacy and business sensitivity. Generative time-series models have the potential to overcome these problems, allowing representative synthetic data, such as people's movement in cities, to be shared openly and be used to the benefit of society at large. However, contemporary approaches are limited to prohibitively short sequences and small scales. Aside from major memory limitations, the models generate less accurate and less representative samples the longer the sequences are. This issue is further exacerbated by the lack of a comprehensive and accessible benchmark. Furthermore, a common need in practical applications is what-if analysis and dynamic adaptation to data distribution changes, for usage in decision making and to manage a changing world: What if this road is temporarily blocked or another road is added? The focus of this paper is on mobility data, such as people's movement in cities, requiring all these issues to be addressed. To this end, we propose a transformer-based diffusion model, TDDPM, for time-series which outperforms and scales substantially better than state-of-the-art. This is evaluated in a new comprehensive benchmark across several sequence lengths, standard datasets, and evaluation measures. We also demonstrate how the model can be conditioned on a prior over spatial occupancy frequency information, allowing the model to generate mobility data for previously unseen environments and for hypothetical scenarios where the underlying road network and its usage changes. This is evaluated by training on mobility data from part of a city. Then, using only aggregate spatial information as prior, we demonstrate out-of-distribution generalization to the unobserved remainder of the city.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we conduct a study to utilize LLMs as a solution for decision making that requires complex data analysis. We define Decision QA as the task of answering the best decision, $d_{best}$, for a decision-making question $Q$, business rules $R$ and a database $D$. Since there is no benchmark that can examine Decision QA, we propose Decision QA benchmark, DQA. It has two scenarios, Locating and Building, constructed from two video games (Europa Universalis IV and Victoria 3) that have almost the same goal as Decision QA. To address Decision QA effectively, we also propose a new RAG technique called the iterative plan-then-retrieval augmented generation (PlanRAG). Our PlanRAG-based LM generates the plan for decision making as the first step, and the retriever generates the queries for data analysis as the second step. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art iterative RAG method by 15.8% in the Locating scenario and by 7.4% in the Building scenario, respectively.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Subgraph federated learning (SFL) is a research methodology that has gained significant attention for its potential to handle distributed graph-structured data. In SFL, the local model comprises graph neural networks (GNNs) with a partial graph structure. However, some SFL models have overlooked the significance of missing cross-subgraph edges, which can lead to local GNNs being unable to message-pass global representations to other parties' GNNs. Moreover, existing SFL models require substantial labeled data, which limits their practical applications. To overcome these limitations, we present a novel SFL framework called FedMpa that aims to learn cross-subgraph node representations. FedMpa first trains a multilayer perceptron (MLP) model using a small amount of data and then propagates the federated feature to the local structures. To further improve the embedding representation of nodes with local subgraphs, we introduce the FedMpae method, which reconstructs the local graph structure with an innovation view that applies pooling operation to form super-nodes. Our extensive experiments on six graph datasets demonstrate that FedMpa is highly effective in node classification. Furthermore, our ablation experiments verify the effectiveness of FedMpa.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Robot manipulation relying on learned object-centric descriptors became popular in recent years. Visual descriptors can easily describe manipulation task objectives, they can be learned efficiently using self-supervision, and they can encode actuated and even non-rigid objects. However, learning robust, view-invariant keypoints in a self-supervised approach requires a meticulous data collection approach involving precise calibration and expert supervision. In this paper we introduce Cycle-Correspondence Loss (CCL) for view-invariant dense descriptor learning, which adopts the concept of cycle-consistency, enabling a simple data collection pipeline and training on unpaired RGB camera views. The key idea is to autonomously detect valid pixel correspondences by attempting to use a prediction over a new image to predict the original pixel in the original image, while scaling error terms based on the estimated confidence. Our evaluation shows that we outperform other self-supervised RGB-only methods, and approach performance of supervised methods, both with respect to keypoint tracking as well as for a robot grasping downstream task.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Despite recent advancements in high-fidelity human reconstruction techniques, the requirements for densely captured images or time-consuming per-instance optimization significantly hinder their applications in broader scenarios. To tackle these issues, we present HumanSplat which predicts the 3D Gaussian Splatting properties of any human from a single input image in a generalizable manner. In particular, HumanSplat comprises a 2D multi-view diffusion model and a latent reconstruction transformer with human structure priors that adeptly integrate geometric priors and semantic features within a unified framework. A hierarchical loss that incorporates human semantic information is further designed to achieve high-fidelity texture modeling and better constrain the estimated multiple views. Comprehensive experiments on standard benchmarks and in-the-wild images demonstrate that HumanSplat surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in achieving photorealistic novel-view synthesis.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent years have witnessed significant advancements in light field image super-resolution (LFSR) owing to the progress of modern neural networks. However, these methods often face challenges in capturing long-range dependencies (CNN-based) or encounter quadratic computational complexities (Transformer-based), which limit their performance. Recently, the State Space Model (SSM) with selective scanning mechanism (S6), exemplified by Mamba, has emerged as a superior alternative in various vision tasks compared to traditional CNN- and Transformer-based approaches, benefiting from its effective long-range sequence modeling capability and linear-time complexity. Therefore, integrating S6 into LFSR becomes compelling, especially considering the vast data volume of 4D light fields. However, the primary challenge lies in \emph{designing an appropriate scanning method for 4D light fields that effectively models light field features}. To tackle this, we employ SSMs on the informative 2D slices of 4D LFs to fully explore spatial contextual information, complementary angular information, and structure information. To achieve this, we carefully devise a basic SSM block characterized by an efficient SS2D mechanism that facilitates more effective and efficient feature learning on these 2D slices. Based on the above two designs, we further introduce an SSM-based network for LFSR termed LFMamba. Experimental results on LF benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of LFMamba. Furthermore, extensive ablation studies are conducted to validate the efficacy and generalization ability of our proposed method. We expect that our LFMamba shed light on effective representation learning of LFs with state space models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The parametric knowledge memorized by large language models (LLMs) becomes outdated quickly. In-context editing (ICE) is currently the most effective method for updating the knowledge of LLMs. Recent advancements involve enhancing ICE by modifying the decoding strategy, obviating the need for altering internal model structures or adjusting external prompts. However, this enhancement operates across the entire sequence generation, encompassing a plethora of non-critical tokens. In this work, we introduce $\textbf{A}$daptive $\textbf{T}$oken $\textbf{Bias}$er ($\textbf{ATBias}$), a new decoding technique designed to enhance ICE. It focuses on the tokens that are mostly related to knowledge during decoding, biasing their logits by matching key entities related to new and parametric knowledge. Experimental results show that ATBias significantly enhances ICE performance, achieving up to a 32.3% improvement over state-of-the-art ICE methods while incurring only half the latency. ATBias not only improves the knowledge editing capabilities of ICE but can also be widely applied to LLMs with negligible cost.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Word embeddings represent words as multidimensional real vectors, facilitating data analysis and processing, but are often challenging to interpret. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) creates clearer semantic axes by identifying independent key features. Previous research has shown ICA's potential to reveal universal semantic axes across languages. However, it lacked verification of the consistency of independent components within and across languages. We investigated the consistency of semantic axes in two ways: both within a single language and across multiple languages. We first probed into intra-language consistency, focusing on the reproducibility of axes by performing ICA multiple times and clustering the outcomes. Then, we statistically examined inter-language consistency by verifying those axes' correspondences using statistical tests. We newly applied statistical methods to establish a robust framework that ensures the reliability and universality of semantic axes.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The remote sensing image intelligence understanding model is undergoing a new profound paradigm shift which has been promoted by multi-modal large language model (MLLM), i.e. from the paradigm learning a domain model (LaDM) shifts to paradigm learning a pre-trained general foundation model followed by an adaptive domain model (LaGD). Under the new LaGD paradigm, the old datasets, which have led to advances in RSI intelligence understanding in the last decade, are no longer suitable for fire-new tasks. We argued that a new dataset must be designed to lighten tasks with the following features: 1) Generalization: training model to learn shared knowledge among tasks and to adapt to different tasks; 2) Understanding complex scenes: training model to understand the fine-grained attribute of the objects of interest, and to be able to describe the scene with natural language; 3) Reasoning: training model to be able to realize high-level visual reasoning. In this paper, we designed a high-quality, diversified, and unified multimodal instruction-following dataset for RSI understanding produced by GPT-4V and existing datasets, which we called RS-GPT4V. To achieve generalization, we used a (Question, Answer) which was deduced from GPT-4V via instruction-following to unify the tasks such as captioning and localization; To achieve complex scene, we proposed a hierarchical instruction description with local strategy in which the fine-grained attributes of the objects and their spatial relationships are described and global strategy in which all the local information are integrated to yield detailed instruction descript; To achieve reasoning, we designed multiple-turn QA pair to provide the reasoning ability for a model. The empirical results show that the fine-tuned MLLMs by RS-GPT4V can describe fine-grained information. The dataset is available at: this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Stance detection holds great potential for enhancing the quality of online political discussions, as it has shown to be useful for summarizing discussions, detecting misinformation, and evaluating opinion distributions. Usually, transformer-based models are used directly for stance detection, which require large amounts of data. However, the broad range of debate questions in online political discussion creates a variety of possible scenarios that the model is faced with and thus makes data acquisition for model training difficult. In this work, we show how to leverage LLM-generated synthetic data to train and improve stance detection agents for online political discussions:(i) We generate synthetic data for specific debate questions by prompting a Mistral-7B model and show that fine-tuning with the generated synthetic data can substantially improve the performance of stance detection. (ii) We examine the impact of combining synthetic data with the most informative samples from an unlabelled dataset. First, we use the synthetic data to select the most informative samples, second, we combine both these samples and the synthetic data for fine-tuning. This approach reduces labelling effort and consistently surpasses the performance of the baseline model that is trained with fully labeled data. Overall, we show in comprehensive experiments that LLM-generated data greatly improves stance detection performance for online political discussions.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Open-Domain Multi-Document Summarization (ODMDS) is crucial for addressing diverse information needs, which aims to generate a summary as answer to user's query, synthesizing relevant content from multiple documents in a large collection. Existing approaches that first find relevant passages and then generate a summary using a language model are inadequate for ODMDS. This is because open-ended queries often require additional context for the retrieved passages to cover the topic comprehensively, making it challenging to retrieve all relevant passages initially. While iterative retrieval methods have been explored for multi-hop question answering (MQA), they are impractical for ODMDS due to high latency from repeated large language model (LLM) inference for reasoning. To address this issue, we propose LightPAL, a lightweight passage retrieval method for ODMDS that constructs a graph representing passage relationships using an LLM during indexing and employs random walk instead of iterative reasoning and retrieval at inference time. Experiments on ODMDS benchmarks show that LightPAL outperforms baseline retrievers in summary quality while being significantly more efficient than an iterative MQA approach.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Semantic segmentation plays a key role in applications such as autonomous driving and medical image. Although existing real-time semantic segmentation models achieve a commendable balance between accuracy and speed, their multi-path blocks still affect overall speed. To address this issue, this study proposes a Reparameterizable Dual-Resolution Network (RDRNet) dedicated to real-time semantic segmentation. Specifically, RDRNet employs a two-branch architecture, utilizing multi-path blocks during training and reparameterizing them into single-path blocks during inference, thereby enhancing both accuracy and inference speed simultaneously. Furthermore, we propose the Reparameterizable Pyramid Pooling Module (RPPM) to enhance the feature representation of the pyramid pooling module without increasing its inference time. Experimental results on the Cityscapes, CamVid, and Pascal VOC 2012 datasets demonstrate that RDRNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in terms of both performance and speed.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Code Language Models have been trained to generate accurate solutions, typically with no regard for runtime. On the other hand, previous works that explored execution optimisation have observed corresponding drops in functional correctness. To that end, we introduce Code-Optimise, a framework that incorporates both correctness (passed, failed) and runtime (quick, slow) as learning signals via self-generated preference data. Our framework is both lightweight and robust as it dynamically selects solutions to reduce overfitting while avoiding a reliance on larger models for learning signals. Code-Optimise achieves significant improvements in pass@k while decreasing the competitive baseline runtimes by an additional 6% for in-domain data and up to 3% for out-of-domain data. As a byproduct, the average length of the generated solutions is reduced by up to 48% on MBPP and 23% on HumanEval, resulting in faster and cheaper inference. The generated data and codebase will be open-sourced at www.open-source.link.</li>

          Can We Trust Large Language Models Generated Code? A Framework for In-Context Learning, Security Patterns, and Code Evaluations Across Diverse LLMs(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, security, attack, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot have revolutionized automated code generation in software engineering. However, as these models are increasingly utilized for software development, concerns have arisen regarding the security and quality of the generated code. These concerns stem from LLMs being primarily trained on publicly available code repositories and internet-based textual data, which may contain insecure code. This presents a significant risk of perpetuating vulnerabilities in the generated code, creating potential attack vectors for exploitation by malicious actors. Our research aims to tackle these issues by introducing a framework for secure behavioral learning of LLMs through In-Content Learning (ICL) patterns during the code generation process, followed by rigorous security evaluations. To achieve this, we have selected four diverse LLMs for experimentation. We have evaluated these coding LLMs across three programming languages and identified security vulnerabilities and code smells. The code is generated through ICL with curated problem sets and undergoes rigorous security testing to evaluate the overall quality and trustworthiness of the generated code. Our research indicates that ICL-driven one-shot and few-shot learning patterns can enhance code security, reducing vulnerabilities in various programming scenarios. Developers and researchers should know that LLMs have a limited understanding of security principles. This may lead to security breaches when the generated code is deployed in production systems. Our research highlights LLMs are a potential source of new vulnerabilities to the software supply chain. It is important to consider this when using LLMs for code generation. This research article offers insights into improving LLM security and encourages proactive use of LLMs for code generation to ensure software system safety.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, privacy, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated learning is a promising privacy-preserving paradigm for distributed machine learning. In this context, there is sometimes a need for a specialized process called machine unlearning, which is required when the effect of some specific training samples needs to be removed from a learning model due to privacy, security, usability, and/or legislative factors. However, problems arise when current centralized unlearning methods are applied to existing federated learning, in which the server aims to remove all information about a class from the global model. Centralized unlearning usually focuses on simple models or is premised on the ability to access all training data at a central node. However, training data cannot be accessed on the server under the federated learning paradigm, conflicting with the requirements of the centralized unlearning process. Additionally, there are high computation and communication costs associated with accessing clients' data, especially in scenarios involving numerous clients or complex global models. To address these concerns, we propose a more effective and efficient federated unlearning scheme based on the concept of model explanation. Model explanation involves understanding deep networks and individual channel importance, so that this understanding can be used to determine which model channels are critical for classes that need to be unlearned. We select the most influential channels within an already-trained model for the data that need to be unlearned and fine-tune only influential channels to remove the contribution made by those data. In this way, we can simultaneously avoid huge consumption costs and ensure that the unlearned model maintains good performance. Experiments with different training models on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the rapid development of depth sensor, more and more RGB-D videos could be obtained. Identifying the foreground in RGB-D videos is a fundamental and important task. However, the existing salient object detection (SOD) works only focus on either static RGB-D images or RGB videos, ignoring the collaborating of RGB-D and video information. In this paper, we first collect a new annotated RGB-D video SOD (ViDSOD-100) dataset, which contains 100 videos within a total of 9,362 frames, acquired from diverse natural scenes. All the frames in each video are manually annotated to a high-quality saliency annotation. Moreover, we propose a new baseline model, named attentive triple-fusion network (ATF-Net), for RGB-D video salient object detection. Our method aggregates the appearance information from an input RGB image, spatio-temporal information from an estimated motion map, and the geometry information from the depth map by devising three modality-specific branches and a multi-modality integration branch. The modality-specific branches extract the representation of different inputs, while the multi-modality integration branch combines the multi-level modality-specific features by introducing the encoder feature aggregation (MEA) modules and decoder feature aggregation (MDA) modules. The experimental findings conducted on both our newly introduced ViDSOD-100 dataset and the well-established DAVSOD dataset highlight the superior performance of the proposed ATF-Net. This performance enhancement is demonstrated both quantitatively and qualitatively, surpassing the capabilities of current state-of-the-art techniques across various domains, including RGB-D saliency detection, video saliency detection, and video object segmentation.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This work introduces Variational Diffusion Distillation (VDD), a novel method that distills denoising diffusion policies into Mixtures of Experts (MoE) through variational inference. Diffusion Models are the current state-of-the-art in generative modeling due to their exceptional ability to accurately learn and represent complex, multi-modal distributions. This ability allows Diffusion Models to replicate the inherent diversity in human behavior, making them the preferred models in behavior learning such as Learning from Human Demonstrations (LfD). However, diffusion models come with some drawbacks, including the intractability of likelihoods and long inference times due to their iterative sampling process. The inference times, in particular, pose a significant challenge to real-time applications such as robot control. In contrast, MoEs effectively address the aforementioned issues while retaining the ability to represent complex distributions but are notoriously difficult to train. VDD is the first method that distills pre-trained diffusion models into MoE models, and hence, combines the expressiveness of Diffusion Models with the benefits of Mixture Models. Specifically, VDD leverages a decompositional upper bound of the variational objective that allows the training of each expert separately, resulting in a robust optimization scheme for MoEs. VDD demonstrates across nine complex behavior learning tasks, that it is able to: i) accurately distill complex distributions learned by the diffusion model, ii) outperform existing state-of-the-art distillation methods, and iii) surpass conventional methods for training MoE.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Knights and knaves problems represent a classic genre of logical puzzles where characters either tell the truth or lie. The objective is to logically deduce each character's identity based on their statements. The challenge arises from the truth-telling or lying behavior, which influences the logical implications of each statement. Solving these puzzles requires not only direct deductions from individual statements, but the ability to assess the truthfulness of statements by reasoning through various hypothetical scenarios. As such, knights and knaves puzzles serve as compelling examples of suppositional reasoning. In this paper, we introduce $\textit{TruthQuest}$, a benchmark for suppositional reasoning based on the principles of knights and knaves puzzles. Our benchmark presents problems of varying complexity, considering both the number of characters and the types of logical statements involved. Evaluations on $\textit{TruthQuest}$ show that large language models like Llama 3 and Mixtral-8x7B exhibit significant difficulties solving these tasks. A detailed error analysis of the models' output reveals that lower-performing models exhibit a diverse range of reasoning errors, frequently failing to grasp the concept of truth and lies. In comparison, more proficient models primarily struggle with accurately inferring the logical implications of potentially false statements.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The increase in the number of phishing demands innovative solutions to safeguard users from phishing attacks. This study explores the development and utilization of a real-time browser extension integrated with machine learning model to improve the detection of phishing websites. The results showed that the model had an accuracy of 98.32%, precision of 98.62%, recall of 97.86%, and an F1-score of 98.24%. When compared to other algorithms like Support Vector Machine, Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree, XGBoost, and K Nearest Neighbor, the Random Forest algorithm stood out for its effectiveness in detecting phishing attacks. The zero-day phishing attack detection testing over a 15-day period revealed the model's capability to identify previously unseen threats and thus achieving an overall accuracy rate of 99.11%. Furthermore, the model showed better performance when compared to conventional security measures like Google Safe Browsing. The model had successfully detected phishing URLs that evaded detection by Google safe browsing. This research shows how using machine learning in real-time browser extensions can defend against phishing attacks. It gives useful information about cybersecurity and helps make the internet safer for everyone.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Personalized large language models (LLMs) have attracted great attention in many applications, such as intelligent education and emotional support. Most work focuses on controlling the character settings based on the profile (e.g., age, skill, experience, and so on). Conversely, the psychological theory-based personality traits with implicit expression and behavior are not well modeled, limiting their potential application in more specialized fields such as the psychological counseling agents. In this paper, we propose a mixture of experts (MoE)-based personalized LLMs, named P-tailor, to model the Big Five Personality Traits. Particularly, we learn specialized LoRA experts to represent various traits, such as openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism. Then, we integrate P-Tailor with a personality specialization loss, promoting experts to specialize in distinct personality traits, thereby enhancing the efficiency of model parameter utilization. Due to the lack of datasets, we also curate a high-quality personality crafting dataset (PCD) to learn and develop the ability to exhibit different personality traits across various topics. We conduct extensive experiments to verify the great performance and effectiveness of P-Tailor in manipulation of the fine-grained personality traits of LLMs.</li>

We evaluate it on the Low-Resource Machine Translation task, using the dataset from the Large-Scale Multilingual Machine Translation Shared Task (Small Track #2) and the subset of Sami languages from the multilingual benchmark for Finno-Ugric languages. In addition to its effectiveness, MeritFed is also highly interpretable, as it can be applied to track the impact of each language used for training. Our analysis reveals that target dataset size affects weight distribution across auxiliary languages, that unrelated languages do not interfere with the training, and auxiliary optimizer parameters have minimal impact. Our approach is easy to apply with a few lines of code, and we provide scripts for reproducing the experiments at this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) effectively addresses issues of static knowledge and hallucination in large language models. Existing studies mostly focus on question scenarios with clear user intents and concise answers. However, it is prevalent that users issue broad, open-ended queries with diverse sub-intents, for which they desire rich and long-form answers covering multiple relevant aspects. To tackle this important yet underexplored problem, we propose a novel RAG framework, namely RichRAG. It includes a sub-aspect explorer to identify potential sub-aspects of input questions, a multi-faceted retriever to build a candidate pool of diverse external documents related to these sub-aspects, and a generative list-wise ranker, which is a key module to provide the top-k most valuable documents for the final generator. These ranked documents sufficiently cover various query aspects and are aware of the generator's preferences, hence incentivizing it to produce rich and comprehensive responses for users. The training of our ranker involves a supervised fine-tuning stage to ensure the basic coverage of documents, and a reinforcement learning stage to align downstream LLM's preferences to the ranking of documents. Experimental results on two publicly available datasets prove that our framework effectively and efficiently provides comprehensive and satisfying responses to users.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The demand for strong cyber defence measures grows, especially in countries such as India, where the rate of digitalization far exceeds cybersecurity developments. The increasing amount of cyber threats highlights the urgent need to strengthen cyber defences. The literature review reveals significant shortcomings in India's cyber defence readiness, especially in real-time threat detection and response capabilities. Through simulation models, the study explores network security behaviours and the impact of defences on network security. The next section of this study focuses on implementing a cyber threat detection system that uses machine learning to identify and categorise cyber threats in real time, followed by strategies to integrate it into India's present infrastructure. Also, the study proposes an educational framework for training cyber professionals. The study concludes with a reflection on the implemented defence strategies. It adds to the continuing discussion about national security by providing an in-depth investigation of cyber warfare preparation and recommending a systematic method to improving through both technological and educational solutions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Massive Over-activation Yielded Uplifts(MOYU) is an inherent property of large language models, and dynamic activation(DA) based on the MOYU property is a clever yet under-explored strategy designed to accelerate inference in these models. Existing methods that utilize MOYU often face a significant 'Impossible Trinity': struggling to simultaneously maintain model performance, enhance inference speed, and extend applicability across various architectures. Due to the theoretical ambiguities surrounding MOYU, this paper elucidates the root cause of the MOYU property and outlines the mechanisms behind two primary limitations encountered by current DA methods: 1) history-related activation uncertainty, and 2) semantic-irrelevant activation inertia. Our analysis not only underscores the limitations of current dynamic activation strategies within large-scale LLaMA models but also proposes opportunities for refining the design of future sparsity schemes.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we study the problem of detecting machine-generated text when the large language model (LLM) it is possibly derived from is unknown. We do so by apply ensembling methods to the outputs from DetectGPT classifiers (Mitchell et al. 2023), a zero-shot model for machine-generated text detection which is highly accurate when the generative (or base) language model is the same as the discriminative (or scoring) language model. We find that simple summary statistics of DetectGPT sub-model outputs yield an AUROC of 0.73 (relative to 0.61) while retaining its zero-shot nature, and that supervised learning methods sharply boost the accuracy to an AUROC of 0.94 but require a training dataset. This suggests the possibility of further generalisation to create a highly-accurate, model-agnostic machine-generated text detector.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce Mathador-LM, a new benchmark for evaluating the mathematical reasoning on large language models (LLMs), combining ruleset interpretation, planning, and problem-solving. This benchmark is inspired by the Mathador game, where the objective is to reach a target number using basic arithmetic operations on a given set of base numbers, following a simple set of rules. We show that, across leading LLMs, we obtain stable average performance while generating benchmark instances dynamically, following a target difficulty level. Thus, our benchmark alleviates concerns about test-set leakage into training data, an issue that often undermines popular benchmarks. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of both open and closed-source state-of-the-art LLMs on Mathador-LM. Our findings reveal that contemporary models struggle with Mathador-LM, scoring significantly lower than average 5th graders. This stands in stark contrast to their strong performance on popular mathematical reasoning benchmarks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The training of diffusion-based models for image generation is predominantly controlled by a select few Big Tech companies, raising concerns about privacy, copyright, and data authority due to their lack of transparency regarding training data. To ad-dress this issue, we propose a federated diffusion model scheme that enables the independent and collaborative training of diffusion models without exposing local data. Our approach adapts the Federated Averaging (FedAvg) algorithm to train a Denoising Diffusion Model (DDPM). Through a novel utilization of the underlying UNet backbone, we achieve a significant reduction of up to 74% in the number of parameters exchanged during training,compared to the naive FedAvg approach, whilst simultaneously maintaining image quality comparable to the centralized setting, as evaluated by the FID score.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Ensembling multiple models has always been an effective approach to push the limits of existing performance and is widely used in classification tasks by simply averaging the classification probability vectors from multiple classifiers to achieve better accuracy. However, in the thriving open-source Large Language Model (LLM) community, ensembling methods are rare and typically limited to ensembling the full-text outputs of LLMs, such as selecting the best output using a ranker, which leads to underutilization of token-level probability information. In this paper, we treat the Generation of each token by LLMs as a Classification (GaC) for ensembling. This approach fully exploits the probability information at each generation step and better prevents LLMs from producing early incorrect tokens that lead to snowballing errors. In experiments, we ensemble state-of-the-art LLMs on several benchmarks, including exams, mathematics and reasoning, and observe that our method breaks the existing community performance ceiling. Furthermore, we observed that most of the tokens in the answer are simple and do not affect the correctness of the final answer. Therefore, we also experimented with ensembling only key tokens, and the results showed better performance with lower latency across benchmarks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Although there are many excellent solutions in image restoration, the fact that they are specifically designed for a single image restoration task may prevent them from being state-of-the-art (SOTA) in other types of image restoration tasks. While some approaches require considering multiple image restoration tasks, they are still not sufficient for the requirements of the real world and may suffer from the task confusion issue. In this work, we focus on designing a unified and effective solution for multiple image restoration tasks including deraining, desnowing, defogging, deblurring, denoising, and low-light enhancement. Based on the above purpose, we propose a Transformer network Restorer with U-Net architecture. In order to effectively deal with degraded information in multiple image restoration tasks, we need a more comprehensive attention mechanism. Thus, we design all-axis attention (AAA) through stereo embedding and 3D convolution, which can simultaneously model the long-range dependencies in both spatial and channel dimensions, capturing potential correlations among all axis. Moreover, we propose a Restorer based on textual prompts. Compared to previous methods that employ learnable queries, textual prompts bring explicit task priors to solve the task confusion issue arising from learnable queries and introduce interactivity. Based on these designs, Restorer demonstrates SOTA or comparable performance in multiple image restoration tasks compared to universal image restoration frameworks and methods specifically designed for these individual tasks. Meanwhile, Restorer is faster during inference. The above results along with the real-world test results show that Restorer has the potential to serve as a backbone for multiple real-world image restoration tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, protect, attack, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) facilitates collaborative machine learning without the need for participants to share raw private data. However, recent studies have revealed privacy risks where adversaries might reconstruct sensitive features through data leakage during the learning process. Although data reconstruction methods based on gradient or model information are somewhat effective, they reveal limitations in VFL application scenarios. This is because these traditional methods heavily rely on specific model structures and/or have strict limitations on application scenarios. To address this, our study introduces the Unified InverNet Framework into VFL, which yields a novel and flexible approach (dubbed UIFV) that leverages intermediate feature data to reconstruct original data, instead of relying on gradients or model details. The intermediate feature data is the feature exchanged by different participants during the inference phase of VFL. Experiments on four datasets demonstrate that our methods significantly outperform state-of-the-art techniques in attack precision. Our work exposes severe privacy vulnerabilities within VFL systems that pose real threats to practical VFL applications and thus confirms the necessity of further enhancing privacy protection in the VFL architecture.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we extend the study of concept ablation within pre-trained models as introduced in 'Ablating Concepts in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models' by (Kumari et al.,2022). Our work focuses on reproducing the results achieved by the different variants of concept ablation proposed and validated through predefined metrics. We also introduce a novel variant of concept ablation, namely 'trademark ablation'. This variant combines the principles of memorization and instance ablation to tackle the nuanced influence of proprietary or branded elements in model outputs. Further, our research contributions include an observational analysis of the model's limitations. Moreover, we investigate the model's behavior in response to ablation leakage-inducing prompts, which aim to indirectly ablate concepts, revealing insights into the model's resilience and adaptability. We also observe the model's performance degradation on images generated by concepts far from its target ablation concept, documented in the appendix.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>defense, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The challenge of WAD (web attack detection) is growing as hackers continuously refine their methods to evade traditional detection. Deep learning models excel in handling complex unknown attacks due to their strong generalization and adaptability. However, they are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where contextually irrelevant fragments are inserted into requests, compromising model stability. While backdoor attacks are well studied in image recognition, they are largely unexplored in WAD. This paper introduces backdoor attacks in WAD, proposing five methods and corresponding defenses. Testing on textCNN, biLSTM, and tinybert models shows an attack success rate over 87%, reducible through fine-tuning. Future research should focus on backdoor defenses in WAD.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) are still struggling in aligning with human preference in complex tasks and scenarios. They are prone to overfit into the unexpected patterns or superficial styles in the training data. We conduct an empirical study that only selects the top-10\% most updated parameters in LLMs for alignment training, and see improvements in the convergence process and final performance. It indicates the existence of redundant neurons in LLMs for alignment training. To reduce its influence, we propose a low-redundant alignment method named \textbf{ALLO}, focusing on optimizing the most related neurons with the most useful supervised signals. Concretely, we first identify the neurons that are related to the human preference data by a gradient-based strategy, then identify the alignment-related key tokens by reward models for computing loss. Besides, we also decompose the alignment process into the forgetting and learning stages, where we first forget the tokens with unaligned knowledge and then learn aligned knowledge, by updating different ratios of neurons, respectively. Experimental results on 10 datasets have shown the effectiveness of ALLO. Our code and data are available at \url{this https URL}.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion regulates a phenomenal number of natural processes and the dynamics of many successful generative models. Existing models to learn the diffusion terms from observational data rely on complex bilevel optimization problems and properly model only the drift of the system. We propose a new simple model, JKOnet*, which bypasses altogether the complexity of existing architectures while presenting significantly enhanced representational capacity: JKOnet* recovers the potential, interaction, and internal energy components of the underlying diffusion process. JKOnet* minimizes a simple quadratic loss, runs at lightspeed, and drastically outperforms other baselines in practice. Additionally, JKOnet* provides a closed-form optimal solution for linearly parametrized functionals. Our methodology is based on the interpretation of diffusion processes as energy-minimizing trajectories in the probability space via the so-called JKO scheme, which we study via its first-order optimality conditions, in light of few-weeks-old advancements in optimization in the probability space.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Interpretability and analysis (IA) research is a growing subfield within NLP with the goal of developing a deeper understanding of the behavior or inner workings of NLP systems and methods. Despite growing interest in the subfield, a commonly voiced criticism is that it lacks actionable insights and therefore has little impact on NLP. In this paper, we seek to quantify the impact of IA research on the broader field of NLP. We approach this with a mixed-methods analysis of: (1) a citation graph of 185K+ papers built from all papers published at ACL and EMNLP conferences from 2018 to 2023, and (2) a survey of 138 members of the NLP community. Our quantitative results show that IA work is well-cited outside of IA, and central in the NLP citation graph. Through qualitative analysis of survey responses and manual annotation of 556 papers, we find that NLP researchers build on findings from IA work and perceive it is important for progress in NLP, multiple subfields, and rely on its findings and terminology for their own work. Many novel methods are proposed based on IA findings and highly influenced by them, but highly influential non-IA work cites IA findings without being driven by them. We end by summarizing what is missing in IA work today and provide a call to action, to pave the way for a more impactful future of IA research.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Offering a promising solution to the scalability challenges associated with human evaluation, the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm is rapidly gaining traction as an approach to evaluating large language models (LLMs). However, there are still many open questions about the strengths and weaknesses of this paradigm, and what potential biases it may hold. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of the performance of various LLMs acting as judges. We leverage TriviaQA as a benchmark for assessing objective knowledge reasoning of LLMs and evaluate them alongside human annotations which we found to have a high inter-annotator agreement. Our study includes 9 judge models and 9 exam taker models -- both base and instruction-tuned. We assess the judge model's alignment across different model sizes, families, and judge prompts. Among other results, our research rediscovers the importance of using Cohen's kappa as a metric of alignment as opposed to simple percent agreement, showing that judges with high percent agreement can still assign vastly different scores. We find that both Llama-3 70B and GPT-4 Turbo have an excellent alignment with humans, but in terms of ranking exam taker models, they are outperformed by both JudgeLM-7B and the lexical judge Contains, which have up to 34 points lower human alignment. Through error analysis and various other studies, including the effects of instruction length and leniency bias, we hope to provide valuable lessons for using LLMs as judges in the future.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for the safe deployment of neural networks. Existing CLIP-based approaches perform OOD detection by devising novel scoring functions or sophisticated fine-tuning methods. In this work, we propose SeTAR, a novel, training-free OOD detection method that leverages selective low-rank approximation of weight matrices in vision-language and vision-only models. SeTAR enhances OOD detection via post-hoc modification of the model's weight matrices using a simple greedy search algorithm. Based on SeTAR, we further propose SeTAR+FT, a fine-tuning extension optimizing model performance for OOD detection tasks. Extensive evaluations on ImageNet1K and Pascal-VOC benchmarks show SeTAR's superior performance, reducing the false positive rate by up to 18.95% and 36.80% compared to zero-shot and fine-tuning baselines. Ablation studies further validate our approach's effectiveness, robustness, and generalizability across different model backbones. Our work offers a scalable, efficient solution for OOD detection, setting a new state-of-the-art in this area.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The evolution of large language models (LLMs) has enhanced the planning capabilities of language agents in diverse real-world scenarios. Despite these advancements, the potential of LLM-powered agents to comprehend ambiguous user instructions for reasoning and decision-making is still under exploration. In this work, we introduce a new task, Proactive Agent Planning, which requires language agents to predict clarification needs based on user-agent conversation and agent-environment interaction, invoke external tools to collect valid information, and generate a plan to fulfill the user's demands. To study this practical problem, we establish a new benchmark dataset, Ask-before-Plan. To tackle the deficiency of LLMs in proactive planning, we propose a novel multi-agent framework, Clarification-Execution-Planning (\texttt{CEP}), which consists of three agents specialized in clarification, execution, and planning. We introduce the trajectory tuning scheme for the clarification agent and static execution agent, as well as the memory recollection mechanism for the dynamic execution agent. Extensive evaluations and comprehensive analyses conducted on the Ask-before-Plan dataset validate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Data, algorithms, and arithmetic power are the three foundational conditions for deep learning to be effective in the application domain. Data is the focus for developing deep learning algorithms. In practical engineering applications, some data are affected by the conditions under which more data cannot be obtained or the cost of obtaining data is too high, resulting in smaller data sets (generally several hundred to several thousand) and data sizes that are far smaller than the size of large data sets (tens of thousands). The above two methods are based on the original dataset to generate, in the case of insufficient data volume of the original data may not reflect all the real environment, such as the real environment of the light, silhouette and other information, if the amount of data is not enough, it is difficult to use a simple transformation or neural network generative model to generate the required data. The research in this paper firstly analyses the key points of the data enhancement technology of graph neural network, and at the same time introduces the composition foundation of graph neural network in depth, on the basis of which the data enhancement technology of graph neural network is optimized and analysed.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Detecting evidence within the context is a key step in the process of reasoning task. Evaluating and enhancing the capabilities of LLMs in evidence detection will strengthen context-based reasoning performance. This paper proposes a benchmark called DetectBench for verifying the ability to detect and piece together implicit evidence within a long context. DetectBench contains 3,928 multiple-choice questions, with an average of 994 tokens per question. Each question contains an average of 4.55 pieces of implicit evidence, and solving the problem typically requires 7.62 logical jumps to find the correct answer. To enhance the performance of LLMs in evidence detection, this paper proposes Detective Reasoning Prompt and Finetune. Experiments demonstrate that the existing LLMs' abilities to detect evidence in long contexts are far inferior to humans. However, the Detective Reasoning Prompt effectively enhances the capability of powerful LLMs in evidence detection, while the Finetuning method shows significant effects in enhancing the performance of weaker LLMs. Moreover, when the abilities of LLMs in evidence detection are improved, their final reasoning performance is also enhanced accordingly.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Assessing the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in addressing diverse tasks is essential for comprehending their strengths and weaknesses. Conventional evaluation techniques typically apply a single prompting strategy uniformly across datasets, not considering the varying degrees of task complexity. We introduce the Hierarchical Prompting Taxonomy (HPT), a taxonomy that employs a Hierarchical Prompt Framework (HPF) composed of five unique prompting strategies, arranged from the simplest to the most complex, to assess LLMs more precisely and to offer a clearer perspective. This taxonomy assigns a score, called the Hierarchical Prompting Score (HP-Score), to datasets as well as LLMs based on the rules of the taxonomy, providing a nuanced understanding of their ability to solve diverse tasks and offering a universal measure of task complexity. Additionally, we introduce the Adaptive Hierarchical Prompt framework, which automates the selection of appropriate prompting strategies for each task. This study compares manual and adaptive hierarchical prompt frameworks using four instruction-tuned LLMs, namely Llama 3 8B, Phi 3 3.8B, Mistral 7B, and Gemma 7B, across four datasets: BoolQ, CommonSenseQA (CSQA), IWSLT-2017 en-fr (IWSLT), and SamSum. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of HPT, providing a reliable way to compare different tasks and LLM capabilities. This paper leads to the development of a universal evaluation metric that can be used to evaluate both the complexity of the datasets and the capabilities of LLMs. The implementation of both manual HPF and adaptive HPF is publicly available.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>An important factor when it comes to generating fact-checking explanations is the selection of evidence: intuitively, high-quality explanations can only be generated given the right evidence. In this work, we investigate the impact of human-curated vs. machine-selected evidence for explanation generation using large language models. To assess the quality of explanations, we focus on transparency (whether an explanation cites sources properly) and utility (whether an explanation is helpful in clarifying a claim). Surprisingly, we found that large language models generate similar or higher quality explanations using machine-selected evidence, suggesting carefully curated evidence (by humans) may not be necessary. That said, even with the best model, the generated explanations are not always faithful to the sources, suggesting further room for improvement in explanation generation for fact-checking.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vision transformers (ViTs) have emerged as a significant area of focus, particularly for their capacity to be jointly trained with large language models and to serve as robust vision foundation models. Yet, the development of trustworthy explanation methods for ViTs has lagged, particularly in the context of post-hoc interpretations of ViT predictions. Existing sub-image selection approaches, such as feature-attribution and conceptual models, fall short in this regard. This paper proposes five desiderata for explaining ViTs -- faithfulness, stability, sparsity, multi-level structure, and parsimony -- and demonstrates the inadequacy of current methods in meeting these criteria comprehensively. We introduce a variational Bayesian explanation framework, dubbed ProbAbilistic Concept Explainers (PACE), which models the distributions of patch embeddings to provide trustworthy post-hoc conceptual explanations. Our qualitative analysis reveals the distributions of patch-level concepts, elucidating the effectiveness of ViTs by modeling the joint distribution of patch embeddings and ViT's predictions. Moreover, these patch-level explanations bridge the gap between image-level and dataset-level explanations, thus completing the multi-level structure of PACE. Through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that PACE surpasses state-of-the-art methods in terms of the defined desiderata.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated Learning (FL) enables multiple machines to collaboratively train a machine learning model without sharing of private training data. Yet, especially for heterogeneous models, a key bottleneck remains the transfer of knowledge gained from each client model with the server. One popular method, FedDF, uses distillation to tackle this task with the use of a common, shared dataset on which predictions are exchanged. However, in many contexts such a dataset might be difficult to acquire due to privacy and the clients might not allow for storage of a large shared dataset. To this end, in this paper, we introduce a new method that improves this knowledge distillation method to only rely on a single shared image between clients and server. In particular, we propose a novel adaptive dataset pruning algorithm that selects the most informative crops generated from only a single image. With this, we show that federated learning with distillation under a limited shared dataset budget works better by using a single image compared to multiple individual ones. Finally, we extend our approach to allow for training heterogeneous client architectures by incorporating a non-uniform distillation schedule and client-model mirroring on the server side.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rise of unifying frameworks that enable seamless interoperability of Large Language Models (LLMs) has made LLM-LLM collaboration for open-ended tasks a possibility. Despite this, there have not been efforts to explore such collaborative writing. We take the next step beyond human-LLM collaboration to explore this multi-LLM scenario by generating the first exclusively LLM-generated collaborative stories dataset called CollabStory. We focus on single-author ($N=1$) to multi-author (up to $N=5$) scenarios, where multiple LLMs co-author stories. We generate over 32k stories using open-source instruction-tuned LLMs. Further, we take inspiration from the PAN tasks that have set the standard for human-human multi-author writing tasks and analysis. We extend their authorship-related tasks for multi-LLM settings and present baselines for LLM-LLM collaboration. We find that current baselines are not able to handle this emerging scenario. Thus, CollabStory is a resource that could help propel an understanding as well as the development of techniques to discern the use of multiple LLMs. This is crucial to study in the context of writing tasks since LLM-LLM collaboration could potentially overwhelm ongoing challenges related to plagiarism detection, credit assignment, maintaining academic integrity in educational settings, and addressing copyright infringement concerns.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair, diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in discriminative and generative pretraining have yielded geometry estimation models with strong generalization capabilities. While discriminative monocular geometry estimation methods rely on large-scale fine-tuning data to achieve zero-shot generalization, several generative-based paradigms show the potential of achieving impressive generalization performance on unseen scenes by leveraging pre-trained diffusion models and fine-tuning on even a small scale of synthetic training data. Frustratingly, these models are trained with different recipes on different datasets, making it hard to find out the critical factors that determine the evaluation performance. Besides, current geometry evaluation benchmarks have two main drawbacks that may prevent the development of the field, i.e., limited scene diversity and unfavorable label quality. To resolve the above issues, (1) we build fair and strong baselines in a unified codebase for evaluating and analyzing the geometry estimation models; (2) we evaluate monocular geometry estimators on more challenging benchmarks for geometry estimation task with diverse scenes and high-quality annotations. Our results reveal that pre-trained using large data, discriminative models such as DINOv2, can outperform generative counterparts with a small amount of high-quality synthetic data under the same training configuration, which suggests that fine-tuning data quality is a more important factor than the data scale and model architecture. Our observation also raises a question: if simply fine-tuning a general vision model such as DINOv2 using a small amount of synthetic depth data produces SOTA results, do we really need complex generative models for depth estimation? We believe this work can propel advancements in geometry estimation tasks as well as a wide range of downstream applications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>To evaluate knowledge in large language models (LLMs), current methods query the model and then evaluate its generated responses. In this work, we ask whether evaluation can be done $\textit{before}$ the model has generated any text. Concretely, is it possible to estimate how knowledgeable a model is about a certain entity, only from its internal computation? We study this question with two tasks: given a subject entity, the goal is to predict (a) the ability of the model to answer common questions about the entity, and (b) the factuality of responses generated by the model about the entity. Experiments with a variety of LLMs show that KEEN, a simple probe trained over internal subject representations, succeeds at both tasks - strongly correlating with both the QA accuracy of the model per-subject and FActScore, a recent factuality metric in open-ended generation. Moreover, KEEN naturally aligns with the model's hedging behavior and faithfully reflects changes in the model's knowledge after fine-tuning. Lastly, we show a more interpretable yet equally performant variant of KEEN, which highlights a small set of tokens that correlates with the model's lack of knowledge. Being simple and lightweight, KEEN can be leveraged to identify gaps and clusters of entity knowledge in LLMs, and guide decisions such as augmenting queries with retrieval.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used in educational and learning applications. Research has demonstrated that controlling for style, to fit the needs of the learner, fosters increased understanding, promotes inclusion, and helps with knowledge distillation. To understand the capabilities and limitations of contemporary LLMs in style control, we evaluated five state-of-the-art models: GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4o, Llama-3, and Mistral-instruct- 7B across two style control tasks. We observed significant inconsistencies in the first task, with model performances averaging between 5th and 8th grade reading levels for tasks intended for first-graders, and standard deviations up to 27.6. For our second task, we observed a statistically significant improvement in performance from 0.02 to 0.26. However, we find that even without stereotypes in reference texts, LLMs often generated culturally insensitive content during their tasks. We provide a thorough analysis and discussion of the results.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Evaluations of creative stories generated by large language models (LLMs) often focus on objective properties of the text, such as its style, coherence, and toxicity. While these metrics are indispensable, they do not speak to a story's subjective, psychological impact from a reader's perspective. We introduce the Psychological Depth Scale (PDS), a novel framework rooted in literary theory that measures an LLM's ability to produce authentic and narratively complex stories that provoke emotion, empathy, and engagement. We empirically validate our framework by showing that humans can consistently evaluate stories based on PDS (0.72 Krippendorff's alpha). We also explore techniques for automating the PDS to easily scale future analyses. GPT-4o, combined with a novel Mixture-of-Personas (MoP) prompting strategy, achieves an average Spearman correlation of $0.51$ with human judgment while Llama-3-70B scores as high as 0.68 for empathy. Finally, we compared the depth of stories authored by both humans and LLMs. Surprisingly, GPT-4 stories either surpassed or were statistically indistinguishable from highly-rated human-written stories sourced from Reddit. By shifting the focus from text to reader, the Psychological Depth Scale is a validated, automated, and systematic means of measuring the capacity of LLMs to connect with humans through the stories they tell.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Self-correction in text-to-SQL is the process of prompting large language model (LLM) to revise its previously incorrectly generated SQL, and commonly relies on manually crafted self-correction guidelines by human experts that are not only labor-intensive to produce but also limited by the human ability in identifying all potential error patterns in LLM responses. We introduce MAGIC, a novel multi-agent method that automates the creation of the self-correction guideline. MAGIC uses three specialized agents: a manager, a correction, and a feedback agent. These agents collaborate on the failures of an LLM-based method on the training set to iteratively generate and refine a self-correction guideline tailored to LLM mistakes, mirroring human processes but without human involvement. Our extensive experiments show that MAGIC's guideline outperforms expert human's created ones. We empirically find out that the guideline produced by MAGIC enhance the interpretability of the corrections made, providing insights in analyzing the reason behind the failures and successes of LLMs in self-correction. We make all agent interactions publicly available to the research community, to foster further research in this area, offering a synthetic dataset for future explorations into automatic self-correction guideline generation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Traffic forecasting is crucial for smart cities and intelligent transportation initiatives, where deep learning has made significant progress in modeling complex spatio-temporal patterns in recent years. However, current public datasets have limitations in reflecting the ultra-dynamic nature of real-world scenarios, characterized by continuously evolving infrastructures, varying temporal distributions, and temporal gaps due to sensor downtimes or changes in traffic patterns. These limitations inevitably restrict the practical applicability of existing traffic forecasting datasets. To bridge this gap, we present XXLTraffic, the largest available public traffic dataset with the longest timespan and increasing number of sensor nodes over the multiple years observed in the data, curated to support research in ultra-dynamic forecasting. Our benchmark includes both typical time-series forecasting settings with hourly and daily aggregated data and novel configurations that introduce gaps and down-sample the training size to better simulate practical constraints. We anticipate the new XXLTraffic will provide a fresh perspective for the time-series and traffic forecasting communities. It would also offer a robust platform for developing and evaluating models designed to tackle ultra-dynamic and extremely long forecasting problems. Our dataset supplements existing spatio-temporal data resources and leads to new research directions in this domain.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Self-portraits captured from a short distance might look unnatural or even unattractive due to heavy distortions making facial features malformed, and ill-placed head poses. In this paper, we propose SUPER, a novel method of eliminating distortions and adjusting head pose in a close-up face crop. We perform 3D GAN inversion for a facial image by optimizing camera parameters and face latent code, which gives a generated image. Besides, we estimate depth from the obtained latent code, create a depth-induced 3D mesh, and render it with updated camera parameters to obtain a warped portrait. Finally, we apply the visibility-based blending so that visible regions are reprojected, and occluded parts are restored with a generative model. Experiments on face undistortion benchmarks and on our self-collected Head Rotation dataset (HeRo), show that SUPER outperforms previous approaches both qualitatively and quantitatively, opening new possibilities for photorealistic selfie editing.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Model (LLM)-enhanced agents become increasingly prevalent in Human-AI communication, offering vast potential from entertainment to professional domains. However, current multi-modal dialogue systems overlook the acoustic information present in speech, which is crucial for understanding human communication nuances. This oversight can lead to misinterpretations of speakers' intentions, resulting in inconsistent or even contradictory responses within dialogues. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose PerceptiveAgent, an empathetic multi-modal dialogue system designed to discern deeper or more subtle meanings beyond the literal interpretations of words through the integration of speech modality perception. Employing LLMs as a cognitive core, PerceptiveAgent perceives acoustic information from input speech and generates empathetic responses based on speaking styles described in natural language. Experimental results indicate that PerceptiveAgent excels in contextual understanding by accurately discerning the speakers' true intentions in scenarios where the linguistic meaning is either contrary to or inconsistent with the speaker's true feelings, producing more nuanced and expressive spoken dialogues.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Peer review is fundamental to the integrity and advancement of scientific publication. Traditional methods of peer review analyses often rely on exploration and statistics of existing peer review data, which do not adequately address the multivariate nature of the process, account for the latent variables, and are further constrained by privacy concerns due to the sensitive nature of the data. We introduce AgentReview, the first large language model (LLM) based peer review simulation framework, which effectively disentangles the impacts of multiple latent factors and addresses the privacy issue. Our study reveals significant insights, including a notable 37.1% variation in paper decisions due to reviewers' biases, supported by sociological theories such as the social influence theory, altruism fatigue, and authority bias. We believe that this study could offer valuable insights to improve the design of peer review mechanisms.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper is the first attempt at providing a holistic view of the Chrome Web Store (CWS). We leverage historical data provided by ChromeStats to study global trends in the CWS and security implications. We first highlight the extremely short life cycles of extensions: roughly 60% of extensions stay in the CWS for one year. Second, we define and show that Security-Noteworthy Extensions (SNE) are a significant issue: they pervade the CWS for years and affect almost 350 million users. Third, we identify clusters of extensions with a similar code base. We discuss how code similarity techniques could be used to flag suspicious extensions. By developing an approach to extract URLs from extensions' comments, we show that extensions reuse code snippets from public repositories or forums, leading to the propagation of dated code and vulnerabilities. Finally, we underline a critical lack of maintenance in the CWS: 60% of the extensions in the CWS have never been updated; half of the extensions known to be vulnerable are still in the CWS and still vulnerable 2 years after disclosure; a third of extensions use vulnerable library versions. We believe that these issues should be widely known in order to pave the way for a more secure CWS.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Collaborative perception has garnered considerable attention due to its capacity to address several inherent challenges in single-agent perception, including occlusion and out-of-range issues. However, existing collaborative perception systems heavily rely on precise localization systems to establish a consistent spatial coordinate system between agents. This reliance makes them susceptible to large pose errors or malicious attacks, resulting in substantial reductions in perception performance. To address this, we propose~$\mathtt{CoBEVGlue}$, a novel self-localized collaborative perception system, which achieves more holistic and robust collaboration without using an external localization system. The core of~$\mathtt{CoBEVGlue}$ is a novel spatial alignment module, which provides the relative poses between agents by effectively matching co-visible objects across agents. We validate our method on both real-world and simulated datasets. The results show that i) $\mathtt{CoBEVGlue}$ achieves state-of-the-art detection performance under arbitrary localization noises and attacks; and ii) the spatial alignment module can seamlessly integrate with a majority of previous methods, enhancing their performance by an average of $57.7\%$.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Despite their great success across various multimodal tasks, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are facing a prevalent problem with object hallucinations, where the generated textual responses are inconsistent with ground-truth objects in the given image. This paper investigates various LVLMs and pinpoints attention deficiency toward discriminative local image features as one root cause of object hallucinations. Specifically, LVLMs predominantly attend to prompt-independent global image features, while failing to capture prompt-relevant local features, consequently undermining the visual grounding capacity of LVLMs and leading to hallucinations. To this end, we propose Assembly of Global and Local Attention (AGLA), a training-free and plug-and-play approach that mitigates object hallucinations by exploring an ensemble of global features for response generation and local features for visual discrimination simultaneously. Our approach exhibits an image-prompt matching scheme that captures prompt-relevant local features from images, leading to an augmented view of the input image where prompt-relevant content is reserved while irrelevant distractions are masked. With the augmented view, a calibrated decoding distribution can be derived by integrating generative global features from the original image and discriminative local features from the augmented image. Extensive experiments show that AGLA consistently mitigates object hallucinations and enhances general perception capability for LVLMs across various discriminative and generative benchmarks.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs), originally shown to ace various text comprehension tasks have also remarkably been shown to tackle table comprehension tasks without specific training. While previous research has explored LLM capabilities with tabular dataset tasks, our study assesses the influence of $\textit{in-context learning}$,$ \textit{model scale}$, $\textit{instruction tuning}$, and $\textit{domain biases}$ on Tabular Question Answering (TQA). We evaluate the robustness of LLMs on Wikipedia-based $\textbf{WTQ}$ and financial report-based $\textbf{TAT-QA}$ TQA datasets, focusing on their ability to robustly interpret tabular data under various augmentations and perturbations. Our findings indicate that instructions significantly enhance performance, with recent models like Llama3 exhibiting greater robustness over earlier versions. However, data contamination and practical reliability issues persist, especially with WTQ. We highlight the need for improved methodologies, including structure-aware self-attention mechanisms and better handling of domain-specific tabular data, to develop more reliable LLMs for table comprehension.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Historical linguists have long written a kind of incompletely formalized ''program'' that converts reconstructed words in an ancestor language into words in one of its attested descendants that consist of a series of ordered string rewrite functions (called sound laws). They do this by observing pairs of words in the reconstructed language (protoforms) and the descendent language (reflexes) and constructing a program that transforms protoforms into reflexes. However, writing these programs is error-prone and time-consuming. Prior work has successfully scaffolded this process computationally, but fewer researchers have tackled Sound Law Induction (SLI), which we approach in this paper by casting it as Programming by Examples. We propose a language-agnostic solution that utilizes the programming ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) by generating Python sound law programs from sound change examples. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach for various LLMs, propose effective methods to generate additional language-agnostic synthetic data to fine-tune LLMs for SLI, and compare our method with existing automated SLI methods showing that while LLMs lag behind them they can complement some of their weaknesses.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The Privacy-sensitive Object Identification (POI) task allocates bounding boxes for privacy-sensitive objects in a scene. The key to POI is settling an object's privacy class (privacy-sensitive or non-privacy-sensitive). In contrast to conventional object classes which are determined by the visual appearance of an object, one object's privacy class is derived from the scene contexts and is subject to various implicit factors beyond its visual appearance. That is, visually similar objects may be totally opposite in their privacy classes. To explicitly derive the objects' privacy class from the scene contexts, in this paper, we interpret the POI task as a visual reasoning task aimed at the privacy of each object in the scene. Following this interpretation, we propose the PrivacyGuard framework for POI. PrivacyGuard contains three stages. i) Structuring: an unstructured image is first converted into a structured, heterogeneous scene graph that embeds rich scene contexts. ii) Data Augmentation: a contextual perturbation oversampling strategy is proposed to create slightly perturbed privacy-sensitive objects in a scene graph, thereby balancing the skewed distribution of privacy classes. iii) Hybrid Graph Generation & Reasoning: the balanced, heterogeneous scene graph is then transformed into a hybrid graph by endowing it with extra "node-node" and "edge-edge" homogeneous paths. These homogeneous paths allow direct message passing between nodes or edges, thereby accelerating reasoning and facilitating the capturing of subtle context changes. Based on this hybrid graph... **For the full abstract, see the original paper.**</li>

          Large Language Model as a Universal Clinical Multi-task Decoder(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The development of effective machine learning methodologies for enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of clinical systems is crucial. Despite significant research efforts, managing a plethora of diversified clinical tasks and adapting to emerging new tasks remain significant challenges. This paper presents a novel paradigm that employs a pre-trained large language model as a universal clinical multi-task decoder. This approach leverages the flexibility and diversity of language expressions to handle task topic variations and associated arguments. The introduction of a new task simply requires the addition of a new instruction template. We validate this framework across hundreds of tasks, demonstrating its robustness in facilitating multi-task predictions, performing on par with traditional multi-task learning and single-task learning approaches. Moreover, it shows exceptional adaptability to new tasks, with impressive zero-shot performance in some instances and superior data efficiency in few-shot scenarios. This novel approach offers a unified solution to manage a wide array of new and emerging tasks in clinical applications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly broadened the scope of applications in natural language processing, with multi-modal LLMs extending these capabilities to integrate and interpret visual data. However, existing benchmarks for visual language models (VLMs) predominantly focus on single-image inputs, neglecting the crucial aspect of multi-image understanding. In this paper, we introduce a Multi-Image Relational Benchmark MIRB, designed to evaluate VLMs' ability to compare, analyze, and reason across multiple images. Our benchmark encompasses four categories: perception, visual world knowledge, reasoning, and multi-hop reasoning. Through a comprehensive evaluation of a wide range of open-source and closed-source models, we demonstrate that while open-source VLMs were shown to approach the performance of GPT-4V in single-image tasks, a significant performance gap remains in multi-image reasoning tasks. Our findings also reveal that even the state-of-the-art GPT-4V model struggles with our benchmark, underscoring the need for further research and development in this area. We believe our contribution of MIRB could serve as a testbed for developing the next-generation multi-modal models.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Effective imputation is a crucial preprocessing step for time series analysis. Despite the development of numerous deep learning algorithms for time series imputation, the community lacks standardized and comprehensive benchmark platforms to effectively evaluate imputation performance across different settings. Moreover, although many deep learning forecasting algorithms have demonstrated excellent performance, whether their modeling achievements can be transferred to time series imputation tasks remains unexplored. To bridge these gaps, we develop TSI-Bench, the first (to our knowledge) comprehensive benchmark suite for time series imputation utilizing deep learning techniques. The TSI-Bench pipeline standardizes experimental settings to enable fair evaluation of imputation algorithms and identification of meaningful insights into the influence of domain-appropriate missingness ratios and patterns on model performance. Furthermore, TSI-Bench innovatively provides a systematic paradigm to tailor time series forecasting algorithms for imputation purposes. Our extensive study across 34,804 experiments, 28 algorithms, and 8 datasets with diverse missingness scenarios demonstrates TSI-Bench's effectiveness in diverse downstream tasks and potential to unlock future directions in time series imputation research and analysis.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) are being employed as mainstream models for generative artificial intelligence (AI), the study of their memorization of the raw training data has attracted growing attention. Existing works in this direction aim to establish an understanding of whether or to what extent DPMs learn by memorization. Such an understanding is crucial for identifying potential risks of data leakage and copyright infringement in diffusion models and, more importantly, for more controllable generation and trustworthy application of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC). While previous works have made important observations of when DPMs are prone to memorization, these findings are mostly empirical, and the developed data extraction methods only work for conditional diffusion models. In this work, we aim to establish a theoretical understanding of memorization in DPMs with 1) a memorization metric for theoretical analysis, 2) an analysis of conditional memorization with informative and random labels, and 3) two better evaluation metrics for measuring memorization. Based on the theoretical analysis, we further propose a novel data extraction method called \textbf{Surrogate condItional Data Extraction (SIDE)} that leverages a classifier trained on generated data as a surrogate condition to extract training data directly from unconditional diffusion models. Our empirical results demonstrate that SIDE can extract training data from diffusion models where previous methods fail, and it is on average over 50\% more effective across different scales of the CelebA dataset.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The evolution of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been significantly accelerated by advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), gradually showcasing potential cognitive reasoning abilities in problem-solving and scientific discovery (i.e., AI4Science) once exclusive to human intellect. To comprehensively evaluate current models' performance in cognitive reasoning abilities, we introduce OlympicArena, which includes 11,163 bilingual problems across both text-only and interleaved text-image modalities. These challenges encompass a wide range of disciplines spanning seven fields and 62 international Olympic competitions, rigorously examined for data leakage. We argue that the challenges in Olympic competition problems are ideal for evaluating AI's cognitive reasoning due to their complexity and interdisciplinary nature, which are essential for tackling complex scientific challenges and facilitating discoveries. Beyond evaluating performance across various disciplines using answer-only criteria, we conduct detailed experiments and analyses from multiple perspectives. We delve into the models' cognitive reasoning abilities, their performance across different modalities, and their outcomes in process-level evaluations, which are vital for tasks requiring complex reasoning with lengthy solutions. Our extensive evaluations reveal that even advanced models like GPT-4o only achieve a 39.97% overall accuracy, illustrating current AI limitations in complex reasoning and multimodal integration. Through the OlympicArena, we aim to advance AI towards superintelligence, equipping it to address more complex challenges in science and beyond. We also provide a comprehensive set of resources to support AI research, including a benchmark dataset, an open-source annotation platform, a detailed evaluation tool, and a leaderboard with automatic submission features.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Machine Learning (ML) for Mineral Prospectivity Mapping (MPM) remains a challenging problem as it requires the analysis of associations between large-scale multi-modal geospatial data and few historical mineral commodity observations (positive labels). Recent MPM works have explored Deep Learning (DL) as a modeling tool with more representation capacity. However, these overparameterized methods may be more prone to overfitting due to their reliance on scarce labeled data. While a large quantity of unlabeled geospatial data exists, no prior MPM works have considered using such information in a self-supervised manner. Our MPM approach uses a masked image modeling framework to pretrain a backbone neural network in a self-supervised manner using unlabeled geospatial data alone. After pretraining, the backbone network provides feature extraction for downstream MPM tasks. We evaluated our approach alongside existing methods to assess mineral prospectivity of Mississippi Valley Type (MVT) and Clastic-Dominated (CD) Lead-Zinc deposits in North America and Australia. Our results demonstrate that self-supervision promotes robustness in learned features, improving prospectivity predictions. Additionally, we leverage explainable artificial intelligence techniques to demonstrate that individual predictions can be interpreted from a geological perspective.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has found application in Human Activity Recognition (HAR) in competitive sports. To date, most Machine Learning (ML) approaches for HAR have relied on offline (batch) training, imposing higher computational and tagging burdens compared to online processing unsupervised approaches. Additionally, the decisions behind traditional ML predictors are opaque and require human interpretation. In this work, we apply an online processing unsupervised clustering approach based on low-cost wearable Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs). The outcomes generated by the system allow for the automatic expansion of limited tagging available (e.g., by referees) within those clusters, producing pertinent information for the explainable classification stage. Specifically, our work focuses on achieving automatic explainability for predictions related to athletes' activities, distinguishing between correct, incorrect, and cheating practices in Nordic Walking. The proposed solution achieved performance metrics of close to 100 % on average.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, transformer, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) can solve complex multi-step problems, but little is known about how these computations are implemented internally. Motivated by this, we study how LLMs answer multi-hop queries such as "The spouse of the performer of Imagine is". These queries require two information extraction steps: a latent one for resolving the first hop ("the performer of Imagine") into the bridge entity (John Lennon), and one for resolving the second hop ("the spouse of John Lennon") into the target entity (Yoko Ono). Understanding how the latent step is computed internally is key to understanding the overall computation. By carefully analyzing the internal computations of transformer-based LLMs, we discover that the bridge entity is resolved in the early layers of the model. Then, only after this resolution, the two-hop query is solved in the later layers. Because the second hop commences in later layers, there could be cases where these layers no longer encode the necessary knowledge for correctly predicting the answer. Motivated by this, we propose a novel "back-patching" analysis method whereby a hidden representation from a later layer is patched back to an earlier layer. We find that in up to 57% of previously incorrect cases there exists a back-patch that results in the correct generation of the answer, showing that the later layers indeed sometimes lack the needed functionality. Overall our methods and findings open further opportunities for understanding and improving latent reasoning in transformer-based LLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has shown promising practical results. However, their low interpretability often leads to errors in unforeseen circumstances, limiting their utility. Many works have focused on creating comprehensive evaluation systems, but previous benchmarks have primarily assessed problem-solving abilities while neglecting the response's uncertainty, which may result in unreliability. Recent methods for measuring LLM reliability are resource-intensive and unable to test black-box models. To address this, we propose UBENCH, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLM reliability. UBENCH includes 3,978 multiple-choice questions covering knowledge, language, understanding, and reasoning abilities. Experimental results show that UBENCH has achieved state-of-the-art performance, while its single-sampling method significantly saves computational resources compared to baseline methods that require multiple samplings. Additionally, based on UBENCH, we evaluate the reliability of 15 popular LLMs, finding GLM4 to be the most outstanding, closely followed by GPT-4. We also explore the impact of Chain-of-Thought prompts, role-playing prompts, option order, and temperature on LLM reliability, analyzing the varying effects on different LLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce ChatGLM, an evolving family of large language models that we have been developing over time. This report primarily focuses on the GLM-4 language series, which includes GLM-4, GLM-4-Air, and GLM-4-9B. They represent our most capable models that are trained with all the insights and lessons gained from the preceding three generations of ChatGLM. To date, the GLM-4 models are pre-trained on ten trillions of tokens mostly in Chinese and English, along with a small set of corpus from 24 languages, and aligned primarily for Chinese and English usage. The high-quality alignment is achieved via a multi-stage post-training process, which involves supervised fine-tuning and learning from human feedback. Evaluations show that GLM-4 1) closely rivals or outperforms GPT-4 in terms of general metrics such as MMLU, GSM8K, MATH, BBH, GPQA, and HumanEval, 2) gets close to GPT-4-Turbo in instruction following as measured by IFEval, 3) matches GPT-4 Turbo (128K) and Claude 3 for long context tasks, and 4) outperforms GPT-4 in Chinese alignments as measured by AlignBench. The GLM-4 All Tools model is further aligned to understand user intent and autonomously decide when and which tool(s) touse -- including web browser, Python interpreter, text-to-image model, and user-defined functions -- to effectively complete complex tasks. In practical applications, it matches and even surpasses GPT-4 All Tools in tasks like accessing online information via web browsing and solving math problems using Python interpreter. Over the course, we have open-sourced a series of models, including ChatGLM-6B (three generations), GLM-4-9B (128K, 1M), GLM-4V-9B, WebGLM, and CodeGeeX, attracting over 10 million downloads on Hugging face in the year 2023 alone.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we explore the feasibility of leveraging large language models (LLMs) to automate or otherwise assist human raters with identifying harmful content including hate speech, harassment, violent extremism, and election misinformation. Using a dataset of 50,000 comments, we demonstrate that LLMs can achieve 90% accuracy when compared to human verdicts. We explore how to best leverage these capabilities, proposing five design patterns that integrate LLMs with human rating, such as pre-filtering non-violative content, detecting potential errors in human rating, or surfacing critical context to support human rating. We outline how to support all of these design patterns using a single, optimized prompt. Beyond these synthetic experiments, we share how piloting our proposed techniques in a real-world review queue yielded a 41.5% improvement in optimizing available human rater capacity, and a 9--11% increase (absolute) in precision and recall for detecting violative content.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Despite the high-quality results of text-to-image generation, stereotypical biases have been spotted in their generated contents, compromising the fairness of generative models. In this work, we propose to learn adaptive inclusive tokens to shift the attribute distribution of the final generative outputs. Unlike existing de-biasing approaches, our method requires neither explicit attribute specification nor prior knowledge of the bias distribution. Specifically, the core of our method is a lightweight adaptive mapping network, which can customize the inclusive tokens for the concepts to be de-biased, making the tokens generalizable to unseen concepts regardless of their original bias distributions. This is achieved by tuning the adaptive mapping network with a handful of balanced and inclusive samples using an anchor loss. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms previous bias mitigation methods without attribute specification while preserving the alignment between generative results and text descriptions. Moreover, our method achieves comparable performance to models that require specific attributes or editing directions for generation. Extensive experiments showcase the effectiveness of our adaptive inclusive tokens in mitigating stereotypical bias in text-to-image generation. The code will be available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities, but still suffer from inconsistency issues (e.g. LLMs can react differently to disturbances like rephrasing or inconsequential order change). In addition to these inconsistencies, we also observe that LLMs, while capable of solving hard problems, can paradoxically fail at easier ones. To evaluate this hard-to-easy inconsistency, we develop the ConsisEval benchmark, where each entry comprises a pair of questions with a strict order of difficulty. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of consistency score to quantitatively measure this inconsistency and analyze the potential for improvement in consistency by relative consistency score. Based on comprehensive experiments across a variety of existing models, we find: (1) GPT-4 achieves the highest consistency score of 92.2\% but is still inconsistent to specific questions due to distraction by redundant information, misinterpretation of questions, etc.; (2) models with stronger capabilities typically exhibit higher consistency, but exceptions also exist; (3) hard data enhances consistency for both fine-tuning and in-context learning.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>defense, attack, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vision-enabled language models (VLMs) are now used to build autonomous multimodal agents capable of taking actions in real environments. In this paper, we show that multimodal agents raise new safety risks, even though attacking agents is more challenging than prior attacks due to limited access to and knowledge about the environment. Our attacks use adversarial text strings to guide gradient-based perturbation over one trigger image in the environment: (1) our captioner attack attacks white-box captioners if they are used to process images into captions as additional inputs to the VLM; (2) our CLIP attack attacks a set of CLIP models jointly, which can transfer to proprietary VLMs. To evaluate the attacks, we curated VisualWebArena-Adv, a set of adversarial tasks based on VisualWebArena, an environment for web-based multimodal agent tasks. Within an L-infinity norm of $16/256$ on a single image, the captioner attack can make a captioner-augmented GPT-4V agent execute the adversarial goals with a 75% success rate. When we remove the captioner or use GPT-4V to generate its own captions, the CLIP attack can achieve success rates of 21% and 43%, respectively. Experiments on agents based on other VLMs, such as Gemini-1.5, Claude-3, and GPT-4o, show interesting differences in their robustness. Further analysis reveals several key factors contributing to the attack's success, and we also discuss the implications for defenses as well.

Various computer vision tasks like image classification, object detection, and image segmentation are poised to become routine in clinical analysis. However, privacy concerns surrounding patient data hinder the assembly of large training datasets needed for developing and training accurate, robust, and generalizable models. Federated Learning (FL) emerges as a compelling solution, enabling organizations to collaborate on ML model training by sharing model training information (gradients) rather than data (e.g., medical images). FL's distributed learning framework facilitates inter-institutional collaboration while preserving patient privacy. However, FL, while robust in privacy preservation, faces several challenges. Sensitive information can still be gleaned from shared gradients that are passed on between organizations during model training. Additionally, in medical imaging, quantifying model confidence\uncertainty accurately is crucial due to the noise and artifacts present in the data. Uncertainty estimation in FL encounters unique hurdles due to data heterogeneity across organizations. This paper offers a comprehensive review of FL, privacy preservation, and uncertainty estimation, with a focus on medical imaging. Alongside a survey of current research, we identify gaps in the field and suggest future directions for FL research to enhance privacy and address noisy medical imaging data challenges.</li>

          Neural Approximate Mirror Maps for Constrained Diffusion Models(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models excel at creating visually-convincing images, but they often struggle to meet subtle constraints inherent in the training data. Such constraints could be physics-based (e.g., satisfying a PDE), geometric (e.g., respecting symmetry), or semantic (e.g., including a particular number of objects). When the training data all satisfy a certain constraint, enforcing this constraint on a diffusion model not only improves its distribution-matching accuracy but also makes it more reliable for generating valid synthetic data and solving constrained inverse problems. However, existing methods for constrained diffusion models are inflexible with different types of constraints. Recent work proposed to learn mirror diffusion models (MDMs) in an unconstrained space defined by a mirror map and to impose the constraint with an inverse mirror map, but analytical mirror maps are challenging to derive for complex constraints. We propose neural approximate mirror maps (NAMMs) for general constraints. Our approach only requires a differentiable distance function from the constraint set. We learn an approximate mirror map that pushes data into an unconstrained space and a corresponding approximate inverse that maps data back to the constraint set. A generative model, such as an MDM, can then be trained in the learned mirror space and its samples restored to the constraint set by the inverse map. We validate our approach on a variety of constraints, showing that compared to an unconstrained diffusion model, a NAMM-based MDM substantially improves constraint satisfaction. We also demonstrate how existing diffusion-based inverse-problem solvers can be easily applied in the learned mirror space to solve constrained inverse problems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models, particularly multilingual ones, are designed, claimed, and expected to cater to native speakers of varied languages. We hypothesise that the current practices of fine-tuning and evaluating these models may mismatch this intention owing to a heavy reliance on translation, which can introduce translation artefacts and defects. It remains unknown whether the nature of the instruction data has an impact on the model output; on the other hand, it remains questionable whether translated test sets can capture such nuances. Due to the often coupled practices of using translated data in both stages, such imperfections could have been overlooked. This work investigates these issues by using controlled native or translated data during instruction tuning and evaluation stages and observing model results. Experiments on eight base models and eight different benchmarks reveal that native or generation benchmarks display a notable difference between native and translated instruction data especially when model performance is high, whereas other types of test sets cannot. Finally, we demonstrate that regularization is beneficial to bridging this gap on structured but not generative tasks.</li>

          LaMDA: Large Model Fine-Tuning via Spectrally Decomposed Low-Dimensional Adaptation(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has become the default approach to fine-tune large language models (LLMs) due to its significant reduction in trainable parameters. However, trainable parameter demand for LoRA increases with increasing model embedding dimensions, leading to high compute costs. Additionally, its backward updates require storing high-dimensional intermediate activations and optimizer states, demanding high peak GPU memory. In this paper, we introduce large model fine-tuning via spectrally decomposed low-dimensional adaptation (LaMDA), a novel approach to fine-tuning large language models, which leverages low-dimensional adaptation to achieve significant reductions in trainable parameters and peak GPU memory footprint. LaMDA freezes a first projection matrix (PMA) in the adaptation path while introducing a low-dimensional trainable square matrix, resulting in substantial reductions in trainable parameters and peak GPU memory usage. LaMDA gradually freezes a second projection matrix (PMB) during the early fine-tuning stages, reducing the compute cost associated with weight updates to enhance parameter efficiency further. We also present an enhancement, LaMDA++, incorporating a ``lite-weight" adaptive rank allocation for the LoRA path via normalized spectrum analysis of pre-trained model weights. We evaluate LaMDA/LaMDA++ across various tasks, including natural language understanding with the GLUE benchmark, text summarization, natural language generation, and complex reasoning on different LLMs. Results show that LaMDA matches or surpasses the performance of existing alternatives while requiring up to 17.7x fewer parameter updates and up to 1.32x lower peak GPU memory usage during fine-tuning. Code will be publicly available.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment the object referred to by the query sentence throughout the entire video. Most existing methods require end-to-end training with dense mask annotations, which could be computation-consuming and less scalable. In this work, we aim to efficiently adapt foundation segmentation models for addressing RVOS from weak supervision with the proposed Grounded Prompting (GroPrompt) framework. More specifically, we propose Text-Aware Prompt Contrastive Learning (TAP-CL) to enhance the association between the position prompts and the referring sentences with only box supervisions, including Text-Contrastive Prompt Learning (TextCon) and Modality-Contrastive Prompt Learning (ModalCon) at frame level and video level, respectively. With the proposed TAP-CL, our GroPrompt framework can generate temporal-consistent yet text-aware position prompts describing locations and movements for the referred object from the video. The experimental results in the standard RVOS benchmarks (Ref-YouTube-VOS, Ref-DAVIS17, A2D-Sentences, and JHMDB-Sentences) demonstrate the competitive performance of our proposed GroPrompt framework given only bounding box weak supervisions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We consider a ubiquitous scenario in the study of Influence Maximization (IM), in which there is limited knowledge about the topology of the diffusion network. We set the IM problem in a multi-round diffusion campaign, aiming to maximize the number of distinct users that are influenced. Leveraging the capability of bandit algorithms to effectively balance the objectives of exploration and exploitation, as well as the expressivity of neural networks, our study explores the application of neural bandit algorithms to the IM problem. We propose the framework IM-GNB (Influence Maximization with Graph Neural Bandits), where we provide an estimate of the users' probabilities of being influenced by influencers (also known as diffusion seeds). This initial estimate forms the basis for constructing both an exploitation graph and an exploration one. Subsequently, IM-GNB handles the exploration-exploitation tradeoff, by selecting seed nodes in real-time using Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), in which the pre-estimated graphs are employed to refine the influencers' estimated rewards in each contextual setting. Through extensive experiments on two large real-world datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of IM-GNB compared with other baseline methods, significantly improving the spread outcome of such diffusion campaigns, when the underlying network is unknown.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Most existing theoretical investigations of the accuracy of diffusion models, albeit significant, assume the score function has been approximated to a certain accuracy, and then use this a priori bound to control the error of generation. This article instead provides a first quantitative understanding of the whole generation process, i.e., both training and sampling. More precisely, it conducts a non-asymptotic convergence analysis of denoising score matching under gradient descent. In addition, a refined sampling error analysis for variance exploding models is also provided. The combination of these two results yields a full error analysis, which elucidates (again, but this time theoretically) how to design the training and sampling processes for effective generation. For instance, our theory implies a preference toward noise distribution and loss weighting that qualitatively agree with the ones used in [Karras et al. 2022]. It also provides some perspectives on why the time and variance schedule used in [Karras et al. 2022] could be better tuned than the pioneering version in [Song et al. 2020].</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In symmetric cryptography, maximum distance separable (MDS) matrices with computationally simple inverses have wide applications. Many block ciphers like AES, SQUARE, SHARK, and hash functions like PHOTON use an MDS matrix in the diffusion layer. In this article, we first characterize all $3 \times 3$ irreducible semi-involutory matrices over the finite field of characteristic $2$. Using this matrix characterization, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition to construct MDS semi-involutory matrices using only their diagonal entries and the entries of an associated diagonal matrix. Finally, we count the number of $3 \times 3$ semi-involutory MDS matrices over any finite field of characteristic $2$.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Prior work found that superhuman Go AIs like KataGo can be defeated by simple adversarial strategies. In this paper, we study if simple defenses can improve KataGo's worst-case performance. We test three natural defenses: adversarial training on hand-constructed positions, iterated adversarial training, and changing the network architecture. We find that some of these defenses are able to protect against previously discovered attacks. Unfortunately, we also find that none of these defenses are able to withstand adaptive attacks. In particular, we are able to train new adversaries that reliably defeat our defended agents by causing them to blunder in ways humans would not. Our results suggest that building robust AI systems is challenging even in narrow domains such as Go. For interactive examples of attacks and a link to our codebase, see this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, federate, transformer, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The recent development of Foundation Models (FMs), represented by large language models, vision transformers, and multimodal models, has been making a significant impact on both academia and industry. Compared with small-scale models, FMs have a much stronger demand for high-volume data during the pre-training phase. Although general FMs can be pre-trained on data collected from open sources such as the Internet, domain-specific FMs need proprietary data, posing a practical challenge regarding the amount of data available due to privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL) is a collaborative learning paradigm that breaks the barrier of data availability from different participants. Therefore, it provides a promising solution to customize and adapt FMs to a wide range of domain-specific tasks using distributed datasets whilst preserving privacy. This survey paper discusses the potentials and challenges of synergizing FL and FMs and summarizes core techniques, future directions, and applications.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as the primary method for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. The RLHF process typically starts by training a reward model (RM) using human preference data. Conventional RMs are trained on pairwise responses to the same user request, with relative ratings indicating which response humans prefer. The trained RM serves as a proxy for human preferences. However, due to the black-box nature of RMs, their outputs lack interpretability, as humans cannot intuitively understand why an RM thinks a response is good or not. As RMs act as human preference proxies, we believe they should be human-interpretable to ensure that their internal decision processes are consistent with human preferences and to prevent reward hacking in LLM alignment. To build RMs with interpretable preferences, we propose a two-stage approach: i) train an Absolute-Rating Multi-Objective Reward Model (ArmoRM) with multi-dimensional absolute-rating data, each dimension corresponding to a human-interpretable objective (e.g., honesty, verbosity, safety); ii) employ a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) strategy with a gating network that automatically selects the most suitable reward objectives based on the context. We efficiently trained an ArmoRM with Llama-3 8B and a gating network consisting of a shallow MLP on top of the ArmoRM. Our trained model, ArmoRM-Llama3-8B, obtains state-of-the-art performance on RewardBench, a benchmark evaluating RMs for language modeling. Notably, the performance of our model surpasses the LLM-as-a-judge method with GPT-4 judges by a margin, and approaches the performance of the much larger Nemotron-4 340B reward model.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Existing methods for long video understanding primarily focus on videos only lasting tens of seconds, with limited exploration of techniques for handling longer videos. The increased number of frames in longer videos presents two main challenges: difficulty in locating key information and performing long-range reasoning. Thus, we propose DrVideo, a document-retrieval-based system designed for long video understanding. Our key idea is to convert the long-video understanding problem into a long-document understanding task so as to effectively leverage the power of large language models. Specifically, DrVideo transforms a long video into a text-based long document to initially retrieve key frames and augment the information of these frames, which is used this as the system's starting point. It then employs an agent-based iterative loop to continuously search for missing information, augment relevant data, and provide final predictions in a chain-of-thought manner once sufficient question-related information is gathered. Extensive experiments on long video benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of our method. DrVideo outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods with +3.8 accuracy on EgoSchema benchmark (3 minutes), +17.9 in MovieChat-1K break mode, +38.0 in MovieChat-1K global mode (10 minutes), and +30.2 on the LLama-Vid QA dataset (over 60 minutes).</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Change detection in remote sensing images is essential for tracking environmental changes on the Earth's surface. Despite the success of vision transformers (ViTs) as backbones in numerous computer vision applications, they remain underutilized in change detection, where convolutional neural networks (CNNs) continue to dominate due to their powerful feature extraction capabilities. In this paper, our study uncovers ViTs' unique advantage in discerning large-scale changes, a capability where CNNs fall short. Capitalizing on this insight, we introduce ChangeViT, a framework that adopts a plain ViT backbone to enhance the performance of large-scale changes. This framework is supplemented by a detail-capture module that generates detailed spatial features and a feature injector that efficiently integrates fine-grained spatial information into high-level semantic learning. The feature integration ensures that ChangeViT excels in both detecting large-scale changes and capturing fine-grained details, providing comprehensive change detection across diverse scales. Without bells and whistles, ChangeViT achieves state-of-the-art performance on three popular high-resolution datasets (i.e., LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, and CLCD) and one low-resolution dataset (i.e., OSCD), which underscores the unleashed potential of plain ViTs for change detection. Furthermore, thorough quantitative and qualitative analyses validate the efficacy of the introduced modules, solidifying the effectiveness of our approach.
