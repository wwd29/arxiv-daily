<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability, explainability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Network alignment (NA) identifies corresponding nodes across multiple networks, with applications in domains like social networks, co-authorship, and biology. Despite advances in alignment models, their interpretability remains limited, making it difficult to understand alignment decisions and posing challenges in building trust, particularly in high-stakes domains. To address this, we introduce NAEx, a plug-and-play, model-agnostic framework that explains alignment models by identifying key subgraphs and features influencing predictions. NAEx addresses the key challenge of preserving the joint cross-network dependencies on alignment decisions by: (1) jointly parameterizing graph structures and feature spaces through learnable edge and feature masks, and (2) introducing an optimization objective that ensures explanations are both faithful to the original predictions and enable meaningful comparisons of structural and feature-based similarities between networks. NAEx is an inductive framework that efficiently generates NA explanations for previously unseen data. We introduce evaluation metrics tailored to alignment explainability and demonstrate NAEx's effectiveness and efficiency on benchmark datasets by integrating it with four representative NA models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text-to-Image (T2I) generation has made significant advancements with diffusion models, yet challenges persist in handling complex instructions, ensuring fine-grained content control, and maintaining deep semantic consistency. Existing T2I models often struggle with tasks like accurate text rendering, precise pose generation, or intricate compositional coherence. Concurrently, Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated powerful capabilities in cross-modal understanding and instruction following. We propose LumiGen, a novel LVLM-enhanced iterative framework designed to elevate T2I model performance, particularly in areas requiring fine-grained control, through a closed-loop, LVLM-driven feedback mechanism. LumiGen comprises an Intelligent Prompt Parsing & Augmentation (IPPA) module for proactive prompt enhancement and an Iterative Visual Feedback & Refinement (IVFR) module, which acts as a "visual critic" to iteratively correct and optimize generated images. Evaluated on the challenging LongBench-T2I Benchmark, LumiGen achieves a superior average score of 3.08, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, our framework demonstrates significant improvements in critical dimensions such as text rendering and pose expression, validating the effectiveness of LVLM integration for more controllable and higher-quality image generation.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as powerful tools for high-quality content generation, yet their intensive computational requirements for inference pose challenges for resource-constrained edge devices. Cloud-based solutions aid in computation but often fall short in addressing privacy risks, personalization efficiency, and communication costs in multi-user edge-AIGC scenarios. To bridge this gap, we first analyze existing edge-AIGC applications in personalized content synthesis, revealing their limitations in efficiency and scalability. We then propose a novel cluster-aware hierarchical federated aggregation framework. Based on parameter-efficient local fine-tuning via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), the framework first clusters clients based on the similarity of their uploaded task requirements, followed by an intra-cluster aggregation for enhanced personalization at the server-side. Subsequently, an inter-cluster knowledge interaction paradigm is implemented to enable hybrid-style content generation across diverse this http URL upon federated learning (FL) collaboration, our framework simultaneously trains personalized models for individual users at the devices and a shared global model enhanced with multiple LoRA adapters on the server,enabling efficient edge inference; meanwhile, all prompts for clustering and inference are encoded prior to transmission, thereby further mitigating the risk of plaintext leakage. Our evaluations demonstrate that the framework achieves accelerated convergence while maintaining practical viability for scalable multi-user personalized AIGC services under edge constraints.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in assisting molecular property prediction tasks but often rely on human-crafted prompts and chain-of-thought templates. While recent advanced large reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 employ reinforcement learning for an extended ``thinking'' process, their reasoning can be verbose and lack relevance. We introduce AttriLens-Mol, an attribute-guided reinforcement learning framework for molecular property prediction with LLMs. AttriLens-Mol steers the model's reasoning by using: (1) a format reward encouraging attribute-based structured output, (2) a count reward to avoid enumerating irrelevant attributes, and (3) a rationality reward using advanced LLMs and RDKit to verify the relatedness of the generated attributes. This approach implicitly elicits the model's inherent knowledge of relevant molecular attributes during reasoning, enables making predictions for the molecular property more effectively. Experiments on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets show that, training both 7B-size R1-Distilled-Qwen2.5 and R1-Distilled-LLaMA3.1 models on 4,000 samples with our proposed AttriLens-Mol method significantly boosts the performance, getting comparable or better results than supervised fine-tuning models (Mol-Instructions, ChemDFM, etc.) and advanced models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, DeepSeek-R1, etc.). Further, our extracted attributes for the target property, when used as features for an interpretable decision tree model, yield superior performance compared to attributes generated by prompting LLMs. This shows that AttriLens-Mol effectively elicits more relevant and predictive molecular attributes, leading to enhanced interpretability and performance for property prediction.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In real-world applications, multimodal time series data often suffer from interference, especially in the textual modality. Existing methods for multimodal time series forecasting often neglect the inherent perturbations within textual data, where irrelevant, noisy, or ambiguous content can significantly degrade model performance, particularly when the noise exhibits varying intensity or stems from structural inconsistencies. To address this challenge, we propose PA-RNet (Perturbation-Aware Reasoning Network for Multimodal Time Series Forecasting), a robust multimodal forecasting framework. PA-RNet features a perturbation-aware projection module and a cross-modal attention mechanism to effectively separate noise from the textual embeddings while maintaining semantically meaningful representations, thereby enhancing the model's generalization ability. Theoretically, we establish the Lipschitz continuity of PA-RNet with respect to textual inputs and prove that the proposed perturbation module can reduce expected prediction error, offering strong guarantees of stability under noisy conditions. Furthermore, we introduce a textual perturbation pipeline that can be seamlessly incorporated into existing multimodal time series forecasting tasks, allowing for systematic evaluation of the model's robustness in the presence of varying levels of textual noise. Extensive experiments across diverse domains and temporal settings demonstrate that PA-RNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Reinforcement learning (RL)-based dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs) hold promise for automating complex clinical decision-making, yet their practical deployment remains hindered by the intensive engineering required to inject clinical knowledge and ensure patient safety. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) suggest a complementary approach, where implicit prior knowledge and clinical heuristics are naturally embedded through linguistic prompts without requiring environment-specific training. In this study, we rigorously evaluate open-source LLMs as dynamic insulin dosing agents in an in silico Type 1 diabetes simulator, comparing their zero-shot inference performance against small neural network-based RL agents (SRAs) explicitly trained for the task. Our results indicate that carefully designed zero-shot prompts enable smaller LLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B) to achieve comparable or superior clinical performance relative to extensively trained SRAs, particularly in stable patient cohorts. However, LLMs exhibit notable limitations, such as overly aggressive insulin dosing when prompted with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, highlighting critical failure modes including arithmetic hallucination, temporal misinterpretation, and inconsistent clinical logic. Incorporating explicit reasoning about latent clinical states (e.g., meals) yielded minimal performance gains, underscoring the current model's limitations in capturing complex, hidden physiological dynamics solely through textual inference. Our findings advocate for cautious yet optimistic integration of LLMs into clinical workflows, emphasising the necessity of targeted prompt engineering, careful validation, and potentially hybrid approaches that combine linguistic reasoning with structured physiological modelling to achieve safe, robust, and clinically effective decision-support systems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, protect, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The increasing emphasis on privacy in recommendation systems has led to the adoption of Federated Learning (FL) as a privacy-preserving solution, enabling collaborative training without sharing user data. While Federated Recommendation (FedRec) effectively protects privacy, existing methods struggle with non-stationary data streams, failing to maintain consistent recommendation quality over time. On the other hand, Continual Learning Recommendation (CLRec) methods address evolving user preferences but typically assume centralized data access, making them incompatible with FL constraints. To bridge this gap, we introduce Federated Continual Recommendation (FCRec), a novel task that integrates FedRec and CLRec, requiring models to learn from streaming data while preserving privacy. As a solution, we propose F3CRec, a framework designed to balance knowledge retention and adaptation under the strict constraints of FCRec. F3CRec introduces two key components: Adaptive Replay Memory on the client side, which selectively retains past preferences based on user-specific shifts, and Item-wise Temporal Mean on the server side, which integrates new knowledge while preserving prior information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that F3CRec outperforms existing approaches in maintaining recommendation quality over time in a federated environment.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In dialogue transcription pipelines, Large Language Models (LLMs) are frequently employed in post-processing to improve grammar, punctuation, and readability. We explore a complementary post-processing step: enriching transcribed dialogues by adding metadata tags for speaker characteristics such as age, gender, and emotion. Some of the tags are global to the entire dialogue, while some are time-variant. Our approach couples frozen audio foundation models, such as Whisper or WavLM, with a frozen LLAMA language model to infer these speaker attributes, without requiring task-specific fine-tuning of either model. Using lightweight, efficient connectors to bridge audio and language representations, we achieve competitive performance on speaker profiling tasks while preserving modularity and speed. Additionally, we demonstrate that a frozen LLAMA model can compare x-vectors directly, achieving an Equal Error Rate of 8.8% in some scenarios.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Tokenization is the first -- and often least scrutinized -- step of most NLP pipelines. Standard algorithms for learning tokenizers rely on frequency-based objectives, which favor languages dominant in the training data and consequently leave lower-resource languages with tokenizations that are disproportionately longer, morphologically implausible, or even riddled with <UNK> placeholders. This phenomenon ultimately amplifies computational and financial inequalities between users from different language backgrounds. To remedy this, we introduce Parity-aware Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), a variant of the widely-used BPE algorithm. At every merge step, Parity-aware BPE maximizes the compression gain of the currently worst-compressed language, trading a small amount of global compression for cross-lingual parity. We find empirically that Parity-aware BPE leads to more equitable token counts across languages, with negligible impact on global compression rate and no substantial effect on language-model performance in downstream tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Order dispatch systems play a vital role in ride-hailing services, which directly influence operator revenue, driver profit, and passenger experience. Most existing work focuses on improving system efficiency in terms of operator revenue, which may cause a bad experience for both passengers and drivers. Hence, in this work, we aim to design a human-centered ride-hailing system by considering both passenger fairness and driver preference without compromising the overall system efficiency. However, it is nontrivial to achieve this target due to the potential conflicts between passenger fairness and driver preference since optimizing one may sacrifice the other. To address this challenge, we design HCRide, a Human-Centered Ride-hailing system based on a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm called Harmonization-oriented Actor-Bi-Critic (Habic), which includes three major components (i.e., a multi-agent competition mechanism, a dynamic Actor network, and a Bi-Critic network) to optimize system efficiency and passenger fairness with driver preference consideration. We extensively evaluate our HCRide using two real-world ride-hailing datasets from Shenzhen and New York City. Experimental results show our HCRide effectively improves system efficiency by 2.02%, fairness by 5.39%, and driver preference by 10.21% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Numerous self-supervised learning paradigms, such as contrastive learning and masked image modeling, learn powerful representations from unlabeled data but are typically pretrained in isolation, overlooking complementary insights and yielding large models that are impractical for resource-constrained deployment. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Consensus-oriented Masked Distillation (CoMAD), a lightweight, parameter-free framework that unifies knowledge from multiple current state-of-the-art self-supervised Vision Transformers into a compact student network. CoMAD distills from three pretrained ViT-Base teachers, MAE, MoCo v3, and iBOT, each offering distinct semantic and contextual priors. Rather than naively averaging teacher outputs, we apply asymmetric masking: the student sees only 25 percent of patches while each teacher receives a progressively lighter, unique mask, forcing the student to interpolate missing features under richer contexts. Teacher embeddings are aligned to the student's space via a linear adapter and layer normalization, then fused through our joint consensus gating, which weights each token by combining cosine affinity with inter-teacher agreement. The student is trained with dual-level KL divergence on visible tokens and reconstructed feature maps, capturing both local and global structure. On ImageNet-1K, CoMAD's ViT-Tiny achieves 75.4 percent Top-1, an increment of 0.4 percent over the previous state-of-the-art. In dense-prediction transfers, it attains 47.3 percent mIoU on ADE20K, and 44.5 percent box average precision and 40.5 percent mask average precision on MS-COCO, establishing a new state-of-the-art in compact SSL distillation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative models have demonstrated significant success in anomaly detection and segmentation over the past decade. Recently, diffusion models have emerged as a powerful alternative, outperforming previous approaches such as GANs and VAEs. In typical diffusion-based anomaly detection, a model is trained on normal data, and during inference, anomalous images are perturbed to a predefined intermediate step in the forward diffusion process. The corresponding normal image is then reconstructed through iterative reverse sampling. However, reconstruction-based approaches present three major challenges: (1) the reconstruction process is computationally expensive due to multiple sampling steps, making real-time applications impractical; (2) for complex or subtle patterns, the reconstructed image may correspond to a different normal pattern rather than the original input; and (3) Choosing an appropriate intermediate noise level is challenging because it is application-dependent and often assumes prior knowledge of anomalies, an assumption that does not hold in unsupervised settings. We introduce Reconstruction-free Anomaly Detection with Attention-based diffusion models in Real-time (RADAR), which overcomes the limitations of reconstruction-based anomaly detection. Unlike current SOTA methods that reconstruct the input image, RADAR directly produces anomaly maps from the diffusion model, improving both detection accuracy and computational efficiency. We evaluate RADAR on real-world 3D-printed material and the MVTec-AD dataset. Our approach surpasses state-of-the-art diffusion-based and statistical machine learning models across all key metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Specifically, RADAR improves F1 score by 7% on MVTec-AD and 13% on the 3D-printed material dataset compared to the next best model. Code available at: this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models require consistent behavioral patterns for safe deployment, yet their personality-like traits remain poorly understood. We present PERSIST (PERsonality Stability in Synthetic Text), a comprehensive evaluation framework testing 25+ open-source models (1B-671B parameters) across 500,000+ responses. Using traditional (BFI-44, SD3) and novel LLM-adapted personality instruments, we systematically vary question order, paraphrasing, personas, and reasoning modes. Our findings challenge fundamental deployment assumptions: (1) Even 400B+ models exhibit substantial response variability (SD > 0.4); (2) Minor prompt reordering alone shifts personality measurements by up to 20%; (3) Interventions expected to stabilize behavior, such as chain-of-thought reasoning, detailed personas instruction, inclusion of conversation history, can paradoxically increase variability; (4) LLM-adapted instruments show equal instability to human-centric versions, confirming architectural rather than translational limitations. This persistent instability across scales and mitigation strategies suggests current LLMs lack the foundations for genuine behavioral consistency. For safety-critical applications requiring predictable behavior, these findings indicate that personality-based alignment strategies may be fundamentally inadequate.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This research project addresses the challenge of accurately tracking eye movements during specific events by leveraging previous research. Given the rapid movements of human eyes, which can reach speeds of 300°/s, precise eye tracking typically requires expensive and high-speed cameras. Our primary objective is to locate the eye center position (x, y) using inputs from an event camera. Eye movement analysis has extensive applications in consumer electronics, especially in VR and AR product development. Therefore, our ultimate goal is to develop an interpretable and cost-effective algorithm using deep learning methods to predict human attention, thereby improving device comfort and enhancing overall user experience. To achieve this goal, we explored various approaches, with the CNN\_LSTM model proving most effective, achieving approximately 81\% accuracy. Additionally, we propose future work focusing on Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to further enhance the model's interpretability and predictive performance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Modeling long horizon marked event sequences is a fundamental challenge in many real-world applications, including healthcare, finance, and user behavior modeling. Existing neural temporal point process models are typically autoregressive, predicting the next event one step at a time, which limits their efficiency and leads to error accumulation in long-range forecasting. In this work, we propose a unified flow matching framework for marked temporal point processes that enables non-autoregressive, joint modeling of inter-event times and event types, via continuous and discrete flow matching. By learning continuous-time flows for both components, our method generates coherent long horizon event trajectories without sequential decoding. We evaluate our model on six real-world benchmarks and demonstrate significant improvements over autoregressive and diffusion-based baselines in both accuracy and generation efficiency.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, attack, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol is a standard for in-vehicle communication but remains susceptible to cyber-attacks due to its lack of built-in security. This paper presents a multi-stage intrusion detection framework leveraging unsupervised anomaly detection and supervised graph learning tailored for automotive CAN traffic. Our architecture combines a Variational Graph Autoencoder (VGAE) for structural anomaly detection with a Knowledge-Distilled Graph Attention Network (KD-GAT) for robust attack classification. CAN bus activity is encoded as graph sequences to model temporal and relational dependencies. The pipeline applies VGAE-based selective undersampling to address class imbalance, followed by GAT classification with optional score-level fusion. The compact student GAT achieves 96% parameter reduction compared to the teacher model while maintaining strong predictive performance. Experiments on six public CAN intrusion datasets--Car-Hacking, Car-Survival, and can-train-and-test--demonstrate competitive accuracy and efficiency, with average improvements of 16.2% in F1-score over existing methods, particularly excelling on highly imbalanced datasets with up to 55% F1-score improvements.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the rapid development of MLLMs, evaluating their visual capabilities has become increasingly crucial. Current benchmarks primarily fall into two main types: basic perception benchmarks, which focus on local details but lack deep reasoning (e.g., "what is in the image?"), and mainstream reasoning benchmarks, which concentrate on prominent image elements but may fail to assess subtle clues requiring intricate analysis. However, profound visual understanding and complex reasoning depend more on interpreting subtle, inconspicuous local details than on perceiving salient, macro-level objects. These details, though occupying minimal image area, often contain richer, more critical information for robust analysis. To bridge this gap, we introduce the VER-Bench, a novel framework to evaluate MLLMs' ability to: 1) identify fine-grained visual clues, often occupying on average just 0.25% of the image area; 2) integrate these clues with world knowledge for complex reasoning. Comprising 374 carefully designed questions across Geospatial, Temporal, Situational, Intent, System State, and Symbolic reasoning, each question in VER-Bench is accompanied by structured evidence: visual clues and question-related reasoning derived from them. VER-Bench reveals current models' limitations in extracting subtle visual evidence and constructing evidence-based arguments, highlighting the need to enhance models's capabilities in fine-grained visual evidence extraction, integration, and reasoning for genuine visual understanding and human-like analysis.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Post-training quantization (PTQ) has become a crucial tool for reducing the memory and compute costs of modern deep neural networks, including large language models (LLMs). Among PTQ algorithms, the OPTQ framework-also known as GPTQ-has emerged as a leading method due to its computational efficiency and strong empirical performance. Despite its widespread adoption, however, OPTQ lacks rigorous quantitative theoretical guarantees. This paper presents the first quantitative error bounds for both deterministic and stochastic variants of OPTQ, as well as for Qronos, a recent related state-of-the-art PTQ algorithm. We analyze how OPTQ's iterative procedure induces quantization error and derive non-asymptotic 2-norm error bounds that depend explicitly on the calibration data and a regularization parameter that OPTQ uses. Our analysis provides theoretical justification for several practical design choices, including the widely used heuristic of ordering features by decreasing norm, as well as guidance for selecting the regularization parameter. For the stochastic variant, we establish stronger infinity-norm error bounds, which enable control over the required quantization alphabet and are particularly useful for downstream layers and nonlinearities. Finally, we extend our analysis to Qronos, providing new theoretical bounds, for both its deterministic and stochastic variants, that help explain its empirical advantages.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) already excel at writing code in high-resource languages such as Python and JavaScript, yet stumble on low-resource languages that remain essential to science and engineering. Besides the obvious shortage of pre-training data, post-training itself is a bottleneck: every new language seems to require new datasets, test harnesses, and reinforcement-learning (RL) infrastructure. We introduce Agnostics, a language-agnostic post-training pipeline that eliminates this per-language engineering. The key idea is to judge code solely by its externally observable behavior, so a single verifier can test solutions written in any language. Concretely, we (i) use an LLM to rewrite existing unit-test datasets into an I/O format, (ii) supply a short configuration that tells the verifier how to compile and run a target language, and (iii) apply reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) in a robust code execution environment. Applied to five low-resource languages--Lua, Julia, R, OCaml, and Fortran--Agnostics (1) improves Qwen-3 4B to performance that rivals other 16B-70B open-weight models; (2) scales cleanly to larger and diverse model families (Qwen-3 8B, DeepSeek Coder 6.7B Instruct, Phi 4 Mini); and (3) for ${\le} 16$B parameter models, sets new state-of-the-art pass@1 results on MultiPL-E and a new multi-language version LiveCodeBench that we introduce. We will release the language-agnostic training datasets (Ag-MBPP-X, Ag-Codeforces-X, Ag-LiveCodeBench-X), training code, and ready-to-use configurations, making RL post-training in any programming language as simple as editing a short YAML file.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Transformer-based object detectors often struggle with occlusions, fine-grained localization, and computational inefficiency caused by fixed queries and dense attention. We propose DAMM, Dual-stream Attention with Multi-Modal queries, a novel framework introducing both query adaptation and structured cross-attention for improved accuracy and efficiency. DAMM capitalizes on three types of queries: appearance-based queries from vision-language models, positional queries using polygonal embeddings, and random learned queries for general scene coverage. Furthermore, a dual-stream cross-attention module separately refines semantic and spatial features, boosting localization precision in cluttered scenes. We evaluated DAMM on four challenging benchmarks, and it achieved state-of-the-art performance in average precision (AP) and recall, demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-modal query adaptation and dual-stream attention.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Air pollution is a global hazard, and as of 2023, 94\% of the world's population is exposed to unsafe pollution levels. Surface Ozone (O3), an important pollutant, and the drivers of its trends are difficult to model, and traditional physics-based models fall short in their practical use for scales relevant to human-health impacts. Deep Learning-based emulators have shown promise in capturing complex climate patterns, but overall lack the interpretability necessary to support critical decision making for policy changes and public health measures. We implement an uncertainty-aware U-Net architecture to predict the Multi-mOdel Multi-cOnstituent Chemical data assimilation (MOMO-Chem) model's surface ozone residuals (bias) using Bayesian and quantile regression methods. We demonstrate the capability of our techniques in regional estimation of bias in North America and Europe for June 2019. We highlight the uncertainty quantification (UQ) scores between our two UQ methodologies and discern which ground stations are optimal and sub-optimal candidates for MOMO-Chem bias correction, and evaluate the impact of land-use information in surface ozone residual modeling.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>protect, defense, attack, robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated with graph-structured data for tasks like node classification, a domain traditionally dominated by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). While this integration leverages rich relational information to improve task performance, their robustness against adversarial attacks remains unexplored. We take the first step to explore the vulnerabilities of graph-aware LLMs by leveraging existing adversarial attack methods tailored for graph-based models, including those for poisoning (training-time attacks) and evasion (test-time attacks), on two representative models, LLAGA (Chen et al. 2024) and GRAPHPROMPTER (Liu et al. 2024). Additionally, we discover a new attack surface for LLAGA where an attacker can inject malicious nodes as placeholders into the node sequence template to severely degrade its performance. Our systematic analysis reveals that certain design choices in graph encoding can enhance attack success, with specific findings that: (1) the node sequence template in LLAGA increases its vulnerability; (2) the GNN encoder used in GRAPHPROMPTER demonstrates greater robustness; and (3) both approaches remain susceptible to imperceptible feature perturbation attacks. Finally, we propose an end-to-end defense framework GALGUARD, that combines an LLM-based feature correction module to mitigate feature-level perturbations and adapted GNN defenses to protect against structural attacks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Reliable evaluation of machine learning models for neonatal seizure detection is critical for clinical adoption. Current practices often rely on inconsistent and biased metrics, hindering model comparability and interpretability. Expert-level claims about AI performance are frequently made without rigorous validation, raising concerns about their reliability. This study aims to systematically evaluate common performance metrics and propose best practices tailored to the specific challenges of neonatal seizure detection. Using real and synthetic seizure annotations, we assessed standard performance metrics, consensus strategies, and human-expert level equivalence tests under varying class imbalance, inter-rater agreement, and number of raters. Matthews and Pearson's correlation coefficients outperformed the area under the curve in reflecting performance under class imbalance. Consensus types are sensitive to the number of raters and agreement level among them. Among human-expert level equivalence tests, the multi-rater Turing test using Fleiss k best captured expert-level AI performance. We recommend reporting: (1) at least one balanced metric, (2) Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV, (3) Multi-rater Turing test results using Fleiss k, and (4) All the above on held-out validation set. This proposed framework provides an important prerequisite to clinical validation by enabling a thorough and honest appraisal of AI methods for neonatal seizure detection.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid proliferation of online multimedia content has intensified the spread of hate speech, presenting critical societal and regulatory challenges. While recent work has advanced multimodal hateful video detection, most approaches rely on coarse, video-level annotations that overlook the temporal granularity of hateful content. This introduces substantial label noise, as videos annotated as hateful often contain long non-hateful segments. In this paper, we investigate the impact of such label ambiguity through a fine-grained approach. Specifically, we trim hateful videos from the HateMM and MultiHateClip English datasets using annotated timestamps to isolate explicitly hateful segments. We then conduct an exploratory analysis of these trimmed segments to examine the distribution and characteristics of both hateful and non-hateful content. This analysis highlights the degree of semantic overlap and the confusion introduced by coarse, video-level annotations. Finally, controlled experiments demonstrated that time-stamp noise fundamentally alters model decision boundaries and weakens classification confidence, highlighting the inherent context dependency and temporal continuity of hate speech expression. Our findings provide new insights into the temporal dynamics of multimodal hateful videos and highlight the need for temporally aware models and benchmarks for improved robustness and interpretability.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multi-agent large language model (LLM) systems have shown strong potential in complex reasoning and collaborative decision-making tasks. However, most existing coordination schemes rely on static or full-context routing strategies, which lead to excessive token consumption, redundant memory exposure, and limited adaptability across interaction rounds. We introduce RCR-Router, a modular and role-aware context routing framework designed to enable efficient, adaptive collaboration in multi-agent LLMs. To our knowledge, this is the first routing approach that dynamically selects semantically relevant memory subsets for each agent based on its role and task stage, while adhering to a strict token budget. A lightweight scoring policy guides memory selection, and agent outputs are iteratively integrated into a shared memory store to facilitate progressive context refinement. To better evaluate model behavior, we further propose an Answer Quality Score metric that captures LLM-generated explanations beyond standard QA accuracy. Experiments on three multi-hop QA benchmarks -- HotPotQA, MuSiQue, and 2WikiMultihop -- demonstrate that RCR-Router reduces token usage (up to 30%) while improving or maintaining answer quality. These results highlight the importance of structured memory routing and output-aware evaluation in advancing scalable multi-agent LLM systems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Hate speech is a widespread and harmful form of online discourse, encompassing slurs and defamatory posts that can have serious social, psychological, and sometimes physical impacts on targeted individuals and communities. As social media platforms such as X (formerly Twitter), Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, and others continue to facilitate widespread communication, they also become breeding grounds for hate speech, which has increasingly been linked to real-world hate crimes. Addressing this issue requires the development of robust automated methods to detect hate speech in diverse social media environments. Deep learning approaches, such as vanilla recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM), and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have achieved good results, but are often limited by issues such as long-term dependencies and inefficient parallelization. This study represents the comprehensive exploration of transformer-based models for hate speech detection using the MetaHate dataset--a meta-collection of 36 datasets with 1.2 million social media samples. We evaluate multiple state-of-the-art transformer models, including BERT, RoBERTa, GPT-2, and ELECTRA, with fine-tuned ELECTRA achieving the highest performance (F1 score: 0.8980). We also analyze classification errors, revealing challenges with sarcasm, coded language, and label noise.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep Active Learning (DAL) reduces annotation costs by selecting the most informative unlabeled samples during training. As real-world applications become more complex, challenges stemming from distribution shifts (e.g., open-set recognition) and data imbalance have gained increasing attention, prompting the development of numerous DAL algorithms. However, the lack of a unified platform has hindered fair and systematic evaluation under diverse conditions. Therefore, we present a new DAL platform ALScope for classification tasks, integrating 10 datasets from computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP), and 21 representative DAL algorithms, including both classical baselines and recent approaches designed to handle challenges such as distribution shifts and data imbalance. This platform supports flexible configuration of key experimental factors, ranging from algorithm and dataset choices to task-specific factors like out-of-distribution (OOD) sample ratio, and class imbalance ratio, enabling comprehensive and realistic evaluation. We conduct extensive experiments on this platform under various settings. Our findings show that: (1) DAL algorithms' performance varies significantly across domains and task settings; (2) in non-standard scenarios such as imbalanced and open-set settings, DAL algorithms show room for improvement and require further investigation; and (3) some algorithms achieve good performance, but require significantly longer selection time.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating how Large Language Models (LLMs) respond to linguistic shibboleths: subtle linguistic markers that can inadvertently reveal demographic attributes such as gender, social class, or regional background. Through carefully constructed interview simulations using 100 validated question-response pairs, we demonstrate how LLMs systematically penalize certain linguistic patterns, particularly hedging language, despite equivalent content quality. Our benchmark generates controlled linguistic variations that isolate specific phenomena while maintaining semantic equivalence, which enables the precise measurement of demographic bias in automated evaluation systems. We validate our approach along multiple linguistic dimensions, showing that hedged responses receive 25.6% lower ratings on average, and demonstrate the benchmark's effectiveness in identifying model-specific biases. This work establishes a foundational framework for detecting and measuring linguistic discrimination in AI systems, with broad applications to fairness in automated decision-making contexts.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP excel in zero-shot learning but often require resource-intensive training to adapt to new tasks. Prompt learning techniques, such as CoOp and CoCoOp, offer efficient adaptation but tend to overfit to known classes, limiting generalization to unseen categories. We introduce ProMIM, a plug-and-play framework that enhances conditional prompt learning by integrating masked image modeling (MIM) into existing VLM pipelines. ProMIM leverages a simple yet effective masking strategy to generate robust, instance-conditioned prompts, seamlessly augmenting methods like CoOp and CoCoOp without altering their core architectures. By masking only visible image patches and using these representations to guide prompt generation, ProMIM improves feature robustness and mitigates overfitting, all while introducing negligible additional computational cost. Extensive experiments across zero-shot and few-shot classification tasks demonstrate that ProMIM consistently boosts generalization performance when plugged into existing approaches, providing a practical, lightweight solution for real-world vision-language applications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Dynamic Scene Graph Generation (DSGG) aims to create a scene graph for each video frame by detecting objects and predicting their relationships. Weakly Supervised DSGG (WS-DSGG) reduces annotation workload by using an unlocalized scene graph from a single frame per video for training. Existing WS-DSGG methods depend on an off-the-shelf external object detector to generate pseudo labels for subsequent DSGG training. However, detectors trained on static, object-centric images struggle in dynamic, relation-aware scenarios required for DSGG, leading to inaccurate localization and low-confidence proposals. To address the challenges posed by external object detectors in WS-DSGG, we propose a Temporal-enhanced Relation-aware Knowledge Transferring (TRKT) method, which leverages knowledge to enhance detection in relation-aware dynamic scenarios. TRKT is built on two key components:(1)Relation-aware knowledge mining: we first employ object and relation class decoders that generate category-specific attention maps to highlight both object regions and interactive areas. Then we propose an Inter-frame Attention Augmentation strategy that exploits optical flow for neighboring frames to enhance the attention maps, making them motion-aware and robust to motion blur. This step yields relation- and motion-aware knowledge mining for WS-DSGG. (2) we introduce a Dual-stream Fusion Module that integrates category-specific attention maps into external detections to refine object localization and boost confidence scores for object proposals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TRKT achieves state-of-the-art performance on Action Genome dataset. Our code is avaliable at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Evaluating visual activity recognition systems is challenging due to inherent ambiguities in verb semantics and image interpretation. When describing actions in images, synonymous verbs can refer to the same event (e.g., brushing vs. grooming), while different perspectives can lead to equally valid but distinct verb choices (e.g., piloting vs. operating). Standard exact-match evaluation, which relies on a single gold answer, fails to capture these ambiguities, resulting in an incomplete assessment of model performance. To address this, we propose a vision-language clustering framework that constructs verb sense clusters, providing a more robust evaluation. Our analysis of the imSitu dataset shows that each image maps to an average of 2.8 sense clusters, with each cluster representing a distinct perspective of the image. We evaluate multiple activity recognition models and compare our cluster-based evaluation with standard evaluation methods. Additionally, our human alignment analysis suggests that the cluster-based evaluation better aligns with human judgements, offering a more nuanced assessment of model performance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we design two compressed decentralized algorithms for solving nonconvex stochastic optimization under two different scenarios. Both algorithms adopt a momentum technique to achieve fast convergence and a message-compression technique to save communication costs. Though momentum acceleration and compressed communication have been used in literature, it is highly nontrivial to theoretically prove the effectiveness of their composition in a decentralized algorithm that can maintain the benefits of both sides, because of the need to simultaneously control the consensus error, the compression error, and the bias from the momentum gradient. For the scenario where gradients are bounded, our proposal is a compressed decentralized adaptive method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first decentralized adaptive stochastic gradient method with compressed communication. For the scenario of data heterogeneity without bounded gradients, our proposal is a compressed decentralized heavy-ball method, which applies a gradient tracking technique to address the challenge of data heterogeneity. Notably, both methods achieve an optimal convergence rate, and they can achieve linear speed up and adopt topology-independent algorithmic parameters within a certain regime of the user-specified error tolerance. Superior empirical performance is observed over state-of-the-art methods on training deep neural networks (DNNs) and Transformers.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful approach for learning visual representations without manual annotations. However, the robustness of standard SSL methods to domain shift -- systematic differences across data sources -- remains uncertain, posing an especially critical challenge in biomedical imaging where batch effects can obscure true biological signals. We present AdvDINO, a domain-adversarial self-supervised learning framework that integrates a gradient reversal layer into the DINOv2 architecture to promote domain-invariant feature learning. Applied to a real-world cohort of six-channel multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) whole slide images from non-small cell lung cancer patients, AdvDINO mitigates slide-specific biases to learn more robust and biologically meaningful representations than non-adversarial baselines. Across $>5.46$ million mIF image tiles, the model uncovers phenotype clusters with distinct proteomic profiles and prognostic significance, and improves survival prediction in attention-based multiple instance learning. While demonstrated on mIF data, AdvDINO is broadly applicable to other imaging domains -- including radiology, remote sensing, and autonomous driving -- where domain shift and limited annotated data hinder model generalization and interpretability.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, interpretability, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Foundation models for electroencephalography (EEG) signals have recently demonstrated success in learning generalized representations of EEGs, outperforming specialized models in various downstream tasks. However, many of these models lack transparency in their pretraining dynamics and offer limited insight into how well EEG information is preserved within their embeddings. For successful clinical integration, EEG foundation models must ensure transparency in pretraining, downstream fine-tuning, and the interpretability of learned representations. Current approaches primarily operate in the temporal domain, overlooking advancements in digital signal processing that enable the extraction of deterministic and traceable features, such as wavelet-based representations. We propose MENDR (Manifold Explainable Neural Data Representations), a filter bank-based EEG foundation model built on a novel Riemannian Manifold Transformer architecture to resolve these issues. MENDR learns symmetric positive definite matrix embeddings of EEG signals and is pretrained on a large corpus comprising over 4,000 hours of EEG data, decomposed via discrete wavelet packet transforms into multi-resolution coefficients. MENDR significantly enhances interpretability by visualizing symmetric positive definite embeddings as geometric ellipsoids and supports accurate reconstruction of EEG signals from learned embeddings. Evaluations across multiple clinical EEG tasks demonstrate that MENDR achieves near state-of-the-art performance with substantially fewer parameters, underscoring its potential for efficient, interpretable, and clinically applicable EEG analysis.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Open-world point cloud semantic segmentation (OW-Seg) aims to predict point labels of both base and novel classes in real-world scenarios. However, existing methods rely on resource-intensive offline incremental learning or densely annotated support data, limiting their practicality. To address these limitations, we propose HOW-Seg, the first human-in-the-loop framework for OW-Seg. Specifically, we construct class prototypes, the fundamental segmentation units, directly on the query data, avoiding the prototype bias caused by intra-class distribution shifts between the support and query data. By leveraging sparse human annotations as guidance, HOW-Seg enables prototype-based segmentation for both base and novel classes. Considering the lack of granularity of initial prototypes, we introduce a hierarchical prototype disambiguation mechanism to refine ambiguous prototypes, which correspond to annotations of different classes. To further enrich contextual awareness, we employ a dense conditional random field (CRF) upon the refined prototypes to optimize their label assignments. Through iterative human feedback, HOW-Seg dynamically improves its predictions, achieving high-quality segmentation for both base and novel classes. Experiments demonstrate that with sparse annotations (e.g., one-novel-class-one-click), HOW-Seg matches or surpasses the state-of-the-art generalized few-shot segmentation (GFS-Seg) method under the 5-shot setting. When using advanced backbones (e.g., Stratified Transformer) and denser annotations (e.g., 10 clicks per sub-scene), HOW-Seg achieves 85.27% mIoU on S3DIS and 66.37% mIoU on ScanNetv2, significantly outperforming alternatives.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion-based image compression has demonstrated impressive perceptual performance. However, it suffers from two critical drawbacks: (1) excessive decoding latency due to multi-step sampling, and (2) poor fidelity resulting from over-reliance on generative priors. To address these issues, we propose SODEC, a novel single-step diffusion image compression model. We argue that in image compression, a sufficiently informative latent renders multi-step refinement unnecessary. Based on this insight, we leverage a pre-trained VAE-based model to produce latents with rich information, and replace the iterative denoising process with a single-step decoding. Meanwhile, to improve fidelity, we introduce the fidelity guidance module, encouraging output that is faithful to the original image. Furthermore, we design the rate annealing training strategy to enable effective training under extremely low bitrates. Extensive experiments show that SODEC significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving superior rate-distortion-perception performance. Moreover, compared to previous diffusion-based compression models, SODEC improves decoding speed by more than 20$\times$. Code is released at: this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Depth completion is a pivotal challenge in computer vision, aiming at reconstructing the dense depth map from a sparse one, typically with a paired RGB image. Existing learning based models rely on carefully prepared but limited data, leading to significant performance degradation in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Recent foundation models have demonstrated exceptional robustness in monocular depth estimation through large-scale training, and using such models to enhance the robustness of depth completion models is a promising solution. In this work, we propose a novel depth completion framework that leverages depth foundation models to attain remarkable robustness without large-scale training. Specifically, we leverage a depth foundation model to extract environmental cues, including structural and semantic context, from RGB images to guide the propagation of sparse depth information into missing regions. We further design a dual-space propagation approach, without any learnable parameters, to effectively propagates sparse depth in both 3D and 2D spaces to maintain geometric structure and local consistency. To refine the intricate structure, we introduce a learnable correction module to progressively adjust the depth prediction towards the real depth. We train our model on the NYUv2 and KITTI datasets as in-distribution datasets and extensively evaluate the framework on 16 other datasets. Our framework performs remarkably well in the OOD scenarios and outperforms existing state-of-the-art depth completion methods. Our models are released in this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent neurophysiological studies have revealed that the early visual cortex can rapidly learn global image context, as evidenced by a sparsification of population responses and a reduction in mean activity when exposed to familiar versus novel image contexts. This phenomenon has been attributed primarily to local recurrent interactions, rather than changes in feedforward or feedback pathways, supported by both empirical findings and circuit-level modeling. Recurrent neural circuits capable of simulating these effects have been shown to reshape the geometry of neural manifolds, enhancing robustness and invariance to irrelevant variations. In this study, we employ a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based autoencoder to investigate, from a functional perspective, how familiarity training can induce sensitivity to global context in the early layers of a deep neural network. We hypothesize that rapid learning operates via fast weights, which encode transient or short-term memory traces, and we explore the use of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to implement such fast weights within each Transformer layer. Our results show that (1) The proposed ViT-based autoencoder's self-attention circuit performs a manifold transform similar to a neural circuit model of the familiarity effect. (2) Familiarity training aligns latent representations in early layers with those in the top layer that contains global context information. (3) Familiarity training broadens the self-attention scope within the remembered image context. (4) These effects are significantly amplified by LoRA-based fast weights. Together, these findings suggest that familiarity training introduces global sensitivity to earlier layers in a hierarchical network, and that a hybrid fast-and-slow weight architecture may provide a viable computational model for studying rapid global context learning in the brain.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Person re-identification (Re-ID) aims to match person images across different camera views, with occluded Re-ID addressing scenarios where pedestrians are partially visible. While pre-trained vision-language models have shown effectiveness in Re-ID tasks, they face significant challenges in occluded scenarios by focusing on holistic image semantics while neglecting fine-grained attribute information. This limitation becomes particularly evident when dealing with partially occluded pedestrians or when distinguishing between individuals with subtle appearance differences. To address this limitation, we propose Attribute-Guide ReID (AG-ReID), a novel framework that leverages pre-trained models' inherent capabilities to extract fine-grained semantic attributes without additional data or annotations. Our framework operates through a two-stage process: first generating attribute pseudo-labels that capture subtle visual characteristics, then introducing a dual-guidance mechanism that combines holistic and fine-grained attribute information to enhance image feature extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AG-ReID achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple widely-used Re-ID datasets, showing significant improvements in handling occlusions and subtle attribute differences while maintaining competitive performance on standard Re-ID scenarios.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Background: Understanding social determinants of health (SDoH) factors contributing to suicide incidents is crucial for early intervention and prevention. However, data-driven approaches to this goal face challenges such as long-tailed factor distributions, analyzing pivotal stressors preceding suicide incidents, and limited model explainability. Methods: We present a multi-stage large language model framework to enhance SDoH factor extraction from unstructured text. Our approach was compared to other state-of-the-art language models (i.e., pre-trained BioBERT and GPT-3.5-turbo) and reasoning models (i.e., DeepSeek-R1). We also evaluated how the model's explanations help people annotate SDoH factors more quickly and accurately. The analysis included both automated comparisons and a pilot user study. Results: We show that our proposed framework demonstrated performance boosts in the overarching task of extracting SDoH factors and in the finer-grained tasks of retrieving relevant context. Additionally, we show that fine-tuning a smaller, task-specific model achieves comparable or better performance with reduced inference costs. The multi-stage design not only enhances extraction but also provides intermediate explanations, improving model explainability. Conclusions: Our approach improves both the accuracy and transparency of extracting suicide-related SDoH from unstructured texts. These advancements have the potential to support early identification of individuals at risk and inform more effective prevention strategies.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Self-evolving Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a scalable path toward super-intelligence by autonomously generating, refining, and learning from their own experiences. However, existing methods for training such models still rely heavily on vast human-curated tasks and labels, typically via fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, which poses a fundamental bottleneck to advancing AI systems toward capabilities beyond human intelligence. To overcome this limitation, we introduce R-Zero, a fully autonomous framework that generates its own training data from scratch. Starting from a single base LLM, R-Zero initializes two independent models with distinct roles, a Challenger and a Solver. These models are optimized separately and co-evolve through interaction: the Challenger is rewarded for proposing tasks near the edge of the Solver capability, and the Solver is rewarded for solving increasingly challenging tasks posed by the Challenger. This process yields a targeted, self-improving curriculum without any pre-existing tasks and labels. Empirically, R-Zero substantially improves reasoning capability across different backbone LLMs, e.g., boosting the Qwen3-4B-Base by +6.49 on math-reasoning benchmarks and +7.54 on general-domain reasoning benchmarks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot capabilities in various computer vision tasks. However, their application to medical imaging remains challenging due to the high variability and complexity of medical data. Specifically, medical images often exhibit significant domain shifts caused by various confounders, including equipment differences, procedure artifacts, and imaging modes, which can lead to poor generalization when models are applied to unseen domains. To address this limitation, we propose Multimodal Causal-Driven Representation Learning (MCDRL), a novel framework that integrates causal inference with the VLM to tackle domain generalization in medical image segmentation. MCDRL is implemented in two steps: first, it leverages CLIP's cross-modal capabilities to identify candidate lesion regions and construct a confounder dictionary through text prompts, specifically designed to represent domain-specific variations; second, it trains a causal intervention network that utilizes this dictionary to identify and eliminate the influence of these domain-specific variations while preserving the anatomical structural information critical for segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MCDRL consistently outperforms competing methods, yielding superior segmentation accuracy and exhibiting robust generalizability.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capabilities when fine-tuned with reinforcement learning (RL). However, such methods require extensive data and compute, making them impractical for smaller models. Current approaches to curriculum learning or data selection are largely heuristic-driven or demand extensive computational resources, limiting their scalability and generalizability. We propose \textbf{SPaRFT}, a self-paced learning framework that enables efficient learning based on the capability of the model being trained through optimizing which data to use and when. First, we apply \emph{cluster-based data reduction} to partition training data by semantics and difficulty, extracting a compact yet diverse subset that reduces redundancy. Then, a \emph{multi-armed bandit} treats data clusters as arms, optimized to allocate training samples based on model current performance. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that SPaRFT achieves comparable or better accuracy than state-of-the-art baselines while using up to \(100\times\) fewer samples. Ablation studies and analyses further highlight the importance of both data clustering and adaptive selection. Our results demonstrate that carefully curated, performance-driven training curricula can unlock strong reasoning abilities in LLMs with minimal resources.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Dialogues Aspect-based Sentiment Quadruple Extraction (DiaASQ) aims to extract all target-aspect-opinion-sentiment quadruples from a given multi-round, multi-participant dialogue. Existing methods typically learn word relations across entire dialogues, assuming a uniform distribution of sentiment elements. However, we find that dialogues often contain multiple semantically independent sub-dialogues without clear dependencies between them. Therefore, learning word relationships across the entire dialogue inevitably introduces additional noise into the extraction process. To address this, our method focuses on partitioning dialogues into semantically independent sub-dialogues. Achieving completeness while minimizing these sub-dialogues presents a significant challenge. Simply partitioning based on reply relationships is ineffective. Instead, we propose utilizing a structural entropy minimization algorithm to partition the dialogues. This approach aims to preserve relevant utterances while distinguishing irrelevant ones as much as possible. Furthermore, we introduce a two-step framework for quadruple extraction: first extracting individual sentiment elements at the utterance level, then matching quadruples at the sub-dialogue level. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in DiaASQ with much lower computational costs.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Meaning Representation (AMR) is a semantic formalism that encodes sentence meaning as rooted, directed, acyclic graphs, where nodes represent concepts and edges denote semantic relations. Finetuning decoder only Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a promising novel straightfoward direction for AMR parsing. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of finetuning four distinct LLM architectures, Phi 3.5, Gemma 2, LLaMA 3.2, and DeepSeek R1 LLaMA Distilled using the LDC2020T02 Gold AMR3.0 test set. Our results have shown that straightfoward finetuning of decoder only LLMs can achieve comparable performance to complex State of the Art (SOTA) AMR parsers. Notably, LLaMA 3.2 demonstrates competitive performance against SOTA AMR parsers given a straightforward finetuning approach. We achieved SMATCH F1: 0.804 on the full LDC2020T02 test split, on par with APT + Silver (IBM) at 0.804 and approaching Graphene Smatch (MBSE) at 0.854. Across our analysis, we also observed a consistent pattern where LLaMA 3.2 leads in semantic performance while Phi 3.5 excels in structural validity.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid advancement of generative AI models necessitates novel methods for evaluating image quality that extend beyond human perception. A critical concern for these models is the preservation of an image's underlying Scene Composition Structure (SCS), which defines the geometric relationships among objects and the background, their relative positions, sizes, orientations, etc. Maintaining SCS integrity is paramount for ensuring faithful and structurally accurate GenAI outputs. Traditional image similarity metrics often fall short in assessing SCS. Pixel-level approaches are overly sensitive to minor visual noise, while perception-based metrics prioritize human aesthetic appeal, neither adequately capturing structural fidelity. Furthermore, recent neural-network-based metrics introduce training overheads and potential generalization issues. We introduce the SCS Similarity Index Measure (SCSSIM), a novel, analytical, and training-free metric that quantifies SCS preservation by exploiting statistical measures derived from the Cuboidal hierarchical partitioning of images, robustly capturing non-object-based structural relationships. Our experiments demonstrate SCSSIM's high invariance to non-compositional distortions, accurately reflecting unchanged SCS. Conversely, it shows a strong monotonic decrease for compositional distortions, precisely indicating when SCS has been altered. Compared to existing metrics, SCSSIM exhibits superior properties for structural evaluation, making it an invaluable tool for developing and evaluating generative models, ensuring the integrity of scene composition.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, robust, biometric</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recently, research interest in person re-identification (ReID) has increasingly focused on video-based scenarios, which are essential for robust surveillance and security in varied and dynamic environments. However, existing video-based ReID methods often overlook the necessity of identifying and selecting the most discriminative features from both videos in a query-gallery pair for effective matching. To address this issue, we propose a novel Hierarchical and Adaptive Mixture of Biometric Experts (HAMoBE) framework, which leverages multi-layer features from a pre-trained large model (e.g., CLIP) and is designed to mimic human perceptual mechanisms by independently modeling key biometric features--appearance, static body shape, and dynamic gait--and adaptively integrating them. Specifically, HAMoBE includes two levels: the first level extracts low-level features from multi-layer representations provided by the frozen large model, while the second level consists of specialized experts focusing on long-term, short-term, and temporal features. To ensure robust matching, we introduce a new dual-input decision gating network that dynamically adjusts the contributions of each expert based on their relevance to the input scenarios. Extensive evaluations on benchmarks like MEVID demonstrate that our approach yields significant performance improvements (e.g., +13.0% Rank-1 accuracy).</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The semidirect discrete logarithm problem (SDLP) in finite groups was proposed as a foundation for post-quantum cryptographic protocols, based on the belief that its non-abelian structure would resist quantum attacks. However, recent results have shown that SDLP in finite groups admits efficient quantum algorithms, undermining its quantum resistance. This raises a fundamental question: does the SDLP offer any computational advantages over the standard discrete logarithm problem (DLP) against classical adversaries? In this work, we investigate the classical hardness of SDLP across different finite group platforms. We establish that the group-case SDLP can be reformulated as a generalized discrete logarithm problem, enabling adaptation of classical algorithms to study its complexity. We present a concrete adaptation of the Baby-Step Giant-Step algorithm for SDLP, achieving time and space complexity $O(\sqrt{r})$ where $r$ is the period of the underlying cycle structure. Through theoretical analysis and experimental validation in SageMath, we demonstrate that the classical hardness of SDLP is highly platform-dependent and does not uniformly exceed that of standard DLP. In finite fields $\mathbb{F}_p^*$, both problems exhibit comparable complexity. Surprisingly, in elliptic curves $E(\mathbb{F}_p)$, the SDLP becomes trivial due to the bounded automorphism group, while in elementary abelian groups $\mathbb{F}_p^n$, the SDLP can be harder than DLP, with complexity varying based on the eigenvalue structure of the automorphism. Our findings reveal that the non-abelian structure of semidirect products does not inherently guarantee increased classical hardness, suggesting that the search for classically hard problems for cryptographic applications requires more careful consideration of the underlying algebraic structures.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in document understanding tasks, their ability to locate and reason about fine-grained details within complex documents remains understudied. Consider searching a restaurant menu for a specific nutritional detail or identifying a disclaimer in a lengthy newspaper article tasks that demand careful attention to small but significant details within a broader narrative, akin to Finding Needles in Images (NiM). To address this gap, we introduce NiM, a carefully curated benchmark spanning diverse real-world documents including newspapers, menus, and lecture images, specifically designed to evaluate MLLMs' capability in these intricate tasks. Building on this, we further propose Spot-IT, a simple yet effective approach that enhances MLLMs capability through intelligent patch selection and Gaussian attention, motivated from how humans zoom and focus when searching documents. Our extensive experiments reveal both the capabilities and limitations of current MLLMs in handling fine-grained document understanding tasks, while demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. Spot-IT achieves significant improvements over baseline methods, particularly in scenarios requiring precise detail extraction from complex layouts.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present DualMat, a novel dual-path diffusion framework for estimating Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials from single images under complex lighting conditions. Our approach operates in two distinct latent spaces: an albedo-optimized path leveraging pretrained visual knowledge through RGB latent space, and a material-specialized path operating in a compact latent space designed for precise metallic and roughness estimation. To ensure coherent predictions between the albedo-optimized and material-specialized paths, we introduce feature distillation during training. We employ rectified flow to enhance efficiency by reducing inference steps while maintaining quality. Our framework extends to high-resolution and multi-view inputs through patch-based estimation and cross-view attention, enabling seamless integration into image-to-3D pipelines. DualMat achieves state-of-the-art performance on both Objaverse and real-world data, significantly outperforming existing methods with up to 28% improvement in albedo estimation and 39% reduction in metallic-roughness prediction errors.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Continual Semantic Segmentation (CSS) requires learning new classes without forgetting previously acquired knowledge, addressing the fundamental challenge of catastrophic forgetting in dense prediction tasks. However, existing CSS methods typically employ single-stage encoder-decoder architectures where segmentation masks and class labels are tightly coupled, leading to interference between old and new class learning and suboptimal retention-plasticity balance. We introduce DecoupleCSS, a novel two-stage framework for CSS. By decoupling class-aware detection from class-agnostic segmentation, DecoupleCSS enables more effective continual learning, preserving past knowledge while learning new classes. The first stage leverages pre-trained text and image encoders, adapted using LoRA, to encode class-specific information and generate location-aware prompts. In the second stage, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) is employed to produce precise segmentation masks, ensuring that segmentation knowledge is shared across both new and previous classes. This approach improves the balance between retention and adaptability in CSS, achieving state-of-the-art performance across a variety of challenging tasks.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Image colorization, the task of adding colors to grayscale images, has been the focus of significant research efforts in computer vision in recent years for its various application areas such as color restoration and automatic animation colorization [15, 1]. The colorization problem is challenging as it is highly ill-posed with two out of three image dimensions lost, resulting in large degrees of freedom. However, semantics of the scene as well as the surface texture could provide important cues for colors: the sky is typically blue, the clouds are typically white and the grass is typically green, and there are huge amounts of training data available for learning such priors since any colored image could serve as a training data point [20]. Colorization is initially formulated as a regression task[5], which ignores the multi-modal nature of color prediction. In this project, we explore automatic image colorization via classification and adversarial learning. We will build our models on prior works, apply modifications for our specific scenario and make comparisons.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, extraction, diffusion, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Makeup transfer aims to apply the makeup style from a reference face to a target face and has been increasingly adopted in practical applications. Existing GAN-based approaches typically rely on carefully designed loss functions to balance transfer quality and facial identity consistency, while diffusion-based methods often depend on additional face-control modules or algorithms to preserve identity. However, these auxiliary components tend to introduce extra errors, leading to suboptimal transfer results. To overcome these limitations, we propose FLUX-Makeup, a high-fidelity, identity-consistent, and robust makeup transfer framework that eliminates the need for any auxiliary face-control components. Instead, our method directly leverages source-reference image pairs to achieve superior transfer performance. Specifically, we build our framework upon FLUX-Kontext, using the source image as its native conditional input. Furthermore, we introduce RefLoRAInjector, a lightweight makeup feature injector that decouples the reference pathway from the backbone, enabling efficient and comprehensive extraction of makeup-related information. In parallel, we design a robust and scalable data generation pipeline to provide more accurate supervision during training. The paired makeup datasets produced by this pipeline significantly surpass the quality of all existing datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FLUX-Makeup achieves state-of-the-art performance, exhibiting strong robustness across diverse scenarios.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) is essential for adapting Large Language Models (LLMs). In practice, LLMs are often required to handle a diverse set of tasks from multiple domains, a scenario naturally addressed by multi-task learning (MTL). Within this MTL context, a prevailing trend involves LoRA variants with multiple adapters or heads, which advocate for structural diversity to capture task-specific knowledge. Our findings present a direct challenge to this paradigm. We first show that a simplified multi-head architecture with high inter-head similarity substantially outperforms complex multi-adapter and multi-head systems. This leads us to question the multi-component paradigm itself, and we further demonstrate that a standard single-adapter LoRA, with a sufficiently increased rank, also achieves highly competitive performance. These results lead us to a new hypothesis: effective MTL generalization hinges on learning robust shared representations, not isolating task-specific features. To validate this, we propose Align-LoRA, which incorporates an explicit loss to align task representations within the shared adapter space. Experiments confirm that Align-LoRA significantly surpasses all baselines, establishing a simpler yet more effective paradigm for adapting LLMs to multiple tasks.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have demonstrated strong representational capabilities through self-supervised pre-training on large-scale, unannotated histopathology image datasets. However, their diverse yet opaque pretraining contexts, shaped by both data-related and structural/training factors, introduce latent biases that hinder generalisability and transparency in downstream applications. In this paper, we propose AdaFusion, a novel prompt-guided inference framework that, to our knowledge, is among the very first to dynamically integrate complementary knowledge from multiple PFMs. Our method compresses and aligns tile-level features from diverse models and employs a lightweight attention mechanism to adaptively fuse them based on tissue phenotype context. We evaluate AdaFusion on three real-world benchmarks spanning treatment response prediction, tumour grading, and spatial gene expression inference. Our approach consistently surpasses individual PFMs across both classification and regression tasks, while offering interpretable insights into each model's biosemantic specialisation. These results highlight AdaFusion's ability to bridge heterogeneous PFMs, achieving both enhanced performance and interpretability of model-specific inductive biases.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generating long, temporally coherent videos with precise control over subject identity and motion is a formidable challenge for current diffusion models, which often suffer from identity drift and are limited to short clips. We introduce PoseGen, a novel framework that generates arbitrarily long videos of a specific subject from a single reference image and a driving pose sequence. Our core innovation is an in-context LoRA finetuning strategy that injects subject appearance at the token level for identity preservation, while simultaneously conditioning on pose information at the channel level for fine-grained motion control. To overcome duration limits, PoseGen pioneers an interleaved segment generation method that seamlessly stitches video clips together, using a shared KV cache mechanism and a specialized transition process to ensure background consistency and temporal smoothness. Trained on a remarkably small 33-hour video dataset, extensive experiments show that PoseGen significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity fidelity, pose accuracy, and its unique ability to produce coherent, artifact-free videos of unlimited duration.</li>

Forward-compatible learning, which prospectively prepares for future tasks during base task training, has emerged as a promising solution for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL). However, existing methods still struggle to balance base-class discriminability and new-class generalization. Moreover, limited access to original data during incremental tasks often results in ambiguous inter-class decision boundaries. To address these challenges, we propose SMP (Sculpting Margin Penalty), a novel FSCIL method that strategically integrates margin penalties at different stages within the parameter-efficient fine-tuning paradigm. Specifically, we introduce the Margin-aware Intra-task Adapter Merging (MIAM) mechanism for base task learning. MIAM trains two sets of low-rank adapters with distinct classification losses: one with a margin penalty to enhance base-class discriminability, and the other without margin constraints to promote generalization to future new classes. These adapters are then adaptively merged to improve forward compatibility. For incremental tasks, we propose a Margin Penalty-based Classifier Calibration (MPCC) strategy to refine decision boundaries by fine-tuning classifiers on all seen classes' embeddings with a margin penalty. Extensive experiments on CIFAR100, ImageNet-R, and CUB200 demonstrate that SMP achieves state-of-the-art performance in FSCIL while maintaining a better balance between base and new classes.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a critical approach to supplement the inherent knowledge limitations of LLMs. However, due to the typically large volume of retrieved information, RAG tends to operate with long context lengths. From the perspective of entropy engineering, we identify unconstrained entropy growth and attention dilution due to long retrieval context as significant factors affecting RAG performance. In this paper, we propose the balanced entropy-engineered RAG (BEE-RAG) framework, which improves the adaptability of RAG systems to varying context lengths through the principle of entropy invariance. By leveraging balanced context entropy to reformulate attention dynamics, BEE-RAG separates attention sensitivity from context length, ensuring a stable entropy level. Building upon this, we introduce a zero-shot inference strategy for multi-importance estimation and a parameter-efficient adaptive fine-tuning mechanism to obtain the optimal balancing factor for different settings. Extensive experiments across multiple RAG tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of BEE-RAG.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In practical machine learning applications, it is often challenging to assign accurate labels to data, and increasing the number of labeled instances is often limited. In such cases, Weakly Supervised Learning (WSL), which enables training with incomplete or imprecise supervision, provides a practical and effective solution. However, most existing WSL methods focus on leveraging a single type of weak supervision. In this paper, we propose a novel WSL framework that leverages complementary weak supervision signals from multiple relational perspectives, which can be especially valuable when labeled data is limited. Specifically, we introduce SconfConfDiff Classification, a method that integrates two distinct forms of weaklabels: similarity-confidence and confidence-difference, which are assigned to unlabeled data pairs. To implement this method, we derive two types of unbiased risk estimators for classification: one based on a convex combination of existing estimators, and another newly designed by modeling the interaction between two weak labels. We prove that both estimators achieve optimal convergence rates with respect to estimation error bounds. Furthermore, we introduce a risk correction approach to mitigate overfitting caused by negative empirical risk, and provide theoretical analysis on the robustness of the proposed method against inaccurate class prior probability and label noise. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing baselines across a variety of settings.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Function calling capabilities are crucial for deploying Large Language Models in real-world applications, yet current training approaches fail to develop robust reasoning strategies. Supervised fine-tuning produces models that rely on superficial pattern matching, while standard reinforcement learning methods struggle with the complex action space of structured function calls. We present a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance group relative policy optimization through strategic entropy based exploration specifically tailored for function calling tasks. Our approach addresses three critical challenges in function calling: insufficient exploration during policy learning, lack of structured reasoning in chain-of-thought generation, and inadequate verification of parameter extraction. Our two-stage data preparation pipeline ensures high-quality training samples through iterative LLM evaluation and abstract syntax tree validation. Extensive experiments on the Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard demonstrate that this framework achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models with 86.02\% overall accuracy, outperforming standard GRPO by up to 6\% on complex multi-function scenarios. Notably, our method shows particularly strong improvements on code-pretrained models, suggesting that structured language generation capabilities provide an advantageous starting point for reinforcement learning in function calling tasks. We will release all the code, models and dataset to benefit the community.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Visual grounding tasks, such as referring image segmentation (RIS) and referring expression comprehension (REC), aim to localize a target object based on a given textual description. The target object in an image can be described in multiple ways, reflecting diverse attributes such as color, position, and more. However, most existing methods rely on a single textual input, which captures only a fraction of the rich information available in the visual domain. This mismatch between rich visual details and sparse textual cues can lead to the misidentification of similar objects. To address this, we propose a novel visual grounding framework that leverages multiple latent expressions generated from a single textual input by incorporating complementary visual details absent from the original description. Specifically, we introduce subject distributor and visual concept injector modules to embed both shared-subject and distinct-attributes concepts into the latent representations, thereby capturing unique and target-specific visual cues. We also propose a positive-margin contrastive learning strategy to align all latent expressions with the original text while preserving subtle variations. Experimental results show that our method not only outperforms state-of-the-art RIS and REC approaches on multiple benchmarks but also achieves outstanding performance on the generalized referring expression segmentation (GRES) benchmark.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is significantly sensitive to the contextual position of information in the input. To investigate the mechanism behind this positional bias, our extensive experiments reveal a consistent phenomenon we term the attention basin: when presented with a sequence of structured items (e.g., retrieved documents or few-shot examples), models systematically assign higher attention to the items at the beginning and end of the sequence, while neglecting those in the middle. Crucially, our analysis further reveals that allocating higher attention to critical information is key to enhancing model performance. Based on these insights, we introduce Attention-Driven Reranking (AttnRank), a two-stage framework that (i) estimates a model's intrinsic positional attention preferences using a small calibration set, and (ii) reorders retrieved documents or few-shot examples to align the most salient content with these high-attention positions. AttnRank is a model-agnostic, training-free, and plug-and-play method with minimal computational overhead. Experiments on multi-hop QA and few-shot in-context learning tasks demonstrate that AttnRank achieves substantial improvements across 10 large language models of varying architectures and scales, without modifying model parameters or training procedures.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The integration of large language models into healthcare necessitates a rigorous evaluation of their ethical reasoning, an area current benchmarks often overlook. We introduce PrinciplismQA, a comprehensive benchmark with 3,648 questions designed to systematically assess LLMs' alignment with core medical ethics. Grounded in Principlism, our benchmark features a high-quality dataset. This includes multiple-choice questions curated from authoritative textbooks and open-ended questions sourced from authoritative medical ethics case study literature, all validated by medical experts. Our experiments reveal a significant gap between models' ethical knowledge and their practical application, especially in dynamically applying ethical principles to real-world scenarios. Most LLMs struggle with dilemmas concerning Beneficence, often over-emphasizing other principles. Frontier closed-source models, driven by strong general capabilities, currently lead the benchmark. Notably, medical domain fine-tuning can enhance models' overall ethical competence, but further progress requires better alignment with medical ethical knowledge. PrinciplismQA offers a scalable framework to diagnose these specific ethical weaknesses, paving the way for more balanced and responsible medical AI.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized approach where multiple clients collaboratively train a shared global model without sharing their raw data. Despite its effectiveness, conventional FL faces scalability challenges due to excessive computational and communication demands placed on a single central server as the number of participating devices grows. Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) addresses these issues by distributing model aggregation tasks across intermediate nodes (stations), thereby enhancing system scalability and robustness against single points of failure. However, HFL still suffers from a critical yet often overlooked limitation: domain shift, where data distributions vary significantly across different clients and stations, reducing model performance on unseen target domains. While Federated Domain Generalization (FedDG) methods have emerged to improve robustness to domain shifts, their integration into HFL frameworks remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we formally introduce Hierarchical Federated Domain Generalization (HFedDG), a novel scenario designed to investigate domain shift within hierarchical architectures. Specifically, we propose HFedATM, a hierarchical aggregation method that first aligns the convolutional filters of models from different stations through Filter-wise Optimal Transport Alignment and subsequently merges aligned models using a Shrinkage-aware Regularized Mean Aggregation. Our extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that HFedATM significantly boosts the performance of existing FedDG baselines across multiple datasets and maintains computational and communication efficiency. Moreover, theoretical analyses indicate that HFedATM achieves tighter generalization error bounds compared to standard hierarchical averaging, resulting in faster convergence and stable training behavior.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, robust, federate, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in AI-assisted diagnostics, surgical planning, and treatment monitoring. Accurate and robust segmentation models are essential for enabling reliable, data-driven clinical decision making across diverse imaging modalities. Given the inherent variability in image characteristics across modalities, developing a unified model capable of generalizing effectively to multiple modalities would be highly beneficial. This model could streamline clinical workflows and reduce the need for modality-specific training. However, real-world deployment faces major challenges, including data scarcity, domain shift between modalities (e.g., CT vs. MRI), and privacy restrictions that prevent data sharing. To address these issues, we propose FedGIN, a Federated Learning (FL) framework that enables multimodal organ segmentation without sharing raw patient data. Our method integrates a lightweight Global Intensity Non-linear (GIN) augmentation module that harmonizes modality-specific intensity distributions during local training. We evaluated FedGIN using two types of datasets: an imputed dataset and a complete dataset. In the limited dataset scenario, the model was initially trained using only MRI data, and CT data was added to assess its performance improvements. In the complete dataset scenario, both MRI and CT data were fully utilized for training on all clients. In the limited-data scenario, FedGIN achieved a 12 to 18% improvement in 3D Dice scores on MRI test cases compared to FL without GIN and consistently outperformed local baselines. In the complete dataset scenario, FedGIN demonstrated near-centralized performance, with a 30% Dice score improvement over the MRI-only baseline and a 10% improvement over the CT-only baseline, highlighting its strong cross-modality generalization under privacy constraints.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, robust, federate, data-free</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed clients without sharing raw data, offering a significant privacy benefit. However, most existing Personalized Federated Learning (pFL) methods assume a static client participation, which does not reflect real-world scenarios where new clients may continuously join the federated system (i.e., dynamic client onboarding). In this paper, we explore a practical scenario in which a new batch of clients is introduced incrementally while the learning task remains unchanged. This dynamic environment poses various challenges, including preserving performance for existing clients without retraining and enabling efficient knowledge transfer between client batches. To address these issues, we propose Personalized Federated Data-Free Sub-Hypernetwork (pFedDSH), a novel framework based on a central hypernetwork that generates personalized models for each client via embedding vectors. To maintain knowledge stability for existing clients, pFedDSH incorporates batch-specific masks, which activate subsets of neurons to preserve knowledge. Furthermore, we introduce a data-free replay strategy motivated by DeepInversion to facilitate backward transfer, enhancing existing clients' performance without compromising privacy. Extensive experiments conducted on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that pFedDSH outperforms the state-of-the-art pFL and Federated Continual Learning baselines in our investigation scenario. Our approach achieves robust performance stability for existing clients, as well as adaptation for new clients and efficient utilization of neural resources.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are becoming integral to autonomous driving (AD) systems due to their strong vision-language reasoning capabilities. However, MLLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, particularly adversarial patch attacks, which can pose serious threats in real-world scenarios. Existing patch-based attack methods are primarily designed for object detection models and perform poorly when transferred to MLLM-based systems due to the latter's complex architectures and reasoning abilities. To address these limitations, we propose PhysPatch, a physically realizable and transferable adversarial patch framework tailored for MLLM-based AD systems. PhysPatch jointly optimizes patch location, shape, and content to enhance attack effectiveness and real-world applicability. It introduces a semantic-based mask initialization strategy for realistic placement, an SVD-based local alignment loss with patch-guided crop-resize to improve transferability, and a potential field-based mask refinement method. Extensive experiments across open-source, commercial, and reasoning-capable MLLMs demonstrate that PhysPatch significantly outperforms prior methods in steering MLLM-based AD systems toward target-aligned perception and planning outputs. Moreover, PhysPatch consistently places adversarial patches in physically feasible regions of AD scenes, ensuring strong real-world applicability and deployability.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Tracking specific targets, such as pedestrians and vehicles, has been the focus of recent vision-based multitarget tracking studies. However, in some real-world scenarios, unseen categories often challenge existing methods due to low-confidence detections, weak motion and appearance constraints, and long-term occlusions. To address these issues, this article proposes a tracklet-enhanced tracker called Multi-Tracklet Tracking (MTT) that integrates flexible tracklet generation into a multi-tracklet association framework. This framework first adaptively clusters the detection results according to their short-term spatio-temporal correlation into robust tracklets and then estimates the best tracklet partitions using multiple clues, such as location and appearance over time to mitigate error propagation in long-term association. Finally, extensive experiments on the benchmark for generic multiple object tracking demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed framework.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We developed a ResNet-based human activity recognition (HAR) model with minimal overhead to detect gait versus non-gait activities and everyday activities (walking, running, stairs, standing, sitting, lying, sit-to-stand transitions). The model was trained and evaluated using smartphone sensor data from adult healthy controls (HC) and people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) with Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores between 0.0-6.5. Datasets included the GaitLab study (ISRCTN15993728), an internal Roche dataset, and publicly available data sources (training only). Data from 34 HC and 68 PwMS (mean [SD] EDSS: 4.7 [1.5]) were included in the evaluation. The HAR model showed 98.4% and 99.6% accuracy in detecting gait versus non-gait activities in the GaitLab and Roche datasets, respectively, similar to a comparative state-of-the-art ResNet model (99.3% and 99.4%). For everyday activities, the proposed model not only demonstrated higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art model (96.2% vs 91.9%; internal Roche dataset) but also maintained high performance across 9 smartphone wear locations (handbag, shopping bag, crossbody bag, backpack, hoodie pocket, coat/jacket pocket, hand, neck, belt), outperforming the state-of-the-art model by 2.8% - 9.0%. In conclusion, the proposed HAR model accurately detects everyday activities and shows high robustness to various smartphone wear locations, demonstrating its practical applicability.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Domain Adaptation (DA) aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled or sparsely labeled target domain under domain shifts. Most prior works focus on capturing the inter-domain transferability but largely overlook rich intra-domain structures, which empirically results in even worse discriminability. To tackle this tradeoff, we propose a generalized graph SPectral Alignment framework, SPA++. Its core is briefly condensed as follows: (1)-by casting the DA problem to graph primitives, it composes a coarse graph alignment mechanism with a novel spectral regularizer toward aligning the domain graphs in eigenspaces; (2)-we further develop a fine-grained neighbor-aware propagation mechanism for enhanced discriminability in the target domain; (3)-by incorporating data augmentation and consistency regularization, SPA++ can adapt to complex scenarios including most DA settings and even challenging distribution scenarios. Furthermore, we also provide theoretical analysis to support our method, including the generalization bound of graph-based DA and the role of spectral alignment and smoothing consistency. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SPA++ consistently outperforms existing cutting-edge methods, achieving superior robustness and adaptability across various challenging adaptation scenarios.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, attack, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Timely and effective incident response is key to managing the growing frequency of cyberattacks. However, identifying the right response actions for complex systems is a major technical challenge. A promising approach to mitigate this challenge is to use the security knowledge embedded in large language models (LLMs) to assist security operators during incident handling. Recent research has demonstrated the potential of this approach, but current methods are mainly based on prompt engineering of frontier LLMs, which is costly and prone to hallucinations. We address these limitations by presenting a novel way to use an LLM for incident response planning with reduced hallucination. Our method includes three steps: fine-tuning, information retrieval, and lookahead planning. We prove that our method generates response plans with a bounded probability of hallucination and that this probability can be made arbitrarily small at the expense of increased planning time under certain assumptions. Moreover, we show that our method is lightweight and can run on commodity hardware. We evaluate our method on logs from incidents reported in the literature. The experimental results show that our method a) achieves up to 22% shorter recovery times than frontier LLMs and b) generalizes to a broad range of incident types and response actions.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Hallucination remains a critical challenge for deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in finance. Accurate extraction and precise calculation from tabular data are essential for reliable financial analysis, since even minor numerical errors can undermine decision-making and regulatory compliance. Financial applications have unique requirements, often relying on context-dependent, numerical, and proprietary tabular data that existing hallucination benchmarks rarely capture. In this study, we develop a rigorous and scalable framework for evaluating intrinsic hallucinations in financial LLMs, conceptualized as a context-aware masked span prediction task over real-world financial documents. Our main contributions are: (1) a novel, automated dataset creation paradigm using a masking strategy; (2) a new hallucination evaluation dataset derived from S&P 500 annual reports; and (3) a comprehensive evaluation of intrinsic hallucination patterns in state-of-the-art LLMs on financial tabular data. Our work provides a robust methodology for in-house LLM evaluation and serves as a critical step toward building more trustworthy and reliable financial Generative AI systems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, interpretability, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Spectral information has long been recognized as a critical cue in remote sensing observations. Although numerous vision-language models have been developed for pixel-level interpretation, spectral information remains underutilized, resulting in suboptimal performance, particularly in multispectral scenarios. To address this limitation, we construct a vision-language instruction-following dataset named SPIE, which encodes spectral priors of land-cover objects into textual attributes recognizable by large language models (LLMs), based on classical spectral index computations. Leveraging this dataset, we propose SPEX, a multimodal LLM designed for instruction-driven land cover extraction. To this end, we introduce several carefully designed components and training strategies, including multiscale feature aggregation, token context condensation, and multispectral visual pre-training, to achieve precise and flexible pixel-level interpretation. To the best of our knowledge, SPEX is the first multimodal vision-language model dedicated to land cover extraction in spectral remote sensing imagery. Extensive experiments on five public multispectral datasets demonstrate that SPEX consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in extracting typical land cover categories such as vegetation, buildings, and water bodies. Moreover, SPEX is capable of generating textual explanations for its predictions, thereby enhancing interpretability and user-friendliness. Code will be released at: this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generalizable dense feature matching in endoscopic images is crucial for robot-assisted tasks, including 3D reconstruction, navigation, and surgical scene understanding. Yet, it remains a challenge due to difficult visual conditions (e.g., weak textures, large viewpoint variations) and a scarcity of annotated data. To address these challenges, we propose EndoMatcher, a generalizable endoscopic image matcher via large-scale, multi-domain data pre-training. To address difficult visual conditions, EndoMatcher employs a two-branch Vision Transformer to extract multi-scale features, enhanced by dual interaction blocks for robust correspondence learning. To overcome data scarcity and improve domain diversity, we construct Endo-Mix6, the first multi-domain dataset for endoscopic matching. Endo-Mix6 consists of approximately 1.2M real and synthetic image pairs across six domains, with correspondence labels generated using Structure-from-Motion and simulated transformations. The diversity and scale of Endo-Mix6 introduce new challenges in training stability due to significant variations in dataset sizes, distribution shifts, and error imbalance. To address them, a progressive multi-objective training strategy is employed to promote balanced learning and improve representation quality across domains. This enables EndoMatcher to generalize across unseen organs and imaging conditions in a zero-shot fashion. Extensive zero-shot matching experiments demonstrate that EndoMatcher increases the number of inlier matches by 140.69% and 201.43% on the Hamlyn and Bladder datasets over state-of-the-art methods, respectively, and improves the Matching Direction Prediction Accuracy (MDPA) by 9.40% on the Gastro-Matching dataset, achieving dense and accurate matching under challenging endoscopic conditions.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair, interpretability, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The Rate of Penetration (ROP) is crucial for optimizing drilling operations; however, accurately predicting it is hindered by the complex, dynamic, and high-dimensional nature of drilling data. Traditional empirical, physics-based, and basic machine learning models often fail to capture intricate temporal and contextual relationships, resulting in suboptimal predictions and limited real-time utility. To address this gap, we propose a novel hybrid deep learning architecture integrating Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Transformer encoders, Time-Series Mixer (TS-Mixer) blocks, and attention mechanisms to synergistically model temporal dependencies, static feature interactions, global context, and dynamic feature importance. Evaluated on a real-world drilling dataset, our model outperformed benchmarks (standalone LSTM, TS-Mixer, and simpler hybrids) with an R-squared score of 0.9988 and a Mean Absolute Percentage Error of 1.447%, as measured by standard regression metrics (R-squared, MAE, RMSE, MAPE). Model interpretability was ensured using SHAP and LIME, while actual vs. predicted curves and bias checks confirmed accuracy and fairness across scenarios. This advanced hybrid approach enables reliable real-time ROP prediction, paving the way for intelligent, cost-effective drilling optimization systems with significant operational impact.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Few-Shot Segmentation(FSS) aims to efficient segmentation of new objects with few labeled samples. However, its performance significantly degrades when domain discrepancies exist between training and deployment. Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation(CD-FSS) is proposed to mitigate such performance degradation. Current CD-FSS methods primarily sought to develop segmentation models on a source domain capable of cross-domain generalization. However, driven by escalating concerns over data privacy and the imperative to minimize data transfer and training expenses, the development of source-free CD-FSS approaches has become essential. In this work, we propose a source-free CD-FSS method that leverages both textual and visual information to facilitate target domain task adaptation without requiring source domain data. Specifically, we first append Task-Specific Attention Adapters (TSAA) to the feature pyramid of a pretrained backbone, which adapt multi-level features extracted from the shared pre-trained backbone to the target task. Then, the parameters of the TSAA are trained through a Visual-Visual Embedding Alignment (VVEA) module and a Text-Visual Embedding Alignment (TVEA) module. The VVEA module utilizes global-local visual features to align image features across different views, while the TVEA module leverages textual priors from pre-aligned multi-modal features (e.g., from CLIP) to guide cross-modal adaptation. By combining the outputs of these modules through dense comparison operations and subsequent fusion via skip connections, our method produces refined prediction masks. Under both 1-shot and 5-shot settings, the proposed approach achieves average segmentation accuracy improvements of 2.18\% and 4.11\%, respectively, across four cross-domain datasets, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art CD-FSS methods.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, robust, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed clients while preserving data privacy by keeping data local. Traditional FL approaches rely on a centralized, star-shaped topology, where a central server aggregates model updates from clients. However, this architecture introduces several limitations, including a single point of failure, limited personalization, and poor robustness to distribution shifts or vulnerability to malfunctioning clients. Moreover, update selection in centralized FL often relies on low-level parameter differences, which can be unreliable when client data is not independent and identically distributed, and offer clients little control. In this work, we propose a decentralized, peer-to-peer (P2P) FL framework. It leverages the flexibility of the P2P topology to enable each client to identify and aggregate a personalized set of trustworthy and beneficial this http URL framework is the Local Inference Guided Aggregation for Heterogeneous Training Environments to Yield Enhancement Through Agreement and Regularization (LIGHTYEAR). Central to our method is an agreement score, computed on a local validation set, which quantifies the semantic alignment of incoming updates in the function space with respect to the clients reference model. Each client uses this score to select a tailored subset of updates and performs aggregation with a regularization term that further stabilizes the training. Our empirical evaluation across two datasets shows that the proposed approach consistently outperforms both centralized baselines and existing P2P methods in terms of client-level performance, particularly under adversarial and heterogeneous conditions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>data-free, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Traditional parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods such as LoRA are tightly coupled with the base model architecture, which constrains their applicability across heterogeneous pretrained large language models (LLMs). To address this limitation, we introduce Cross-LoRA, a data-free framework for transferring LoRA modules between diverse base models without requiring additional training data. Cross-LoRA consists of two key components: (a) LoRA-Align, which performs subspace alignment between source and target base models through rank-truncated singular value decomposition (SVD) and Frobenius-optimal linear transformation, ensuring compatibility under dimension mismatch; and (b) LoRA-Shift, which applies the aligned subspaces to project source LoRA weight updates into the target model parameter space. Both components are data-free, training-free, and enable lightweight adaptation on a commodity GPU in 20 minutes. Experiments on ARCs, OBOA and HellaSwag show that Cross-LoRA achieves relative gains of up to 5.26% over base models. Across other commonsense reasoning benchmarks, Cross-LoRA maintains performance comparable to that of directly trained LoRA adapters.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The surge in rich multimodal content on social media platforms has greatly advanced Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA), with Large Language Models (LLMs) further accelerating progress in this field. Current approaches primarily leverage the knowledge and reasoning capabilities of parameter-heavy (Multimodal) LLMs for sentiment classification, overlooking autonomous multimodal sentiment reasoning generation in resource-constrained environments. Therefore, we focus on the Resource-Limited Joint Multimodal Sentiment Reasoning and Classification task, JMSRC, which simultaneously performs multimodal sentiment reasoning chain generation and sentiment classification only with a lightweight model. We propose a Multimodal Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Distillation model, MulCoT-RD, designed for JMSRC that employs a "Teacher-Assistant-Student" distillation paradigm to address deployment constraints in resource-limited environments. We first leverage a high-performance Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to generate the initial reasoning dataset and train a medium-sized assistant model with a multi-task learning mechanism. A lightweight student model is jointly trained to perform efficient multimodal sentiment reasoning generation and classification. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that MulCoT-RD with only 3B parameters achieves strong performance on JMSRC, while exhibiting robust generalization and enhanced interpretability.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Arbitrary viewpoint image generation holds significant potential for autonomous driving, yet remains a challenging task due to the lack of ground-truth data for extrapolated views, which hampers the training of high-fidelity generative models. In this work, we propose Arbiviewgen, a novel diffusion-based framework for the generation of controllable camera images from arbitrary points of view. To address the absence of ground-truth data in unseen views, we introduce two key components: Feature-Aware Adaptive View Stitching (FAVS) and Cross-View Consistency Self-Supervised Learning (CVC-SSL). FAVS employs a hierarchical matching strategy that first establishes coarse geometric correspondences using camera poses, then performs fine-grained alignment through improved feature matching algorithms, and identifies high-confidence matching regions via clustering analysis. Building upon this, CVC-SSL adopts a self-supervised training paradigm where the model reconstructs the original camera views from the synthesized stitched images using a diffusion model, enforcing cross-view consistency without requiring supervision from extrapolated data. Our framework requires only multi-camera images and their associated poses for training, eliminating the need for additional sensors or depth maps. To our knowledge, Arbiviewgen is the first method capable of controllable arbitrary view camera image generation in multiple vehicle configurations.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This report synthesizes eight seminal papers on the zero-shot adversarial robustness of vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP. A central challenge in this domain is the inherent trade-off between enhancing adversarial robustness and preserving the model's zero-shot generalization capabilities. We analyze two primary defense paradigms: Adversarial Fine-Tuning (AFT), which modifies model parameters, and Training-Free/Test-Time Defenses, which preserve them. We trace the evolution from alignment-preserving methods (TeCoA) to embedding space re-engineering (LAAT, TIMA), and from input heuristics (AOM, TTC) to latent-space purification (CLIPure). Finally, we identify key challenges and future directions including hybrid defense strategies and adversarial pre-training.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Structured pruning is one of the representative techniques for compressing large language models (LLMs) to reduce GPU memory consumption and accelerate inference speed. It offers significant practical value in improving the efficiency of LLMs in real-world applications. Current structured pruning methods typically rely on assessment of the importance of the structure units and pruning the units with less importance. Most of them overlooks the interaction and collaboration among artificial neurons that are crucial for the functionalities of LLMs, leading to a disruption in the macro functional architecture of LLMs and consequently a pruning performance degradation. Inspired by the inherent similarities between artificial neural networks and functional neural networks in the human brain, we alleviate this challenge and propose to prune LLMs by identifying and preserving functional networks within LLMs in this study. To achieve this, we treat an LLM as a digital brain and decompose the LLM into functional networks, analogous to identifying functional brain networks in neuroimaging data. Afterwards, an LLM is pruned by preserving the key neurons within these functional networks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can successfully identify and locate functional networks and key neurons in LLMs, enabling efficient model pruning.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Code large language models (LLMs) have become indispensable tools for building efficient and automated coding pipelines. Existing models are typically post-trained using reinforcement learning (RL) from general-purpose LLMs using "human instruction-final answer" pairs, where the instructions are usually from manual annotations. However, collecting high-quality coding instructions is both labor-intensive and difficult to scale. On the other hand, code snippets are abundantly available from various sources. This imbalance presents a major bottleneck in instruction-based post-training. We propose CodeBoost, a post-training framework that enhances code LLMs purely from code snippets, without relying on human-annotated instructions. CodeBoost introduces the following key components: (1) maximum-clique curation, which selects a representative and diverse training corpus from code; (2) bi-directional prediction, which enables the model to learn from both forward and backward prediction objectives; (3) error-aware prediction, which incorporates learning signals from both correct and incorrect outputs; (4) heterogeneous augmentation, which diversifies the training distribution to enrich code semantics; and (5) heterogeneous rewarding, which guides model learning through multiple reward types including format correctness and execution feedback from both successes and failures. Extensive experiments across several code LLMs and benchmarks verify that CodeBoost consistently improves performance, demonstrating its effectiveness as a scalable and effective training pipeline.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Medical image understanding plays a crucial role in enabling automated diagnosis and data-driven clinical decision support. However, its progress is impeded by two primary challenges: the limited availability of high-quality annotated medical data and an overreliance on global image features, which often miss subtle but clinically significant pathological regions. To address these issues, we introduce RegionMed-CLIP, a region-aware multimodal contrastive learning framework that explicitly incorporates localized pathological signals along with holistic semantic representations. The core of our method is an innovative region-of-interest (ROI) processor that adaptively integrates fine-grained regional features with the global context, supported by a progressive training strategy that enhances hierarchical multimodal alignment. To enable large-scale region-level representation learning, we construct MedRegion-500k, a comprehensive medical image-text corpus that features extensive regional annotations and multilevel clinical descriptions. Extensive experiments on image-text retrieval, zero-shot classification, and visual question answering tasks demonstrate that RegionMed-CLIP consistently exceeds state-of-the-art vision language models by a wide margin. Our results highlight the critical importance of region-aware contrastive pre-training and position RegionMed-CLIP as a robust foundation for advancing multimodal medical image understanding.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Gender classification is attractive in a range of applications, including surveillance and monitoring, corporate profiling, and human-computer interaction. Individuals' identities may be gleaned from information about their gender, which is a kind of soft this http URL the years, several methods for determining a person's gender have been devised. Some of the most well-known ones are based on physical characteristics like face, fingerprint, palmprint, DNA, ears, gait, and iris. On the other hand, facial features account for the vast majority of gender classification methods. Also, the iris is a significant biometric trait because the iris, according to research, remains basically constant during an individual's life. Besides that, the iris is externally visible and is non-invasive to the user, which is important for practical applications. Furthermore, there are already high-quality methods for segmenting and encoding iris images, and the current methods facilitate selecting and extracting attribute vectors from iris textures. This study discusses several approaches to determining gender. The previous works of literature are briefly reviewed. Additionally, there are a variety of methodologies for different steps of gender classification. This study provides researchers with knowledge and analysis of the existing gender classification approaches. Also, it will assist researchers who are interested in this specific area, as well as highlight the gaps and challenges in the field, and finally provide suggestions and future paths for improvement.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture has become a predominant paradigm for scaling large language models (LLMs). Despite offering strong performance and computational efficiency, large MoE-based LLMs like DeepSeek-V3-0324 and Kimi-K2-Instruct present serious challenges due to substantial memory requirements in deployment. While recent works have explored MoE compression to address this issue, existing methods often suffer from considerable accuracy drops (e.g., 7-14% relatively) even at modest compression rates. This paper introduces a novel Mixture-of-Basis-Experts (MoBE) method that achieves model compression while incurring minimal accuracy drops. Specifically, each up/gate matrix in an expert is decomposed via a rank decomposition as W = AB, where matrix A is unique to each expert. The relatively larger matrix B is further re-parameterized as a linear combination of basis matrices {Bi} shared across all experts within a given MoE layer. The factorization is learned by minimizing the reconstruction error relative to the original weight matrices. Experiments demonstrate that MoBE achieves notably lower accuracy drops compared to prior works. For instance, MoBE can reduce the parameter counts of Qwen3-235B-A22B-2507, DeepSeek-V3-0324 (671B) and Kimi-K2-Instruct (1T) by 24%-30% with only 1%-2% accuracy drop (about 2% drops when measured relatively).</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Intraoperative fluorescent cardiac imaging enables quality control following coronary bypass grafting surgery. We can estimate local quantitative indicators, such as cardiac perfusion, by tracking local feature points. However, heart motion and significant fluctuations in image characteristics caused by vessel structural enrichment limit traditional tracking methods. We propose a particle filtering tracker based on cyclicconsistency checks to robustly track particles sampled to follow target landmarks. Our method tracks 117 targets simultaneously at 25.4 fps, allowing real-time estimates during interventions. It achieves a tracking error of (5.00 +/- 0.22 px) and outperforms other deep learning trackers (22.3 +/- 1.1 px) and conventional trackers (58.1 +/- 27.1 px).</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) aims to combine the thermal radiation information from infrared images with the rich texture details from visible images to enhance perceptual capabilities for downstream visual tasks. However, existing methods often fail to preserve key targets due to a lack of deep semantic understanding of the scene, while the fusion process itself can also introduce artifacts and detail loss, severely compromising both image quality and task performance. To address these issues, this paper proposes SGDFuse, a conditional diffusion model guided by the Segment Anything Model (SAM), to achieve high-fidelity and semantically-aware image fusion. The core of our method is to utilize high-quality semantic masks generated by SAM as explicit priors to guide the optimization of the fusion process via a conditional diffusion model. Specifically, the framework operates in a two-stage process: it first performs a preliminary fusion of multi-modal features, and then utilizes the semantic masks from SAM jointly with the preliminary fused image as a condition to drive the diffusion model's coarse-to-fine denoising generation. This ensures the fusion process not only has explicit semantic directionality but also guarantees the high fidelity of the final result. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SGDFuse achieves state-of-the-art performance in both subjective and objective evaluations, as well as in its adaptability to downstream tasks, providing a powerful solution to the core challenges in image fusion.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Understanding dynamic outdoor environments requires capturing complex object interactions and their evolution over time. LiDAR-based 4D point clouds provide precise spatial geometry and rich temporal cues, making them ideal for representing real-world scenes. However, despite their potential, 4D LiDAR remains underexplored in the context of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) due to the absence of high-quality, modality-specific annotations and the lack of MLLM architectures capable of processing its high-dimensional composition. To address these challenges, we introduce B4DL, a new benchmark specifically designed for training and evaluating MLLMs on 4D LiDAR understanding. In addition, we propose a scalable data generation pipeline and an MLLM model that, for the first time, directly processes raw 4D LiDAR by bridging it with language understanding. Combined with our dataset and benchmark, our model offers a unified solution for spatio-temporal reasoning in dynamic outdoor environments.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Change detection in remote sensing imagery plays a vital role in various engineering applications, such as natural disaster monitoring, urban expansion tracking, and infrastructure management. Despite the remarkable progress of deep learning in recent years, most existing methods still rely on spatial-domain modeling, where the limited diversity of feature representations hinders the detection of subtle change regions. We observe that frequency-domain feature modeling particularly in the wavelet domain an amplify fine-grained differences in frequency components, enhancing the perception of edge changes that are challenging to capture in the spatial domain. Thus, we propose a method called Wavelet-Guided Dual-Frequency Encoding (WGDF). Specifically, we first apply Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to decompose the input images into high-frequency and low-frequency components, which are used to model local details and global structures, respectively. In the high-frequency branch, we design a Dual-Frequency Feature Enhancement (DFFE) module to strengthen edge detail representation and introduce a Frequency-Domain Interactive Difference (FDID) module to enhance the modeling of fine-grained changes. In the low-frequency branch, we exploit Transformers to capture global semantic relationships and employ a Progressive Contextual Difference Module (PCDM) to progressively refine change regions, enabling precise structural semantic characterization. Finally, the high- and low-frequency features are synergistically fused to unify local sensitivity with global discriminability. Extensive experiments on multiple remote sensing datasets demonstrate that WGDF significantly alleviates edge ambiguity and achieves superior detection accuracy and robustness compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the reliability of these reasoning chains remains a critical challenge. A widely held "cascading failure" hypothesis suggests that errors are most detrimental when they occur early in the reasoning process. This paper challenges that assumption through systematic error-injection experiments, revealing a counter-intuitive phenomenon we term "Late-Stage Fragility": errors introduced in the later stages of a CoT chain are significantly more likely to corrupt the final answer than identical errors made at the beginning. To address this specific vulnerability, we introduce the Adaptive Self-Correction Chain-of-Thought (ASCoT) method. ASCoT employs a modular pipeline in which an Adaptive Verification Manager (AVM) operates first, followed by the Multi-Perspective Self-Correction Engine (MSCE). The AVM leverages a Positional Impact Score function I(k) that assigns different weights based on the position within the reasoning chains, addressing the Late-Stage Fragility issue by identifying and prioritizing high-risk, late-stage steps. Once these critical steps are identified, the MSCE applies robust, dual-path correction specifically to the failure parts. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as GSM8K and MATH demonstrate that ASCoT achieves outstanding accuracy, outperforming strong baselines, including standard CoT. Our work underscores the importance of diagnosing specific failure modes in LLM reasoning and advocates for a shift from uniform verification strategies to adaptive, vulnerability-aware correction mechanisms.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Meta-reviewing is a pivotal stage in the peer-review process, serving as the final step in determining whether a paper is recommended for acceptance. Prior research on meta-reviewing has treated this as a summarization problem over review reports. However, complementary to this perspective, meta-reviewing is a decision-making process that requires weighing reviewer arguments and placing them within a broader context. Prior research has demonstrated that decision-makers can be effectively assisted in such scenarios via dialogue agents. In line with this framing, we explore the practical challenges for realizing dialog agents that can effectively assist meta-reviewers. Concretely, we first address the issue of data scarcity for training dialogue agents by generating synthetic data using Large Language Models (LLMs) based on a self-refinement strategy to improve the relevance of these dialogues to expert domains. Our experiments demonstrate that this method produces higher-quality synthetic data and can serve as a valuable resource towards training meta-reviewing assistants. Subsequently, we utilize this data to train dialogue agents tailored for meta-reviewing and find that these agents outperform \emph{off-the-shelf} LLM-based assistants for this task. Finally, we apply our agents in real-world meta-reviewing scenarios and confirm their effectiveness in enhancing the efficiency of meta-reviewing.\footnote{Code and Data: this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Foundation models (FMs) have transformed natural language processing, but their success has not yet translated to time series forecasting. Existing time series foundation models (TSFMs), often based on transformer variants, struggle with generalization across varying context and target lengths, lack adaptability to different sampling rates, and are computationally inefficient. We introduce FlowState, a novel TSFM architecture that addresses these challenges through two key innovations: a state space model (SSM) based encoder and a functional basis decoder. This design enables continuous-time modeling and dynamic time-scale adjustment, allowing FlowState to inherently generalize across all possible temporal resolutions, and dynamically adjust the forecasting horizons. In contrast to other state-of-the-art TSFMs, which require training data across all possible sampling rates to memorize patterns at each scale, FlowState inherently adapts its internal dynamics to the input scale, enabling smaller models, reduced data requirements, and improved efficiency. We further propose an efficient pretraining strategy that improves robustness and accelerates training. Despite being the smallest model, FlowState outperforms all other models and is state-of-the-art for the GIFT-ZS and the Chronos-ZS benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of its components, and we demonstrate its unique ability to adapt online to varying input sampling rates.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Conversational recommender systems (CRS) based on Large Language Models (LLMs) need to constantly be aligned to the user preferences to provide satisfying and context-relevant item recommendations. The traditional supervised fine-tuning cannot capture the implicit feedback signal, e.g., dwell time, sentiment polarity, or engagement patterns. In this paper, we share a fine-tuning solution using human feedback reinforcement learning (RLHF) to maximize implied user feedback (IUF) in a multi-turn recommendation context. We specify a reward model $R_{\phi}$ learnt on weakly-labelled engagement information and maximize user-centric utility by optimizing the foundational LLM M_{\theta} through a proximal policy optimization (PPO) approach. The architecture models conversational state transitions $s_t \to a_t \to s_{t +1}$, where the action $a_t$ is associated with LLM-generated item suggestions only on condition of conversation history in the past. The evaluation across synthetic and real-world datasets (this http URL, OpenDialKG) demonstrates that our RLHF-fine-tuned models can perform better in terms of top-$k$ recommendation accuracy, coherence, and user satisfaction compared to (arrow-zero-cmwrquca-teja-falset ensuite 2Round group-deca States penalty give up This paper shows that implicit signal alignment can be efficient in achieving scalable and user-adaptive design of CRS.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, transformer, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In recent years, large-scale visual backbones have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in learning general-purpose features from images via extensive pre-training. Concurrently, many efficient architectures have emerged that have performance comparable to that of larger models on in-domain benchmarks. However, we observe that for smaller models, the performance drop on out-of-distribution (OOD) data is disproportionately larger, indicating a deficiency in the generalization performance of existing efficient models. To address this, we identify key architectural bottlenecks and inappropriate design choices that contribute to this issue, retaining robustness for smaller models. To restore the global field of pure window attention, we further introduce a Coordinator-patch Cross Attention (CoCA) mechanism, featuring dynamic, domain-aware global tokens that enhance local-global feature modeling and adaptively capture robust patterns across domains with minimal computational overhead. Integrating these advancements, we present CoCAViT, a novel visual backbone designed for robust real-time visual representation. Extensive experiments empirically validate our design. At a resolution of 224*224, CoCAViT-28M achieves 84.0% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, with significant gains on multiple OOD benchmarks, compared to competing models. It also attains 52.2 mAP on COCO object detection and 51.3 mIOU on ADE20K semantic segmentation, while maintaining low latency.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recently, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been proposed to expand internal knowledge of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by incorporating external knowledge databases into the generation process, which is widely used for knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks. Despite impressive advancements, vanilla RAG-based VQA methods that rely on unstructured documents and overlook the structural relationships among knowledge elements frequently introduce irrelevant or misleading content, reducing answer accuracy and reliability. To overcome these challenges, a promising solution is to integrate multimodal knowledge graphs (KGs) into RAG-based VQA frameworks to enhance the generation by introducing structured multimodal knowledge. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel multimodal knowledge-augmented generation framework (mKG-RAG) based on multimodal KGs for knowledge-intensive VQA tasks. Specifically, our approach leverages MLLM-powered keyword extraction and vision-text matching to distill semantically consistent and modality-aligned entities/relationships from multimodal documents, constructing high-quality multimodal KGs as structured knowledge representations. In addition, a dual-stage retrieval strategy equipped with a question-aware multimodal retriever is introduced to improve retrieval efficiency while refining precision. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods, setting a new state-of-the-art for knowledge-based VQA.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent progress in large pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) has reached state-of-the-art performance on several object detection benchmarks and boasts strong zero-shot capabilities, but for optimal performance on specific targets some form of finetuning is still necessary. While the initial VLM weights allow for great few-shot transfer learning, this usually involves the loss of the original natural language querying and zero-shot capabilities. Inspired by the success of Textual Inversion (TI) in personalizing text-to-image diffusion models, we propose a similar formulation for open-vocabulary object detection. TI allows extending the VLM vocabulary by learning new or improving existing tokens to accurately detect novel or fine-grained objects from as little as three examples. The learned tokens are completely compatible with the original VLM weights while keeping them frozen, retaining the original model's benchmark performance, and leveraging its existing capabilities such as zero-shot domain transfer (e.g., detecting a sketch of an object after training only on real photos). The storage and gradient calculations are limited to the token embedding dimension, requiring significantly less compute than full-model fine-tuning. We evaluated whether the method matches or outperforms the baseline methods that suffer from forgetting in a wide variety of quantitative and qualitative experiments.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Chest X-ray report generation aims to reduce radiologists' workload by automatically producing high-quality preliminary reports. A critical yet underexplored aspect of this task is the effective use of patient-specific prior knowledge -- including clinical context (e.g., symptoms, medical history) and the most recent prior image -- which radiologists routinely rely on for diagnostic reasoning. Most existing methods generate reports from single images, neglecting this essential prior information and thus failing to capture diagnostic intent or disease progression. To bridge this gap, we propose PriorRG, a novel chest X-ray report generation framework that emulates real-world clinical workflows via a two-stage training pipeline. In Stage 1, we introduce a prior-guided contrastive pre-training scheme that leverages clinical context to guide spatiotemporal feature extraction, allowing the model to align more closely with the intrinsic spatiotemporal semantics in radiology reports. In Stage 2, we present a prior-aware coarse-to-fine decoding for report generation that progressively integrates patient-specific prior knowledge with the vision encoder's hidden states. This decoding allows the model to align with diagnostic focus and track disease progression, thereby enhancing the clinical accuracy and fluency of the generated reports. Extensive experiments on MIMIC-CXR and MIMIC-ABN datasets demonstrate that PriorRG outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 3.6% BLEU-4 and 3.8% F1 score improvement on MIMIC-CXR, and a 5.9% BLEU-1 gain on MIMIC-ABN. Code and checkpoints will be released upon acceptance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Agentic Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and 'deep research' systems aim to enable autonomous search processes where Large Language Models (LLMs) iteratively refine outputs. However, applying these systems to domain-specific professional search, such as biomedical research, presents challenges, as automated systems may reduce user involvement and misalign with expert information needs. Professional search tasks often demand high levels of user expertise and transparency. The BioASQ CLEF 2025 challenge, using expert-formulated questions, can serve as a platform to study these issues. We explored the performance of current reasoning and nonreasoning LLMs like Gemini-Flash 2.0, o3-mini, o4-mini and DeepSeek-R1. A key aspect of our methodology was a self-feedback mechanism where LLMs generated, evaluated, and then refined their outputs for query expansion and for multiple answer types (yes/no, factoid, list, ideal). We investigated whether this iterative self-correction improves performance and if reasoning models are more capable of generating useful feedback. Preliminary results indicate varied performance for the self-feedback strategy across models and tasks. This work offers insights into LLM self-correction and informs future work on comparing the effectiveness of LLM-generated feedback with direct human expert input in these search systems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As medical imaging is central to diagnostic processes, automating the generation of radiology reports has become increasingly relevant to assist radiologists with their heavy workloads. Most current methods rely solely on global image features, failing to capture fine-grained organ relationships crucial for accurate reporting. To this end, we propose CT-GRAPH, a hierarchical graph attention network that explicitly models radiological knowledge by structuring anatomical regions into a graph, linking fine-grained organ features to coarser anatomical systems and a global patient context. Our method leverages pretrained 3D medical feature encoders to obtain global and organ-level features by utilizing anatomical masks. These features are further refined within the graph and then integrated into a large language model to generate detailed medical reports. We evaluate our approach for the task of report generation on the large-scale chest CT dataset CT-RATE. We provide an in-depth analysis of pretrained feature encoders for CT report generation and show that our method achieves a substantial improvement of absolute 7.9\% in F1 score over current state-of-the-art methods.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Modern RL-based post-training for large language models (LLMs) co-locate trajectory sampling and policy optimisation on the same GPU cluster, forcing the system to switch between inference and training workloads. This serial context switching violates the single-program-multiple-data (SPMD) assumption underlying today's distributed training systems. We present Echo, the RL system that cleanly decouples these two phases across heterogeneous "inference" and "training" swarms while preserving statistical efficiency. Echo introduces two lightweight synchronization protocols: a sequential pull mode that refreshes sampler weights on every API call for minimal bias, and an asynchronous push-pull mode that streams version-tagged rollouts through a replay buffer to maximise hardware utilisation. Training three representative RL workloads with Qwen3-4B, Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen3-32B on a geographically distributed cluster, Echo matches a fully co-located Verl baseline in convergence speed and final reward while off-loading trajectory generation to commodity edge hardware. These promising results demonstrate that large-scale RL for LLMs could achieve datacentre-grade performance using decentralised, heterogeneous resources.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, transformer, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text-to-image (T2I) generation has been actively studied using Diffusion Models and Autoregressive Models. Recently, Masked Generative Transformers have gained attention as an alternative to Autoregressive Models to overcome the inherent limitations of causal attention and autoregressive decoding through bidirectional attention and parallel decoding, enabling efficient and high-quality image generation. However, compositional T2I generation remains challenging, as even state-of-the-art Diffusion Models often fail to accurately bind attributes and achieve proper text-image alignment. While Diffusion Models have been extensively studied for this issue, Masked Generative Transformers exhibit similar limitations but have not been explored in this context. To address this, we propose Unmasking with Contrastive Attention Guidance (UNCAGE), a novel training-free method that improves compositional fidelity by leveraging attention maps to prioritize the unmasking of tokens that clearly represent individual objects. UNCAGE consistently improves performance in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations across multiple benchmarks and metrics, with negligible inference overhead.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>defense, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent studies have shown that deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where a designed trigger is injected into the dataset, causing erroneous predictions when activated. In this paper, we propose a novel defense mechanism, Non-target label Training and Mutual Learning (NT-ML), which can successfully restore the poisoned model under advanced backdoor attacks. NT aims to reduce the harm of poisoned data by retraining the model with the outputs of the standard training. At this stage, a teacher model with high accuracy on clean data and a student model with higher confidence in correct prediction on poisoned data are obtained. Then, the teacher and student can learn the strengths from each other through ML to obtain a purified student model. Extensive experiments show that NT-ML can effectively defend against 6 backdoor attacks with a small number of clean samples, and outperforms 5 state-of-the-art backdoor defenses.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>defense, attack, biometric</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Biometric systems, such as face recognition systems powered by deep neural networks (DNNs), rely on large and highly sensitive datasets. Backdoor attacks can subvert these systems by manipulating the training process. By inserting a small trigger, such as a sticker, make-up, or patterned mask, into a few training images, an adversary can later present the same trigger during authentication to be falsely recognized as another individual, thereby gaining unauthorized access. Existing defense mechanisms against backdoor attacks still face challenges in precisely identifying and mitigating poisoned images without compromising data utility, which undermines the overall reliability of the system. We propose a novel and generalizable approach, TrueBiometric: Trustworthy Biometrics, which accurately detects poisoned images using a majority voting mechanism leveraging multiple state-of-the-art large vision language models. Once identified, poisoned samples are corrected using targeted and calibrated corrective noise. Our extensive empirical results demonstrate that TrueBiometric detects and corrects poisoned images with 100\% accuracy without compromising accuracy on clean images. Compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches, TrueBiometric offers a more practical, accurate, and effective solution for mitigating backdoor attacks in face recognition systems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Molecular generation conditioned on textual descriptions is a fundamental task in computational chemistry and drug discovery. Existing methods often struggle to simultaneously ensure high-quality, diverse generation and fast inference. In this work, we propose a novel causality-aware framework that addresses these challenges through two key innovations. First, we introduce a Causality-Aware Transformer (CAT) that jointly encodes molecular graph tokens and text instructions while enforcing causal dependencies during generation. Second, we develop a Variational Mean Flow (VMF) framework that generalizes existing flow-based methods by modeling the latent space as a mixture of Gaussians, enhancing expressiveness beyond unimodal priors. VMF enables efficient one-step inference while maintaining strong generation quality and diversity. Extensive experiments on four standard molecular benchmarks demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher novelty (up to 74.5\%), diversity (up to 70.3\%), and 100\% validity across all datasets. Moreover, VMF requires only one number of function evaluation (NFE) during conditional generation and up to five NFEs for unconditional generation, offering substantial computational efficiency over diffusion-based methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, attack, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The advancement of deep object detectors has greatly affected safety-critical fields like autonomous driving. However, physical adversarial camouflage poses a significant security risk by altering object textures to deceive detectors. Existing techniques struggle with variable physical environments, facing two main challenges: 1) inconsistent sampling point densities across distances hinder the gradient optimization from ensuring local continuity, and 2) updating texture gradients from multiple angles causes conflicts, reducing optimization stability and attack effectiveness. To address these issues, we propose a novel adversarial camouflage framework based on gradient optimization. First, we introduce a gradient calibration strategy, which ensures consistent gradient updates across distances by propagating gradients from sparsely to unsampled texture points. Additionally, we develop a gradient decorrelation method, which prioritizes and orthogonalizes gradients based on loss values, enhancing stability and effectiveness in multi-angle optimization by eliminating redundant or conflicting updates. Extensive experimental results on various detection models, angles and distances show that our method significantly exceeds the state of the art, with an average increase in attack success rate (ASR) of 13.46% across distances and 11.03% across angles. Furthermore, empirical evaluation in real-world scenarios highlights the need for more robust system design.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Forecasting stock and cryptocurrency prices is challenging due to high volatility and non-stationarity, influenced by factors like economic changes and market sentiment. Previous research shows that Echo State Networks (ESNs) can effectively model short-term stock market movements, capturing nonlinear patterns in dynamic data. To the best of our knowledge, this work is among the first to explore ESNs for cryptocurrency forecasting, especially during extreme volatility. We also conduct chaos analysis through the Lyapunov exponent in chaotic periods and show that our approach outperforms existing machine learning methods by a significant margin. Our findings are consistent with the Lyapunov exponent analysis, showing that ESNs are robust during chaotic periods and excel under high chaos compared to Boosting and Naïve methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, federate, fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated learning (FL) is a widely adopted paradigm for privacy-preserving model training, but FedAvg optimise for the majority while under-serving minority clients. Existing methods such as federated multi-objective learning (FMOL) attempts to import multi-objective optimisation (MOO) into FL. However, it merely delivers task-wise Pareto-stationary points, leaving client fairness to chance. In this paper, we introduce Conically-Regularised FMOL (CR-FMOL), the first federated MOO framework that enforces client-wise Pareto optimality through a novel preference-cone constraint. After local federated multi-gradient descent averaging (FMGDA) / federated stochastic multi-gradient descent averaging (FSMGDA) steps, each client transmits its aggregated task-loss vector as an implicit preference; the server then solves a cone-constrained Pareto-MTL sub-problem centred at the uniform vector, producing a descent direction that is Pareto-stationary for every client within its cone. Experiments on non-IID benchmarks show that CR-FMOL enhances client fairness, and although the early-stage performance is slightly inferior to FedAvg, it is expected to achieve comparable accuracy given sufficient training rounds.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have broadened their applicability across diverse tasks, yet specialized domains still require targeted post training. Among existing methods, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) stands out for its efficiency, leveraging groupwise relative rewards while avoiding costly value function learning. However, GRPO treats candidate responses as independent, overlooking semantic interactions such as complementarity and contradiction. To address this challenge, we first introduce a Structural Causal Model (SCM) that reveals hidden dependencies among candidate responses induced by conditioning on a final integrated output forming a collider structure. Then, our causal analysis leads to two insights: (1) projecting responses onto a causally informed subspace improves prediction quality, and (2) this projection yields a better baseline than query only conditioning. Building on these insights, we propose Group Causal Policy Optimization (GCPO), which integrates causal structure into optimization through two key components: a causally informed reward adjustment and a novel KL regularization term that aligns the policy with a causally projected reference distribution. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that GCPO consistently surpasses existing methods, including GRPO across multiple reasoning benchmarks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit cultural biases due to training data dominated by high-resource languages like English and Chinese. This poses challenges for accurately representing and evaluating diverse cultural contexts, particularly in low-resource language settings. To address this, we introduce MyCulture, a benchmark designed to comprehensively evaluate LLMs on Malaysian culture across six pillars: arts, attire, customs, entertainment, food, and religion presented in Bahasa Melayu. Unlike conventional benchmarks, MyCulture employs a novel open-ended multiple-choice question format without predefined options, thereby reducing guessing and mitigating format bias. We provide a theoretical justification for the effectiveness of this open-ended structure in improving both fairness and discriminative power. Furthermore, we analyze structural bias by comparing model performance on structured versus free-form outputs, and assess language bias through multilingual prompt variations. Our evaluation across a range of regional and international LLMs reveals significant disparities in cultural comprehension, highlighting the urgent need for culturally grounded and linguistically inclusive benchmarks in the development and assessment of LLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Interpretability and high performance are essential goals in designing control policies, particularly for safety-critical tasks. Deep reinforcement learning has greatly enhanced performance, yet its inherent lack of interpretability often undermines trust and hinders real-world deployment. This work addresses these dual challenges by introducing a novel approach for programmatic policy discovery, called Multimodal Large Language Model-assisted Evolutionary Search (MLES). MLES utilizes multimodal large language models as policy generators, combining them with evolutionary mechanisms for automatic policy optimization. It integrates visual feedback-driven behavior analysis within the policy generation process to identify failure patterns and facilitate targeted improvements, enhancing the efficiency of policy discovery and producing adaptable, human-aligned policies. Experimental results show that MLES achieves policy discovery capabilities and efficiency comparable to Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) across two control tasks, while offering transparent control logic and traceable design processes. This paradigm overcomes the limitations of predefined domain-specific languages, facilitates knowledge transfer and reuse, and is scalable across various control tasks. MLES shows promise as a leading approach for the next generation of interpretable control policy discovery.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Accurate time-to-event prediction is integral to decision-making, informing medical guidelines, hiring decisions, and resource allocation. Survival analysis, the quantitative framework used to model time-to-event data, accounts for patients who do not experience the event of interest during the study period, known as censored patients. However, many patients experience events that prevent the observation of the outcome of interest. These competing risks are often treated as censoring, a practice frequently overlooked due to a limited understanding of its consequences. Our work theoretically demonstrates why treating competing risks as censoring introduces substantial bias in survival estimates, leading to systematic overestimation of risk and, critically, amplifying disparities. First, we formalize the problem of misclassifying competing risks as censoring and quantify the resulting error in survival estimates. Specifically, we develop a framework to estimate this error and demonstrate the associated implications for predictive performance and algorithmic fairness. Furthermore, we examine how differing risk profiles across demographic groups lead to group-specific errors, potentially exacerbating existing disparities. Our findings, supported by an empirical analysis of cardiovascular management, demonstrate that ignoring competing risks disproportionately impacts the individuals most at risk of these events, potentially accentuating inequity. By quantifying the error and highlighting the fairness implications of the common practice of considering competing risks as censoring, our work provides a critical insight into the development of survival models: practitioners must account for competing risks to improve accuracy, reduce disparities in risk assessment, and better inform downstream decisions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Making decisions with respect to just the expected returns in Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) cannot account for the potential range of high-risk, adverse outcomes associated with a decision. To this end, safety-aware MCTS often consider some constrained variants -- by introducing some form of mean risk measures or hard cost thresholds. These approaches fail to provide rigorous tail-safety guarantees with respect to extreme or high-risk outcomes (denoted as tail-risk), potentially resulting in serious consequence in high-stake scenarios. This paper addresses the problem by developing two novel solutions. We first propose CVaR-MCTS, which embeds a coherent tail risk measure, Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR), into MCTS. Our CVaR-MCTS with parameter $\alpha$ achieves explicit tail-risk control over the expected loss in the "worst $(1-\alpha)\%$ scenarios." Second, we further address the estimation bias of tail-risk due to limited samples. We propose Wasserstein-MCTS (or W-MCTS) by introducing a first-order Wasserstein ambiguity set $\mathcal{P}_{\varepsilon_{s}}(s,a)$ with radius $\varepsilon_{s}$ to characterize the uncertainty in tail-risk estimates. We prove PAC tail-safety guarantees for both CVaR-MCTS and W-MCTS and establish their regret. Evaluations on diverse simulated environments demonstrate that our proposed methods outperform existing baselines, effectively achieving robust tail-risk guarantees with improved rewards and stability.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, fair, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Existing evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) on static benchmarks is vulnerable to data contamination and leaderboard overfitting, critical issues that obscure true model capabilities. To address this, we introduce LLMEval-3, a framework for dynamic evaluation of LLMs. LLMEval-3 is built on a proprietary bank of 220k graduate-level questions, from which it dynamically samples unseen test sets for each evaluation run. Its automated pipeline ensures integrity via contamination-resistant data curation, a novel anti-cheating architecture, and a calibrated LLM-as-a-judge process achieving 90% agreement with human experts, complemented by a relative ranking system for fair comparison. An 20-month longitudinal study of nearly 50 leading models reveals a performance ceiling on knowledge memorization and exposes data contamination vulnerabilities undetectable by static benchmarks. The framework demonstrates exceptional robustness in ranking stability and consistency, providing strong empirical validation for the dynamic evaluation paradigm. LLMEval-3 offers a robust and credible methodology for assessing the true capabilities of LLMs beyond leaderboard scores, promoting the development of more trustworthy evaluation standards.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Accurate and reliable energy time series prediction is of great significance for power generation planning and allocation. At present, deep learning time series prediction has become the mainstream method. However, the multi-scale time dynamics and the irregularity of real data lead to the limitations of the existing methods. Therefore, we propose EnergyPatchTST, which is an extension of the Patch Time Series Transformer specially designed for energy forecasting. The main innovations of our method are as follows: (1) multi-scale feature extraction mechanism to capture patterns with different time resolutions; (2) probability prediction framework to estimate uncertainty through Monte Carlo elimination; (3) integration path of future known variables (such as temperature and wind conditions); And (4) Pre-training and Fine-tuning examples to enhance the performance of limited energy data sets. A series of experiments on common energy data sets show that EnergyPatchTST is superior to other commonly used methods, the prediction error is reduced by 7-12%, and reliable uncertainty estimation is provided, which provides an important reference for time series prediction in the energy field.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Neural networks excel across a wide range of tasks, yet remain black boxes. In particular, how their internal representations are shaped by the complexity of the input data and the problems they solve remains obscure. In this work, we introduce a suite of five data-agnostic probes-pruning, binarization, noise injection, sign flipping, and bipartite network randomization-to quantify how task difficulty influences the topology and robustness of representations in multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). MLPs are represented as signed, weighted bipartite graphs from a network science perspective. We contrast easy and hard classification tasks on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. We show that binarizing weights in hard-task models collapses accuracy to chance, whereas easy-task models remain robust. We also find that pruning low-magnitude edges in binarized hard-task models reveals a sharp phase-transition in performance. Moreover, moderate noise injection can enhance accuracy, resembling a stochastic-resonance effect linked to optimal sign flips of small-magnitude weights. Finally, preserving only the sign structure-instead of precise weight magnitudes-through bipartite network randomizations suffices to maintain high accuracy. These phenomena define a model- and modality-agnostic measure of task complexity: the performance gap between full-precision and binarized or shuffled neural network performance. Our findings highlight the crucial role of signed bipartite topology in learned representations and suggest practical strategies for model compression and interpretability that align with task complexity.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Pituitary tumors often cause deformation or encapsulation of adjacent vital structures. Anatomical structure segmentation can provide surgeons with early warnings of regions that pose surgical risks, thereby enhancing the safety of pituitary surgery. However, pixel-level annotated video stream datasets for pituitary surgeries are extremely rare. To address this challenge, we introduce a new dataset for Pituitary Anatomy Segmentation (PAS). PAS comprises 7,845 time-coherent images extracted from 120 videos. To mitigate class imbalance, we apply data augmentation techniques that simulate the presence of surgical instruments in the training data. One major challenge in pituitary anatomy segmentation is the inconsistency in feature representation due to occlusions, camera motion, and surgical bleeding. By incorporating a Feature Fusion module, F2PASeg is proposed to refine anatomical structure segmentation by leveraging both high-resolution image features and deep semantic embeddings, enhancing robustness against intraoperative variations. Experimental results demonstrate that F2PASeg consistently segments critical anatomical structures in real time, providing a reliable solution for intraoperative pituitary surgery planning.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on high-level semantic tasks, they often struggle with fine-grained, token-level understanding and structural reasoning--capabilities that are essential for applications requiring precision and control. We introduce TASE, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to perceive and reason about token-level information across languages. TASE covers 10 tasks under two core categories: token awareness and structural understanding, spanning Chinese, English, and Korean, with a 35,927-instance evaluation set and a scalable synthetic data generation pipeline for training. Tasks include character counting, token alignment, syntactic structure parsing, and length constraint satisfaction. We evaluate over 30 leading commercial and open-source LLMs, including O3, Claude 4, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and DeepSeek-R1, and train a custom Qwen2.5-14B model using the GRPO training method. Results show that human performance significantly outpaces current LLMs, revealing persistent weaknesses in token-level reasoning. TASE sheds light on these limitations and provides a new diagnostic lens for future improvements in low-level language understanding and cross-lingual generalization.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We develop mechanisms for evaluating AI systems without ground truth by exploiting a connection between gaming resistance and output quality. The data processing inequality ensures post-hoc attempts to game a metric degrades both information content and task performance. We prove that f-mutual information measures are the unique gaming resistant mechanisms under natural conditions, with the overseer acting as an agent. While Shannon mutual information faces exponential sample complexity, bounded measures like total variation distance remain tractable. Empirically, across ten domains from translation to peer review, all information-theoretic mechanisms achieve perfect discrimination (d > 0.5) between faithful and strategic agents. In contrast, LLM judges exhibit systematic evaluation inversion, preferring fabricated content over accurate summaries. Our mechanisms show 10-100x better robustness to adversarial manipulation than current practices. We also find performance follows an inverted-U curve with compression ratio, peaking at 10:1 where agent responses exhibit optimal information diversity (3 effective dimensions), giving a bias-variance perspective on when our approach is expected to be most effective.</li>

Our analyses reveal that these metrics exhibit limited consistency, capturing different dimensions of creativity. We highlight key limitations, including the creativity index's focus on lexical diversity, perplexity's sensitivity to model confidence, and syntactic templates' inability to capture conceptual creativity. Additionally, LLM-as-a-Judge shows instability and bias. Our findings underscore the need for more robust, generalizable evaluation frameworks that better align with human judgments of creativity.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, attack, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Previous work has suggested that preprocessing images through lossy compression can defend against adversarial perturbations, but comprehensive attack evaluations have been lacking. In this paper, we construct strong white-box and adaptive attacks against various compression models and identify a critical challenge for attackers: high realism in reconstructed images significantly increases attack difficulty. Through rigorous evaluation across multiple attack scenarios, we demonstrate that compression models capable of producing realistic, high-fidelity reconstructions are substantially more resistant to our attacks. In contrast, low-realism compression models can be broken. Our analysis reveals that this is not due to gradient masking. Rather, realistic reconstructions maintaining distributional alignment with natural images seem to offer inherent robustness. This work highlights a significant obstacle for future adversarial attacks and suggests that developing more effective techniques to overcome realism represents an essential challenge for comprehensive security evaluation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multimodal electronic health record (EHR) data provide richer, complementary insights into patient health compared to single-modality data. However, effectively integrating diverse data modalities for clinical prediction modeling remains challenging due to the substantial data requirements. We introduce a novel architecture, Mixture-of-Multimodal-Agents (MoMA), designed to leverage multiple large language model (LLM) agents for clinical prediction tasks using multimodal EHR data. MoMA employs specialized LLM agents ("specialist agents") to convert non-textual modalities, such as medical images and laboratory results, into structured textual summaries. These summaries, together with clinical notes, are combined by another LLM ("aggregator agent") to generate a unified multimodal summary, which is then used by a third LLM ("predictor agent") to produce clinical predictions. Evaluating MoMA on three prediction tasks using real-world datasets with different modality combinations and prediction settings, MoMA outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its enhanced accuracy and flexibility across various tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Historical maps are valuable for studying changes to the Earth's surface. With the rise of deep learning, models like UNet have been used to extract information from these maps through semantic segmentation. Recently, pre-trained foundation models have shown strong performance across domains such as autonomous driving, medical imaging, and industrial inspection. However, they struggle with historical maps. These models are trained on modern or domain-specific images, where patterns can be tied to predefined concepts through common sense or expert knowledge. Historical maps lack such consistency -- similar concepts can appear in vastly different shapes and styles. To address this, we propose On-Need Declarative (OND) knowledge-based prompting, which introduces explicit prompts to guide the model on what patterns correspond to which concepts. This allows users to specify the target concept and pattern during inference (on-need inference). We implement this by replacing the prompt encoder of the foundation model SAM with our OND prompting mechanism and fine-tune it on historical maps. The resulting model is called SMOL-MapSeg (Show Me One Label). Experiments show that SMOL-MapSeg can accurately segment classes defined by OND knowledge. It can also adapt to unseen classes through few-shot fine-tuning. Additionally, it outperforms a UNet-based baseline in average segmentation performance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable performance in high-resource languages. However, their effectiveness diminishes significantly in the contexts of low-resource languages. Current multilingual enhancement methods are often limited to text modality or rely solely on machine translation. While such approaches help models acquire basic linguistic capabilities and produce "thin descriptions", they neglect the importance of multimodal informativeness and cultural groundedness, both of which are crucial for serving low-resource language users effectively. To bridge this gap, in this study, we identify two significant objectives for a truly effective MLLM in low-resource language settings, namely 1) linguistic capability and 2) cultural groundedness, placing special emphasis on cultural awareness. To achieve these dual objectives, we propose a dual-source strategy that guides the collection of data tailored to each goal, sourcing native web alt-text for culture and MLLM-generated captions for linguistics. As a concrete implementation, we introduce MELLA, a multimodal, multilingual dataset. Experiment results show that after fine-tuning on MELLA, there is a general performance improvement for the eight languages on various MLLM backbones, with models producing "thick descriptions". We verify that the performance gains are from both cultural knowledge enhancement and linguistic capability enhancement. Our dataset can be found at this https URL.</li>

AutoIAD leverages a Manager-Driven central agent to orchestrate specialized sub-agents (including Data Preparation, Data Loader, Model Designer, Trainer) and integrates a domain-specific knowledge base, which intelligently handles the entire pipeline using raw industrial image data to develop a trained anomaly detection model. We construct a comprehensive benchmark using MVTec AD datasets to evaluate AutoIAD across various LLM backends. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AutoIAD significantly outperforms existing general-purpose agentic collaboration frameworks and traditional AutoML frameworks in task completion rate and model performance (AUROC), while effectively mitigating issues like hallucination through iterative refinement. Ablation studies further confirm the crucial roles of the Manager central agent and the domain knowledge base module in producing robust and high-quality IAD solutions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, extraction, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Chirality information (i.e. information that allows distinguishing left from right) is ubiquitous for various data modes in computer vision, including images, videos, point clouds, and meshes. While chirality has been extensively studied in the image domain, its exploration in shape analysis (such as point clouds and meshes) remains underdeveloped. Although many shape vertex descriptors have shown appealing properties (e.g. robustness to rigid-body transformations), they are often not able to disambiguate between left and right symmetric parts. Considering the ubiquity of chirality information in different shape analysis problems and the lack of chirality-aware features within current shape descriptors, developing a chirality feature extractor becomes necessary and urgent. Based on the recent Diff3F framework, we propose an unsupervised chirality feature extraction pipeline to decorate shape vertices with chirality-aware information, extracted from 2D foundation models. We evaluated the extracted chirality features through quantitative and qualitative experiments across diverse datasets. Results from downstream tasks including left-right disentanglement, shape matching, and part segmentation demonstrate their effectiveness and practical utility. Project page: this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Most RGB-based hand-object reconstruction methods rely on object templates, while template-free methods typically assume full object visibility. This assumption often breaks in real-world settings, where fixed camera viewpoints and static grips leave parts of the object unobserved, resulting in implausible reconstructions. To overcome this, we present MagicHOI, a method for reconstructing hands and objects from short monocular interaction videos, even under limited viewpoint variation. Our key insight is that, despite the scarcity of paired 3D hand-object data, large-scale novel view synthesis diffusion models offer rich object supervision. This supervision serves as a prior to regularize unseen object regions during hand interactions. Leveraging this insight, we integrate a novel view synthesis model into our hand-object reconstruction framework. We further align hand to object by incorporating visible contact constraints. Our results demonstrate that MagicHOI significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art hand-object reconstruction methods. We also show that novel view synthesis diffusion priors effectively regularize unseen object regions, enhancing 3D hand-object reconstruction.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Event camera, a novel neuromorphic vision sensor, records data with high temporal resolution and wide dynamic range, offering new possibilities for accurate visual representation in challenging scenarios. However, event data is inherently sparse and noisy, mainly reflecting brightness changes, which complicates effective feature extraction. To address this, we propose a self-supervised pre-training framework to fully reveal latent information in event data, including edge information and texture cues. Our framework consists of three stages: Difference-guided Masked Modeling, inspired by the event physical sampling process, reconstructs temporal intensity difference maps to extract enhanced information from raw event data. Backbone-fixed Feature Transition contrasts event and image features without updating the backbone to preserve representations learned from masked modeling and stabilizing their effect on contrastive learning. Focus-aimed Contrastive Learning updates the entire model to improve semantic discrimination by focusing on high-value regions. Extensive experiments show our framework is robust and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on various downstream tasks, including object recognition, semantic segmentation, and optical flow estimation.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks, yet exhibit critical limitations in knowledge-intensive tasks, often generating hallucinations when faced with questions requiring specialized expertise. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this by integrating external knowledge, it struggles with complex reasoning scenarios due to its reliance on direct semantic retrieval and lack of structured logical organization. Inspired by Cartesian principles from \textit{Discours de la méthode}, this paper introduces Logic-Augmented Generation (LAG), a novel paradigm that reframes knowledge augmentation through systematic question decomposition and dependency-aware reasoning. Specifically, LAG first decomposes complex questions into atomic sub-questions ordered by logical dependencies. It then resolves these sequentially, using prior answers to guide context retrieval for subsequent sub-questions, ensuring stepwise grounding in logical chain. To prevent error propagation, LAG incorporates a logical termination mechanism that halts inference upon encountering unanswerable sub-questions and reduces wasted computation on excessive reasoning. Finally, it synthesizes all sub-resolutions to generate verified responses. Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that LAG significantly enhances reasoning robustness, reduces hallucination, and aligns LLM problem-solving with human cognition, offering a principled alternative to existing RAG systems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Visual pedestrian tracking represents a promising research field, with extensive applications in intelligent surveillance, behavior analysis, and human-computer interaction. However, real-world applications face significant occlusion challenges. When multiple pedestrians interact or overlap, the loss of target features severely compromises the tracker's ability to maintain stable trajectories. Traditional tracking methods, which typically rely on full-body bounding box features extracted from {Re-ID} models and linear constant-velocity motion assumptions, often struggle in severe occlusion scenarios. To address these limitations, this work proposes an enhanced tracking framework that leverages richer feature representations and a more robust motion model. Specifically, the proposed method incorporates detection features from both the regression and classification branches of an object detector, embedding spatial and positional information directly into the feature representations. To further mitigate occlusion challenges, a head keypoint detection model is introduced, as the head is less prone to occlusion compared to the full body. In terms of motion modeling, we propose an iterative Kalman filtering approach designed to align with modern detector assumptions, integrating 3D priors to better complete motion trajectories in complex scenes. By combining these advancements in appearance and motion modeling, the proposed method offers a more robust solution for multi-object tracking in crowded environments where occlusions are prevalent.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>defense, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose a novel certified defense method for Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models based on randomized smoothing with noise applied in the feature space rather than the input space. Unlike prior approaches that inject Gaussian noise directly into input images, often degrading visual quality, our method preserves image fidelity while providing robustness guarantees. To formally connect noise levels in the feature space with corresponding input-space perturbations, we analyze the maximum singular value of the backbone network's Jacobian. Our approach supports both full-reference (FR) and no-reference (NR) IQA models without requiring any architectural modifications, suitable for various scenarios. It is also computationally efficient, requiring a single backbone forward pass per image. Compared to previous methods, it reduces inference time by 99.5% without certification and by 20.6% when certification is applied. We validate our method with extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, involving six widely-used FR and NR IQA models and comparisons against five state-of-the-art certified defenses. Our results demonstrate consistent improvements in correlation with subjective quality scores by up to 30.9%.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Differential Privacy (DP) is commonly employed to safeguard graph analysis or publishing. Distance, a critical factor in graph analysis, is typically handled using curator DP, where a trusted curator holds the complete neighbor lists of all vertices and answers queries privately. However, in many real-world scenarios, such a curator may not be present, posing a significant challenge for implementing differentially private distance queries under Local Differential Privacy (LDP). This paper proposes two approaches to address this challenge. The first approach generates a synthetic graph by randomizing responses and applies bitwise operations to reduce noise interference. However, like other synthetic graph methods, this approach suffers from low utility. To overcome this limitation, we propose a second approach, the first LDP method specifically designed for distance queries, which captures the global graph structure by continuously aggregating local distance vectors from neighboring vertices. This process enables the accurate updating of global distances. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through comprehensive theoretical analysis and experimental evaluations on real-world datasets.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Clinical trial data cleaning represents a critical bottleneck in drug development, with manual review processes struggling to manage exponentially increasing data volumes and complexity. This paper presents Octozi, an artificial intelligence-assisted platform that combines large language models with domain-specific heuristics to transform clinical data review. In a controlled experimental study with experienced clinical reviewers (n=10), we demonstrate that AI assistance increased data cleaning throughput by 6.03-fold while simultaneously decreasing cleaning errors from 54.67% to 8.48% (a 6.44-fold improvement). Crucially, the system reduced false positive queries by 15.48-fold, minimizing unnecessary site burden. These improvements were consistent across reviewers regardless of experience level, suggesting broad applicability. Our findings indicate that AI-assisted approaches can address fundamental inefficiencies in clinical trial operations, potentially accelerating drug development timelines and reducing costs while maintaining regulatory compliance. This work establishes a framework for integrating AI into safety-critical clinical workflows and demonstrates the transformative potential of human-AI collaboration in pharmaceutical clinical trials.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively tuned to mitigate explicit biases, yet they often exhibit subtle implicit biases rooted in their pre-training data. Rather than directly probing LLMs with human-crafted questions that may trigger guardrails, we propose studying how models behave when they proactively ask questions themselves. The 20 Questions game, a multi-turn deduction task, serves as an ideal testbed for this purpose. We systematically evaluate geographic performance disparities in entity deduction using a new dataset, Geo20Q+, consisting of both notable people and culturally significant objects (e.g., foods, landmarks, animals) from diverse regions. We test popular LLMs across two gameplay configurations (canonical 20-question and unlimited turns) and in seven languages (English, Hindi, Mandarin, Japanese, French, Spanish, and Turkish). Our results reveal geographic disparities: LLMs are substantially more successful at deducing entities from the Global North than the Global South, and the Global West than the Global East. While Wikipedia pageviews and pre-training corpus frequency correlate mildly with performance, they fail to fully explain these disparities. Notably, the language in which the game is played has minimal impact on performance gaps. These findings demonstrate the value of creative, free-form evaluation frameworks for uncovering subtle biases in LLMs that remain hidden in standard prompting setups. By analyzing how models initiate and pursue reasoning goals over multiple turns, we find geographic and cultural disparities embedded in their reasoning processes. We release the dataset (Geo20Q+) and code at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The proliferation of generative video models has made detecting AI-generated and manipulated videos an urgent challenge. Existing detection approaches often fail to generalize across diverse manipulation types due to their reliance on isolated spatial, temporal, or spectral information, and typically require large models to perform well. This paper introduces SSTGNN, a lightweight Spatial-Spectral-Temporal Graph Neural Network framework that represents videos as structured graphs, enabling joint reasoning over spatial inconsistencies, temporal artifacts, and spectral distortions. SSTGNN incorporates learnable spectral filters and temporal differential modeling into a graph-based architecture, capturing subtle manipulation traces more effectively. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that SSTGNN not only achieves superior performance in both in-domain and cross-domain settings, but also offers strong robustness against unseen manipulations. Remarkably, SSTGNN accomplishes these results with up to 42.4$\times$ fewer parameters than state-of-the-art models, making it highly lightweight and scalable for real-world deployment.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As the volume of video content online grows exponentially, the demand for moderation of unsafe videos has surpassed human capabilities, posing both operational and mental health challenges. While recent studies demonstrated the merits of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in various video understanding tasks, their application to multimodal content moderation, a domain that requires nuanced understanding of both visual and textual cues, remains relatively underexplored. In this work, we benchmark the capabilities of MLLMs in brand safety classification, a critical subset of content moderation for safe-guarding advertising integrity. To this end, we introduce a novel, multimodal and multilingual dataset, meticulously labeled by professional reviewers in a multitude of risk categories. Through a detailed comparative analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MLLMs such as Gemini, GPT, and Llama in multimodal brand safety, and evaluate their accuracy and cost efficiency compared to professional human reviewers. Furthermore, we present an in-depth discussion shedding light on limitations of MLLMs and failure cases. We are releasing our dataset alongside this paper to facilitate future research on effective and responsible brand safety and content moderation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce Action Discovery, a novel setup within Temporal Action Segmentation that addresses the challenge of defining and annotating ambiguous actions and incomplete annotations in partially labeled datasets. In this setup, only a subset of actions - referred to as known actions - is annotated in the training data, while other unknown actions remain unlabeled. This scenario is particularly relevant in domains like neuroscience, where well-defined behaviors (e.g., walking, eating) coexist with subtle or infrequent actions that are often overlooked, as well as in applications where datasets are inherently partially annotated due to ambiguous or missing labels. To address this problem, we propose a two-step approach that leverages the known annotations to guide both the temporal and semantic granularity of unknown action segments. First, we introduce the Granularity-Guided Segmentation Module (GGSM), which identifies temporal intervals for both known and unknown actions by mimicking the granularity of annotated actions. Second, we propose the Unknown Action Segment Assignment (UASA), which identifies semantically meaningful classes within the unknown actions, based on learned embedding similarities. We systematically explore the proposed setting of Action Discovery on three challenging datasets - Breakfast, 50Salads, and Desktop Assembly - demonstrating that our method considerably improves upon existing baselines.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Probabilistic Circuits (PCs) are a class of generative models that allow exact and tractable inference for a wide range of queries. While recent developments have enabled the learning of deep and expressive PCs, this increased capacity can often lead to overfitting, especially when data is limited. We analyze PC overfitting from a log-likelihood-landscape perspective and show that it is often caused by convergence to sharp optima that generalize poorly. Inspired by sharpness aware minimization in neural networks, we propose a Hessian-based regularizer for training PCs. As a key contribution, we show that the trace of the Hessian of the log-likelihood-a sharpness proxy that is typically intractable in deep neural networks-can be computed efficiently for PCs. Minimizing this Hessian trace induces a gradient-norm-based regularizer that yields simple closed-form parameter updates for EM, and integrates seamlessly with gradient based learning methods. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method consistently guides PCs toward flatter minima, improves generalization performance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in multiple-choice question answering (MCQA), but their inherent unreliability, such as hallucination and overconfidence, limits their application in high-risk domains. To address this, we propose a frequency-based uncertainty quantification method under black-box settings, leveraging conformal prediction (CP) to ensure provable coverage guarantees. Our approach involves multiple independent samplings of the model's output distribution for each input, with the most frequent sample serving as a reference to calculate predictive entropy (PE). Experimental evaluations across six LLMs and four datasets (MedMCQA, MedQA, MMLU, MMLU-Pro) demonstrate that frequency-based PE outperforms logit-based PE in distinguishing between correct and incorrect predictions, as measured by AUROC. Furthermore, the method effectively controls the empirical miscoverage rate under user-specified risk levels, validating that sampling frequency can serve as a viable substitute for logit-based probabilities in black-box scenarios. This work provides a distribution-free model-agnostic framework for reliable uncertainty quantification in MCQA with guaranteed coverage, enhancing the trustworthiness of LLMs in practical applications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, privacy, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Redacting Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from unstructured text is critical for ensuring data privacy in regulated domains. While earlier approaches have relied on rule-based systems and domain-specific Named Entity Recognition (NER) models, these methods fail to generalize across formats and contexts. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative, yet the effect of architectural and training choices on redaction performance remains underexplored. LLMs have demonstrated strong performance in tasks that require contextual language understanding, including the redaction of PII in free-form text. Prior work suggests that with appropriate adaptation, LLMs can become effective contextual privacy learners. However, the consequences of architectural and training choices for PII Redaction remain underexplored. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of LLMs as privacy-preserving PII Redaction systems. We evaluate a range of LLM architectures and training strategies for their effectiveness in PII Redaction. Our analysis measures redaction performance, semantic preservation, and PII leakage, and compares these outcomes against latency and computational cost. The results provide practical guidance for configuring LLM-based redactors that are accurate, efficient, and privacy-aware. To support reproducibility and real-world deployment, we release PRvL, an open-source suite of fine-tuned models, and evaluation tools for general-purpose PII Redaction. PRvL is built entirely on open-source LLMs and supports multiple inference settings for flexibility and compliance. It is designed to be easily customized for different domains and fully operable within secure, self-managed environments. This enables data owners to perform redactions without relying on third-party services or exposing sensitive content beyond their own infrastructure.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>data-free</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization capabilities across a wide range of tasks. However, their performance often remains suboptimal when directly applied to specific downstream scenarios without task-specific adaptation. To enhance their utility while preserving data efficiency, recent research has increasingly focused on unsupervised adaptation methods that do not rely on labeled data. Despite the growing interest in this area, there remains a lack of a unified, task-oriented survey dedicated to unsupervised VLM adaptation. To bridge this gap, we present a comprehensive and structured overview of the field. We propose a taxonomy based on the availability and nature of unlabeled visual data, categorizing existing approaches into four key paradigms: Data-Free Transfer (no data), Unsupervised Domain Transfer (abundant data), Episodic Test-Time Adaptation (batch data), and Online Test-Time Adaptation (streaming data). Within this framework, we analyze core methodologies and adaptation strategies associated with each paradigm, aiming to establish a systematic understanding of the field. Additionally, we review representative benchmarks across diverse applications and highlight open challenges and promising directions for future research.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Public opinion surveys show cross-cultural differences in political opinions between socio-cultural contexts. However, there is no clear evidence whether these differences translate to cross-lingual differences in multilingual large language models (MLLMs). We analyze whether opinions transfer between languages or whether there are separate opinions for each language in MLLMs of various sizes across five Western languages. We evaluate MLLMs' opinions by prompting them to report their (dis)agreement with political statements from voting advice applications. To better understand the interaction between languages in the models, we evaluate them both before and after aligning them with more left or right views using direct preference optimization and English alignment data only. Our findings reveal that unaligned models show only very few significant cross-lingual differences in the political opinions they reflect. The political alignment shifts opinions almost uniformly across all five languages. We conclude that in Western language contexts, political opinions transfer between languages, demonstrating the challenges in achieving explicit socio-linguistic, cultural, and political alignment of MLLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) enables collaborative learning by integrating disjoint feature subsets from multiple clients/parties. However, VFL typically faces two key challenges: i) the requirement for perfectly aligned data samples across all clients (missing features are not allowed); ii) the requirement for joint collaborative inference/prediction involving all clients (it does not support locally independent inference on a single client). To address these challenges, we propose X-VFL, a new VFL framework designed to deal with the non-aligned data samples with (partially) missing features and to support locally independent inference of new data samples for each client. In particular, we design two novel modules in X-VFL: Cross Completion (XCom) and Decision Subspace Alignment (DS-Align). XCom can complete/reconstruct missing features for non-aligned data samples by leveraging information from other clients. DS-Align aligns local features with completed and global features across all clients within the decision subspace, thus enabling locally independent inference at each client. Moreover, we provide convergence theorems for different algorithms used in training X-VFL, showing an $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate for SGD-type algorithms and an $O(1/T)$ rate for PAGE-type algorithms, where $T$ denotes the number of training update steps. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that X-VFL significantly outperforms existing methods, e.g., achieving a 15% improvement in accuracy on the image CIFAR-10 dataset and a 43% improvement on the medical MIMIC-III dataset. These results validate the practical effectiveness and superiority of X-VFL, particularly in scenarios involving partially missing features and locally independent inference.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) integrates quantization into the training loop, enabling LLMs to learn robust low-bit representations, and is widely recognized as one of the most promising research directions. All current QAT research focuses on minimizing quantization error on full-precision models, where the full-precision accuracy acts as an upper bound (accuracy ceiling). No existing method has even attempted to surpass this ceiling. To break this ceiling, we propose a new paradigm: raising the ceiling (full-precision model), and then still quantizing it efficiently into 2 bits. We propose Fairy$\pm i$, the first 2-bit quantization framework for complex-valued LLMs. Specifically, our method leverages the representational advantages of the complex domain to boost full-precision accuracy. We map weights to the fourth roots of unity $\{\pm1, \pm i\}$, forming a perfectly symmetric and information-theoretically optimal 2-bit representation. Importantly, each quantized weight has either a zero real or imaginary part, enabling multiplication-free inference using only additions and element swaps. Experimental results show that Fairy$\pm i$ outperforms the ceiling of existing 2-bit quantization approaches in terms of both PPL and downstream tasks, while maintaining strict storage and compute efficiency. This work opens a new direction for building highly accurate and practical LLMs under extremely low-bit constraints.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the growing demands of AI-generated content (AIGC), the need for high-quality, diverse, and scalable data has become increasingly crucial. However, collecting large-scale real-world data remains costly and time-consuming, hindering the development of downstream applications. While some works attempt to collect task-specific data via a rendering process, most approaches still rely on manual scene construction, limiting their scalability and accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose Follow-Your-Instruction, a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-driven framework for automatically synthesizing high-quality 2D, 3D, and 4D data. Our \textbf{Follow-Your-Instruction} first collects assets and their associated descriptions through multimodal inputs using the MLLM-Collector. Then it constructs 3D layouts, and leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for semantic refinement through multi-view scenes with the MLLM-Generator and MLLM-Optimizer, respectively. Finally, it uses MLLM-Planner to generate temporally coherent future frames. We evaluate the quality of the generated data through comprehensive experiments on the 2D, 3D, and 4D generative tasks. The results show that our synthetic data significantly boosts the performance of existing baseline models, demonstrating Follow-Your-Instruction's potential as a scalable and effective data engine for generative intelligence.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities for medical question answering and programming, but their potential for generating interpretable computable phenotypes (CPs) is under-explored. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs can generate accurate and concise CPs for six clinical phenotypes of varying complexity, which could be leveraged to enable scalable clinical decision support to improve care for patients with hypertension. In addition to evaluating zero-short performance, we propose and test a synthesize, execute, debug, instruct strategy that uses LLMs to generate and iteratively refine CPs using data-driven feedback. Our results show that LLMs, coupled with iterative learning, can generate interpretable and reasonably accurate programs that approach the performance of state-of-the-art ML methods while requiring significantly fewer training examples.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Open-Vocabulary Multi-Label Recognition (OV-MLR) aims to identify multiple seen and unseen object categories within an image, requiring both precise intra-class localization to pinpoint objects and effective inter-class reasoning to model complex category dependencies. While Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models offer a strong open-vocabulary foundation, they often struggle with fine-grained localization under weak supervision and typically fail to explicitly leverage structured relational knowledge beyond basic semantics, limiting performance especially for unseen classes. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Dual Adaptive Refinement Transfer (DART) framework. DART enhances a frozen VLP backbone via two synergistic adaptive modules. For intra-class refinement, an Adaptive Refinement Module (ARM) refines patch features adaptively, coupled with a novel Weakly Supervised Patch Selecting (WPS) loss that enables discriminative localization using only image-level labels. Concurrently, for inter-class transfer, an Adaptive Transfer Module (ATM) leverages a Class Relationship Graph (CRG), constructed using structured knowledge mined from a Large Language Model (LLM), and employs graph attention network to adaptively transfer relational information between class representations. DART is the first framework, to our knowledge, to explicitly integrate external LLM-derived relational knowledge for adaptive inter-class transfer while simultaneously performing adaptive intra-class refinement under weak supervision for OV-MLR. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our DART achieves new state-of-the-art performance, validating its effectiveness.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models have achieved substantial progress in mathematical reasoning, yet their advancement is limited by the scarcity of high-quality, high-difficulty training data. Existing synthesis methods largely rely on transforming human-written templates, limiting both diversity and scalability. We propose MathSmith, a novel framework for synthesizing challenging mathematical problems to enhance LLM reasoning. Rather than modifying existing problems, MathSmith constructs new ones from scratch by randomly sampling concept-explanation pairs from PlanetMath, ensuring data independence and avoiding contamination. To increase difficulty, we design nine predefined strategies as soft constraints during rationales. We further adopts reinforcement learning to jointly optimize structural validity, reasoning complexity, and answer consistency. The length of the reasoning trace generated under autoregressive prompting is used to reflect cognitive complexity, encouraging the creation of more demanding problems aligned with long-chain-of-thought reasoning. Experiments across five benchmarks, categorized as easy & medium (GSM8K, MATH-500) and hard (AIME2024, AIME2025, OlympiadBench), show that MathSmith consistently outperforms existing baselines under both short and long CoT settings. Additionally, a weakness-focused variant generation module enables targeted improvement on specific concepts. Overall, MathSmith exhibits strong scalability, generalization, and transferability, highlighting the promise of high-difficulty synthetic data in advancing LLM reasoning capabilities.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Visual tokenizer is a critical component for vision generation. However, the existing tokenizers often face unsatisfactory trade-off between compression ratios and reconstruction fidelity. To fill this gap, we introduce a powerful and concise WeTok tokenizer, which surpasses the previous leading tokenizers via two core innovations. (1) Group-wise lookup-free Quantization (GQ). We partition the latent features into groups, and perform lookup-free quantization for each group. As a result, GQ can efficiently overcome memory and computation limitations of prior tokenizers, while achieving a reconstruction breakthrough with more scalable codebooks. (2) Generative Decoding (GD). Different from prior tokenizers, we introduce a generative decoder with a prior of extra noise variable. In this case, GD can probabilistically model the distribution of visual data conditioned on discrete tokens, allowing WeTok to reconstruct visual details, especially at high compression ratios. Extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks show superior performance of our WeTok. On the ImageNet 50k validation set, WeTok achieves a record-low zero-shot rFID (WeTok: 0.12 vs. FLUX-VAE: 0.18 vs. SD-VAE 3.5: 0.19). Furthermore, our highest compression model achieves a zero-shot rFID of 3.49 with a compression ratio of 768, outperforming Cosmos (384) 4.57 which has only 50% compression rate of ours.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Backdoor injection attacks are a threat to machine learning models that are trained on large data collected from untrusted sources; these attacks enable attackers to inject malicious behavior into the model that can be triggered by specially crafted inputs. Prior work has established bounds on the success of backdoor attacks and their impact on the benign learning task, however, an open question is what amount of poison data is needed for a successful backdoor attack. Typical attacks either use few samples, but need much information about the data points or need to poison many data points. In this paper, we formulate the one-poison hypothesis: An adversary with one poison sample and limited background knowledge can inject a backdoor with zero backdooring-error and without significantly impacting the benign learning task performance. Moreover, we prove the one-poison hypothesis for linear regression and linear classification. For adversaries that utilize a direction that is unused by the benign data distribution for the poison sample, we show that the resulting model is functionally equivalent to a model where the poison was excluded from training. We build on prior work on statistical backdoor learning to show that in all other cases, the impact on the benign learning task is still limited. We also validate our theoretical results experimentally with realistic benchmark data sets.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multimodal generative AI usually involves generating image or text responses given inputs in another modality. The evaluation of image-text relevancy is essential for measuring response quality or ranking candidate responses. In particular, binary relevancy evaluation, i.e., ``Relevant'' vs. ``Not Relevant'', is a fundamental problem. However, this is a challenging task considering that texts have diverse formats and the definition of relevancy varies in different scenarios. We find that Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are an ideal choice to build such evaluators, as they can flexibly handle complex text formats and take in additional task information. In this paper, we present LLaVA-RE, a first attempt for binary image-text relevancy evaluation with MLLM. It follows the LLaVA architecture and adopts detailed task instructions and multimodal in-context samples. In addition, we propose a novel binary relevancy data set that covers various tasks. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our framework.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been widely adopted to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) by decomposing complex tasks into simpler, sequential subtasks. However, extending CoT to vision-language reasoning tasks remains challenging, as it often requires interpreting transitions of visual states to support reasoning. Existing methods often struggle with this due to limited capacity of modeling visual state transitions or incoherent visual trajectories caused by fragmented architectures. To overcome these limitations, we propose Uni-CoT, a Unified Chain-of-Thought framework that enables coherent and grounded multimodal reasoning within a single unified model. The key idea is to leverage a model capable of both image understanding and generation to reason over visual content and model evolving visual states. However, empowering a unified model to achieve that is non-trivial, given the high computational cost and the burden of training. To address this, Uni-CoT introduces a novel two-level reasoning paradigm: A Macro-Level CoT for high-level task planning and A Micro-Level CoT for subtask execution. This design significantly reduces the computational overhead. Furthermore, we introduce a structured training paradigm that combines interleaved image-text supervision for macro-level CoT with multi-task objectives for micro-level CoT. Together, these innovations allow Uni-CoT to perform scalable and coherent multi-modal reasoning. Furthermore, thanks to our design, all experiments can be efficiently completed using only 8 A100 GPUs with 80GB VRAM each. Experimental results on reasoning-driven image generation benchmark (WISE) and editing benchmarks (RISE and KRIS) indicates that Uni-CoT demonstrates SOTA performance and strong generalization, establishing Uni-CoT as a promising solution for multi-modal reasoning.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Despite rapid advances in 3D content generation, quality assessment for the generated 3D assets remains challenging. Existing methods mainly rely on image-based metrics and operate solely at the object level, limiting their ability to capture spatial coherence, material authenticity, and high-fidelity local details. 1) To address these challenges, we introduce Hi3DEval, a hierarchical evaluation framework tailored for 3D generative content. It combines both object-level and part-level evaluation, enabling holistic assessments across multiple dimensions as well as fine-grained quality analysis. Additionally, we extend texture evaluation beyond aesthetic appearance by explicitly assessing material realism, focusing on attributes such as albedo, saturation, and metallicness. 2) To support this framework, we construct Hi3DBench, a large-scale dataset comprising diverse 3D assets and high-quality annotations, accompanied by a reliable multi-agent annotation pipeline. We further propose a 3D-aware automated scoring system based on hybrid 3D representations. Specifically, we leverage video-based representations for object-level and material-subject evaluations to enhance modeling of spatio-temporal consistency and employ pretrained 3D features for part-level perception. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing image-based metrics in modeling 3D characteristics and achieves superior alignment with human preference, providing a scalable alternative to manual evaluations.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as an effective post-training paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language model (MLLM). However, current RL pipelines often suffer from training inefficiencies caused by two underexplored issues: Advantage Collapsing, where most advantages in a batch concentrate near zero, and Rollout Silencing, where the proportion of rollouts contributing non-zero gradients diminishes over time. These issues lead to suboptimal gradient updates and hinder long-term learning efficiency. To address these issues, we propose Shuffle-R1, a simple yet principled framework that improves RL fine-tuning efficiency by dynamically restructuring trajectory sampling and batch composition. It introduces (1) Pairwise Trajectory Sampling, which selects high-contrast trajectories with large advantages to improve gradient signal quality, and (2) Advantage-based Trajectory Shuffle, which increases exposure of valuable rollouts through informed batch reshuffling. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that our framework consistently outperforms strong RL baselines with minimal overhead. These results highlight the importance of data-centric adaptations for more efficient RL training in MLLM.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in reasoning tasks, where reinforcement learning (RL) serves as a key algorithm for enhancing their reasoning capabilities. Currently, there are two mainstream reward paradigms: model-based rewards and rule-based rewards. However, both approaches suffer from limitations: rule-based rewards lack robustness, while model-based rewards are vulnerable to reward hacking. To address these issues, we propose Cooper(Co-optimizing Policy Model and Reward Model), a RL framework that jointly optimizes both the policy model and the reward model. Cooper leverages the high precision of rule-based rewards when identifying correct responses, and dynamically constructs and selects positive-negative sample pairs for continued training the reward model. This design enhances robustness and mitigates the risk of reward hacking. To further support Cooper, we introduce a hybrid annotation strategy that efficiently and accurately generates training data for the reward model. We also propose a reference-based reward modeling paradigm, where the reward model takes a reference answer as input. Based on this design, we train a reward model named VerifyRM, which achieves higher accuracy on VerifyBench compared to other models of the same size. We conduct reinforcement learning using both VerifyRM and Cooper. Our experiments show that Cooper not only alleviates reward hacking but also improves end-to-end RL performance, for instance, achieving a 0.54% gain in average accuracy on Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct. Our findings demonstrate that dynamically updating reward model is an effective way to combat reward hacking, providing a reference for better integrating reward models into RL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models excel at abstract reasoning but their capacity for embodied agent reasoning remains largely unexplored. We present OmniEAR, a comprehensive framework for evaluating how language models reason about physical interactions, tool usage, and multi-agent coordination in embodied tasks. Unlike existing benchmarks that provide predefined tool sets or explicit collaboration directives, OmniEAR requires agents to dynamically acquire capabilities and autonomously determine coordination strategies based on task demands. Through text-based environment representation, we model continuous physical properties and complex spatial relationships across 1,500 scenarios spanning household and industrial domains. Our systematic evaluation reveals severe performance degradation when models must reason from constraints: while achieving 85-96% success with explicit instructions, performance drops to 56-85% for tool reasoning and 63-85% for implicit collaboration, with compound tasks showing over 50% failure rates. Surprisingly, complete environmental information degrades coordination performance, indicating models cannot filter task-relevant constraints. Fine-tuning improves single-agent tasks dramatically (0.6% to 76.3%) but yields minimal multi-agent gains (1.5% to 5.5%), exposing fundamental architectural limitations. These findings demonstrate that embodied reasoning poses fundamentally different challenges than current models can address, establishing OmniEAR as a rigorous benchmark for evaluating and advancing embodied AI systems. Our code and data are included in the supplementary materials and will be open-sourced upon acceptance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding, the task of mapping natural language instructions to precise screen coordinates, is fundamental to autonomous GUI agents. While existing methods achieve strong performance through extensive supervised training or reinforcement learning with labeled rewards, they remain constrained by the cost and availability of pixel-level annotations. We observe that when models generate multiple predictions for the same GUI element, the spatial overlap patterns reveal implicit confidence signals that can guide more accurate localization. Leveraging this insight, we propose GUI-RC (Region Consistency), a test-time scaling method that constructs spatial voting grids from multiple sampled predictions to identify consensus regions where models show highest agreement. Without any training, GUI-RC improves accuracy by 2-3% across various architectures on ScreenSpot benchmarks. We further introduce GUI-RCPO (Region Consistency Policy Optimization), which transforms these consistency patterns into rewards for test-time reinforcement learning. By computing how well each prediction aligns with the collective consensus, GUI-RCPO enables models to iteratively refine their outputs on unlabeled data during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate the generality of our approach: GUI-RC boosts Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct from 80.11% to 83.57% on ScreenSpot-v2, while GUI-RCPO further improves it to 85.14% through self-supervised optimization. Our approach reveals the untapped potential of test-time scaling and test-time reinforcement learning for GUI grounding, offering a promising path toward more robust and data-efficient GUI agents.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>explainability, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Trajectory prediction is a critical task in modeling human behavior, especially in safety-critical domains such as social robotics and autonomous vehicle navigation. Traditional heuristics based on handcrafted rules often lack accuracy and generalizability. Although deep learning approaches offer improved performance, they typically suffer from high computational cost, limited explainability, and, importantly, poor generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. In this paper, we introduce TrajEvo, a framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically design trajectory prediction heuristics. TrajEvo employs an evolutionary algorithm to generate and refine prediction heuristics from past trajectory data. We propose two key innovations: Cross-Generation Elite Sampling to encourage population diversity, and a Statistics Feedback Loop that enables the LLM to analyze and improve alternative predictions. Our evaluations demonstrate that TrajEvo outperforms existing heuristic methods across multiple real-world datasets, and notably surpasses both heuristic and deep learning methods in generalizing to an unseen OOD real-world dataset. TrajEvo marks a promising step toward the automated design of fast, explainable, and generalizable trajectory prediction heuristics.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Reasoning Large Language Models (R-LLMs) have significantly advanced complex reasoning tasks but often struggle with factuality, generating substantially more hallucinations than their non-reasoning counterparts on long-form factuality benchmarks. However, extending online Reinforcement Learning (RL), a key component in recent R-LLM advancements, to the long-form factuality setting poses several unique challenges due to the lack of reliable verification methods. Previous work has utilized automatic factuality evaluation frameworks such as FActScore to curate preference data in the offline RL setting, yet we find that directly leveraging such methods as the reward in online RL leads to reward hacking in multiple ways, such as producing less detailed or relevant responses. We propose a novel reward function that simultaneously considers the factual precision, response detail level, and answer relevance, and applies online RL to learn high quality factual reasoning. Evaluated on six long-form factuality benchmarks, our factual reasoning model achieves an average reduction of 23.1 percentage points in hallucination rate, a 23% increase in answer detail level, and no degradation in the overall response helpfulness.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have started to demonstrate the ability to persuade humans, yet our understanding of how this dynamic transpires is limited. Recent work has used linear probes, lightweight tools for analyzing model representations, to study various LLM skills such as the ability to model user sentiment and political perspective. Motivated by this, we apply probes to study persuasion dynamics in natural, multi-turn conversations. We leverage insights from cognitive science to train probes on distinct aspects of persuasion: persuasion success, persuadee personality, and persuasion strategy. Despite their simplicity, we show that they capture various aspects of persuasion at both the sample and dataset levels. For instance, probes can identify the point in a conversation where the persuadee was persuaded or where persuasive success generally occurs across the entire dataset. We also show that in addition to being faster than expensive prompting-based approaches, probes can do just as well and even outperform prompting in some settings, such as when uncovering persuasion strategy. This suggests probes as a plausible avenue for studying other complex behaviours such as deception and manipulation, especially in multi-turn settings and large-scale dataset analysis where prompting-based methods would be computationally inefficient.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Byte-level language models eliminate fragile tokenizers but face computational challenges in morphologically-rich languages (MRLs), where words span many bytes. We propose H-NET++, a hierarchical dynamic-chunking model that learns linguistically-informed segmentation through end-to-end training. Key innovations include: (1) a lightweight Transformer context-mixer (1.9M parameters) for cross-chunk attention, (2) a two-level latent hyper-prior for document-level consistency, (3) specialized handling of orthographic artifacts (e.g. Persian ZWNJ), and (4) curriculum-based training with staged sequence lengths. On a 1.4B-token Persian corpus, H-NET++ achieves state-of-the-art results: 0.159 BPB reduction versus BPE-based GPT-2-fa (12% better compression), 5.4pp gain on ParsGLUE, 53% improved robustness to ZWNJ corruption, and 73.8% F1 on gold morphological boundaries. Our learned chunks align with Persian morphology without explicit supervision, demonstrating that hierarchical dynamic chunking provides an effective tokenizer-free solution for MRLs while maintaining computational efficiency.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present a simple yet theoretically motivated improvement to Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for the Large Language Model (LLM), addressing its limited generalization compared to reinforcement learning (RL). Through mathematical analysis, we reveal that standard SFT gradients implicitly encode a problematic reward structure that may severely restrict the generalization capabilities of model. To rectify this, we propose Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT), stabilizing gradient updates for each token by dynamically rescaling the objective function with the probability of this token. Remarkably, this single-line code change significantly outperforms standard SFT across multiple challenging benchmarks and base models, demonstrating greatly improved generalization. Additionally, our approach shows competitive results in offline RL settings, offering an effective yet simpler alternative. This work bridges theoretical insight and practical solutions, substantially advancing SFT performance. The code will be available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Video object segmentation (VOS) aims to segment specified target objects throughout a video. Although state-of-the-art methods have achieved impressive performance (e.g., 90+% J&F) on existing benchmarks such as DAVIS and YouTube-VOS, these datasets primarily contain salient, dominant, and isolated objects, limiting their generalization to real-world scenarios. To advance VOS toward more realistic environments, coMplex video Object SEgmentation (MOSEv1) was introduced to facilitate VOS research in complex scenes. Building on the strengths and limitations of MOSEv1, we present MOSEv2, a significantly more challenging dataset designed to further advance VOS methods under real-world conditions. MOSEv2 consists of 5,024 videos and over 701,976 high-quality masks for 10,074 objects across 200 categories. Compared to its predecessor, MOSEv2 introduces significantly greater scene complexity, including more frequent object disappearance and reappearance, severe occlusions and crowding, smaller objects, as well as a range of new challenges such as adverse weather (e.g., rain, snow, fog), low-light scenes (e.g., nighttime, underwater), multi-shot sequences, camouflaged objects, non-physical targets (e.g., shadows, reflections), scenarios requiring external knowledge, etc. We benchmark 20 representative VOS methods under 5 different settings and observe consistent performance drops. For example, SAM2 drops from 76.4% on MOSEv1 to only 50.9% on MOSEv2. We further evaluate 9 video object tracking methods and find similar declines, demonstrating that MOSEv2 presents challenges across tasks. These results highlight that despite high accuracy on existing datasets, current VOS methods still struggle under real-world complexities. MOSEv2 is publicly available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated its advantages in achieving fast and high-quality rendering. As point clouds serve as a widely-used and easily accessible form of 3D representation, bridging the gap between point clouds and Gaussians becomes increasingly important. Recent studies have explored how to convert the colored points into Gaussians, but directly generating Gaussians from colorless 3D point clouds remains an unsolved challenge. In this paper, we propose GAP, a novel approach that gaussianizes raw point clouds into high-fidelity 3D Gaussians with text guidance. Our key idea is to design a multi-view optimization framework that leverages a depth-aware image diffusion model to synthesize consistent appearances across different viewpoints. To ensure geometric accuracy, we introduce a surface-anchoring mechanism that effectively constrains Gaussians to lie on the surfaces of 3D shapes during optimization. Furthermore, GAP incorporates a diffuse-based inpainting strategy that specifically targets at completing hard-to-observe regions. We evaluate GAP on the Point-to-Gaussian generation task across varying complexity levels, from synthetic point clouds to challenging real-world scans, and even large-scale scenes.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, protect, biometric, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Advancements in face recognition (FR) technologies have amplified privacy concerns, necessitating methods that protect identity while maintaining recognition utility. Existing face anonymization methods typically focus on obscuring identity but fail to meet the requirements of biometric template protection, including revocability, unlinkability, and irreversibility. We propose FaceAnonyMixer, a cancelable face generation framework that leverages the latent space of a pre-trained generative model to synthesize privacy-preserving face images. The core idea of FaceAnonyMixer is to irreversibly mix the latent code of a real face image with a synthetic code derived from a revocable key. The mixed latent code is further refined through a carefully designed multi-objective loss to satisfy all cancelable biometric requirements. FaceAnonyMixer is capable of generating high-quality cancelable faces that can be directly matched using existing FR systems without requiring any modifications. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that FaceAnonyMixer delivers superior recognition accuracy while providing significantly stronger privacy protection, achieving over an 11% gain on commercial API compared to recent cancelable biometric methods.
