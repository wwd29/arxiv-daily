<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Excessive caregiver workload in hospital nurses has been implicated in poorer patient care and increased worker burnout. Measurement of this workload in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is often done using the Nursing Activities Score (NAS), but this is usually recorded manually and sporadically. Previous work has made use of Ambient Intelligence (AmI) by using computer vision to passively derive caregiver-patient interaction times to monitor staff workload. In this letter, we propose using a Multiscale Vision Transformer (MViT) to passively predict the NAS from low-resolution thermal videos recorded in an ICU. 458 videos were obtained from an ICU in Melbourne, Australia and used to train a MViTv2 model using an indirect prediction and a direct prediction method. The indirect method predicted 1 of 8 potentially identifiable NAS activities from the video before inferring the NAS. The direct method predicted the NAS score immediately from the video. The indirect method yielded an average 5-fold accuracy of 57.21%, an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC) of 0.865, a F1 score of 0.570 and a mean squared error (MSE) of 28.16. The direct method yielded a MSE of 18.16. We also showed that the MViTv2 outperforms similar models such as R(2+1)D and ResNet50-LSTM under identical settings. This study shows the feasibility of using a MViTv2 to passively predict the NAS in an ICU and monitor staff workload automatically. Our results above also show an increased accuracy in predicting NAS directly versus predicting NAS indirectly. We hope that our study can provide a direction for future work and further improve the accuracy of passive NAS monitoring.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Estimating uncertainty or confidence in the responses of a model can be significant in evaluating trust not only in the responses, but also in the model as a whole. In this paper, we explore the problem of estimating confidence for responses of large language models (LLMs) with simply black-box or query access to them. We propose a simple and extensible framework where, we engineer novel features and train a (interpretable) model (viz. logistic regression) on these features to estimate the confidence. We empirically demonstrate that our simple framework is effective in estimating confidence of flan-ul2, llama-13b and mistral-7b with it consistently outperforming existing black-box confidence estimation approaches on benchmark datasets such as TriviaQA, SQuAD, CoQA and Natural Questions by even over $10\%$ (on AUROC) in some cases. Additionally, our interpretable approach provides insight into features that are predictive of confidence, leading to the interesting and useful discovery that our confidence models built for one LLM generalize zero-shot across others on a given dataset.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Instruction Fine-Tuning, a method enhancing pre-trained language models' capabilities from mere next-word prediction to complex instruction following, often employs a one-off training approach on diverse instruction dataset. However, this method may not effectively enhance models' adherence to instructions due to the simultaneous handling of varying instruction complexities. To address this, we propose a novel phased instruction fine-tuning (Phased IFT) method, grounded in the hypothesis of progressive alignment, which posits that the transition of a pre-trained language model from simple next-word prediction to sophisticated instruction following is a gradual learning process. Specifically, we obtain the score of difficulty for each instruction via GPT-4, stratify the instruction data into subsets of increasing difficulty, and sequentially uptrain on these subsets using the standard supervised loss. Through extensive experiments on the pre-trained models Llama-2 7B/13B, and Mistral-7B using the 52K Alpaca instruction data, we demonstrate that Phased IFT significantly surpasses traditional one-off instruction fine-tuning (One-off IFT) method in win rate, empirically validating the progressive alignment hypothesis. Our findings suggest that Phased IFT offers a simple yet effective pathway for elevating the instruction-following capabilities of pre-trained language models.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new avenues for automating complex tasks in AI research. This paper investigates the efficacy of different LLMs-Mistral 7B, Llama-2, GPT-4-Turbo and GPT-4.o in extracting leaderboard information from empirical AI research articles. We explore three types of contextual inputs to the models: DocTAET (Document Title, Abstract, Experimental Setup, and Tabular Information), DocREC (Results, Experiments, and Conclusions), and DocFULL (entire document). Our comprehensive study evaluates the performance of these models in generating (Task, Dataset, Metric, Score) quadruples from research papers. The findings reveal significant insights into the strengths and limitations of each model and context type, providing valuable guidance for future AI research automation efforts.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences becomes a key component to obtaining state-of-the-art performance, but it yields a huge cost to construct a large human-annotated preference dataset. To tackle this problem, we propose a new framework that boosts the alignment of LLMs through Self-generated Preference data (Selfie) using only a very small amount of human-annotated preference data. Our key idea is leveraging the human prior knowledge within the small (seed) data and progressively improving the alignment of LLM, by iteratively generating the responses and learning from them with the self-annotated preference data. To be specific, we propose to derive the preference label from the logits of LLM to explicitly extract the model's inherent preference. Compared to the previous approaches using external reward models or implicit in-context learning, we observe that the proposed approach is significantly more effective. In addition, we introduce a noise-aware preference learning algorithm to mitigate the risk of low quality within generated preference data. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly boosts the alignment of LLMs. For example, we achieve superior alignment performance on AlpacaEval 2.0 with only 3.3\% of the ground-truth preference labels in the Ultrafeedback data compared to the cases using the entire data or state-of-the-art baselines.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The value of supervised dimensionality reduction lies in its ability to uncover meaningful connections between data features and labels. Common dimensionality reduction methods embed a set of fixed, latent points, but are not capable of generalizing to an unseen test set. In this paper, we provide an out-of-sample extension method for the random forest-based supervised dimensionality reduction method, RF-PHATE, combining information learned from the random forest model with the function-learning capabilities of autoencoders. Through quantitative assessment of various autoencoder architectures, we identify that networks that reconstruct random forest proximities are more robust for the embedding extension problem. Furthermore, by leveraging proximity-based prototypes, we achieve a 40% reduction in training time without compromising extension quality. Our method does not require label information for out-of-sample points, thus serving as a semi-supervised method, and can achieve consistent quality using only 10% of the training data.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The tasks of object detection and trajectory forecasting play a crucial role in understanding the scene for autonomous driving. These tasks are typically executed in a cascading manner, making them prone to compounding errors. Furthermore, there is usually a very thin interface between the two tasks, creating a lossy information bottleneck. To address these challenges, our approach formulates the union of the two tasks as a trajectory refinement problem, where the first pose is the detection (current time), and the subsequent poses are the waypoints of the multiple forecasts (future time). To tackle this unified task, we design a refinement transformer that infers the presence, pose, and multi-modal future behaviors of objects directly from LiDAR point clouds and high-definition maps. We call this model DeTra, short for object Detection and Trajectory forecasting. In our experiments, we observe that \ourmodel{} outperforms the state-of-the-art on Argoverse 2 Sensor and Waymo Open Dataset by a large margin, across a broad range of metrics. Last but not least, we perform extensive ablation studies that show the value of refinement for this task, that every proposed component contributes positively to its performance, and that key design choices were made.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for a myriad of applications, from natural language processing to decision-making support systems. However, as these models become increasingly integrated into societal frameworks, the imperative to ensure they operate within ethical and moral boundaries has never been more critical. This paper introduces a novel benchmark designed to measure and compare the moral reasoning capabilities of LLMs. We present the first comprehensive dataset specifically curated to probe the moral dimensions of LLM outputs, addressing a wide range of ethical dilemmas and scenarios reflective of real-world complexities. The main contribution of this work lies in the development of benchmark datasets and metrics for assessing the moral identity of LLMs, which accounts for nuance, contextual sensitivity, and alignment with human ethical standards. Our methodology involves a multi-faceted approach, combining quantitative analysis with qualitative insights from ethics scholars to ensure a thorough evaluation of model performance. By applying our benchmark across several leading LLMs, we uncover significant variations in moral reasoning capabilities of different models. These findings highlight the importance of considering moral reasoning in the development and evaluation of LLMs, as well as the need for ongoing research to address the biases and limitations uncovered in our study. We publicly release the benchmark at this https URL and also open-source the code of the project at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>One of the principal objectives of Natural Language Processing (NLP) is to generate meaningful representations from text. Improving the informativeness of the representations has led to a tremendous rise in the dimensionality and the memory footprint. It leads to a cascading effect amplifying the complexity of the downstream model by increasing its parameters. The available techniques cannot be applied to cross-modal applications such as text-to-image. To ameliorate these issues, a novel Text-to-Image methodology for generating fixed-length representations through a self-supervised Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) for semantic evaluation applying transformers (TexIm FAST) has been proposed in this paper. The pictorial representations allow oblivious inference while retaining the linguistic intricacies, and are potent in cross-modal applications. TexIm FAST deals with variable-length sequences and generates fixed-length representations with over 75% reduced memory footprint. It enhances the efficiency of the models for downstream tasks by reducing its parameters. The efficacy of TexIm FAST has been extensively analyzed for the task of Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) upon the MSRPC, CNN/ Daily Mail, and XSum data-sets. The results demonstrate 6% improvement in accuracy compared to the baseline and showcase its exceptional ability to compare disparate length sequences such as a text with its summary.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Methods with adaptive stepsizes, such as AdaGrad and Adam, are essential for training modern Deep Learning models, especially Large Language Models. Typically, the noise in the stochastic gradients is heavy-tailed for the later ones. Gradient clipping provably helps to achieve good high-probability convergence for such noises. However, despite the similarity between AdaGrad/Adam and Clip-SGD, the high-probability convergence of AdaGrad/Adam has not been studied in this case. In this work, we prove that AdaGrad (and its delayed version) can have provably bad high-probability convergence if the noise is heavy-tailed. To fix this issue, we propose a new version of AdaGrad called Clip-RAdaGradD (Clipped Reweighted AdaGrad with Delay) and prove its high-probability convergence bounds with polylogarithmic dependence on the confidence level for smooth convex/non-convex stochastic optimization with heavy-tailed noise. Our empirical evaluations, including NLP model fine-tuning, highlight the superiority of clipped versions of AdaGrad/Adam in handling the heavy-tailed noise.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Radiology reporting is a complex task that requires detailed image understanding, integration of multiple inputs, including comparison with prior imaging, and precise language generation. This makes it ideal for the development and use of generative multimodal models. Here, we extend report generation to include the localisation of individual findings on the image - a task we call grounded report generation. Prior work indicates that grounding is important for clarifying image understanding and interpreting AI-generated text. Therefore, grounded reporting stands to improve the utility and transparency of automated report drafting. To enable evaluation of grounded reporting, we propose a novel evaluation framework - RadFact - leveraging the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). RadFact assesses the factuality of individual generated sentences, as well as correctness of generated spatial localisations when present. We introduce MAIRA-2, a large multimodal model combining a radiology-specific image encoder with a LLM, and trained for the new task of grounded report generation on chest X-rays. MAIRA-2 uses more comprehensive inputs than explored previously: the current frontal image, the current lateral image, the prior frontal image and prior report, as well as the Indication, Technique and Comparison sections of the current report. We demonstrate that these additions significantly improve report quality and reduce hallucinations, establishing a new state of the art on findings generation (without grounding) on MIMIC-CXR while demonstrating the feasibility of grounded reporting as a novel and richer task.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Controlling the attribute intensity of text generation is crucial across scenarios (e.g., writing conciseness, chatting emotion, and explanation clarity). The remarkable capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized text generation, prompting us to explore such \emph{smooth control} of LLM generation. Specifically, we propose metrics to assess the range, calibration, and consistency of the generated text's attribute intensity in response to varying control values, as well as its relevance to the intended context. To quantify the attribute intensity and context relevance, we propose an effective evaluation framework leveraging the Elo rating system and GPT4, both renowned for their robust alignment with human judgment. We look into two viable training-free methods for achieving smooth control of LLMs: (1) Prompting with semantic shifters, and (2) Modifying internal model representations. The evaluations of these two methods are conducted on $5$ different attributes with various models. Our code and dataset can be obtained from \url{this https URL}.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have attracted enormous attention over the past few years with their unparalleled performances. Meanwhile, the soaring cost to train PLMs as well as their amazing generalizability have jointly contributed to few-shot fine-tuning and prompting as the most popular training paradigms for natural language processing (NLP) models. Nevertheless, existing studies have shown that these NLP models can be backdoored such that model behavior is manipulated when trigger tokens are presented. In this paper, we propose PromptFix, a novel backdoor mitigation strategy for NLP models via adversarial prompt-tuning in few-shot settings. Unlike existing NLP backdoor removal methods, which rely on accurate trigger inversion and subsequent model fine-tuning, PromptFix keeps the model parameters intact and only utilizes two extra sets of soft tokens which approximate the trigger and counteract it respectively. The use of soft tokens and adversarial optimization eliminates the need to enumerate possible backdoor configurations and enables an adaptive balance between trigger finding and preservation of performance. Experiments with various backdoor attacks validate the effectiveness of the proposed method and the performances when domain shift is present further shows PromptFix's applicability to models pretrained on unknown data source which is the common case in prompt tuning scenarios.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Advancements in large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing interactive game design, enabling dynamic plotlines and interactions between players and non-player characters (NPCs). However, LLMs may exhibit flaws such as hallucinations, forgetfulness, or misinterpretations of prompts, causing logical inconsistencies and unexpected deviations from intended designs. Automated techniques for detecting such game bugs are still lacking. To address this, we propose a systematic LLM-based method for automatically identifying such bugs from player game logs, eliminating the need for collecting additional data such as post-play surveys. Applied to a text-based game DejaBoom!, our approach effectively identifies bugs inherent in LLM-powered interactive games, surpassing unstructured LLM-powered bug-catching methods and filling the gap in automated detection of logical and design flaws.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Next-item recommender systems are often trained using only positive feedback with randomly-sampled negative feedback. We show the benefits of using real negative feedback both as inputs into the user sequence and also as negative targets for training a next-song recommender system for internet radio. In particular, using explicit negative samples during training helps reduce training time by ~60% while also improving test accuracy by ~6%; adding user skips as additional inputs also can considerably increase user coverage alongside slightly improving accuracy. We test the impact of using a large number of random negative samples to capture a 'harder' one and find that the test accuracy increases with more randomly-sampled negatives, but only to a point. Too many random negatives leads to false negatives that limits the lift, which is still lower than if using true negative feedback. We also find that the test accuracy is fairly robust with respect to the proportion of different feedback types, and compare the learned embeddings for different feedback types.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Query Processing (QP) is optimized by a Cloud-based cache by storing the frequently accessed data closer to users. Nevertheless, the lack of focus on user intention type in queries affected the efficiency of QP in prevailing works. Thus, by using a Contextual Fuzzy Linguistic Inference System (CFLIS), this work analyzed the informational, navigational, and transactional-based intents in queries for enhanced QP. Primarily, the user query is parsed using tokenization, normalization, stop word removal, stemming, and POS tagging and then expanded using the WordNet technique. After expanding the queries, to enhance query understanding and to facilitate more accurate analysis and retrieval in query processing, the named entity is recognized using Bidirectional Encoder UnispecNorm Representations from Transformers (BEUNRT). Next, for efficient QP and retrieval of query information from the semantic cache database, the data is structured using Epanechnikov Kernel-Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure (EK-OPTICS). The features are extracted from the structured data. Now, sentence type is identified and intent keywords are extracted from the parsed query. Next, the extracted features, detected intents and structured data are inputted to the Multi-head Gated Recurrent Learnable Attention Unit (MGR-LAU), which processes the query based on a semantic cache database (stores previously interpreted queries to expedite effective future searches). Moreover, the query is processed with a minimum latency of 12856ms. Lastly, the Semantic Similarity (SS) is analyzed between the retrieved query and the inputted user query, which continues until the similarity reaches 0.9 and above. Thus, the proposed work surpassed the previous methodologies.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the fields of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), integrating multilingual capabilities remains a critical challenge, especially when considering languages with complex scripts such as Arabic. This paper introduces the Comprehensive Post-OCR Parsing and Receipt Understanding Dataset (CORU), a novel dataset specifically designed to enhance OCR and information extraction from receipts in multilingual contexts involving Arabic and English. CORU consists of over 20,000 annotated receipts from diverse retail settings, including supermarkets and clothing stores, alongside 30,000 annotated images for OCR that were utilized to recognize each detected line, and 10,000 items annotated for detailed information extraction. These annotations capture essential details such as merchant names, item descriptions, total prices, receipt numbers, and dates. They are structured to support three primary computational tasks: object detection, OCR, and information extraction. We establish the baseline performance for a range of models on CORU to evaluate the effectiveness of traditional methods, like Tesseract OCR, and more advanced neural network-based approaches. These baselines are crucial for processing the complex and noisy document layouts typical of real-world receipts and for advancing the state of automated multilingual document processing.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capability in different tasks and are bringing transformative changes to many domains. However, keeping the knowledge in LLMs up-to-date remains a challenge once pretraining is complete. It is thus essential to design effective methods to both update obsolete knowledge and induce new knowledge into LLMs. Existing locate-and-edit knowledge editing (KE) method suffers from two limitations. First, the post-edit LLMs by such methods generally have poor capability in answering complex queries that require multi-hop reasoning. Second, the long run-time of such locate-and-edit methods to perform knowledge edits make it infeasible for large scale KE in practice. In this paper, we explore Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques as an alternative for KE. We curate a more comprehensive temporal KE dataset with both knowledge update and knowledge injection examples for KE performance benchmarking. We further probe the effect of fine-tuning on a range of layers in an LLM for the multi-hop QA task. We find that PEFT performs better than locate-and-edit techniques for time-sensitive knowledge edits.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Learning computational fluid dynamics (CFD) traditionally relies on computationally intensive simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable pattern recognition and reasoning abilities in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV). However, these models struggle with the complex geometries inherent in fluid dynamics. We introduce FLUID-LLM, a novel framework combining pre-trained LLMs with spatiotemporal-aware encoding to predict unsteady fluid dynamics. Our approach leverages the temporal autoregressive abilities of LLMs alongside spatial-aware layers, bridging the gap between previous CFD prediction methods. Evaluations on standard benchmarks reveal significant performance improvements across various fluid datasets. Our results demonstrate that FLUID-LLM effectively integrates spatiotemporal information into pre-trained LLMs, enhancing CFD task performance.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has accelerated the progress of handwritten character classification/recognition. Handwritten character recognition (HCR) has found applications in various domains, such as traffic signal detection, language translation, and document information extraction. However, the widespread use of existing HCR technology is yet to be seen as it does not provide reliable character recognition with outstanding accuracy. One of the reasons for unreliable HCR is that existing HCR methods do not take the handwriting styles of non-native writers into account. Hence, further improvement is needed to ensure the reliability and extensive deployment of character recognition technologies for critical tasks. In this work, the classification of English characters written by non-native users is performed by proposing a custom-tailored CNN model. We train this CNN with a new dataset called the handwritten isolated English character (HIEC) dataset. This dataset consists of 16,496 images collected from 260 persons. This paper also includes an ablation study of our CNN by adjusting hyperparameters to identify the best model for the HIEC dataset. The proposed model with five convolutional layers and one hidden layer outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of character recognition accuracy and achieves an accuracy of $\mathbf{97.04}$%. Compared with the second-best model, the relative improvement of our model in terms of classification accuracy is $\mathbf{4.38}$%.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Arabic is known to present unique challenges for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). On one hand, its rich linguistic diversity and wide range of dialects complicate the development of robust, inclusive models. On the other, current multilingual ASR models are compute-intensive and lack proper comprehensive evaluations. In light of these challenges, we distill knowledge from large teacher models into smaller student variants that are more efficient. We also introduce a novel human-annotated dataset covering five under-represented Arabic dialects for evaluation. We further evaluate both our models and existing SoTA multilingual models on both standard available benchmarks and our new dialectal data. Our best-distilled model's overall performance ($45.0$\% WER) surpasses that of a SoTA model twice its size (SeamlessM4T-large-v2, WER=$47.0$\%) and its teacher model (Whisper-large-v2, WER=$55.1$\%), and its average performance on our new dialectal data ($56.9$\% WER) outperforms all other models. To gain more insight into the poor performance of these models on dialectal data, we conduct an error analysis and report the main types of errors the different models tend to make.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Fuzzing is an effective technique for discovering software vulnerabilities by generating random test inputs and executing them against the target program. However, fuzzing large and complex programs remains challenging due to difficulties in uncovering deeply hidden vulnerabilities. This paper addresses the limitations of existing coverage-guided fuzzers, focusing on the scheduler and mutator components. Existing schedulers suffer from information sparsity and the inability to handle fine-grained feedback metrics. The mutators are agnostic of target program branches, leading to wasted computation and slower coverage exploration. To overcome these issues, we propose an end-to-end online stochastic control formulation for coverage-guided fuzzing. Our approach incorporates a novel scheduler and custom mutator that can adapt to branch logic, maximizing aggregate edge coverage achieved over multiple stages. The scheduler utilizes fine-grained branch distance measures to identify frontier branches, where new coverage is likely to be achieved. The mutator leverages branch distance information to perform efficient and targeted seed mutations, leading to robust progress with minimal overhead. We present FOX, a proof-of-concept implementation of our control-theoretic approach, and compare it to industry-standard coverage-guided fuzzers. 6 CPU-years of extensive evaluations on the FuzzBench dataset and complex real-world programs (a total of 38 test programs) demonstrate that FOX outperforms existing state-of-the-art fuzzers, achieving average coverage improvements up to 26.45% in real-world standalone programs and 6.59% in FuzzBench programs over the state-of-the-art AFL++. In addition, it uncovers 20 unique bugs in popular real-world applications including eight that are previously unknown, showcasing real-world security impact.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The impressive capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a powerful approach to reimagine users' typing experience. This paper demonstrates Proofread, a novel Gboard feature powered by a server-side LLM in Gboard, enabling seamless sentence-level and paragraph-level corrections with a single tap. We describe the complete system in this paper, from data generation, metrics design to model tuning and deployment. To obtain models with sufficient quality, we implement a careful data synthetic pipeline tailored to online use cases, design multifaceted metrics, employ a two-stage tuning approach to acquire the dedicated LLM for the feature: the Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT) for foundational quality, followed by the Reinforcement Learning (RL) tuning approach for targeted refinement. Specifically, we find sequential tuning on Rewrite and proofread tasks yields the best quality in SFT stage, and propose global and direct rewards in the RL tuning stage to seek further improvement. Extensive experiments on a human-labeled golden set showed our tuned PaLM2-XS model achieved 85.56\% good ratio. We launched the feature to Pixel 8 devices by serving the model on TPU v5 in Google Cloud, with thousands of daily active users. Serving latency was significantly reduced by quantization, bucket inference, text segmentation, and speculative decoding. Our demo could be seen in \href{this https URL}{Youtube}.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) allow us to generate high-quality human-like text. One interesting task in natural language processing (NLP) is named entity recognition (NER), which seeks to detect mentions of relevant information in documents. This paper presents llmNER, a Python library for implementing zero-shot and few-shot NER with LLMs; by providing an easy-to-use interface, llmNER can compose prompts, query the model, and parse the completion returned by the LLM. Also, the library enables the user to perform prompt engineering efficiently by providing a simple interface to test multiple variables. We validated our software on two NER tasks to show the library's flexibility. llmNER aims to push the boundaries of in-context learning research by removing the barrier of the prompting and parsing steps.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the field of self-supervised depth estimation, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers have traditionally been dominant. However, both architectures struggle with efficiently handling long-range dependencies due to their local focus or computational demands. To overcome this limitation, we present MambaDepth, a versatile network tailored for self-supervised depth estimation. Drawing inspiration from the strengths of the Mamba architecture, renowned for its adept handling of lengthy sequences and its ability to capture global context efficiently through a State Space Model (SSM), we introduce MambaDepth. This innovative architecture combines the U-Net's effectiveness in self-supervised depth estimation with the advanced capabilities of Mamba. MambaDepth is structured around a purely Mamba-based encoder-decoder framework, incorporating skip connections to maintain spatial information at various levels of the network. This configuration promotes an extensive feature learning process, enabling the capture of fine details and broader contexts within depth maps. Furthermore, we have developed a novel integration technique within the Mamba blocks to facilitate uninterrupted connectivity and information flow between the encoder and decoder components, thereby improving depth accuracy. Comprehensive testing across the established KITTI dataset demonstrates MambaDepth's superiority over leading CNN and Transformer-based models in self-supervised depth estimation task, allowing it to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, MambaDepth proves its superior generalization capacities on other datasets such as Make3D and Cityscapes. MambaDepth's performance heralds a new era in effective long-range dependency modeling for self-supervised depth estimation.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Differential privacy is a framework for protecting the identity of individual data points in the decision-making process. In this note, we propose a new form of differential privacy called tangent differential privacy. Compared with the usual differential privacy that is defined uniformly across data distributions, tangent differential privacy is tailored towards a specific data distribution of interest. It also allows for general distribution distances such as total variation distance and Wasserstein distance. In the case of risk minimization, we show that entropic regularization guarantees tangent differential privacy under rather general conditions on the risk function.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present M&M VTO, a mix and match virtual try-on method that takes as input multiple garment images, text description for garment layout and an image of a person. An example input includes: an image of a shirt, an image of a pair of pants, "rolled sleeves, shirt tucked in", and an image of a person. The output is a visualization of how those garments (in the desired layout) would look like on the given person. Key contributions of our method are: 1) a single stage diffusion based model, with no super resolution cascading, that allows to mix and match multiple garments at 1024x512 resolution preserving and warping intricate garment details, 2) architecture design (VTO UNet Diffusion Transformer) to disentangle denoising from person specific features, allowing for a highly effective finetuning strategy for identity preservation (6MB model per individual vs 4GB achieved with, e.g., dreambooth finetuning); solving a common identity loss problem in current virtual try-on methods, 3) layout control for multiple garments via text inputs specifically finetuned over PaLI-3 for virtual try-on task. Experimental results indicate that M&M VTO achieves state-of-the-art performance both qualitatively and quantitatively, as well as opens up new opportunities for virtual try-on via language-guided and multi-garment try-on.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper proposes a short-range FMCW radar-based facial authentication and out-of-distribution (OOD) detection framework. Our pipeline jointly estimates the correct classes for the in-distribution (ID) samples and detects the OOD samples to prevent their inaccurate prediction. Our reconstruction-based architecture consists of a main convolutional block with one encoder and multi-decoder configuration, and intermediate linear encoder-decoder parts. Together, these elements form an accurate human face classifier and a robust OOD detector. For our dataset, gathered using a 60 GHz short-range FMCW radar, our network achieves an average classification accuracy of 98.07% in identifying in-distribution human faces. As an OOD detector, it achieves an average Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) curve of 98.50% and an average False Positive Rate at 95% True Positive Rate (FPR95) of 6.20%. Also, our extensive experiments show that the proposed approach outperforms previous OOD detectors in terms of common OOD detection metrics.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose an algorithm capable of identifying and eliminating irrelevant layers of a neural network during the early stages of training. In contrast to weight or filter-level pruning, layer pruning reduces the harder to parallelize sequential computation of a neural network. We employ a structure using residual connections around nonlinear network sections that allow the flow of information through the network once a nonlinear section is pruned. Our approach is based on variational inference principles using Gaussian scale mixture priors on the neural network weights and allows for substantial cost savings during both training and inference. More specifically, the variational posterior distribution of scalar Bernoulli random variables multiplying a layer weight matrix of its nonlinear sections is learned, similarly to adaptive layer-wise dropout. To overcome challenges of concurrent learning and pruning such as premature pruning and lack of robustness with respect to weight initialization or the size of the starting network, we adopt the "flattening" hyper-prior on the prior parameters. We prove that, as a result of its usage, the solutions of the resulting optimization problem describe deterministic networks with parameters of the posterior distribution at either 0 or 1. We formulate a projected SGD algorithm and prove its convergence to such a solution using stochastic approximation results. In particular, we prove conditions that lead to a layer's weights converging to zero and derive practical pruning conditions from the theoretical results. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on the MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets and common LeNet, VGG16 and ResNet architectures. The simulations demonstrate that our method achieves state-of the-art performance for layer pruning at reduced computational cost in distinction to competing methods due to the concurrent training and pruning.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the growing popularity of text-to-image generative models, there has been increasing focus on understanding their risks and biases. Recent work has found that state-of-the-art models struggle to depict everyday objects with the true diversity of the real world and have notable gaps between geographic regions. In this work, we aim to increase the diversity of generated images of common objects such that per-region variations are representative of the real world. We introduce an inference time intervention, contextualized Vendi Score Guidance (c-VSG), that guides the backwards steps of latent diffusion models to increase the diversity of a sample as compared to a "memory bank" of previously generated images while constraining the amount of variation within that of an exemplar set of real-world contextualizing images. We evaluate c-VSG with two geographically representative datasets and find that it substantially increases the diversity of generated images, both for the worst performing regions and on average, while simultaneously maintaining or improving image quality and consistency. Additionally, qualitative analyses reveal that diversity of generated images is significantly improved, including along the lines of reductive region portrayals present in the original model. We hope that this work is a step towards text-to-image generative models that reflect the true geographic diversity of the world.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>An experienced human Observer reading a document -- such as a crime report -- creates a succinct plot-like $\textit{``Working Memory''}$ comprising different actors, their prototypical roles and states at any point, their evolution over time based on their interactions, and even a map of missing Semantic parts anticipating them in the future. $\textit{An equivalent AI Observer currently does not exist}$. We introduce the $\textbf{[G]}$enerative $\textbf{[S]}$emantic $\textbf{[W]}$orkspace (GSW) -- comprising an $\textit{``Operator''}$ and a $\textit{``Reconciler''}$ -- that leverages advancements in LLMs to create a generative-style Semantic framework, as opposed to a traditionally predefined set of lexicon labels. Given a text segment $C_n$ that describes an ongoing situation, the $\textit{Operator}$ instantiates actor-centric Semantic maps (termed ``Workspace instance'' $\mathcal{W}_n$). The $\textit{Reconciler}$ resolves differences between $\mathcal{W}_n$ and a ``Working memory'' $\mathcal{M}_n^*$ to generate the updated $\mathcal{M}_{n+1}^*$. GSW outperforms well-known baselines on several tasks ($\sim 94\%$ vs. FST, GLEN, BertSRL - multi-sentence Semantics extraction, $\sim 15\%$ vs. NLI-BERT, $\sim 35\%$ vs. QA). By mirroring the real Observer, GSW provides the first step towards Spatial Computing assistants capable of understanding individual intentions and predicting future behavior.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Constrained optimization offers a powerful framework to prescribe desired behaviors in neural network models. Typically, constrained problems are solved via their min-max Lagrangian formulations, which exhibit unstable oscillatory dynamics when optimized using gradient descent-ascent. The adoption of constrained optimization techniques in the machine learning community is currently limited by the lack of reliable, general-purpose update schemes for the Lagrange multipliers. This paper proposes the $\nu$PI algorithm and contributes an optimization perspective on Lagrange multiplier updates based on PI controllers, extending the work of Stooke, Achiam and Abbeel (2020). We provide theoretical and empirical insights explaining the inability of momentum methods to address the shortcomings of gradient descent-ascent, and contrast this with the empirical success of our proposed $\nu$PI controller. Moreover, we prove that $\nu$PI generalizes popular momentum methods for single-objective minimization. Our experiments demonstrate that $\nu$PI reliably stabilizes the multiplier dynamics and its hyperparameters enjoy robust and predictable behavior.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Spatial reasoning is a crucial component of both biological and artificial intelligence. In this work, we present a comprehensive study of the capability of current state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) on spatial reasoning. To support our study, we created and contribute a novel Spatial Reasoning Characterization (SpaRC) framework and Spatial Reasoning Paths (SpaRP) datasets, to enable an in-depth understanding of the spatial relations and compositions as well as the usefulness of spatial reasoning chains. We found that all the state-of-the-art LLMs do not perform well on the datasets -- their performances are consistently low across different setups. The spatial reasoning capability improves substantially as model sizes scale up. Finetuning both large language models (e.g., Llama-2-70B) and smaller ones (e.g., Llama-2-13B) can significantly improve their F1-scores by 7--32 absolute points. We also found that the top proprietary LLMs still significantly outperform their open-source counterparts in topological spatial understanding and reasoning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As space missions aim to explore increasingly hazardous terrain, accurate and timely position estimates are required to ensure safe navigation. Vision-based navigation achieves this goal through correlating impact craters visible through onboard imagery with a known database to estimate a craft's pose. However, existing literature has not sufficiently evaluated crater-detection algorithm (CDA) performance from imagery containing off-nadir view angles. In this work, we evaluate the performance of Mask R-CNN for crater detection, comparing models pretrained on simulated data containing off-nadir view angles and to pretraining on real-lunar images. We demonstrate pretraining on real-lunar images is superior despite the lack of images containing off-nadir view angles, achieving detection performance of 63.1 F1-score and ellipse-regression performance of 0.701 intersection over union. This work provides the first quantitative analysis of performance of CDAs on images containing off-nadir view angles. Towards the development of increasingly robust CDAs, we additionally provide the first annotated CDA dataset with off-nadir view angles from the Chang'e 5 Landing Camera.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) exhibit robust capabilities in text generation and comprehension, mimicking human behavior and exhibiting synthetic personalities. However, some LLMs have displayed offensive personality, propagating toxic discourse. Existing literature neglects the origin and evolution of LLM personalities, as well as the effective personality control. To fill these gaps, our study embarked on a comprehensive investigation into LLM personality control. We investigated several typical methods to influence LLMs, including three training methods: Continual Pre-training, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), along with inference phase considerations (prompts). Our investigation revealed a hierarchy of effectiveness in control: Prompt > SFT > RLHF > Continual Pre-train. Notably, SFT exhibits a higher control success rate compared to prompt induction. While prompts prove highly effective, we found that prompt-induced personalities are less robust than those trained, making them more prone to showing conflicting personalities under reverse personality prompt induction. Besides, harnessing the strengths of both SFT and prompt, we proposed $\underline{\text{P}}$rompt $\underline{\text{I}}$nduction post $\underline{\text{S}}$upervised $\underline{\text{F}}$ine-tuning (PISF), which emerges as the most effective and robust strategy for controlling LLMs' personality, displaying high efficacy, high success rates, and high robustness. Even under reverse personality prompt induction, LLMs controlled by PISF still exhibit stable and robust personalities.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Continual Learning (CL) poses a significant challenge in Artificial Intelligence, aiming to mirror the human ability to incrementally acquire knowledge and skills. While extensive research has focused on CL within the context of classification tasks, the advent of increasingly powerful generative models necessitates the exploration of Continual Learning of Generative models (CLoG). This paper advocates for shifting the research focus from classification-based CL to CLoG. We systematically identify the unique challenges presented by CLoG compared to traditional classification-based CL. We adapt three types of existing CL methodologies, replay-based, regularization-based, and parameter-isolation-based methods to generative tasks and introduce comprehensive benchmarks for CLoG that feature great diversity and broad task coverage. Our benchmarks and results yield intriguing insights that can be valuable for developing future CLoG methods. Additionally, we will release a codebase designed to facilitate easy benchmarking and experimentation in CLoG publicly at this https URL. We believe that shifting the research focus to CLoG will benefit the continual learning community and illuminate the path for next-generation AI-generated content (AIGC) in a lifelong learning paradigm.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated representation learning (FRL) is a popular personalized federated learning (FL) framework where clients work together to train a common representation while retaining their personalized heads. Existing studies, however, largely focus on the over-parameterized regime. In this paper, we make the initial efforts to investigate FRL in the under-parameterized regime, where the FL model is insufficient to express the variations in all ground-truth models. We propose a novel FRL algorithm FLUTE, and theoretically characterize its sample complexity and convergence rate for linear models in the under-parameterized regime. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first FRL algorithm with provable performance guarantees in this regime. FLUTE features a data-independent random initialization and a carefully designed objective function that aids the distillation of subspace spanned by the global optimal representation from the misaligned local representations. On the technical side, we bridge low-rank matrix approximation techniques with the FL analysis, which may be of broad interest. We also extend FLUTE beyond linear representations. Experimental results demonstrate that FLUTE outperforms state-of-the-art FRL solutions in both synthetic and real-world tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Tracking and segmenting multiple objects in complex scenes has always been a challenge in the field of video object segmentation, especially in scenarios where objects are occluded and split into parts. In such cases, the definition of objects becomes very ambiguous. The motivation behind the MOSE dataset is how to clearly recognize and distinguish objects in complex scenes. In this challenge, we propose a semantic embedding video object segmentation model and use the salient features of objects as query representations. The semantic understanding helps the model to recognize parts of the objects and the salient feature captures the more discriminative features of the objects. Trained on a large-scale video object segmentation dataset, our model achieves first place (\textbf{84.45\%}) in the test set of PVUW Challenge 2024: Complex Video Object Segmentation Track.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, explainability, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The increasing complexity of foundational models underscores the necessity for explainability, particularly for fine-tuning, the most widely used training method for adapting models to downstream tasks. Instance attribution, one type of explanation, attributes the model prediction to each training example by an instance score. However, the robustness of instance scores, specifically towards dataset resampling, has been overlooked. To bridge this gap, we propose a notion of robustness on the sign of the instance score. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that the popular leave-one-out-based methods lack robustness, while the Shapley value behaves significantly better, but at a higher computational cost. Accordingly, we introduce an efficient fine-tuning-free approximation of the Shapley value (FreeShap) for instance attribution based on the neural tangent kernel. We empirically demonstrate that FreeShap outperforms other methods for instance attribution and other data-centric applications such as data removal, data selection, and wrong label detection, and further generalize our scale to large language models (LLMs).

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Anomaly detection (AD) has been extensively studied and applied in a wide range of scenarios in the recent past. However, there are still gaps between achieved and desirable levels of recognition accuracy for making AD for practical applications. In this paper, we start from an insightful analysis of two types of fundamental yet representative failure cases in the baseline model, and reveal reasons that hinder current AD methods from achieving a higher recognition accuracy. Specifically, by Case-1, we found that the main reasons detrimental to current AD methods is that the inputs to the recovery model contain a large number of detailed features to be recovered, which leads to the normal/abnormal area has-not/has been recovered into its original state. By Case-2, we surprisingly found that the abnormal area that cannot be recognized in image-level representations can be easily recognized in the feature-level representation. Based on the above observations, we propose a novel Recover-then-Discriminate (ReDi) framework for AD. ReDi takes a self-generated feature map and a selected prompted image as explicit input information to solve problems in case-1. Concurrently, a feature-level discriminative network is proposed to enhance abnormal differences between the recovered representation and the input representation. Extensive experimental results on two popular yet challenging AD datasets validate that ReDi achieves the new state-of-the-art accuracy.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Existing domain generalization (DG) methods for cross-person generalization tasks often face challenges in capturing intra- and inter-domain style diversity, resulting in domain gaps with the target domain. In this study, we explore a novel perspective to tackle this problem, a process conceptualized as domain padding. This proposal aims to enrich the domain diversity by synthesizing intra- and inter-domain style data while maintaining robustness to class labels. We instantiate this concept using a conditional diffusion model and introduce a style-fused sampling strategy to enhance data generation diversity. In contrast to traditional condition-guided sampling, our style-fused sampling strategy allows for the flexible use of one or more random styles to guide data synthesis. This feature presents a notable advancement: it allows for the maximum utilization of possible permutations and combinations among existing styles to generate a broad spectrum of new style instances. Empirical evaluations on a board of datasets demonstrate that our generated data achieves remarkable diversity within the domain space. Both intra- and inter-domain generated data have proven to be significant and valuable, contributing to varying degrees of performance enhancements. Notably, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art DG methods in all human activity recognition tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper presents a novel approach in Explainable AI (XAI), integrating contrastive explanations with differential privacy in clustering methods. For several basic clustering problems, including $k$-median and $k$-means, we give efficient differential private contrastive explanations that achieve essentially the same explanations as those that non-private clustering explanations can obtain. We define contrastive explanations as the utility difference between the original clustering utility and utility from clustering with a specifically fixed centroid. In each contrastive scenario, we designate a specific data point as the fixed centroid position, enabling us to measure the impact of this constraint on clustering utility under differential privacy. Extensive experiments across various datasets show our method's effectiveness in providing meaningful explanations without significantly compromising data privacy or clustering utility. This underscores our contribution to privacy-aware machine learning, demonstrating the feasibility of achieving a balance between privacy and utility in the explanation of clustering tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>explainability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The self-attention mechanism has been adopted in several widely-used message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) (e.g., GATs), which adaptively controls the amount of information that flows along the edges of the underlying graph. This usage of attention has made such models a baseline for studies on explainable AI (XAI) since interpretations via attention have been popularized in various domains (e.g., natural language processing and computer vision). However, existing studies often use naive calculations to derive attribution scores from attention, and do not take the precise and careful calculation of edge attribution into consideration. In our study, we aim to fill the gap between the widespread usage of attention-enabled MPNNs and their potential in largely under-explored explainability, a topic that has been actively investigated in other areas. To this end, as the first attempt, we formalize the problem of edge attribution from attention weights in GNNs. Then, we propose GATT, an edge attribution calculation method built upon the computation tree. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method when evaluating attributions from GATs. Conversely, we empirically validate that simply averaging attention weights over graph attention layers is insufficient to interpret the GAT model's behavior.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs), including both proprietary and open-source models, have showcased remarkable capabilities in addressing a wide range of downstream tasks. Nonetheless, when it comes to practical Chinese legal tasks, these models fail to meet the actual requirements. Proprietary models do not ensure data privacy for sensitive legal cases, while open-source models demonstrate unsatisfactory performance due to their lack of legal knowledge. To address this problem, we introduce LawGPT, the first open-source model specifically designed for Chinese legal applications. LawGPT comprises two key components: legal-oriented pre-training and legal supervised fine-tuning. Specifically, we employ large-scale Chinese legal documents for legal-oriented pre-training to incorporate legal domain knowledge. To further improve the model's performance on downstream legal tasks, we create a knowledge-driven instruction dataset for legal supervised fine-tuning. Our experimental results demonstrate that LawGPT outperforms the open-source LLaMA 7B model.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative Foundation Models (GFMs) have produced synthetic data with remarkable quality in modalities such as images and text. However, applying GFMs to tabular data poses significant challenges due to the inherent heterogeneity of table features. Existing cross-table learning frameworks are hindered by the absence of both a generative model backbone and a decoding mechanism for heterogeneous feature values. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Cross-Table Synthesizer (CTSyn), a diffusion-based foundational model tailored for tabular data generation. CTSyn introduces three major components: an aggregator that consolidates heterogeneous tables into a unified latent space; a conditional latent diffusion model for sampling from this space; and type-specific decoders that reconstruct values of varied data types from sampled latent vectors. Extensive testing on real-world datasets reveals that CTSyn not only significantly outperforms existing table synthesizers in utility and diversity, but also uniquely enhances performances of downstream machine learning beyond what is achievable with real data, thus establishing a new paradigm for synthetic data generation.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Remarkable advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled high-quality text summarization. However, this capability is currently accessible only through LLMs of substantial size or proprietary LLMs with usage fees. In response, smaller-scale LLMs (sLLMs) of easy accessibility and low costs have been extensively studied, yet they often suffer from missing key information and entities, i.e., low relevance, in particular, when input documents are long. We hence propose a key-element-informed instruction tuning for summarization, so-called KEITSum, which identifies key elements in documents and instructs sLLM to generate summaries capturing these key elements. Experimental results on dialogue and news datasets demonstrate that sLLM with KEITSum indeed provides high-quality summarization with higher relevance and less hallucinations, competitive to proprietary LLM.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The creation of 4D avatars (i.e., animated 3D avatars) from text description typically uses text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models to synthesize 3D avatars in the canonical space and subsequently applies animation with target motions. However, such an optimization-by-animation paradigm has several drawbacks. (1) For pose-agnostic optimization, the rendered images in canonical pose for naive Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) exhibit domain gap and cannot preserve view-consistency using only T2I priors, and (2) For post hoc animation, simply applying the source motions to target 3D avatars yields translation artifacts and misalignment. To address these issues, we propose Skeleton-aware Text-based 4D Avatar generation with in-network motion Retargeting (STAR). STAR considers the geometry and skeleton differences between the template mesh and target avatar, and corrects the mismatched source motion by resorting to the pretrained motion retargeting techniques. With the informatively retargeted and occlusion-aware skeleton, we embrace the skeleton-conditioned T2I and text-to-video (T2V) priors, and propose a hybrid SDS module to coherently provide multi-view and frame-consistent supervision signals. Hence, STAR can progressively optimize the geometry, texture, and motion in an end-to-end manner. The quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate our proposed STAR can synthesize high-quality 4D avatars with vivid animations that align well with the text description. Additional ablation studies shows the contributions of each component in STAR. The source code and demos are available at: \href{this https URL}{this https URL}.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Cross-lingual summarization (XLS) aims to generate a summary in a target language different from the source language document. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promising zero-shot XLS performance, their few-shot capabilities on this task remain unexplored, especially for low-resource languages with limited parallel data. In this paper, we investigate the few-shot XLS performance of various models, including Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4. Our experiments demonstrate that few-shot learning significantly improves the XLS performance of LLMs, particularly GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, in low-resource settings. However, the open-source model Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 struggles to adapt effectively to the XLS task with limited examples. Our findings highlight the potential of few-shot learning for improving XLS performance and the need for further research in designing LLM architectures and pre-training objectives tailored for this task. We provide a future work direction to explore more effective few-shot learning strategies and to investigate the transfer learning capabilities of LLMs for cross-lingual summarization.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Model (LLM) pre-training exhausts an ever growing compute budget, yet recent research has demonstrated that careful document selection enables comparable model quality with only a fraction of the FLOPs. Inspired by efforts suggesting that domain-specific training document selection is in fact an interpretable process [Gunasekar et al., 2023], as well as research showing that instruction-finetuned LLMs are adept zero-shot data labelers [Gilardi et al.,2023], we explore a promising direction for scalable general-domain document selection; employing a prompted LLM as a document grader, we distill quality labels into a classifier model, which is applied at scale to a large, and already heavily-filtered, web-crawl-derived corpus autonomously. Following the guidance of this classifier, we drop 75% of the corpus and train LLMs on the remaining data. Results across multiple benchmarks show that: 1. Filtering allows us to quality-match a model trained on the full corpus across diverse benchmarks with at most 70% of the FLOPs, 2. More capable LLM labelers and classifier models lead to better results that are less sensitive to the labeler's prompt, 3. In-context learning helps to boost the performance of less-capable labeling models. In all cases we use open-source datasets, models, recipes, and evaluation frameworks, so that results can be reproduced by the community.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising results on various language and vision tasks. Recently, there has been growing interest in applying LLMs to graph-based tasks, particularly on Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs). However, most studies have focused on node classification, while the use of LLMs for link prediction (LP) remains understudied. In this work, we propose a new task on LLMs, where the objective is to leverage LLMs to predict missing links between nodes in a graph. This task evaluates an LLM's ability to reason over structured data and infer new facts based on learned patterns. This new task poses two key challenges: (1) How to effectively integrate pairwise structural information into the LLMs, which is known to be crucial for LP performance, and (2) how to solve the computational bottleneck when teaching LLMs to perform LP. To address these challenges, we propose LinkGPT, the first end-to-end trained LLM for LP tasks. To effectively enhance the LLM's ability to understand the underlying structure, we design a two-stage instruction tuning approach where the first stage fine-tunes the pairwise encoder, projector, and node projector, and the second stage further fine-tunes the LLMs to predict links. To address the efficiency challenges at inference time, we introduce a retrieval-reranking scheme. Experiments show that LinkGPT can achieve state-of-the-art performance on real-world graphs as well as superior generalization in zero-shot and few-shot learning, surpassing existing benchmarks. At inference time, it can achieve $10\times$ speedup while maintaining high LP accuracy.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The capacity of existing human keypoint localization models is limited by keypoint priors provided by the training data. To alleviate this restriction and pursue more general model, this work studies keypoint localization from a different perspective by reasoning locations based on keypiont clues in text descriptions. We propose LocLLM, the first Large-Language Model (LLM) based keypoint localization model that takes images and text instructions as inputs and outputs the desired keypoint coordinates. LocLLM leverages the strong reasoning capability of LLM and clues of keypoint type, location, and relationship in textual descriptions for keypoint localization. To effectively tune LocLLM, we construct localization-based instruction conversations to connect keypoint description with corresponding coordinates in input image, and fine-tune the whole model in a parameter-efficient training pipeline. LocLLM shows remarkable performance on standard 2D/3D keypoint localization benchmarks. Moreover, incorporating language clues into the localization makes LocLLM show superior flexibility and generalizable capability in cross dataset keypoint localization, and even detecting novel type of keypoints unseen during training.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The popularity of visual generative AI models like DALL-E 3, Stable Diffusion XL, Stable Video Diffusion, and Sora has been increasing. Through extensive evaluation, we discovered that the state-of-the-art visual generative models can generate content that bears a striking resemblance to characters protected by intellectual property rights held by major entertainment companies (such as Sony, Marvel, and Nintendo), which raises potential legal concerns. This happens when the input prompt contains the character's name or even just descriptive details about their characteristics. To mitigate such IP infringement problems, we also propose a defense method against it. In detail, we develop a revised generation paradigm that can identify potentially infringing generated content and prevent IP infringement by utilizing guidance techniques during the diffusion process. It has the capability to recognize generated content that may be infringing on intellectual property rights, and mitigate such infringement by employing guidance methods throughout the diffusion process without retrain or fine-tune the pretrained models. Experiments on well-known character IPs like Spider-Man, Iron Man, and Superman demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed defense method. Our data and code can be found at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Most of the existing compositional generalization datasets are synthetically-generated, resulting in a lack of natural language variation. While there have been recent attempts to introduce non-synthetic datasets for compositional generalization, they suffer from either limited data scale or a lack of diversity in the forms of combinations. To better investigate compositional generalization with more linguistic phenomena and compositional diversity, we propose the DIsh NamE Recognition (DiNeR) task and create a large realistic Chinese dataset. Given a recipe instruction, models are required to recognize the dish name composed of diverse combinations of food, actions, and flavors. Our dataset consists of 3,811 dishes and 228,114 recipes, and involves plenty of linguistic phenomena such as anaphora, omission and ambiguity. We provide two strong baselines based on T5 and large language models (LLMs). This work contributes a challenging task, baseline methods to tackle the task, and insights into compositional generalization in the context of dish name recognition.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Leveraging external knowledge is crucial for achieving high performance in knowledge-intensive tasks, such as question answering. The retrieve-and-read approach is widely adopted for integrating external knowledge into a language model. However, this approach suffers from increased computational cost and latency due to the long context length, which grows proportionally with the number of retrieved knowledge. Furthermore, existing retrieval-augmented models typically retrieve information from a single type of knowledge source, limiting their scalability to diverse knowledge sources with varying structures. In this work, we introduce an efficient memory-augmented transformer called MATTER, designed to retrieve relevant knowledge from multiple heterogeneous knowledge sources. Specifically, our model retrieves and reads from both unstructured sources (paragraphs) and semi-structured sources (QA pairs) in the form of fixed-length neural memories. We demonstrate that our model outperforms existing efficient retrieval-augmented models on popular QA benchmarks in terms of both accuracy and speed. Furthermore, MATTER achieves competitive results compared to conventional read-and-retrieve models while having 100x throughput during inference.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Music is a universal language that can communicate emotions and feelings. It forms an essential part of the whole spectrum of creative media, ranging from movies to social media posts. Machine learning models that can synthesize music are predominantly conditioned on textual descriptions of it. Inspired by how musicians compose music not just from a movie script, but also through visualizations, we propose MeLFusion, a model that can effectively use cues from a textual description and the corresponding image to synthesize music. MeLFusion is a text-to-music diffusion model with a novel "visual synapse", which effectively infuses the semantics from the visual modality into the generated music. To facilitate research in this area, we introduce a new dataset MeLBench, and propose a new evaluation metric IMSM. Our exhaustive experimental evaluation suggests that adding visual information to the music synthesis pipeline significantly improves the quality of generated music, measured both objectively and subjectively, with a relative gain of up to 67.98% on the FAD score. We hope that our work will gather attention to this pragmatic, yet relatively under-explored research area.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The challenge of open-vocabulary recognition lies in the model has no clue of new categories it is applied to. Existing works have proposed different methods to embed category cues into the model, \eg, through few-shot fine-tuning, providing category names or textual descriptions to Vision-Language Models. Fine-tuning is time-consuming and degrades the generalization capability. Textual descriptions could be ambiguous and fail to depict visual details. This paper tackles open-vocabulary recognition from a different perspective by referring to multi-modal clues composed of textual descriptions and exemplar images. Our method, named OVMR, adopts two innovative components to pursue a more robust category cues embedding. A multi-modal classifier is first generated by dynamically complementing textual descriptions with image exemplars. A preference-based refinement module is hence applied to fuse uni-modal and multi-modal classifiers, with the aim to alleviate issues of low-quality exemplar images or textual descriptions. The proposed OVMR is a plug-and-play module, and works well with exemplar images randomly crawled from the Internet. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the promising performance of OVMR, \eg, it outperforms existing methods across various scenarios and setups.

By harnessing LLMs for logical reasoning, LogiCode autonomously generates Python codes to pinpoint anomalies such as incorrect component quantities or missing elements, marking a significant leap forward in anomaly detection technologies. A custom dataset "LOCO-Annotations" and a benchmark "LogiBench" are introduced to evaluate the LogiCode's performance across various metrics including binary classification accuracy, code generation success rate, and precision in reasoning. Findings demonstrate LogiCode's enhanced interpretability, significantly improving the accuracy of logical anomaly detection and offering detailed explanations for identified anomalies. This represents a notable shift towards more intelligent, LLM-driven approaches in industrial anomaly detection, promising substantial impacts on industry-specific applications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As a common image processing technique, image decomposition is often used to extract complementary information between modalities. In current decomposition-based image fusion methods, typically, source images are decomposed into three parts at single scale (i.e., visible-exclusive part, infrared-exclusive part, and common part) and lacking interaction between modalities during the decomposition process. These results in the inability of fusion images to effectively focus on finer complementary information between modalities at various scales. To address the above issue, a novel decomposition mechanism, Continuous Decomposition Fusion (CDeFuse), is proposed. Firstly, CDeFuse extends the original three-part decomposition to a more general K-part decomposition at each scale through similarity constraints to fuse multi-scale information and achieve a finer representation of decomposition features. Secondly, a Continuous Decomposition Module (CDM) is introduced to assist K-part decomposition. Its core component, State Transformer (ST), efficiently captures complementary information between modalities by utilizing multi-head self-attention mechanism. Finally, a novel decomposition loss function and the corresponding computational optimization strategy are utilized to ensure the smooth progress of the decomposition process while maintaining linear growth in time complexity with the number of decomposition results K. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our CDeFuse achieves comparable performance compared to previous methods. The code will be publicly available.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) demonstrate substantial capabilities in natural language understanding and generation tasks. With the growing number of LLMs, how to harness the collective expertise of multiple LLMs is an exciting open direction. Toward this goal, we propose a new approach that leverages the collective strengths of multiple LLMs through a Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) methodology. In our approach, we construct a layered MoA architecture wherein each layer comprises multiple LLM agents. Each agent takes all the outputs from agents in the previous layer as auxiliary information in generating its response. MoA models achieves state-of-art performance on AlpacaEval 2.0, MT-Bench and FLASK, surpassing GPT-4 Omni. For example, our MoA using only open-source LLMs is the leader of AlpacaEval 2.0 by a substantial gap, achieving a score of 65.1% compared to 57.5% by GPT-4 Omni.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, protect, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated recommender systems have been crucially enhanced through data sharing and continuous model updates, attributed to the pervasive connectivity and distributed computing capabilities of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Given the sensitivity of IoT data, transparent data processing in data sharing and model updates is paramount. However, existing methods fall short in tracing the flow of shared data and the evolution of model updates. Consequently, data sharing is vulnerable to exploitation by malicious entities, raising significant data privacy concerns, while excluding data sharing will result in sub-optimal recommendations. To mitigate these concerns, we present LIBERATE, a privacy-traceable federated recommender system. We design a blockchain-based traceability mechanism, ensuring data privacy during data sharing and model updates. We further enhance privacy protection by incorporating local differential privacy in user-server communication. Extensive evaluations with the real-world dataset corroborate LIBERATE's capabilities in ensuring data privacy during data sharing and model update while maintaining efficiency and performance. Results underscore blockchain-based traceability mechanism as a promising solution for privacy-preserving in federated recommender systems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vehicle Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) have experienced significant development in recent years, playing a crucial role in enhancing the driving experience by enabling safer and more efficient inter-vehicle interactions through information exchange. Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication is particularly vital as it not only helps to prevent collisions and improve traffic efficiency but also provides essential situational awareness to drivers or autonomous driving systems. Communication is typically supported by Roadside Units (RSUs); however, in practical applications, vehicles may exceed the communication range of RSUs, thus exposing them to various malicious attacks. Additionally, considering the limited computational resources of onboard units (OBUs) in vehicles, there is a high demand for designing lightweight security protocols that support V2V communication. To address this issue, this paper proposes an efficient anonymous V2V identity authentication protocol tailored for scenarios that lack RSU support. The proposed protocol has been formally assessed using the Scyther tool, demonstrating its capability to withstand major typical malicious attacks. Performance evaluations indicate that the proposed protocol is efficient in terms of communication and computational overhead, making it a viable solution for V2V vehicle communication.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present ConDiff, a novel dataset for scientific machine learning. ConDiff focuses on the diffusion equation with varying coefficients, a fundamental problem in many applications of parametric partial differential equations (PDEs). The main novelty of the proposed dataset is that we consider discontinuous coefficients with high contrast. These coefficient functions are sampled from a selected set of distributions. This class of problems is not only of great academic interest, but is also the basis for describing various environmental and industrial problems. In this way, ConDiff shortens the gap with real-world problems while remaining fully synthetic and easy to use. ConDiff consists of a diverse set of diffusion equations with coefficients covering a wide range of contrast levels and heterogeneity with a measurable complexity metric for clearer comparison between different coefficient functions. We baseline ConDiff on standard deep learning models in the field of scientific machine learning. By providing a large number of problem instances, each with its own coefficient function and right-hand side, we hope to encourage the development of novel physics-based deep learning approaches, such as neural operators and physics-informed neural networks, ultimately driving progress towards more accurate and efficient solutions of complex PDE problems.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Automated code generation is a pivotal capability of large language models (LLMs). However, assessing this capability in real-world scenarios remains challenging. Previous methods focus more on low-level code generation, such as model loading, instead of generating high-level codes catering for real-world tasks, such as image-to-text, text classification, in various domains. Therefore, we construct AICoderEval, a dataset focused on real-world tasks in various domains based on HuggingFace, PyTorch, and TensorFlow, along with comprehensive metrics for evaluation and enhancing LLMs' task-specific code generation capability. AICoderEval contains test cases and complete programs for automated evaluation of these tasks, covering domains such as natural language processing, computer vision, and multimodal learning. To facilitate research in this area, we open-source the AICoderEval dataset at \url{this https URL}. After that, we propose CoderGen, an agent-based framework, to help LLMs generate codes related to real-world tasks on the constructed AICoderEval. Moreover, we train a more powerful task-specific code generation model, named AICoder, which is refined on llama-3 based on AICoderEval. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CoderGen in improving LLMs' task-specific code generation capability (by 12.00\% on pass@1 for original model and 9.50\% on pass@1 for ReAct Agent). AICoder also outperforms current code generation LLMs, indicating the great quality of the AICoderEval benchmark.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Crystalline materials are a fundamental component in next-generation technologies, yet modeling their distribution presents unique computational challenges. Of the plausible arrangements of atoms in a periodic lattice only a vanishingly small percentage are thermodynamically stable, which is a key indicator of the materials that can be experimentally realized. Two fundamental tasks in this area are to (a) predict the stable crystal structure of a known composition of elements and (b) propose novel compositions along with their stable structures. We present FlowMM, a pair of generative models that achieve state-of-the-art performance on both tasks while being more efficient and more flexible than competing methods. We generalize Riemannian Flow Matching to suit the symmetries inherent to crystals: translation, rotation, permutation, and periodic boundary conditions. Our framework enables the freedom to choose the flow base distributions, drastically simplifying the problem of learning crystal structures compared with diffusion models. In addition to standard benchmarks, we validate FlowMM's generated structures with quantum chemistry calculations, demonstrating that it is about 3x more efficient, in terms of integration steps, at finding stable materials compared to previous open methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recently, large multimodal models have built a bridge from visual to textual information, but they tend to underperform in remote sensing scenarios. This underperformance is due to the complex distribution of objects and the significant scale differences among targets in remote sensing images, leading to visual ambiguities and insufficient descriptions by these multimodal models. Moreover, the lack of multimodal fine-tuning data specific to the remote sensing field makes it challenging for the model's behavior to align with user queries. To address these issues, this paper proposes an attribute-guided \textbf{Multi-Granularity Instruction Multimodal Model (MGIMM)} for remote sensing image detailed description. MGIMM guides the multimodal model to learn the consistency between visual regions and corresponding text attributes (such as object names, colors, and shapes) through region-level instruction tuning. Then, with the multimodal model aligned on region-attribute, guided by multi-grain visual features, MGIMM fully perceives both region-level and global image information, utilizing large language models for comprehensive descriptions of remote sensing images. Due to the lack of a standard benchmark for generating detailed descriptions of remote sensing images, we construct a dataset featuring 38,320 region-attribute pairs and 23,463 image-detailed description pairs. Compared with various advanced methods on this dataset, the results demonstrate the effectiveness of MGIMM's region-attribute guided learning approach. Code can be available at this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Ransomware has become one of the most widespread threats, primarily due to its easy deployment and the accessibility to services that enable attackers to raise and obfuscate funds. This latter aspect has been significantly enhanced with the advent of cryptocurrencies, which, by fostering decentralisation and anonymity, have transformed this threat into a large-scale outbreak. However, recent reports indicate that a small group of individuals dominate the ransomware ecosystem and try to obfuscate their activity using multiple strains characterised by a short time to live. This scenario suggests that different strains could share mechanisms in ransom collection, fund movement, and money laundering operations. For this reason, this study aims to analyse the address-transaction graphs generated in the Bitcoin network by low-labelled ransomware families. Our goals are to identify payment spreading patterns for evaluating the evolution of ransomware families and to detect similarities among different strains that potentially can be controlled by the same attacker. Specifically, this latter task assigns an address behaviour to each node in the address-transaction graphs according to its dynamics. The distribution of the behaviours in each strain is finally used to evaluate the closeness among different ransomware families. Our findings show that although ransomware families can quickly establish connections with millions of addresses, numerous families require multiple-step analysis. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that the introduced behaviours can effectively be used to highlight similarities among different ransomware strains. The outcome shows that families are similar primarily due to behaviours usually associated with ransom collection and money laundering operations.+</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) policies are critically vulnerable to adversarial noise in observations, posing severe risks in safety-critical scenarios. For example, a self-driving car receiving manipulated sensory inputs about traffic signs could lead to catastrophic outcomes. Existing strategies to fortify RL algorithms against such adversarial perturbations generally fall into two categories: (a) using regularization methods that enhance robustness by incorporating adversarial loss terms into the value objectives, and (b) adopting "maximin" principles, which focus on maximizing the minimum value to ensure robustness. While regularization methods reduce the likelihood of successful attacks, their effectiveness drops significantly if an attack does succeed. On the other hand, maximin objectives, although robust, tend to be overly conservative. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel objective called Adversarial Counterfactual Error (ACoE), which naturally balances optimizing value and robustness against adversarial attacks. To optimize ACoE in a scalable manner in model-free settings, we propose a theoretically justified surrogate objective known as Cumulative-ACoE (C-ACoE). The core idea of optimizing C-ACoE is utilizing the belief about the underlying true state given the adversarially perturbed observation. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches for addressing adversarial RL problems across all established benchmarks (MuJoCo, Atari, and Highway) used in the literature.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the past few decades, polymers, high-molecular-weight compounds formed by bonding numerous identical or similar monomers covalently, have played an essential role in various scientific fields. In this context, accurate prediction of their properties is becoming increasingly crucial. Typically, the properties of a polymer, such as plasticity, conductivity, bio-compatibility, and so on, are highly correlated with its 3D structure. However, current methods for predicting polymer properties heavily rely on information from polymer SMILES sequences (P-SMILES strings) while ignoring crucial 3D structural information, leading to sub-optimal performance. In this work, we propose MMPolymer, a novel multimodal multitask pretraining framework incorporating both polymer 1D sequential information and 3D structural information to enhance downstream polymer property prediction tasks. Besides, to overcome the limited availability of polymer 3D data, we further propose the "Star Substitution" strategy to extract 3D structural information effectively. During pretraining, MMPolymer not only predicts masked tokens and recovers 3D coordinates but also achieves the cross-modal alignment of latent representation. Subsequently, we further fine-tune the pretrained MMPolymer for downstream polymer property prediction tasks in the supervised learning paradigm. Experimental results demonstrate that MMPolymer achieves state-of-the-art performance in various polymer property prediction tasks. Moreover, leveraging the pretrained MMPolymer and using only one modality (either P-SMILES string or 3D conformation) during fine-tuning can also surpass existing polymer property prediction methods, highlighting the exceptional capability of MMPolymer in polymer feature extraction and utilization.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Machine learning models offer the capability to forecast future energy production or consumption and infer essential unknown variables from existing data. However, legal and policy constraints within specific energy sectors render the data sensitive, presenting technical hurdles in utilizing data from diverse sources. Therefore, we propose adopting a Swarm Learning (SL) scheme, which replaces the centralized server with a blockchain-based distributed network to address the security and privacy issues inherent in Federated Learning (FL)'s centralized architecture. Within this distributed Collaborative Learning framework, each participating organization governs nodes for inter-organizational communication. Devices from various organizations utilize smart contracts for parameter uploading and retrieval. Consensus mechanism ensures distributed consistency throughout the learning process, guarantees the transparent trustworthiness and immutability of parameters on-chain. The efficacy of the proposed framework is substantiated across three real-world energy series modeling scenarios with superior performance compared to Local Learning approaches, simultaneously emphasizing enhanced data security and privacy over Centralized Learning and FL method. Notably, as the number of data volume and the count of local epochs increases within a threshold, there is an improvement in model performance accompanied by a reduction in the variance of performance errors. Consequently, this leads to an increased stability and reliability in the outcomes produced by the model.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has recently emerged as a promising solution to alleviate Large Language Model (LLM)'s deficiency in lack of knowledge. Existing RAG datasets, however, do not adequately represent the diverse and dynamic nature of real-world Question Answering (QA) tasks. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Comprehensive RAG Benchmark (CRAG), a factual question answering benchmark of 4,409 question-answer pairs and mock APIs to simulate web and Knowledge Graph (KG) search. CRAG is designed to encapsulate a diverse array of questions across five domains and eight question categories, reflecting varied entity popularity from popular to long-tail, and temporal dynamisms ranging from years to seconds. Our evaluation on this benchmark highlights the gap to fully trustworthy QA. Whereas most advanced LLMs achieve <=34% accuracy on CRAG, adding RAG in a straightforward manner improves the accuracy only to 44%. State-of-the-art industry RAG solutions only answer 63% questions without any hallucination. CRAG also reveals much lower accuracy in answering questions regarding facts with higher dynamism, lower popularity, or higher complexity, suggesting future research directions. The CRAG benchmark laid the groundwork for a KDD Cup 2024 challenge, attracting thousands of participants and submissions within the first 50 days of the competition. We commit to maintaining CRAG to serve research communities in advancing RAG solutions and general QA solutions.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text-to-image generation has recently emerged as a viable alternative to text-to-image retrieval, due to the visually impressive results of generative diffusion models. Although query performance prediction is an active research topic in information retrieval, to the best of our knowledge, there is no prior study that analyzes the difficulty of queries (prompts) in text-to-image generation, based on human judgments. To this end, we introduce the first dataset of prompts which are manually annotated in terms of image generation performance. In order to determine the difficulty of the same prompts in image retrieval, we also collect manual annotations that represent retrieval performance. We thus propose the first benchmark for joint text-to-image prompt and query performance prediction, comprising 10K queries. Our benchmark enables: (i) the comparative assessment of the difficulty of prompts/queries in image generation and image retrieval, and (ii) the evaluation of prompt/query performance predictors addressing both generation and retrieval. We present results with several pre-generation/retrieval and post-generation/retrieval performance predictors, thus providing competitive baselines for future research.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) are possessed of numerous beneficial capabilities, yet their potential inclination harbors unpredictable risks that may materialize in the future. We hence propose CRiskEval, a Chinese dataset meticulously designed for gauging the risk proclivities inherent in LLMs such as resource acquisition and malicious coordination, as part of efforts for proactive preparedness. To curate CRiskEval, we define a new risk taxonomy with 7 types of frontier risks and 4 safety levels, including extremely hazardous,moderately hazardous, neutral and safe. We follow the philosophy of tendency evaluation to empirically measure the stated desire of LLMs via fine-grained multiple-choice question answering. The dataset consists of 14,888 questions that simulate scenarios related to predefined 7 types of frontier risks. Each question is accompanied with 4 answer choices that state opinions or behavioral tendencies corresponding to the question. All answer choices are manually annotated with one of the defined risk levels so that we can easily build a fine-grained frontier risk profile for each assessed LLM. Extensive evaluation with CRiskEval on a spectrum of prevalent Chinese LLMs has unveiled a striking revelation: most models exhibit risk tendencies of more than 40% (weighted tendency to the four risk levels). Furthermore, a subtle increase in the model's inclination toward urgent self-sustainability, power seeking and other dangerous goals becomes evident as the size of models increase. To promote further research on the frontier risk evaluation of LLMs, we publicly release our dataset at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language model (LLM) users might rely on others (e.g., prompting services), to write prompts. However, the risks of trusting prompts written by others remain unstudied. In this paper, we assess the risk of using such prompts on brand recommendation tasks when shopping. First, we found that paraphrasing prompts can result in LLMs mentioning given brands with drastically different probabilities, including a pair of prompts where the probability changes by 100%. Next, we developed an approach that can be used to perturb an original base prompt to increase the likelihood that an LLM mentions a given brand. We designed a human-inconspicuous algorithm that perturbs prompts, which empirically forces LLMs to mention strings related to a brand more often, by absolute improvements up to 78.3%. Our results suggest that our perturbed prompts, 1) are inconspicuous to humans, 2) force LLMs to recommend a target brand more often, and 3) increase the perceived chances of picking targeted brands.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid spread of information through mobile devices and media has led to the widespread of false or deceptive news, causing significant concerns in society. Among different types of misinformation, image repurposing, also known as out-of-context misinformation, remains highly prevalent and effective. However, current approaches for detecting out-of-context misinformation often lack interpretability and offer limited explanations. In this study, we propose a logic regularization approach for out-of-context detection called LOGRAN (LOGic Regularization for out-of-context ANalysis). The primary objective of LOGRAN is to decompose the out-of-context detection at the phrase level. By employing latent variables for phrase-level predictions, the final prediction of the image-caption pair can be aggregated using logical rules. The latent variables also provide an explanation for how the final result is derived, making this fine-grained detection method inherently explanatory. We evaluate the performance of LOGRAN on the NewsCLIPpings dataset, showcasing competitive overall results. Visualized examples also reveal faithful phrase-level predictions of out-of-context images, accompanied by explanations. This highlights the effectiveness of our approach in addressing out-of-context detection and enhancing interpretability.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Humans convey emotions through daily dialogues, making emotion understanding a crucial step of affective intelligence. To understand emotions in dialogues, machines are asked to recognize the emotion for an utterance (Emotion Recognition in Dialogues, ERD); based on the emotion, then find causal utterances for the emotion (Emotion Cause Extraction in Dialogues, ECED). The setting of the two tasks requires first ERD and then ECED, ignoring the mutual complement between emotion and cause. To fix this, some new tasks are proposed to extract them simultaneously. Although the current research on these tasks has excellent achievements, simply identifying emotion-related factors by classification modeling lacks realizing the specific thinking process of causes stimulating the emotion in an explainable way. This thinking process especially reflected in the reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) is under-explored. To this end, we propose a new task "Emotion Deducing Explanation in Dialogues" (EDEN). EDEN recognizes emotion and causes in an explicitly thinking way. That is, models need to generate an explanation text, which first summarizes the causes; analyzes the inner activities of the speakers triggered by the causes using common sense; then guesses the emotion accordingly. To support the study of EDEN, based on the existing resources in ECED, we construct two EDEN datasets by human effort. We further evaluate different models on EDEN and find that LLMs are more competent than conventional PLMs. Besides, EDEN can help LLMs achieve better recognition of emotions and causes, which explores a new research direction of explainable emotion understanding in dialogues.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Most video compression methods focus on human visual perception, neglecting semantic preservation. This leads to severe semantic loss during the compression, hampering downstream video analysis tasks. In this paper, we propose a Masked Video Modeling (MVM)-powered compression framework that particularly preserves video semantics, by jointly mining and compressing the semantics in a self-supervised manner. While MVM is proficient at learning generalizable semantics through the masked patch prediction task, it may also encode non-semantic information like trivial textural details, wasting bitcost and bringing semantic noises. To suppress this, we explicitly regularize the non-semantic entropy of the compressed video in the MVM token space. The proposed framework is instantiated as a simple Semantic-Mining-then-Compression (SMC) model. Furthermore, we extend SMC as an advanced SMC++ model from several aspects. First, we equip it with a masked motion prediction objective, leading to better temporal semantic learning ability. Second, we introduce a Transformer-based compression module, to improve the semantic compression efficacy. Considering that directly mining the complex redundancy among heterogeneous features in different coding stages is non-trivial, we introduce a compact blueprint semantic representation to align these features into a similar form, fully unleashing the power of the Transformer-based compression module. Extensive results demonstrate the proposed SMC and SMC++ models show remarkable superiority over previous traditional, learnable, and perceptual quality-oriented video codecs, on three video analysis tasks and seven datasets. \textit{Codes and model are available at: \url{this https URL}.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce WildBench, an automated evaluation framework designed to benchmark large language models (LLMs) using challenging, real-world user queries. WildBench consists of 1,024 tasks carefully selected from over one million human-chatbot conversation logs. For automated evaluation with WildBench, we have developed two metrics, WB-Reward and WB-Score, which are computable using advanced LLMs such as GPT-4-turbo. WildBench evaluation uses task-specific checklists to evaluate model outputs systematically and provides structured explanations that justify the scores and comparisons, resulting in more reliable and interpretable automatic judgments. WB-Reward employs fine-grained pairwise comparisons between model responses, generating five potential outcomes: much better, slightly better, slightly worse, much worse, or a tie. Unlike previous evaluations that employed a single baseline model, we selected three baseline models at varying performance levels to ensure a comprehensive pairwise evaluation. Additionally, we propose a simple method to mitigate length bias, by converting outcomes of ``slightly better/worse'' to ``tie'' if the winner response exceeds the loser one by more than $K$ characters. WB-Score evaluates the quality of model outputs individually, making it a fast and cost-efficient evaluation metric. WildBench results demonstrate a strong correlation with the human-voted Elo ratings from Chatbot Arena on hard tasks. Specifically, WB-Reward achieves a Pearson correlation of 0.98 with top-ranking models. Additionally, WB-Score reaches 0.95, surpassing both ArenaHard's 0.91 and AlpacaEval2.0's 0.89 for length-controlled win rates, as well as the 0.87 for regular win rates.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>On-device continual learning (CL) requires the co-optimization of model accuracy and resource efficiency to be practical. This is extremely challenging because it must preserve accuracy while learning new tasks with continuously drifting data and maintain both high energy and memory efficiency to be deployable on real-world devices. Typically, a CL method leverages one of two types of backbone networks: CNN or ViT. It is commonly believed that CNN-based CL excels in resource efficiency, whereas ViT-based CL is superior in model performance, making each option attractive only for a single aspect. In this paper, we revisit this comparison while embracing powerful pre-trained ViT models of various sizes, including ViT-Ti (5.8M parameters). Our detailed analysis reveals that many practical options exist today for making ViT-based methods more suitable for on-device CL, even when accuracy, energy, and memory are all considered. To further expand this impact, we introduce REP, which improves resource efficiency specifically targeting prompt-based rehearsal-free methods. Our key focus is on avoiding catastrophic trade-offs with accuracy while trimming computational and memory costs throughout the training process. We achieve this by exploiting swift prompt selection that enhances input data using a carefully provisioned model, and by developing two novel algorithms-adaptive token merging (AToM) and adaptive layer dropping (ALD)-that optimize the prompt updating stage. In particular, AToM and ALD perform selective skipping across the data and model-layer dimensions without compromising task-specific features in vision transformer models. Extensive experiments on three image classification datasets validate REP's superior resource efficiency over current state-of-the-art methods.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>There are vast number of configurable parameters in a Radio Access Telecom Network. A significant amount of these parameters is configured by Radio Node or cell based on their deployment setting. Traditional methods rely on domain knowledge for individual parameter configuration, often leading to sub-optimal results. To improve this, a framework using a Deep Generative Graph Neural Network (GNN) is proposed. It encodes the network into a graph, extracts subgraphs for each RAN node, and employs a Siamese GNN (S-GNN) to learn embeddings. The framework recommends configuration parameters for a multitude of parameters and detects misconfigurations, handling both network expansion and existing cell reconfiguration. Tested on real-world data, the model surpasses baselines, demonstrating accuracy, generalizability, and robustness against concept drift.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Language agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are increasingly valuable as decision-making tools in domains such as gaming and programming. However, these agents often face challenges in achieving high-level goals without detailed instructions and in adapting to environments where feedback is delayed. In this paper, we present SelfGoal, a novel automatic approach designed to enhance agents' capabilities to achieve high-level goals with limited human prior and environmental feedback. The core concept of SelfGoal involves adaptively breaking down a high-level goal into a tree structure of more practical subgoals during the interaction with environments while identifying the most useful subgoals and progressively updating this structure. Experimental results demonstrate that SelfGoal significantly enhances the performance of language agents across various tasks, including competitive, cooperative, and deferred feedback environments.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have advanced the field of machine learning by utilizing graph-structured data, which is ubiquitous in the real world. GNNs have applications in various fields, ranging from social network analysis to drug discovery. GNN training is strenuous, requiring significant computational resources and human expertise. It makes a trained GNN an indispensable Intellectual Property (IP) for its owner. Recent studies have shown GNNs to be vulnerable to model-stealing attacks, which raises concerns over IP rights protection. Watermarking has been shown to be effective at protecting the IP of a GNN model. Existing efforts to develop a watermarking scheme for GNNs have only focused on the node classification and the graph classification tasks. To the best of our knowledge, we introduce the first-ever watermarking scheme for GNNs tailored to the Link Prediction (LP) task. We call our proposed watermarking scheme GENIE (watermarking Graph nEural Networks for lInk prEdiction). We design GENIE using a novel backdoor attack to create a trigger set for two key methods of LP: (1) node representation-based and (2) subgraph-based. In GENIE, the watermark is embedded into the GNN model by training it on both the trigger set and a modified training set, resulting in a watermarked GNN model. To assess a suspect model, we verify the watermark against the trigger set. We extensively evaluate GENIE across 3 model architectures (i.e., SEAL, GCN, and GraphSAGE) and 7 real-world datasets. Furthermore, we validate the robustness of GENIE against 11 state-of-the-art watermark removal techniques and 3 model extraction attacks. We also demonstrate that GENIE is robust against ownership piracy attack. Our ownership demonstration scheme statistically guarantees both False Positive Rate (FPR) and False Negative Rate (FNR) to be less than $10^{-6}$.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Model fragile watermarking, inspired by both the field of adversarial attacks on neural networks and traditional multimedia fragile watermarking, has gradually emerged as a potent tool for detecting tampering, and has witnessed rapid development in recent years. Unlike robust watermarks, which are widely used for identifying model copyrights, fragile watermarks for models are designed to identify whether models have been subjected to unexpected alterations such as backdoors, poisoning, compression, among others. These alterations can pose unknown risks to model users, such as misidentifying stop signs as speed limit signs in classic autonomous driving scenarios. This paper provides an overview of the relevant work in the field of model fragile watermarking since its inception, categorizing them and revealing the developmental trajectory of the field, thus offering a comprehensive survey for future endeavors in model fragile watermarking.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models have shown exceptional capabilities in generating realistic videos. Yet, their training has been predominantly confined to offline environments where models can repeatedly train on i.i.d. data to convergence. This work explores the feasibility of training diffusion models from a semantically continuous video stream, where correlated video frames sequentially arrive one at a time. To investigate this, we introduce two novel continual video generative modeling benchmarks, Lifelong Bouncing Balls and Windows 95 Maze Screensaver, each containing over a million video frames generated from navigating stationary environments. Surprisingly, our experiments show that diffusion models can be effectively trained online using experience replay, achieving performance comparable to models trained with i.i.d. samples given the same number of gradient steps.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Meta-Reinforcement Learning (Meta-RL) agents can struggle to operate across tasks with varying environmental features that require different optimal skills (i.e., different modes of behaviours). Using context encoders based on contrastive learning to enhance the generalisability of Meta-RL agents is now widely studied but faces challenges such as the requirement for a large sample size, also referred to as the $\log$-$K$ curse. To improve RL generalisation to different tasks, we first introduce Skill-aware Mutual Information (SaMI), an optimisation objective that aids in distinguishing context embeddings according to skills, thereby equipping RL agents with the ability to identify and execute different skills across tasks. We then propose Skill-aware Noise Contrastive Estimation (SaNCE), a $K$-sample estimator used to optimise the SaMI objective. We provide a framework for equipping an RL agent with SaNCE in practice and conduct experimental validation on modified MuJoCo and Panda-gym benchmarks. We empirically find that RL agents that learn by maximising SaMI achieve substantially improved zero-shot generalisation to unseen tasks. Additionally, the context encoder equipped with SaNCE demonstrates greater robustness to reductions in the number of available samples, thus possessing the potential to overcome the $\log$-$K$ curse.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Numerous techniques have been meticulously designed to achieve optimal architectures for convolutional neural networks (CNNs), yet a comparable focus on vision transformers (ViTs) has been somewhat lacking. Despite the remarkable success of ViTs in various vision tasks, their heavyweight nature presents challenges of computational costs. In this paper, we leverage the Gaussian process to systematically explore the nonlinear and uncertain relationship between performance and global architecture factors of MobileViT, such as resolution, width, and depth including the depth of in-verted residual blocks and the depth of ViT blocks, and joint factors including resolution-depth and resolution-width. We present design principles twisting magic 4D cube of the global architecture factors that minimize model sizes and computational costs with higher model accuracy. We introduce a formula for downsizing architectures by iteratively deriving smaller MobileViT V2, all while adhering to a specified constraint of multiply-accumulate operations (MACs). Experiment results show that our formula significantly outperforms CNNs and mobile ViTs across diversified datasets</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) effectively necessitates a multi-scale approach, particularly critical in high-dimensional scenarios characterized by increasing grid points or resolution. Traditional methods often fail to capture the detailed features necessary for accurate modeling, presenting a significant challenge in scientific computing. In response, we introduce the Multiwavelet-based Algebraic Multigrid Neural Operator (M2NO), a novel deep learning framework that synergistically combines multiwavelet transformations and algebraic multigrid (AMG) techniques. By exploiting the inherent similarities between these two approaches, M2NO overcomes their individual limitations and enhances precision and flexibility across various PDE benchmarks. Employing Multiresolution Analysis (MRA) with high-pass and low-pass filters, the model executes hierarchical decomposition to accurately delineate both global trends and localized details within PDE solutions, supporting adaptive data representation at multiple scales. M2NO also automates node selection and adeptly manages complex boundary conditions through its multiwavelet-based operators. Extensive evaluations on a diverse array of PDE datasets with different boundary conditions confirm M2NO's superior performance. Furthermore, M2NO excels in handling high-resolution and super-resolution tasks, consistently outperforming competing models and demonstrating robust adaptability in complex computational scenarios.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper explores the in-context learning capabilities of masked language models, challenging the common view that this ability does not 'emerge' in them. We present an embarrassingly simple inference technique that enables DeBERTa to operate as a generative model without any additional training. Our findings demonstrate that DeBERTa can match and even surpass GPT-3, its contemporary that famously introduced the paradigm of in-context learning. The comparative analysis reveals that the masked and causal language models behave very differently, as they clearly outperform each other on different categories of tasks. This suggests that there is great potential for a hybrid training approach that takes advantage of the strengths of both training objectives.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The sample efficiency of Bayesian optimization algorithms depends on carefully crafted acquisition functions (AFs) guiding the sequential collection of function evaluations. The best-performing AF can vary significantly across optimization problems, often requiring ad-hoc and problem-specific choices. This work tackles the challenge of designing novel AFs that perform well across a variety of experimental settings. Based on FunSearch, a recent work using Large Language Models (LLMs) for discovery in mathematical sciences, we propose FunBO, an LLM-based method that can be used to learn new AFs written in computer code by leveraging access to a limited number of evaluations for a set of objective functions. We provide the analytic expression of all discovered AFs and evaluate them on various global optimization benchmarks and hyperparameter optimization tasks. We show how FunBO identifies AFs that generalize well in and out of the training distribution of functions, thus outperforming established general-purpose AFs and achieving competitive performance against AFs that are customized to specific function types and are learned via transfer-learning algorithms.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present a practical method to audit the differential privacy (DP) guarantees of a machine learning model using a small hold-out dataset that is not exposed to the model during the training. Having a score function such as the loss function employed during the training, our method estimates the total variation (TV) distance between scores obtained with a subset of the training data and the hold-out dataset. With some meta information about the underlying DP training algorithm, these TV distance values can be converted to $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-guarantees for any $\delta$. We show that these score distributions asymptotically give lower bounds for the DP guarantees of the underlying training algorithm, however, we perform a one-shot estimation for practicality reasons. We specify conditions that lead to lower bounds for the DP guarantees with high probability. To estimate the TV distance between the score distributions, we use a simple density estimation method based on histograms. We show that the TV distance gives a very close to optimally robust estimator and has an error rate $\mathcal{O}(k^{-1/3})$, where $k$ is the total number of samples. Numerical experiments on benchmark datasets illustrate the effectiveness of our approach and show improvements over baseline methods for black-box auditing.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Incremental object detection aims to simultaneously maintain old-class accuracy and detect emerging new-class objects in incremental data. Most existing distillation-based methods underperform when unlabeled old-class objects are absent in the incremental dataset. While the absence can be mitigated by generating old-class samples, it also incurs high computational costs. In this paper, we argue that the extra computational cost stems from the inconsistency between the detector and the generative model, along with redundant generation. To overcome this problem, we propose Efficient Generated Object Replay (EGOR). Specifically, we generate old-class samples by inversing the original detectors, thus eliminating the necessity of training and storing additional generative models. We also propose augmented replay to reuse the objects in generated samples, thereby reducing the redundant generation. In addition, we propose high-response knowledge distillation focusing on the knowledge related to the old class, which transfers the knowledge in generated objects to the incremental detector. With the addition of the generated objects and losses, we observe a bias towards old classes in the detector. We balance the losses for old and new classes to alleviate the bias, thereby increasing the overall detection accuracy. Extensive experiments conducted on MS COCO 2017 demonstrate that our method can efficiently improve detection performance in the absence of old-class objects.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Despite the remarkable generative capabilities of language models in producing naturalistic language, their effectiveness on explicit manipulation and generation of linguistic structures remain understudied. In this paper, we investigate the task of generating new sentences preserving a given semantic structure, following the FrameNet formalism. We propose a framework to produce novel frame-semantically annotated sentences following an overgenerate-and-filter approach. Our results show that conditioning on rich, explicit semantic information tends to produce generations with high human acceptance, under both prompting and finetuning. Our generated frame-semantic structured annotations are effective at training data augmentation for frame-semantic role labeling in low-resource settings; however, we do not see benefits under higher resource settings. Our study concludes that while generating high-quality, semantically rich data might be within reach, the downstream utility of such generations remains to be seen, highlighting the outstanding challenges with automating linguistic annotation tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Catastrophic Forgetting (CF) means models forgetting previously acquired knowledge when learning new data. It compromises the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) during fine-tuning, yet the underlying causes have not been thoroughly investigated. This paper takes the first step to reveal the direct link between the flatness of the model loss landscape and the extent of CF in the field of LLMs. Based on this, we introduce the sharpness-aware minimization to mitigate CF by flattening the loss landscape. Experiments on three widely-used fine-tuning datasets, spanning different model scales, demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in alleviating CF. Analyses show that we nicely complement the existing anti-forgetting strategies, further enhancing the resistance of LLMs to CF.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Referring video object segmentation (RVOS) relies on natural language expressions to segment target objects in video, emphasizing modeling dense text-video relations. The current RVOS methods typically use independently pre-trained vision and language models as backbones, resulting in a significant domain gap between video and text. In cross-modal feature interaction, text features are only used as query initialization and do not fully utilize important information in the text. In this work, we propose using frozen pre-trained vision-language models (VLM) as backbones, with a specific emphasis on enhancing cross-modal feature interaction. Firstly, we use frozen convolutional CLIP backbone to generate feature-aligned vision and text features, alleviating the issue of domain gap and reducing training costs. Secondly, we add more cross-modal feature fusion in the pipeline to enhance the utilization of multi-modal information. Furthermore, we propose a novel video query initialization method to generate higher quality video queries. Without bells and whistles, our method achieved 51.5 J&F on the MeViS test set and ranked 3rd place for MeViS Track in CVPR 2024 PVUW workshop: Motion Expression guided Video Segmentation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Most existing multi-object tracking methods typically learn visual tracking features via maximizing dis-similarities of different instances and minimizing similarities of the same instance. While such a feature learning scheme achieves promising performance, learning discriminative features solely based on visual information is challenging especially in case of environmental interference such as occlusion, blur and domain variance. In this work, we argue that multi-modal language-driven features provide complementary information to classical visual features, thereby aiding in improving the robustness to such environmental interference. To this end, we propose a new multi-object tracking framework, named LG-MOT, that explicitly leverages language information at different levels of granularity (scene-and instance-level) and combines it with standard visual features to obtain discriminative representations. To develop LG-MOT, we annotate existing MOT datasets with scene-and instance-level language descriptions. We then encode both instance-and scene-level language information into high-dimensional embeddings, which are utilized to guide the visual features during training. At inference, our LG-MOT uses the standard visual features without relying on annotated language descriptions. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks, MOT17, DanceTrack and SportsMOT, reveal the merits of the proposed contributions leading to state-of-the-art performance. On the DanceTrack test set, our LG-MOT achieves an absolute gain of 2.2\% in terms of target object association (IDF1 score), compared to the baseline using only visual features. Further, our LG-MOT exhibits strong cross-domain generalizability. The dataset and code will be available at ~\url{this https URL}.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, federate, fair, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated learning has enabled multiple parties to collaboratively train large language models without directly sharing their data (FedLLM). Following this training paradigm, the community has put massive efforts from diverse aspects including framework, performance, and privacy. However, an unpleasant fact is that there are currently no realistic datasets and benchmarks for FedLLM and previous works all rely on artificially constructed datasets, failing to capture properties in real-world scenarios. Addressing this, we propose FedLLM-Bench, which involves 8 training methods, 4 training datasets, and 6 evaluation metrics, to offer a comprehensive testbed for the FedLLM community. FedLLM-Bench encompasses three datasets (e.g., user-annotated multilingual dataset) for federated instruction tuning and one dataset (e.g., user-annotated preference dataset) for federated preference alignment, whose scale of client number ranges from 38 to 747. Our datasets incorporate several representative diversities: language, quality, quantity, instruction, length, embedding, and preference, capturing properties in real-world scenarios. Based on FedLLM-Bench, we conduct experiments on all datasets to benchmark existing FL methods and provide empirical insights (e.g., multilingual collaboration). We believe that our FedLLM-Bench can benefit the FedLLM community by reducing required efforts, providing a practical testbed, and promoting fair comparisons.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Training certifiably robust neural networks is an important but challenging task. While many algorithms for (deterministic) certified training have been proposed, they are often evaluated on different training schedules, certification methods, and systematically under-tuned hyperparameters, making it difficult to compare their performance. To address this challenge, we introduce CTBENCH, a unified library and a high-quality benchmark for certified training that evaluates all algorithms under fair settings and systematically tuned hyperparameters. We show that (1) almost all algorithms in CTBENCH surpass the corresponding reported performance in literature in the magnitude of algorithmic improvements, thus establishing new state-of-the-art, and (2) the claimed advantage of recent algorithms drops significantly when we enhance the outdated baselines with a fair training schedule, a fair certification method and well-tuned hyperparameters. Based on CTBENCH, we provide new insights into the current state of certified training and suggest future research directions. We are confident that CTBENCH will serve as a benchmark and testbed for future research in certified training.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) evolve, aligning pretrained foundation models presents increasing challenges. Existing alignment strategies, which typically leverage diverse and high-quality data sources, often overlook the intrinsic uncertainty of tasks, learning all data samples equally. This may lead to suboptimal data efficiency and model performance. In response, we propose uncertainty-aware learning (UAL) to improve the model alignment of different task scenarios, by introducing the sample uncertainty (elicited from more capable LLMs). We implement UAL in a simple fashion -- adaptively setting the label smoothing value of training according to the uncertainty of individual samples. Analysis shows that our UAL indeed facilitates better token clustering in the feature space, validating our hypothesis. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our UAL significantly and consistently outperforms standard supervised fine-tuning. Notably, LLMs aligned in a mixed scenario have achieved an average improvement of 10.62\% on high-entropy tasks (i.e., AlpacaEval leaderboard), and 1.81\% on complex low-entropy tasks (i.e., MetaMath and GSM8K).</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce ComplexTempQA,a large-scale dataset consisting of over 100 million question-answer pairs designed to tackle the challenges in temporal question answering. ComplexTempQA significantly surpasses existing benchmarks like HOTPOTQA, TORQUE, and TEQUILA in scale and scope. Utilizing data from Wikipedia and Wikidata, the dataset covers questions spanning over two decades and offers an unmatched breadth of topics. We introduce a unique taxonomy that categorizes questions as attributes, comparisons, and counting questions, each revolving around events, entities, and time periods. One standout feature of ComplexTempQA is the high complexity of its questions, which demand effective capabilities for answering such as across-time comparison, temporal aggregation, and multi-hop reasoning involving temporal event ordering and entity recognition. Additionally, each question is accompanied by detailed metadata, including specific time scopes, allowing for comprehensive evaluation and enhancement of the temporal reasoning abilities of large language models. ComplexTempQA serves both as a testing ground for developing sophisticated AI models and as a foundation for advancing research in question answering, information retrieval, and language understanding.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep learning-based time series forecasting has dominated the short-term precipitation forecasting field with the help of its ability to estimate motion flow in high-resolution datasets. The growing interest in precipitation nowcasting offers substantial opportunities for the advancement of current forecasting technologies. Nevertheless, there has been a scarcity of in-depth surveys of time series precipitation forecasting using deep learning. Thus, this paper systemically reviews recent progress in time series precipitation forecasting models. Specifically, we investigate the following key points within background components, covering: i) preprocessing, ii) objective functions, and iii) evaluation metrics. We then categorize forecasting models into \textit{recursive} and \textit{multiple} strategies based on their approaches to predict future frames, investigate the impacts of models using the strategies, and performance assessments. Finally, we evaluate current deep learning-based models for precipitation forecasting on a public benchmark, discuss their limitations and challenges, and present some promising research directions. Our contribution lies in providing insights for a better understanding of time series precipitation forecasting and in aiding the development of robust AI solutions for the future.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We revisit the input perturbations framework for differential privacy where noise is added to the input $A\in \mathcal{S}$ and the result is then projected back to the space of admissible datasets $\mathcal{S}$. Through this framework, we first design novel efficient algorithms to privately release pair-wise cosine similarities. Second, we derive a novel algorithm to compute $k$-way marginal queries over $n$ features. Prior work could achieve comparable guarantees only for $k$ even. Furthermore, we extend our results to $t$-sparse datasets, where our efficient algorithms yields novel, stronger guarantees whenever $t\le n^{5/6}/\log n\,.$ Finally, we provide a theoretical perspective on why \textit{fast} input perturbation algorithms works well in practice. The key technical ingredients behind our results are tight sum-of-squares certificates upper bounding the Gaussian complexity of sets of solutions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models are first pre-trained on trillions of tokens and then instruction-tuned or aligned to specific preferences. While pre-training remains out of reach for most researchers due to the compute required, fine-tuning has become affordable thanks to parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA and QLoRA. Alignment is known to be sensitive to the many factors involved, including the quantity and quality of data, the alignment method, and the adapter rank. However, there has not yet been an extensive study of their effect on downstream performance. To address this gap, we conduct an in-depth investigation of the impact of popular choices for three crucial axes: (i) the alignment dataset (HH-RLHF and BeaverTails), (ii) the alignment technique (SFT and DPO), and (iii) the model (LLaMA-1, Vicuna-v1.3, Mistral-7b, and Mistral-7b-Instruct). Our extensive setup spanning over 300 experiments reveals consistent trends and unexpected findings. We observe how more informative data helps with preference alignment, cases where supervised fine-tuning outperforms preference optimization, and how aligning to a distinct preference boosts performance on downstream tasks. Through our in-depth analyses, we put forward key guidelines to help researchers perform more effective parameter-efficient LLM alignment.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The burgeoning field of text-based video generation (T2V) has reignited significant interest in the research of controllable video editing. Although pre-trained T2V-based editing models have achieved efficient editing capabilities, current works are still plagued by two major challenges. Firstly, the inherent limitations of T2V models lead to content inconsistencies and motion discontinuities between frames. Secondly, the notorious issue of over-editing significantly disrupts areas that are intended to remain unaltered. To address these challenges, our work aims to explore a robust video-based editing paradigm based on score distillation. Specifically, we propose an Adaptive Sliding Score Distillation strategy, which not only enhances the stability of T2V supervision but also incorporates both global and local video guidance to mitigate the impact of generation errors. Additionally, we modify the self-attention layers during the editing process to further preserve the key features of the original video. Extensive experiments demonstrate that these strategies enable us to effectively address the aforementioned challenges, achieving superior editing performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Forecasting indoor temperatures is important to achieve efficient control of HVAC systems. In this task, the limited data availability presents a challenge as most of the available data is acquired during standard operation where extreme scenarios and transitory regimes such as major temperature increases or decreases are de-facto excluded. Acquisition of such data requires significant energy consumption and a dedicated facility, hindering the quantity and diversity of available data. Cost related constraints however do not allow for continuous year-around acquisition. To address this, we investigate the efficacy of data augmentation techniques leveraging SoTA AI-based methods for synthetic data generation. Inspired by practical and experimental motivations, we explore fusion strategies of real and synthetic data to improve forecasting models. This approach alleviates the need for continuously acquiring extensive time series data, especially in contexts involving repetitive heating and cooling cycles in buildings. In our evaluation 1) we assess the performance of synthetic data generators independently, particularly focusing on SoTA AI-based methods; 2) we measure the utility of incorporating synthetically augmented data in a subsequent forecasting tasks where we employ a simple model in two distinct scenarios: 1) we first examine an augmentation technique that combines real and synthetically generated data to expand the training dataset, 2) we delve into utilizing synthetic data to tackle dataset imbalances. Our results highlight the potential of synthetic data augmentation in enhancing forecasting accuracy while mitigating training variance. Through empirical experiments, we show significant improvements achievable by integrating synthetic data, thereby paving the way for more robust forecasting models in low-data regime.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Dynamic link prediction is an important problem considered by many recent works proposing various approaches for learning temporal edge patterns. To assess their efficacy, models are evaluated on publicly available benchmark datasets involving continuous-time and discrete-time temporal graphs. However, as we show in this work, the suitability of common batch-oriented evaluation depends on the datasets' characteristics, which can cause two issues: First, for continuous-time temporal graphs, fixed-size batches create time windows with different durations, resulting in an inconsistent dynamic link prediction task. Second, for discrete-time temporal graphs, the sequence of batches can additionally introduce temporal dependencies that are not present in the data. In this work, we empirically show that this common evaluation approach leads to skewed model performance and hinders the fair comparison of methods. We mitigate this problem by reformulating dynamic link prediction as a link forecasting task that better accounts for temporal information present in the data. We provide implementations of our new evaluation method for commonly used graph learning frameworks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep neural networks (DNNs) are one of the most widely used machine learning algorithm. DNNs requires the training data to be available beforehand with true labels. This is not feasible for many real-world problems where data arrives in the streaming form and acquisition of true labels are scarce and expensive. In the literature, not much focus has been given to the privacy prospect of the streaming data, where data may change its distribution frequently. These concept drifts must be detected privately in order to avoid any disclosure risk from DNNs. Existing privacy models use concept drift detection schemes such ADWIN, KSWIN to detect the drifts. In this paper, we focus on the notion of integrally private DNNs to detect concept drifts. Integrally private DNNs are the models which recur frequently from different datasets. Based on this, we introduce an ensemble methodology which we call 'Integrally Private Drift Detection' (IPDD) method to detect concept drift from private models. Our IPDD method does not require labels to detect drift but assumes true labels are available once the drift has been detected. We have experimented with binary and multi-class synthetic and real-world data. Our experimental results show that our methodology can privately detect concept drift, has comparable utility (even better in some cases) with ADWIN and outperforms utility from different levels of differentially private models.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The recent advancements in generative AI models, which can create realistic and human-like content, are significantly transforming how people communicate, create, and work. While the appropriate use of generative AI models can benefit the society, their misuse poses significant threats to data reliability and authentication. However, due to a lack of aligned multimodal datasets, effective and robust methods for detecting machine-generated content are still in the early stages of development. In this paper, we introduce RU-AI, a new large-scale multimodal dataset designed for the robust and efficient detection of machine-generated content in text, image, and voice. Our dataset is constructed from three large publicly available datasets: Flickr8K, COCO, and Places205, by combining the original datasets and their corresponding machine-generated pairs. Additionally, experimental results show that our proposed unified model, which incorporates a multimodal embedding module with a multilayer perceptron network, can effectively determine the origin of the data (i.e., original data samples or machine-generated ones) from RU-AI. However, future work is still required to address the remaining challenges posed by RU-AI. The source code and dataset are available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Unbalanced optimal transport (UOT) has recently gained much attention due to its flexible framework for handling un-normalized measures and its robustness properties. In this work, we explore learning (structured) sparse transport plans in the UOT setting, i.e., transport plans have an upper bound on the number of non-sparse entries in each column (structured sparse pattern) or in the whole plan (general sparse pattern). We propose novel sparsity-constrained UOT formulations building on the recently explored maximum mean discrepancy based UOT. We show that the proposed optimization problem is equivalent to the maximization of a weakly submodular function over a uniform matroid or a partition matroid. We develop efficient gradient-based discrete greedy algorithms and provide the corresponding theoretical guarantees. Empirically, we observe that our proposed greedy algorithms select a diverse support set and we illustrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in various applications.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Graph structures offer a versatile framework for representing diverse patterns in nature and complex systems, applicable across domains like molecular chemistry, social networks, and transportation systems. While diffusion models have excelled in generating various objects, generating graphs remains challenging. This thesis explores the potential of score-based generative models in generating such objects through a modelization as combinatorial complexes, which are powerful topological structures that encompass higher-order relationships. In this thesis, we propose a unified framework by employing stochastic differential equations. We not only generalize the generation of complex objects such as graphs and hypergraphs, but we also unify existing generative modelling approaches such as Score Matching with Langevin dynamics and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models. This innovation overcomes limitations in existing frameworks that focus solely on graph generation, opening up new possibilities in generative AI. The experiment results showed that our framework could generate these complex objects, and could also compete against state-of-the-art approaches for mere graph and molecule generation tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown exceptional performance in text processing. Notably, LLMs can synthesize information from large datasets and explain their decisions similarly to human reasoning through a chain of thought (CoT). An emerging application of LLMs is the handling and interpreting of numerical data, where fine-tuning enhances their performance over basic inference methods. This paper proposes a novel approach to training LLMs using knowledge transfer from a random forest (RF) ensemble, leveraging its efficiency and accuracy. By converting RF decision paths into natural language statements, we generate outputs for LLM fine-tuning, enhancing the model's ability to classify and explain its decisions. Our method includes verifying these rules through established classification metrics, ensuring their correctness. We also examine the impact of preprocessing techniques on the representation of numerical data and their influence on classification accuracy and rule correctness</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in pre-trained vision transformers have shown promise in parameter-efficient audio-visual learning without audio pre-training. However, few studies have investigated effective methods for aligning multimodal features in parameter-efficient audio-visual transformers. In this paper, we propose MA-AVT, a new parameter-efficient audio-visual transformer employing deep modality alignment for corresponding multimodal semantic features. Specifically, we introduce joint unimodal and multimodal token learning for aligning the two modalities with a frozen modality-shared transformer. This allows the model to learn separate representations for each modality, while also attending to the cross-modal relationships between them. In addition, unlike prior work that only aligns coarse features from the output of unimodal encoders, we introduce blockwise contrastive learning to align coarse-to-fine-grain hierarchical features throughout the encoding phase. Furthermore, to suppress the background features in each modality from foreground matched audio-visual features, we introduce a robust discriminative foreground mining scheme. Through extensive experiments on benchmark AVE, VGGSound, and CREMA-D datasets, we achieve considerable performance improvements over SOTA methods.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Saliency methods have become standard in the explanation toolkit of deep neural networks. Recent developments specific to image classifiers have investigated region-based explanations with either new methods or by adapting well-established ones using ad-hoc superpixel algorithms. In this paper, we aim to avoid relying on these segmenters by extracting a segmentation from the activations of a deep neural network image classifier without fine-tuning the network. Our so-called Neuro-Activated Superpixels (NAS) can isolate the regions of interest in the input relevant to the model's prediction, which boosts high-threshold weakly supervised object localization performance. This property enables the semi-supervised semantic evaluation of saliency methods. The aggregation of NAS with existing saliency methods eases their interpretation and reveals the inconsistencies of the widely used area under the relevance curve metric.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In dynamical systems reconstruction (DSR) we seek to infer from time series measurements a generative model of the underlying dynamical process. This is a prime objective in any scientific discipline, where we are particularly interested in parsimonious models with a low parameter load. A common strategy here is parameter pruning, removing all parameters with small weights. However, here we find this strategy does not work for DSR, where even low magnitude parameters can contribute considerably to the system dynamics. On the other hand, it is well known that many natural systems which generate complex dynamics, like the brain or ecological networks, have a sparse topology with comparatively few links. Inspired by this, we show that geometric pruning, where in contrast to magnitude-based pruning weights with a low contribution to an attractor's geometrical structure are removed, indeed manages to reduce parameter load substantially without significantly hampering DSR quality. We further find that the networks resulting from geometric pruning have a specific type of topology, and that this topology, and not the magnitude of weights, is what is most crucial to performance. We provide an algorithm that automatically generates such topologies which can be used as priors for generative modeling of dynamical systems by RNNs, and compare it to other well studied topologies like small-world or scale-free networks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Terrestrial carbon fluxes provide vital information about our biosphere's health and its capacity to absorb anthropogenic CO$_2$ emissions. The importance of predicting carbon fluxes has led to the emerging field of data-driven carbon flux modelling (DDCFM), which uses statistical techniques to predict carbon fluxes from biophysical data. However, the field lacks a standardized dataset to promote comparisons between models. To address this gap, we present CarbonSense, the first machine learning-ready dataset for DDCFM. CarbonSense integrates measured carbon fluxes, meteorological predictors, and satellite imagery from 385 locations across the globe, offering comprehensive coverage and facilitating robust model training. Additionally, we provide a baseline model using a current state-of-the-art DDCFM approach and a novel transformer based model. Our experiments illustrate the potential gains that multimodal deep learning techniques can bring to this domain. By providing these resources, we aim to lower the barrier to entry for other deep learning researchers to develop new models and drive new advances in carbon flux modelling.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The recently unprecedented advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have propelled the medical community by establishing advanced medical-domain models. However, due to the limited collection of medical datasets, there are only a few comprehensive benchmarks available to gauge progress in this area. In this paper, we introduce a new medical question-answering (QA) dataset that contains massive manual instruction for solving Traditional Chinese Medicine examination tasks, called TCMD. Specifically, our TCMD collects massive questions across diverse domains with their annotated medical subjects and thus supports us in comprehensively assessing the capability of LLMs in the TCM domain. Extensive evaluation of various general LLMs and medical-domain-specific LLMs is conducted. Moreover, we also analyze the robustness of current LLMs in solving TCM QA tasks by introducing randomness. The inconsistency of the experimental results also reveals the shortcomings of current LLMs in solving QA tasks. We also expect that our dataset can further facilitate the development of LLMs in the TCM area.</li>

The task aims to evaluate the ability of language models to think creatively. The dataset comprises multi-choice questions that challenge models to think "outside of the box". We fine-tune 2 models, BERT and RoBERTa Large. Next, we employ a Chain of Thought (CoT) zero-shot prompting approach with 6 large language models, such as GPT-3.5, Mixtral, and Llama2. Finally, we utilize ReConcile, a technique that employs a "round table conference" approach with multiple agents for zero-shot learning, to generate consensus answers among 3 selected language models. Our best method achieves an overall accuracy of 85 percent on the sentence puzzles subtask.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As low-quality housing and in particular certain roof characteristics are associated with an increased risk of malaria, classification of roof types based on remote sensing imagery can support the assessment of malaria risk and thereby help prevent the disease. To support research in this area, we release the Nacala-Roof-Material dataset, which contains high-resolution drone images from Mozambique with corresponding labels delineating houses and specifying their roof types. The dataset defines a multi-task computer vision problem, comprising object detection, classification, and segmentation. In addition, we benchmarked various state-of-the-art approaches on the dataset. Canonical U-Nets, YOLOv8, and a custom decoder on pretrained DINOv2 served as baselines. We show that each of the methods has its advantages but none is superior on all tasks, which highlights the potential of our dataset for future research in multi-task learning. While the tasks are closely related, accurate segmentation of objects does not necessarily imply accurate instance separation, and vice versa. We address this general issue by introducing a variant of the deep ordinal watershed (DOW) approach that additionally separates the interior of objects, allowing for improved object delineation and separation. We show that our DOW variant is a generic approach that improves the performance of both U-Net and DINOv2 backbones, leading to a better trade-off between semantic segmentation and instance segmentation.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) exhibit emerging geospatial capabilities, stemming from their pre-training on vast unlabelled text datasets that are often derived from the Common Crawl corpus. However, the geospatial content within CC remains largely unexplored, impacting our understanding of LLMs' spatial reasoning. This paper investigates the prevalence of geospatial data in recent Common Crawl releases using Gemini, a powerful language model. By analyzing a sample of documents and manually revising the results, we estimate that between 1 in 5 and 1 in 6 documents contain geospatial information such as coordinates and street addresses. Our findings provide quantitative insights into the nature and extent of geospatial data within Common Crawl, and web crawl data in general. Furthermore, we formulate questions to guide future investigations into the geospatial content of available web crawl datasets and its influence on LLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have been successfully applied in various aerial scenes, yet they face challenges with sparse views due to limited supervision. The acquisition of dense aerial views is often prohibitive, as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) may encounter constraints in perspective range and energy constraints. In this work, we introduce Multiplane Prior guided NeRF (MPNeRF), a novel approach tailored for few-shot aerial scene rendering-marking a pioneering effort in this domain. Our key insight is that the intrinsic geometric regularities specific to aerial imagery could be leveraged to enhance NeRF in sparse aerial scenes. By investigating NeRF's and Multiplane Image (MPI)'s behavior, we propose to guide the training process of NeRF with a Multiplane Prior. The proposed Multiplane Prior draws upon MPI's benefits and incorporates advanced image comprehension through a SwinV2 Transformer, pre-trained via SimMIM. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that MPNeRF outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods applied in non-aerial contexts, by tripling the performance in SSIM and LPIPS even with three views available. We hope our work offers insights into the development of NeRF-based applications in aerial scenes with limited data.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, diffusion, transformer, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Real-world data generation often involves certain geometries (e.g., graphs) that induce instance-level interdependence. This characteristic makes the generalization of learning models more difficult due to the intricate interdependent patterns that impact data-generative distributions and can vary from training to testing. In this work, we propose a geometric diffusion model with learnable divergence fields for the challenging generalization problem with interdependent data. We generalize the diffusion equation with stochastic diffusivity at each time step, which aims to capture the multi-faceted information flows among interdependent data. Furthermore, we derive a new learning objective through causal inference, which can guide the model to learn generalizable patterns of interdependence that are insensitive across domains. Regarding practical implementation, we introduce three model instantiations that can be considered as the generalized versions of GCN, GAT, and Transformers, respectively, which possess advanced robustness against distribution shifts. We demonstrate their promising efficacy for out-of-distribution generalization on diverse real-world datasets.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Transformer-based models have emerged as powerful tools for multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF). However, existing Transformer models often fall short of capturing both intricate dependencies across variate and temporal dimensions in MTS data. Some recent models are proposed to separately capture variate and temporal dependencies through either two sequential or parallel attention mechanisms. However, these methods cannot directly and explicitly learn the intricate inter-series and intra-series dependencies. In this work, we first demonstrate that these dependencies are very important as they usually exist in real-world data. To directly model these dependencies, we propose a transformer-based model UniTST containing a unified attention mechanism on the flattened patch tokens. Additionally, we add a dispatcher module which reduces the complexity and makes the model feasible for a potentially large number of variates. Although our proposed model employs a simple architecture, it offers compelling performance as shown in our extensive experiments on several datasets for time series forecasting.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Pixel-level Video Understanding requires effectively integrating three-dimensional data in both spatial and temporal dimensions to learn accurate and stable semantic information from continuous frames. However, existing advanced models on the VSPW dataset have not fully modeled spatiotemporal relationships. In this paper, we present our solution for the PVUW competition, where we introduce masked video consistency (MVC) based on existing models. MVC enforces the consistency between predictions of masked frames where random patches are withheld. The model needs to learn the segmentation results of the masked parts through the context of images and the relationship between preceding and succeeding frames of the video. Additionally, we employed test-time augmentation, model aggeregation and a multimodal model-based post-processing method. Our approach achieves 67.27% mIoU performance on the VSPW dataset, ranking 2nd place in the PVUW2024 challenge VSS track.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We study the implicit bias of optimization in robust empirical risk minimization (robust ERM) and its connection with robust generalization. In classification settings under adversarial perturbations with linear models, we study what type of regularization should ideally be applied for a given perturbation set to improve (robust) generalization. We then show that the implicit bias of optimization in robust ERM can significantly affect the robustness of the model and identify two ways this can happen; either through the optimization algorithm or the architecture. We verify our predictions in simulations with synthetic data and experimentally study the importance of implicit bias in robust ERM with deep neural networks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>City scene generation has gained significant attention in autonomous driving, smart city development, and traffic simulation. It helps enhance infrastructure planning and monitoring solutions. Existing methods have employed a two-stage process involving city layout generation, typically using Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), or Transformers, followed by neural rendering. These techniques often exhibit limited diversity and noticeable artifacts in the rendered city scenes. The rendered scenes lack variety, resembling the training images, resulting in monotonous styles. Additionally, these methods lack planning capabilities, leading to less realistic generated scenes. In this paper, we introduce CityCraft, an innovative framework designed to enhance both the diversity and quality of urban scene generation. Our approach integrates three key stages: initially, a diffusion transformer (DiT) model is deployed to generate diverse and controllable 2D city layouts. Subsequently, a Large Language Model(LLM) is utilized to strategically make land-use plans within these layouts based on user prompts and language guidelines. Based on the generated layout and city plan, we utilize the asset retrieval module and Blender for precise asset placement and scene construction. Furthermore, we contribute two new datasets to the field: 1)CityCraft-OSM dataset including 2D semantic layouts of urban areas, corresponding satellite images, and detailed annotations. 2) CityCraft-Buildings dataset, featuring thousands of diverse, high-quality 3D building assets. CityCraft achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating realistic 3D cities.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) facilitates the fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) under limited resources. However, the fine-tuning performance with PEFT on complex, knowledge-intensive tasks is limited due to the constrained model capacity, which originates from the limited number of additional trainable parameters. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel mechanism that fine-tunes LLMs with adapters of larger size yet memory-efficient. This is achieved by leveraging the inherent activation sparsity in the Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) of LLMs and utilizing the larger capacity of Central Processing Unit (CPU) memory compared to Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). We store and update the parameters of larger adapters on the CPU. Moreover, we employ a Mixture of Experts (MoE)-like architecture to mitigate unnecessary CPU computations and reduce the communication volume between the GPU and CPU. This is particularly beneficial over the limited bandwidth of PCI Express (PCIe). Our method can achieve fine-tuning results comparable to those obtained with larger memory capacities, even when operating under more limited resources such as a 24GB memory single GPU setup, with acceptable loss in training efficiency.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>To date, most investigations on surprisal and entropy effects in reading have been conducted on the group level, disregarding individual differences. In this work, we revisit the predictive power of surprisal and entropy measures estimated from a range of language models (LMs) on data of human reading times as a measure of processing effort by incorporating information of language users' cognitive capacities. To do so, we assess the predictive power of surprisal and entropy estimated from generative LMs on reading data obtained from individuals who also completed a wide range of psychometric tests. Specifically, we investigate if modulating surprisal and entropy relative to cognitive scores increases prediction accuracy of reading times, and we examine whether LMs exhibit systematic biases in the prediction of reading times for cognitively high- or low-performing groups, revealing what type of psycholinguistic subject a given LM emulates. Our study finds that in most cases, incorporating cognitive capacities increases predictive power of surprisal and entropy on reading times, and that generally, high performance in the psychometric tests is associated with lower sensitivity to predictability effects. Finally, our results suggest that the analyzed LMs emulate readers with lower verbal intelligence, suggesting that for a given target group (i.e., individuals with high verbal intelligence), these LMs provide less accurate predictability estimates.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, steal</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Many machine learning models are susceptible to adversarial attacks, with decision-based black-box attacks representing the most critical threat in real-world applications. These attacks are extremely stealthy, generating adversarial examples using hard labels obtained from the target machine learning model. This is typically realized by optimizing perturbation directions, guided by decision boundaries identified through query-intensive exact search, significantly limiting the attack success rate. This paper introduces a novel approach using the Approximation Decision Boundary (ADB) to efficiently and accurately compare perturbation directions without precisely determining decision boundaries. The effectiveness of our ADB approach (ADBA) hinges on promptly identifying suitable ADB, ensuring reliable differentiation of all perturbation directions. For this purpose, we analyze the probability distribution of decision boundaries, confirming that using the distribution's median value as ADB can effectively distinguish different perturbation directions, giving rise to the development of the ADBA-md algorithm. ADBA-md only requires four queries on average to differentiate any pair of perturbation directions, which is highly query-efficient. Extensive experiments on six well-known image classifiers clearly demonstrate the superiority of ADBA and ADBA-md over multiple state-of-the-art black-box attacks.</li>

ProMotion offers a range of compelling attributes that set it apart from current task-specific paradigms. We adopt a prototypical perspective, establishing a unified paradigm that harmonizes disparate motion learning approaches. This novel paradigm streamlines the architectural design, enabling the simultaneous assimilation of diverse motion information. We capitalize on a dual mechanism involving the feature denoiser and the prototypical learner to decipher the intricacies of motion. This approach effectively circumvents the pitfalls of ambiguity in pixel-wise feature matching, significantly bolstering the robustness of motion representation. We demonstrate a profound degree of transferability across distinct motion patterns. This inherent versatility reverberates robustly across a comprehensive spectrum of both 2D and 3D downstream tasks. Empirical results demonstrate that ProMotion outperforms various well-known specialized architectures, achieving 0.54 and 0.054 Abs Rel error on the Sintel and KITTI depth datasets, 1.04 and 2.01 average endpoint error on the clean and final pass of Sintel flow benchmark, and 4.30 F1-all error on the KITTI flow benchmark.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep learning models can perform well when evaluated on images from the same distribution as the training set. However, applying small perturbations in the forms of noise, artifacts, occlusions, blurring, etc. to a model's input image and feeding the model with out-of-distribution (OOD) data can significantly drop the model's accuracy, making it not applicable to real-world scenarios. Data augmentation is one of the well-practiced methods to improve model robustness against OOD data; however, examining which augmentation type to choose and how it affects the OOD robustness remains understudied. There is a growing belief that augmenting datasets using data augmentations that improve a model's bias to shape-based features rather than texture-based features results in increased OOD robustness for Convolutional Neural Networks trained on the ImageNet-1K dataset. This is usually stated as ``an increase in the model's shape bias results in an increase in its OOD robustness". Based on this hypothesis, some works in the literature aim to find augmentations with higher effects on model shape bias and use those for data augmentation. By evaluating 39 types of data augmentations on a widely used OOD dataset, we demonstrate the impact of each data augmentation on the model's robustness to OOD data and further show that the mentioned hypothesis is not true; an increase in shape bias does not necessarily result in higher OOD robustness. By analyzing the results, we also find some biases in the ImageNet-1K dataset that can easily be reduced using proper data augmentation. Our evaluation results further show that there is not necessarily a trade-off between in-domain accuracy and OOD robustness, and choosing the proper augmentations can help increase both in-domain accuracy and OOD robustness simultaneously.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are machine learning models that are used to estimate the underlying statistical structure of a given dataset and as a result can be used for a variety of tasks such as image generation or anomaly detection. Despite their initial simplicity, designing an effective loss function for training GANs remains challenging, and various loss functions have been proposed aiming to improve the performance and stability of the generative models. In this study, loss function design for GANs is presented as an optimization problem solved using the genetic programming (GP) approach. Initial experiments were carried out using small Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) model and the MNIST dataset, in order to search experimentally for an improved loss function. The functions found were evaluated on CIFAR10, with the best function, named GANetic loss, showing exceptionally better performance and stability compared to the losses commonly used for GAN training. To further evalute its general applicability on more challenging problems, GANetic loss was applied for two medical applications: image generation and anomaly detection. Experiments were performed with histopathological, gastrointestinal or glaucoma images to evaluate the GANetic loss in medical image generation, resulting in improved image quality compared to the baseline models. The GANetic Loss used for polyp and glaucoma images showed a strong improvement in the detection of anomalies. In summary, the GANetic loss function was evaluated on multiple datasets and applications where it consistently outperforms alternative loss functions. Moreover, GANetic loss leads to stable training and reproducible results, a known weak spot of GANs.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) can be used to generate natural language explanations (NLE) that are adapted to different users' situations. However, there is yet to be a quantitative evaluation of the extent of such adaptation. To bridge this gap, we collect a benchmarking dataset, Situation-Based Explanation. This dataset contains 100 explanandums. Each explanandum is paired with explanations targeted at three distinct audience types-such as educators, students, and professionals-enabling us to assess how well the explanations meet the specific informational needs and contexts of these diverse groups e.g. students, teachers, and parents. For each "explanandum paired with an audience" situation, we include a human-written explanation. These allow us to compute scores that quantify how the LLMs adapt the explanations to the situations. On an array of pretrained language models with varying sizes, we examine three categories of prompting methods: rule-based prompting, meta-prompting, and in-context learning prompting. We find that 1) language models can generate prompts that result in explanations more precisely aligned with the target situations, 2) explicitly modeling an "assistant" persona by prompting "You are a helpful assistant..." is not a necessary prompt technique for situated NLE tasks, and 3) the in-context learning prompts only can help LLMs learn the demonstration template but can't improve their inference performance. SBE and our analysis facilitate future research towards generating situated natural language explanations.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advancements in sequence modeling have led to the development of the Mamba architecture, noted for its selective state space approach, offering a promising avenue for efficient long sequence handling. However, its application in 3D shape generation, particularly at high resolutions, remains underexplored. Traditional diffusion transformers (DiT) with self-attention mechanisms, despite their potential, face scalability challenges due to the cubic complexity of attention operations as input length increases. This complexity becomes a significant hurdle when dealing with high-resolution voxel sizes. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel diffusion architecture tailored for 3D point clouds generation-Diffusion Mamba (DiM-3D). This architecture forgoes traditional attention mechanisms, instead utilizing the inherent efficiency of the Mamba architecture to maintain linear complexity with respect to sequence length. DiM-3D is characterized by fast inference times and substantially lower computational demands, quantified in reduced Gflops, thereby addressing the key scalability issues of prior models. Our empirical results on the ShapeNet benchmark demonstrate that DiM-3D achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating high-fidelity and diverse 3D shapes. Additionally, DiM-3D shows superior capabilities in tasks like 3D point cloud completion. This not only proves the model's scalability but also underscores its efficiency in generating detailed, high-resolution voxels necessary for advanced 3D shape modeling, particularly excelling in environments requiring high-resolution voxel sizes. Through these findings, we illustrate the exceptional scalability and efficiency of the Diffusion Mamba framework in 3D shape generation, setting a new standard for the field and paving the way for future explorations in high-resolution 3D modeling technologies.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Referring multi-object tracking (RMOT) aims at detecting and tracking multiple objects following human instruction represented by a natural language expression. Existing RMOT benchmarks are usually formulated through manual annotations, integrated with static regulations. This approach results in a dearth of notable diversity and a constrained scope of implementation. In this work, our key idea is to bootstrap the task of referring multi-object tracking by introducing discriminative language words as much as possible. In specific, we first develop Refer-KITTI into a large-scale dataset, named Refer-KITTI-V2. It starts with 2,719 manual annotations, addressing the issue of class imbalance and introducing more keywords to make it closer to real-world scenarios compared to Refer-KITTI. They are further expanded to a total of 9,758 annotations by prompting large language models, which create 617 different words, surpassing previous RMOT benchmarks. In addition, the end-to-end framework in RMOT is also bootstrapped by a simple yet elegant temporal advancement strategy, which achieves better performance than previous approaches.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative AI and large language models hold great promise in enhancing programming education by generating individualized feedback and hints for learners. Recent works have primarily focused on improving the quality of generated feedback to achieve human tutors' quality. While quality is an important performance criterion, it is not the only criterion to optimize for real-world educational deployments. In this paper, we benchmark language models for programming feedback generation across several performance criteria, including quality, cost, time, and data privacy. The key idea is to leverage recent advances in the new paradigm of in-browser inference that allow running these models directly in the browser, thereby providing direct benefits across cost and data privacy. To boost the feedback quality of small models compatible with in-browser inference engines, we develop a fine-tuning pipeline based on GPT-4 generated synthetic data. We showcase the efficacy of fine-tuned Llama3-8B and Phi3-3.8B 4-bit quantized models using WebLLM's in-browser inference engine on three different Python programming datasets. We will release the full implementation along with a web app and datasets to facilitate further research on in-browser language models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Few-shot medical image segmentation has achieved great progress in improving accuracy and efficiency of medical analysis in the biomedical imaging field. However, most existing methods cannot explore inter-class relations among base and novel medical classes to reason unseen novel classes. Moreover, the same kind of medical class has large intra-class variations brought by diverse appearances, shapes and scales, thus causing ambiguous visual characterization to degrade generalization performance of these existing methods on unseen novel classes. To address the above challenges, in this paper, we propose a \underline{\textbf{P}}rototype correlation \underline{\textbf{M}}atching and \underline{\textbf{C}}lass-relation \underline{\textbf{R}}easoning (i.e., \textbf{PMCR}) model. The proposed model can effectively mitigate false pixel correlation matches caused by large intra-class variations while reasoning inter-class relations among different medical classes. Specifically, in order to address false pixel correlation match brought by large intra-class variations, we propose a prototype correlation matching module to mine representative prototypes that can characterize diverse visual information of different appearances well. We aim to explore prototype-level rather than pixel-level correlation matching between support and query features via optimal transport algorithm to tackle false matches caused by intra-class variations. Meanwhile, in order to explore inter-class relations, we design a class-relation reasoning module to segment unseen novel medical objects via reasoning inter-class relations between base and novel classes. Such inter-class relations can be well propagated to semantic encoding of local query features to improve few-shot segmentation performance. Quantitative comparisons illustrates the large performance improvement of our model over other baseline methods.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Grasping is an important human activity that has long been studied in robotics, computer vision, and cognitive science. Most existing works study grasping from the perspective of synthesizing hand poses conditioned on 3D or 2D object representations. We propose GenHeld to address the inverse problem of synthesizing held objects conditioned on 3D hand model or 2D image. Given a 3D model of hand, GenHeld 3D can select a plausible held object from a large dataset using compact object representations called object codes.The selected object is then positioned and oriented to form a plausible grasp without changing hand pose. If only a 2D hand image is available, GenHeld 2D can edit this image to add or replace a held object. GenHeld 2D operates by combining the abilities of GenHeld 3D with diffusion-based image editing. Results and experiments show that we outperform baselines and can generate plausible held objects in both 2D and 3D. Our experiments demonstrate that our method achieves high quality and plausibility of held object synthesis in both 3D and 2D.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the emergence of large language models (LLMs), investigating if they can surpass humans in areas such as emotion recognition and empathetic responding has become a focal point of research. This paper presents a comprehensive study exploring the empathetic responding capabilities of four state-of-the-art LLMs: GPT-4, LLaMA-2-70B-Chat, Gemini-1.0-Pro, and Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct in comparison to a human baseline. We engaged 1,000 participants in a between-subjects user study, assessing the empathetic quality of responses generated by humans and the four LLMs to 2,000 emotional dialogue prompts meticulously selected to cover a broad spectrum of 32 distinct positive and negative emotions. Our findings reveal a statistically significant superiority of the empathetic responding capability of LLMs over humans. GPT-4 emerged as the most empathetic, marking approximately 31% increase in responses rated as "Good" compared to the human benchmark. It was followed by LLaMA-2, Mixtral-8x7B, and Gemini-Pro, which showed increases of approximately 24%, 21%, and 10% in "Good" ratings, respectively. We further analyzed the response ratings at a finer granularity and discovered that some LLMs are significantly better at responding to specific emotions compared to others. The suggested evaluation framework offers a scalable and adaptable approach for assessing the empathy of new LLMs, avoiding the need to replicate this study's findings in future research.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we study multi-task structured bandit problem where the goal is to learn a near-optimal algorithm that minimizes cumulative regret. The tasks share a common structure and the algorithm exploits the shared structure to minimize the cumulative regret for an unseen but related test task. We use a transformer as a decision-making algorithm to learn this shared structure so as to generalize to the test task. The prior work of pretrained decision transformers like DPT requires access to the optimal action during training which may be hard in several scenarios. Diverging from these works, our learning algorithm does not need the knowledge of optimal action per task during training but predicts a reward vector for each of the actions using only the observed offline data from the diverse training tasks. Finally, during inference time, it selects action using the reward predictions employing various exploration strategies in-context for an unseen test task. Our model outperforms other SOTA methods like DPT, and Algorithmic Distillation over a series of experiments on several structured bandit problems (linear, bilinear, latent, non-linear). Interestingly, we show that our algorithm, without the knowledge of the underlying problem structure, can learn a near-optimal policy in-context by leveraging the shared structure across diverse tasks. We further extend the field of pre-trained decision transformers by showing that they can leverage unseen tasks with new actions and still learn the underlying latent structure to derive a near-optimal policy. We validate this over several experiments to show that our proposed solution is very general and has wide applications to potentially emergent online and offline strategies at test time. Finally, we theoretically analyze the performance of our algorithm and obtain generalization bounds in the in-context multi-task learning setting.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>explainability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Decision processes of computer vision models - especially deep neural networks - are opaque in nature, meaning that these decisions cannot be understood by humans. Thus, over the last years, many methods to provide human-understandable explanations have been proposed. For image classification, the most common group are saliency methods, which provide (super-)pixelwise feature attribution scores for input images. But their evaluation still poses a problem, as their results cannot be simply compared to the unknown ground truth. To overcome this, a slew of different proxy metrics have been defined, which are - as the explainability methods themselves - often built on intuition and thus, are possibly unreliable. In this paper, new evaluation metrics for saliency methods are developed and common saliency methods are benchmarked on ImageNet. In addition, a scheme for reliability evaluation of such metrics is proposed that is based on concepts from psychometric testing. The used code can be found at this https URL .</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Tuning-free long video diffusion has been proposed to generate extended-duration videos with enriched content by reusing the knowledge from pre-trained short video diffusion model without retraining. However, most works overlook the fine-grained long-term video consistency modeling, resulting in limited scene consistency (i.e., unreasonable object or background transitions), especially with multiple text inputs. To mitigate this, we propose the Consistency Noise Injection, dubbed CoNo, which introduces the "look-back" mechanism to enhance the fine-grained scene transition between different video clips, and designs the long-term consistency regularization to eliminate the content shifts when extending video contents through noise prediction. In particular, the "look-back" mechanism breaks the noise scheduling process into three essential parts, where one internal noise prediction part is injected into two video-extending parts, intending to achieve a fine-grained transition between two video clips. The long-term consistency regularization focuses on explicitly minimizing the pixel-wise distance between the predicted noises of the extended video clip and the original one, thereby preventing abrupt scene transitions. Extensive experiments have shown the effectiveness of the above strategies by performing long-video generation under both single- and multi-text prompt conditions.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by enabling the retrieval of documents into the LLM context to provide more accurate and relevant responses. Existing RAG solutions do not focus on queries that may require fetching multiple documents with substantially different contents. Such queries occur frequently, but are challenging because the embeddings of these documents may be distant in the embedding space, making it hard to retrieve them all. This paper introduces Multi-Head RAG (MRAG), a novel scheme designed to address this gap with a simple yet powerful idea: leveraging activations of Transformer's multi-head attention layer, instead of the decoder layer, as keys for fetching multi-aspect documents. The driving motivation is that different attention heads can learn to capture different data aspects. Harnessing the corresponding activations results in embeddings that represent various facets of data items and queries, improving the retrieval accuracy for complex queries. We provide an evaluation methodology and metrics, synthetic datasets, and real-world use cases to demonstrate MRAG's effectiveness, showing improvements of up to 20% in relevance over standard RAG baselines. MRAG can be seamlessly integrated with existing RAG frameworks and benchmarking tools like RAGAS as well as different classes of data stores.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Using feature attributions for post-hoc explanations is a common practice to understand and verify the predictions of opaque machine learning models. Despite the numerous techniques available, individual methods often produce inconsistent and unstable results, putting their overall reliability into question. In this work, we aim to systematically improve the quality of feature attributions by combining multiple explanations across distinct methods or their variations. For this purpose, we propose a novel approach to derive optimal convex combinations of feature attributions that yield provable improvements of desired quality criteria such as robustness or faithfulness to the model behavior. Through extensive experiments involving various model architectures and popular feature attribution techniques, we demonstrate that our combination strategy consistently outperforms individual methods and existing baselines.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Generative Models (LGMs) such as GPT, Stable Diffusion, Sora, and Suno are trained on a huge amount of language corpus, images, videos, and audio that are extremely diverse from numerous domains. This training paradigm over diverse well-curated data lies at the heart of generating creative and sensible content. However, all previous graph generative models (e.g., GraphRNN, MDVAE, MoFlow, GDSS, and DiGress) have been trained only on one dataset each time, which cannot replicate the revolutionary success achieved by LGMs in other fields. To remedy this crucial gap, we propose a new class of graph generative model called Large Graph Generative Model (LGGM) that is trained on a large corpus of graphs (over 5000 graphs) from 13 different domains. We empirically demonstrate that the pre-trained LGGM has superior zero-shot generative capability to existing graph generative models. Furthermore, our pre-trained LGGM can be easily fine-tuned with graphs from target domains and demonstrate even better performance than those directly trained from scratch, behaving as a solid starting point for real-world customization. Inspired by Stable Diffusion, we further equip LGGM with the capability to generate graphs given text prompts (Text-to-Graph), such as the description of the network name and domain (i.e., "The power-1138-bus graph represents a network of buses in a power distribution system."), and network statistics (i.e., "The graph has a low average degree, suitable for modeling social media interactions."). This Text-to-Graph capability integrates the extensive world knowledge in the underlying language model, offering users fine-grained control of the generated graphs.

Specifically, we designed LlavaGuard for dataset annotation and generative model safeguarding. To this end, we collected and annotated a high-quality visual dataset incorporating a broad safety taxonomy, which we use to tune VLMs on context-aware safety risks. As a key innovation, LlavaGuard's new responses contain comprehensive information, including a safety rating, the violated safety categories, and an in-depth rationale. Further, our introduced customizable taxonomy categories enable the context-specific alignment of LlavaGuard to various scenarios. Our experiments highlight the capabilities of LlavaGuard in complex and real-world applications. We provide checkpoints ranging from 7B to 34B parameters demonstrating state-of-the-art performance, with even the smallest models outperforming baselines like GPT-4.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>A key challenge that threatens the widespread use of neural networks in safety-critical applications is their vulnerability to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we study the second-order behavior of continuously differentiable deep neural networks, focusing on robustness against adversarial perturbations. First, we provide a theoretical analysis of robustness and attack certificates for deep classifiers by leveraging local gradients and upper bounds on the second derivative (curvature constant). Next, we introduce a novel algorithm to analytically compute provable upper bounds on the second derivative of neural networks. This algorithm leverages the compositional structure of the model to propagate the curvature bound layer-by-layer, giving rise to a scalable and modular approach. The proposed bound can serve as a differentiable regularizer to control the curvature of neural networks during training, thereby enhancing robustness. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our method on classification tasks using the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Mammalian brains handle complex reasoning by integrating information across brain regions specialized for particular sensory modalities. This enables improved robustness and generalization versus deep neural networks, which typically process one modality and are vulnerable to perturbations. While defense methods exist, they do not generalize well across perturbations. We developed a fusion model combining background and foreground features from CNNs trained on Imagenet and Places365. We tested its robustness to human-perceivable perturbations on MS COCO. The fusion model improved robustness, especially for classes with greater context variability. Our proposed solution for integrating multiple modalities provides a new approach to enhance robustness and may be complementary to existing methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in processing vision-language tasks. One of the crux of MLLMs lies in vision tokenization, which involves efficiently transforming input visual signals into feature representations that are most beneficial for LLMs. However, existing vision tokenizers, essential for semantic alignment between vision and language, remain problematic. Existing methods aggressively fragment visual input, corrupting the visual semantic integrity. To address this, this paper proposes a novel dynamic Semantic-Equivalent Vision Tokenizer (SeTok), which groups visual features into semantic units via a dynamic clustering algorithm, flexibly determining the number of tokens based on image complexity. The resulting vision tokens effectively preserve semantic integrity and capture both low-frequency and high-frequency visual features. The proposed MLLM (Setokim) equipped with SeTok significantly demonstrates superior performance across various tasks, as evidenced by our experimental results.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) fine-tuned with multimodal instruction datasets have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in multimodal tasks. However, fine-tuning all parameters of MLLMs has become challenging as they usually contain billions of parameters. To address this issue, we study parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods for MLLMs. We aim to identify effective methods for enhancing the performance of MLLMs in scenarios where only a limited number of parameters are trained. This paper conducts empirical studies using four popular PEFT methods to fine-tune the LLM component of open-source MLLMs. We present a comprehensive analysis that encompasses various aspects, including the impact of PEFT methods on various models, parameters and location of the PEFT module, size of fine-tuning data, model stability based on PEFT methods, MLLM's generalization, and hallucination. We evaluated four PEFT methods on seven datasets from two different categories: unseen and seen datasets. Across all experiments, we show that the adapter is the best-performing PEFT method. At the same time, fine-tuning the connector layers leads to improved performance in most MLLMs. Code and data are available at this https URL.</li>

In Dense Video Object Segmentation (DVOS) scenarios, each video frame encompasses hundreds of small, dense, and partially occluded objects. Accordingly, the labor-intensive manual annotation of even a single frame often takes hours, which hinders the development of DVOS for many applications. Furthermore, in videos with dense patterns, following a large number of objects that move in different directions poses additional challenges. To address these challenges, we proposed a semi-self-supervised spatiotemporal approach for DVOS utilizing a diffusion-based method through multi-task learning. Emulating real videos' optical flow and simulating their motion, we developed a methodology to synthesize computationally annotated videos that can be used for training DVOS models; The model performance was further improved by utilizing weakly labeled (computationally generated but imprecise) data. To demonstrate the utility and efficacy of the proposed approach, we developed DVOS models for wheat head segmentation of handheld and drone-captured videos, capturing wheat crops in fields of different locations across various growth stages, spanning from heading to maturity. Despite using only a few manually annotated video frames, the proposed approach yielded high-performing models, achieving a Dice score of 0.82 when tested on a drone-captured external test set. While we showed the efficacy of the proposed approach for wheat head segmentation, its application can be extended to other crops or DVOS in other domains, such as crowd analysis or microscopic image analysis.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The integration of language and 3D perception is crucial for developing embodied agents and robots that comprehend and interact with the physical world. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive language understanding and generation capabilities, their adaptation to 3D environments (3D-LLMs) remains in its early stages. A primary challenge is the absence of large-scale datasets that provide dense grounding between language and 3D scenes. In this paper, we introduce 3D-GRAND, a pioneering large-scale dataset comprising 40,087 household scenes paired with 6.2 million densely-grounded scene-language instructions. Our results show that instruction tuning with 3D-GRAND significantly enhances grounding capabilities and reduces hallucinations in 3D-LLMs. As part of our contributions, we propose a comprehensive benchmark 3D-POPE to systematically evaluate hallucination in 3D-LLMs, enabling fair comparisons among future models. Our experiments highlight a scaling effect between dataset size and 3D-LLM performance, emphasizing the critical role of large-scale 3D-text datasets in advancing embodied AI research. Notably, our results demonstrate early signals for effective sim-to-real transfer, indicating that models trained on large synthetic data can perform well on real-world 3D scans. Through 3D-GRAND and 3D-POPE, we aim to equip the embodied AI community with essential resources and insights, setting the stage for more reliable and better-grounded 3D-LLMs. Project website: this https URL</li>
