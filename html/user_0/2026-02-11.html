<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Transformers have demonstrated success in graph learning, particularly for node-level tasks. However, existing methods encounter an information bottleneck when generating graph-level representations. The prevalent single token paradigm fails to fully leverage the inherent strength of self-attention in encoding token sequences, and degenerates into a weighted sum of node signals. To address this issue, we design a novel serialized token paradigm to encapsulate global signals more effectively. Specifically, a graph serialization method is proposed to aggregate node signals into serialized graph tokens, with positional encoding being automatically involved. Then, stacked self-attention layers are applied to encode this token sequence and capture its internal dependencies. Our method can yield more expressive graph representations by modeling complex interactions among multiple graph tokens. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on several graph-level benchmarks. Ablation studies verify the effectiveness of the proposed modules.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large-scale multimodal contrastive learning has recently achieved impressive success in learning rich and transferable representations, yet it remains fundamentally limited by the uniform treatment of feature dimensions and the neglect of the intrinsic spectral structure of the learned features. Empirical evidence indicates that high-dimensional embeddings tend to collapse into narrow cones, concentrating task-relevant semantics in a small subspace, while the majority of dimensions remain occupied by noise and spurious correlations. Such spectral imbalance and entanglement undermine model generalization. We propose Spectral Disentanglement and Enhancement (SDE), a novel framework that bridges the gap between the geometry of the embedded spaces and their spectral properties. Our approach leverages singular value decomposition to adaptively partition feature dimensions into strong signals that capture task-critical semantics, weak signals that reflect ancillary correlations, and noise representing irrelevant perturbations. A curriculum-based spectral enhancement strategy is then applied, selectively amplifying informative components with theoretical guarantees on training stability. Building upon the enhanced features, we further introduce a dual-domain contrastive loss that jointly optimizes alignment in both the feature and spectral spaces, effectively integrating spectral regularization into the training process and encouraging richer, more robust representations. Extensive experiments on large-scale multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that SDE consistently improves representation robustness and generalization, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. SDE integrates seamlessly with existing contrastive pipelines, offering an effective solution for multimodal representation learning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In-Context Learning (ICL) in transformers acts as an online associative memory and is believed to underpin their high performance on complex sequence processing tasks. However, in gated linear attention models, this memory has a fixed capacity and is prone to interference, especially for long sequences. We propose Palimpsa, a self-attention model that views ICL as a continual learning problem that must address a stability-plasticity dilemma. Palimpsa uses Bayesian metaplasticity, where the plasticity of each attention state is tied to an importance state grounded by a prior distribution that captures accumulated knowledge. We demonstrate that various gated linear attention models emerge as specific architecture choices and posterior approximations, and that Mamba2 is a special case of Palimpsa where forgetting dominates. This theoretical link enables the transformation of any non-metaplastic model into a metaplastic one, significantly expanding its memory capacity. Our experiments show that Palimpsa consistently outperforms baselines on the Multi-Query Associative Recall (MQAR) benchmark and on Commonsense Reasoning tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, protect, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Cyber threats have become highly sophisticated, prompting a heightened concern for endpoint security, especially in critical infrastructure, to new heights. A security model, such as Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA), is required to overcome this challenge. ZTA treats every access request as new and assumes no implicit trust. Critical infrastructure like power plants, healthcare systems, financial systems, water supply, and military assets are especially prone to becoming targets for hackers and phishing attacks. This proposes a comprehensive framework for integrating tailored ZTA into organizations that manage sensitive operations. The paper highlights how the ZTA framework can enhance compliance, enabling continuous protection, thereby reducing attack surfaces. This paper aims to address the gap that exists in applying ZTA to endpoint management within cloud environments for critical infrastructure.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable success in vision-language tasks, yet their vast parameter counts are often underutilized during both training and inference. In this work, we embrace the idea of looping back to move forward: reusing model parameters through recursive refinement to extract stronger multimodal representations without increasing model size. We propose RecursiveVLM, a recursive Transformer architecture tailored for LMMs. Two key innovations enable effective looping: (i) a Recursive Connector that aligns features across recursion steps by fusing intermediate-layer hidden states and applying modality-specific projections, respecting the distinct statistical structures of vision and language tokens; (ii) a Monotonic Recursion Loss that supervises every step and guarantees performance improves monotonically with recursion depth. This design transforms recursion into an on-demand refinement mechanism: delivering strong results with few loops on resource-constrained devices and progressively improving outputs when more computation resources are available. Experiments show consistent gains of +3% over standard Transformers and +7% over vanilla recursive baselines, demonstrating that strategic looping is a powerful path toward efficient, deployment-adaptive LMMs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the rapid growth of large language models (LLMs), a wide range of methods have been developed to distribute computation and memory across hardware devices for efficient training and inference. While existing surveys provide descriptive overviews of these techniques, systematic analysis of their benefits and trade offs and how such insights can inform principled methodology for designing optimal distributed systems remain limited. This paper offers a comprehensive review of collective operations and distributed parallel strategies, complemented by mathematical formulations to deepen theoretical understanding. We further examine hybrid parallelization designs, emphasizing communication computation overlap across different stages of model deployment, including both training and inference. Recent advances in automated search for optimal hybrid parallelization strategies using cost models are also discussed. Moreover, we present case studies with mainstream architecture categories to reveal empirical insights to guide researchers and practitioners in parallelism strategy selection. Finally, we highlight open challenges and limitations of current LLM training paradigms and outline promising directions for the next generation of large scale model development.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The capacity to transfer knowledge across scientific domains relies on shared organizational principles. However, existing transfer-learning methodologies often fail to bridge radically heterogeneous systems, particularly under severe data scarcity or stochastic noise. This study formalizes Explainable Cross-Domain Transfer Learning (X-CDTL), a framework unifying network science and explainable artificial intelligence to identify structural invariants that generalize across biological, linguistic, molecular, and social networks. By introducing the Importance Inversion Transfer (IIT) mechanism, the framework prioritizes domain-invariant structural anchors over idiosyncratic, highly discriminative features. In anomaly detection tasks, models guided by these principles achieve significant performance gains - exhibiting a 56\% relative improvement in decision stability under extreme noise - over traditional baselines. These results provide evidence for a shared organizational signature across heterogeneous domains, establishing a principled paradigm for cross-disciplinary knowledge propagation. By shifting from opaque latent representations to explicit structural laws, this work advances machine learning as a robust engine for scientific discovery.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent generative and tool-using AI systems can surface a large volume of candidates at low marginal cost, yet only a small fraction can be checked carefully. This creates a decoder-side bottleneck: downstream decision-makers must form reliable posteriors from many public records under scarce attention. We formalize this regime via Attention-Constrained Inference (ACI), in which a cheap screening stage processes $K$ records and an expensive verification stage can follow up on at most $B$ of them. Under Bayes log-loss, we study the maximum achievable reduction in posterior uncertainty per window, which we call \emph{epistemic throughput}. Our main result is a ``JaKoB'' scaling law showing that epistemic throughput has a baseline term that grows linearly with verification and prevalence, and an additional \emph{information-leverage} term that scales as $\sqrt{JKB}$, where $J$ summarizes screening quality. Thus, expanding cheap screening can nonlinearly amplify scarce verification, even when informative records are rare. We further show that this scaling is tight in a weak-screening limit, and that in the sparse-verification regime ($B \ll K$), substantial leverage requires heavy-tailed score distributions; for light-tailed scores the amplification is only logarithmic.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Model compression is increasingly essential for deploying large language models (LLMs), yet existing evaluations are limited in method coverage and focus primarily on knowledge-centric benchmarks. Thus, we introduce UniComp, a unified evaluation framework for comparing pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation. UniComp evaluates compressed models along three dimensions: performance, reliability, and efficiency, using a diverse set of capability- and safety-oriented benchmarks together with a hardware-aware efficiency analysis. Through extensive evaluation of six compression techniques on modern LLMs across more than 40 datasets, we find that (i) compression exhibits a consistent knowledge bias, where knowledge-intensive tasks are relatively preserved while reasoning, multilingual, and instruction-following capabilities degrade substantially; (ii) quantization provides the best overall trade-off between retained performance and efficiency, whereas distillation yields strong runtime acceleration gains at high computational cost; and (iii) task-specific calibration can significantly improve the reasoning ability of pruned models by up to 50%.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, protect</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While the CHERI instruction-set architecture extensions for capabilities enable strong spatial memory safety, CHERI lacks built-in temporal safety, particularly for heap allocations. Prior attempts to augment CHERI with temporal safety fall short in terms of scalability, memory overhead, and incomplete security guarantees due to periodical sweeps of the system's memory to individually revoke stale capabilities. We address these limitations by introducing colored capabilities that add a controlled form of indirection to CHERI's capability model. This enables provenance tracking of capabilities to their respective allocations via a hardware-managed provenance-validity table, allowing bulk retraction of dangling pointers without needing to quarantine freed memory. Colored capabilities significantly reduce the frequency of capability revocation sweeps while improving security. We realize colored capabilities in PICASSO, an extension of the CHERI-RISC-V architecture on a speculative out-of-order FPGA softcore (CHERI-Toooba). We also integrate colored-capability support into the CheriBSD OS and CHERI-enabled Clang/LLVM toolchain. Our evaluation shows effective mitigation of use-after-free and double-free bugs across all heap-based temporal memory-safety vulnerabilities in NIST Juliet test cases, with only a small performance overhead on SPEC CPU benchmarks (5% g.m.), less latency, and more consistent performance in long-running SQLite, PostgreSQL, and gRPC workloads compared to prior work.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, extraction, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The growing volume of video-based news content has heightened the need for transparent and reliable methods to extract on-screen information. Yet the variability of graphical layouts, typographic conventions, and platform-specific design patterns renders manual indexing impractical. This work presents a comprehensive framework for automatically detecting and extracting personal names from broadcast and social-media-native news videos. It introduces a curated and balanced corpus of annotated frames capturing the diversity of contemporary news graphics and proposes an interpretable, modular extraction pipeline designed to operate under deterministic and auditable conditions. The pipeline is evaluated against a contrasting class of generative multimodal methods, revealing a clear trade-off between deterministic auditability and stochastic inference. The underlying detector achieves 95.8% mAP@0.5, demonstrating operationally robust performance for graphical element localisation. While generative systems achieve marginally higher raw accuracy (F1: 84.18% vs 77.08%), they lack the transparent data lineage required for journalistic and analytical contexts. The proposed pipeline delivers balanced precision (79.9%) and recall (74.4%), avoids hallucination, and provides full traceability across each processing stage. Complementary user findings indicate that 59% of respondents report difficulty reading on-screen names in fast-paced broadcasts, underscoring the practical relevance of the task. The results establish a methodologically rigorous and interpretable baseline for hybrid multimodal information extraction in modern news media.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Hallucination remains a barrier to deploying generative models in high-consequence applications. This is especially true in cases where external ground truth is not readily available to validate model outputs. This situation has motivated the study of geometric signals in the internal state of an LLM that are predictive of hallucination and require limited external knowledge. Given that there are a range of factors that can lead model output to be called a hallucination (e.g., irrelevance vs incoherence), in this paper we ask what specific properties of a hallucination these geometric statistics actually capture. To assess this, we generate a synthetic dataset which varies distinct properties of output associated with hallucination. This includes output correctness, confidence, relevance, coherence, and completeness. We find that different geometric statistics capture different types of hallucinations. Along the way we show that many existing geometric detection methods have substantial sensitivity to shifts in task domain (e.g., math questions vs. history questions). Motivated by this, we introduce a simple normalization method to mitigate the effect of domain shift on geometric statistics, leading to AUROC gains of +34 points in multi-domain settings.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Analog Ising machines (AIMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for combinatorial optimization, utilizing physical dynamics to solve Ising problems with high energy efficiency. However, the performance of traditional optimization and sampling algorithms on these platforms is often limited by inherent measurement noise. We introduce BRAIN (Boltzmann Reinforcement for Analog Ising Networks), a distribution learning framework that utilizes variational reinforcement learning to approximate the Boltzmann distribution. By shifting from state-by-state sampling to aggregating information across multiple noisy measurements, BRAIN is resilient to Gaussian noise characteristic of AIMs. We evaluate BRAIN across diverse combinatorial topologies, including the Curie-Weiss and 2D nearest-neighbor Ising systems. We find that under realistic 3\% Gaussian measurement noise, BRAIN maintains 98\% ground state fidelity, whereas Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods degrade to 51\% fidelity. Furthermore, BRAIN reaches the MCMC-equivalent solution up to 192x faster under these conditions. BRAIN exhibits $\mathcal{O}(N^{1.55})$ scaling up to 65,536 spins and maintains robustness against severe measurement uncertainty up to 40\%. Beyond ground state optimization, BRAIN accurately captures thermodynamic phase transitions and metastable states, providing a scalable and noise-resilient method for utilizing analog computing architectures in complex optimizations.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we study federated optimization for solving stochastic variational inequalities (VIs), a problem that has attracted growing attention in recent years. Despite substantial progress, a significant gap remains between existing convergence rates and the state-of-the-art bounds known for federated convex optimization. In this work, we address this limitation by establishing a series of improved convergence rates. First, we show that, for general smooth and monotone variational inequalities, the classical Local Extra SGD algorithm admits tighter guarantees under a refined analysis. Next, we identify an inherent limitation of Local Extra SGD, which can lead to excessive client drift. Motivated by this observation, we propose a new algorithm, the Local Inexact Proximal Point Algorithm with Extra Step (LIPPAX), and show that it mitigates client drift and achieves improved guarantees in several regimes, including bounded Hessian, bounded operator, and low-variance settings. Finally, we extend our results to federated composite variational inequalities and establish improved convergence guarantees.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Accurate interpretation and visual representation of complex prompts involving multiple objects, attributes, and spatial relationships is a critical challenge in text-to-image synthesis. Despite recent advancements in generating photorealistic outputs, current models often struggle with maintaining semantic fidelity and structural coherence when processing intricate textual inputs. We propose a novel approach that grounds text-to-image synthesis within the framework of scene graph structures, aiming to enhance the compositional abilities of existing models. Eventhough, prior approaches have attempted to address this by using pre-defined layout maps derived from prompts, such rigid constraints often limit compositional flexibility and diversity. In contrast, we introduce a zero-shot, scene graph-based conditioning mechanism that generates soft visual guidance during inference. At the core of our method is the Attribute-Size-Quantity-Location (ASQL) Conditioner, which produces visual conditions via a lightweight language model and guides diffusion-based generation through inference-time optimization. This enables the model to maintain text-image alignment while supporting lightweight, coherent, and diverse image synthesis.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Exploiting the analogy between Gaussian Distributions and Gaussian Processes' posterior, we present how the weighted Wasserstein Barycenter of Gaussian Processes (W2BGP) can be used to unify, under a common framework, different exotic Bayesian Optimization (BO) tasks. Specifically, collaborative/federated BO, (synchronous) batch BO, and multi-fidelity BO are considered in this paper. Our empirical analysis proves that each one of these tasks requires just an appropriate weighting schema for the W2BGP, while the entire framework remains untouched. Moreover, we demonstrate that the most well-known BO acquisition functions can be easily re-interpreted under the proposed framework and also enable a more computationally efficient way to deal with the computation of the Wasserstein Barycenter, compared with state-of-the-art methods from the Machine Learning literature. Finally, research perspectives branching from the proposed approach are presented.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, security, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Machine learning relies on randomness as a fundamental component in various steps such as data sampling, data augmentation, weight initialization, and optimization. Most machine learning frameworks use pseudorandom number generators as the source of randomness. However, variations in design choices and implementations across different frameworks, software dependencies, and hardware backends along with the lack of statistical validation can lead to previously unexplored attack vectors on machine learning systems. Such attacks on randomness sources can be extremely covert, and have a history of exploitation in real-world systems. In this work, we examine the role of randomness in the machine learning development pipeline from an adversarial point of view, and analyze the implementations of PRNGs in major machine learning frameworks. We present RNGGuard to help machine learning engineers secure their systems with low effort. RNGGuard statically analyzes a target library's source code and identifies instances of random functions and modules that use them. At runtime, RNGGuard enforces secure execution of random functions by replacing insecure function calls with RNGGuard's implementations that meet security specifications. Our evaluations show that RNGGuard presents a practical approach to close existing gaps in securing randomness sources in machine learning systems.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Existing work has linked properties of a function's gradient to the difficulty of function approximation. Motivated by these insights, we study how gradient information can be leveraged to improve neural network's ability to approximate high-frequency functions, and we propose a gradient-based residual connection as a complement to the standard identity skip connection used in residual networks. We provide simple theoretical intuition for why gradient information can help distinguish inputs and improve the approximation of functions with rapidly varying behaviour. On a synthetic regression task with a high-frequency sinusoidal ground truth, we show that conventional residual connections struggle to capture high-frequency patterns. In contrast, our gradient residual substantially improves approximation quality. We then introduce a convex combination of the standard and gradient residuals, allowing the network to flexibly control how strongly it relies on gradient information. After validating the design choices of our proposed method through an ablation study, we further validate our approach's utility on the single-image super-resolution task, where the underlying function may be high-frequency. Finally, on standard tasks such as image classification and segmentation, our method achieves performance comparable to standard residual networks, suggesting its broad utility.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As machine learning models increasingly impact society, their opaque nature poses challenges to trust and accountability, particularly in fairness contexts. Understanding how individual features influence model outcomes is crucial for building interpretable and equitable models. While feature importance metrics for accuracy are well-established, methods for assessing feature contributions to fairness remain underexplored. We propose two model-agnostic approaches to measure fair feature importance. First, we propose to compare model fairness before and after permuting feature values. This simple intervention-based approach decouples a feature and model predictions to measure its contribution to training. Second, we evaluate the fairness of models trained with and without a given feature. This occlusion-based score enjoys dramatic computational simplification via minipatch learning. Our empirical results reflect the simplicity and effectiveness of our proposed metrics for multiple predictive tasks. Both methods offer simple, scalable, and interpretable solutions to quantify the influence of features on fairness, providing new tools for responsible machine learning development.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in a wide range of sequential decision-making problems. Recent diffusion-based policies further improve RL by modeling complex, high-dimensional action distributions. However, existing diffusion policies primarily rely on statistical associations and fail to explicitly account for causal relationships among states, actions, and rewards, limiting their ability to identify which action components truly cause high returns. In this paper, we propose Causality-guided Diffusion Policy (CausalGDP), a unified framework that integrates causal reasoning into diffusion-based RL. CausalGDP first learns a base diffusion policy and an initial causal dynamical model from offline data, capturing causal dependencies among states, actions, and rewards. During real-time interaction, the causal information is continuously updated and incorporated as a guidance signal to steer the diffusion process toward actions that causally influence future states and rewards. By explicitly considering causality beyond association, CausalGDP focuses policy optimization on action components that genuinely drive performance improvements. Experimental results demonstrate that CausalGDP consistently achieves competitive or superior performance over state-of-the-art diffusion-based and offline RL methods, especially in complex, high-dimensional control tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Time series forecasting is a critical task across domains such as energy, finance, and meteorology, where accurate predictions enable informed decision-making. While transformer-based and large-parameter models have recently achieved state-of-the-art results, their complexity can lead to overfitting and unstable forecasts, especially when older data points become less relevant. In this paper, we propose a lightweight multi-view approach to short-term load forecasting that leverages single-value embeddings and a scaled time-range input to capture temporally relevant features efficiently. We introduce an embedding dropout mechanism to prevent over-reliance on specific features and enhance interpretability. Our method achieves competitive performance with significantly fewer parameters, demonstrating robustness across multiple datasets, including scenarios with noisy or sparse data, and provides insights into the contributions of individual features to the forecast.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, privacy, attack, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language model (LLM) based web agents are increasingly deployed to automate complex online tasks by directly interacting with web sites and performing actions on users' behalf. While these agents offer powerful capabilities, their design exposes them to indirect prompt injection attacks embedded in untrusted web content, enabling adversaries to hijack agent behavior and violate user intent. Despite growing awareness of this threat, existing evaluations rely on fixed attack templates, manually selected injection surfaces, or narrowly scoped scenarios, limiting their ability to capture realistic, adaptive attacks encountered in practice. We present MUZZLE, an automated agentic framework for evaluating the security of web agents against indirect prompt injection attacks. MUZZLE utilizes the agent's trajectories to automatically identify high-salience injection surfaces, and adaptively generate context-aware malicious instructions that target violations of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Unlike prior approaches, MUZZLE adapts its attack strategy based on the agent's observed execution trajectory and iteratively refines attacks using feedback from failed executions. We evaluate MUZZLE across diverse web applications, user tasks, and agent configurations, demonstrating its ability to automatically and adaptively assess the security of web agents with minimal human intervention. Our results show that MUZZLE effectively discovers 37 new attacks on 4 web applications with 10 adversarial objectives that violate confidentiality, availability, or privacy properties. MUZZLE also identifies novel attack strategies, including 2 cross-application prompt injection attacks and an agent-tailored phishing scenario.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Statistical data anonymization increasingly relies on fully synthetic microdata, for which classical identity disclosure measures are less informative than an adversary's ability to infer sensitive attributes from released data. We introduce RAPID (Risk of Attribute Prediction--Induced Disclosure), a disclosure risk measure that directly quantifies inferential vulnerability under a realistic attack model. An adversary trains a predictive model solely on the released synthetic data and applies it to real individuals' quasi-identifiers. For continuous sensitive attributes, RAPID reports the proportion of records whose predicted values fall within a specified relative error tolerance. For categorical attributes, we propose a baseline-normalized confidence score that measures how much more confident the attacker is about the true class than would be expected from class prevalence alone, and we summarize risk as the fraction of records exceeding a policy-defined threshold. This construction yields an interpretable, bounded risk metric that is robust to class imbalance, independent of any specific synthesizer, and applicable with arbitrary learning algorithms. We illustrate threshold calibration, uncertainty quantification, and comparative evaluation of synthetic data generators using simulations and real data. Our results show that RAPID provides a practical, attacker-realistic upper bound on attribute-inference disclosure risk that complements existing utility diagnostics and disclosure control frameworks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>watermark</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Explainable AI (XAI) promises to provide insight into machine learning models' decision processes, where one goal is to identify failures such as shortcut learning. This promise relies on the field's assumption that input features marked as important by an XAI must contain information about the target variable. However, it is unclear whether informativeness is indeed the main driver of importance attribution in practice, or if other data properties such as statistical suppression, novelty at test-time, or high feature salience substantially contribute. To clarify this, we trained deep learning models on three variants of a binary image classification task, in which translucent watermarks are either absent, act as class-dependent confounds, or represent class-independent noise. Results for five popular attribution methods show substantially elevated relative importance in watermarked areas (RIW) for all models regardless of the training setting ($R^2 \geq .45$). By contrast, whether the presence of watermarks is class-dependent or not only has a marginal effect on RIW ($R^2 \leq .03$), despite a clear impact impact on model performance and generalisation ability. XAI methods show similar behaviour to model-agnostic edge detection filters and attribute substantially less importance to watermarks when bright image intensities are encoded by smaller instead of larger feature values. These results indicate that importance attribution is most strongly driven by the salience of image structures at test time rather than statistical associations learned by machine learning models. Previous studies demonstrating successful XAI application should be reevaluated with respect to a possibly spurious concurrency of feature salience and informativeness, and workflows using feature attribution methods as building blocks should be scrutinised.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Surgical image segmentation is essential for robot-assisted surgery and intraoperative guidance. However, existing methods are constrained to predefined categories, produce one-shot predictions without adaptive refinement, and lack mechanisms for clinician interaction. We propose IR-SIS, an iterative refinement system for surgical image segmentation that accepts natural language descriptions. IR-SIS leverages a fine-tuned SAM3 for initial segmentation, employs a Vision-Language Model to detect instruments and assess segmentation quality, and applies an agentic workflow that adaptively selects refinement strategies. The system supports clinician-in-the-loop interaction through natural language feedback. We also construct a multi-granularity language-annotated dataset from EndoVis2017 and EndoVis2018 benchmarks. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and out-of-distribution data, with clinician interaction providing additional improvements. Our work establishes the first language-based surgical segmentation framework with adaptive self-refinement capabilities.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deployed graph neural networks (GNNs) are frozen at deployment yet must fit clean data, generalize under distribution shifts, and remain stable to perturbations. We show that static inference induces a fundamental tradeoff: improving stability requires reducing reliance on shift-sensitive features, leaving an irreducible worst-case generalization floor. Instance-conditional routing can break this ceiling, but is fragile because shifts can mislead routing and perturbations can make routing fluctuate. We capture these effects via two decompositions separating coverage vs selection, and base sensitivity vs fluctuation amplification. Based on these insights, we propose STEM-GNN, a pretrain-then-finetune framework with a mixture-of-experts encoder for diverse computation paths, a vector-quantized token interface to stabilize encoder-to-head signals, and a Lipschitz-regularized head to bound output amplification. Across nine node, link, and graph benchmarks, STEM-GNN achieves a stronger three-way balance, improving robustness to degree/homophily shifts and to feature/edge corruptions while remaining competitive on clean graphs.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion transformers typically incorporate textual information via attention layers and a modulation mechanism using a pooled text embedding. Nevertheless, recent approaches discard modulation-based text conditioning and rely exclusively on attention. In this paper, we address whether modulation-based text conditioning is necessary and whether it can provide any performance advantage. Our analysis shows that, in its conventional usage, the pooled embedding contributes little to overall performance, suggesting that attention alone is generally sufficient for faithfully propagating prompt information. However, we reveal that the pooled embedding can provide significant gains when used from a different perspective-serving as guidance and enabling controllable shifts toward more desirable properties. This approach is training-free, simple to implement, incurs negligible runtime overhead, and can be applied to various diffusion models, bringing improvements across diverse tasks, including text-to-image/video generation and image editing.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aims to provide transparent insights into machine learning models, yet the reliability of many feature attribution methods remains a critical challenge. Prior research (Haufe et al., 2014; Wilming et al., 2022, 2023) has demonstrated that these methods often erroneously assign significant importance to non-informative variables, such as suppressor variables, leading to fundamental misinterpretations. Since statistical suppression is induced by feature dependencies, this study investigates whether data whitening, a common preprocessing technique for decorrelation, can mitigate such errors. Using the established XAI-TRIS benchmark (Clark et al., 2024b), which offers synthetic ground-truth data and quantitative measures of explanation correctness, we empirically evaluate 16 popular feature attribution methods applied in combination with 5 distinct whitening transforms. Additionally, we analyze a minimal linear two-dimensional classification problem (Wilming et al., 2023) to theoretically assess whether whitening can remove the impact of suppressor features from Bayes-optimal models. Our results indicate that, while specific whitening techniques can improve explanation performance, the degree of improvement varies substantially across XAI methods and model architectures. These findings highlight the complex relationship between data non-linearities, preprocessing quality, and attribution fidelity, underscoring the vital role of pre-processing techniques in enhancing model interpretability.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>High-quality medical imaging datasets are essential for training deep learning models, but their unauthorized use raises serious copyright and ethical concerns. Medical imaging presents a unique challenge for existing dataset ownership verification methods designed for natural images, as static watermark patterns generated in fixed-scale images scale poorly dynamic and high-resolution scans with limited visual diversity and subtle anatomical structures, while preserving diagnostic quality. In this paper, we propose X-Mark, a sample-specific clean-label watermarking method for chest x-ray copyright protection. Specifically, X-Mark uses a conditional U-Net to generate unique perturbations within salient regions of each sample. We design a multi-component training objective to ensure watermark efficacy, robustness against dynamic scaling processes while preserving diagnostic quality and visual-distinguishability. We incorporate Laplacian regularization into our training objective to penalize high-frequency perturbations and achieve watermark scale-invariance. Ownership verification is performed in a black-box setting to detect characteristic behaviors in suspicious models. Extensive experiments on CheXpert verify the effectiveness of X-Mark, achieving WSR of 100% and reducing probability of false positives in Ind-M scenario by 12%, while demonstrating resistance to potential adaptive attacks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We explore the privacy-utility tradeoff of synthetic data generation schemes on tabular financial datasets, a domain characterized by high regulatory risk and severe class imbalance. We consider representative tabular data generators, including autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, diffusion, and copula synthesizers. To address the challenges of the financial domain, we provide novel privacy-preserving implementations of GAN and autoencoder synthesizers. We evaluate whether and how well the generators simultaneously achieve data quality, downstream utility, and privacy, with comparison across balanced and imbalanced input datasets. Our results offer insight into the distinct challenges of generating synthetic data from datasets that exhibit severe class imbalance and mixed-type attributes.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This work presents the largest curation of Southern Resident Killer Whale (SRKW) acoustic data to date, also containing other marine mammals in their environment. We systematically search all available public archival hydrophone data within the SRKW habitat (over 30 years of audio data). The search consists of a weakly-supervised, positive-unlabelled, active learning strategy to identify all instances of marine mammals. The resulting transformer-based detectors outperform state-of-the-art detectors on the DEEPAL, DCLDE-2026, and two newly introduced expert-annotated datasets in terms of accuracy, energy efficiency, and speed. The detection model has a specificity of 0-28.8% at 95% sensitivity. Our multiclass species classifier obtains a top-1 accuracy of 42.1% (11 train classes, 4 test classes) and our ecotype classifier obtains a top-1 accuracy of 43.0% (4 train classes, 5 test classes) on the DCLDE-2026 dataset. We yield 919 hours of SRKW data, 230 hours of Bigg's orca data, 1374 hours of orca data from unlabelled ecotypes, 1501 hours of humpback data, 88 hours of sea lion data, 246 hours of pacific white-sided dolphin data, and over 784 hours of unspecified marine mammal data. This SRKW dataset is larger than DCLDE-2026, Ocean Networks Canada, and OrcaSound combined. The curated species labels are available under CC-BY 4.0 license, and the corresponding audio data are available under the licenses of the original owners. The comprehensive nature of this dataset makes it suitable for unsupervised machine translation, habitat usage surveys, and conservation endeavours for this critically endangered ecotype.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Transformers leverage attention, the residual connection, and layer normalization to control the variance of token representations. We propose to modify attention into a Laplacian mechanism that gives the model more direct control over token variance. We conjecture that this helps transformers achieve the ideal token geometry. To investigate our conjecture, we first show that incorporating the Laplacian mechanism into transformers induces consistent improvements across benchmarks in computer vision and language. Next, we study how the Laplacian mechanism impacts the geometry of token representations using various tools: 1) principal component analysis, 2) cosine similarity metric, 3) analysis of variance, and 4) Neural Collapse metrics. Our investigation shows that the Laplacian mechanism reshapes token embeddings toward a geometry of maximal separability: tokens collapse according to their classes, and the class means exhibit Neural Collapse.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose a physics-informed consistency modeling framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) via fast, few-step generative inference. We identify a key stability challenge in physics-constrained consistency training, where PDE residuals can drive the model toward trivial or degenerate solutions, degrading the learned data distribution. To address this, we introduce a structure-preserving two-stage training strategy that decouples distribution learning from physics enforcement by freezing the coefficient decoder during physics-informed fine-tuning. We further propose a two-step residual objective that enforces physical consistency on refined, structurally valid generative trajectories rather than noisy single-step predictions. The resulting framework enables stable, high-fidelity inference for both unconditional generation and forward problems. We demonstrate that forward solutions can be obtained via a projection-based zero-shot inpainting procedure, achieving consistent accuracy of diffusion baselines with orders of magnitude reduction in computational cost.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>membership infer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Machine unlearning aims to remove the influence of a designated forget set from a trained model while preserving utility on the retained data. In modern deep networks, approximate unlearning frequently fails under large or adversarial deletions due to pronounced layer-wise heterogeneity: some layers exhibit stable, well-regularized representations while others are brittle, undertrained, or overfit, so naive update allocation can trigger catastrophic forgetting or unstable dynamics. We propose Statistical-Roughness Adaptive Gradient Unlearning (SRAGU), a mechanism-first unlearning algorithm that reallocates unlearning updates using layer-wise statistical roughness operationalized via heavy-tailed spectral diagnostics of layer weight matrices. Starting from an Adaptive Gradient Unlearning (AGU) sensitivity signal computed on the forget set, SRAGU estimates a WeightWatcher-style heavy-tailed exponent for each layer, maps it to a bounded spectral stability weight, and uses this stability signal to spectrally reweight the AGU sensitivities before applying the same minibatch update form. This concentrates unlearning motion in spectrally stable layers while damping updates in unstable or overfit layers, improving stability under hard deletions. We evaluate unlearning via behavioral alignment to a gold retrained reference model trained from scratch on the retained data, using empirical prediction-divergence and KL-to-gold proxies on a forget-focused query set; we additionally report membership inference auditing as a complementary leakage signal, treating forget-set points as should-be-forgotten members during evaluation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate transformative potential, yet their reasoning remains inconsistent and unreliable. Reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning is a key mechanism for improvement, but its effectiveness is fundamentally governed by reward design. Despite its importance, the relationship between reward modeling and core LLM challenges--such as evaluation bias, hallucination, distribution shift, and efficient learning--remains poorly understood. This work argues that reward modeling is not merely an implementation detail but a central architect of reasoning alignment, shaping what models learn, how they generalize, and whether their outputs can be trusted. We introduce Reasoning-Aligned Reinforcement Learning (RARL), a unifying framework that systematizes diverse reward paradigms for multi-step reasoning. Within this framework, we present a taxonomy of reward mechanisms, analyze reward hacking as a pervasive failure mode, and examine how reward signals unify challenges ranging from inference-time scaling to hallucination mitigation. We further critically evaluate existing benchmarks, highlighting vulnerabilities such as data contamination and reward misalignment, and outline directions for more robust evaluation. By integrating fragmented research threads and clarifying the interplay between reward design and fundamental reasoning capabilities, this work provides a foundational roadmap for building reasoning models that are robust, verifiable, and trustworthy.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, protect, robust, federate, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated sequential recommendation (FedSeqRec) aims to perform next-item prediction while keeping user data decentralised, yet model quality is frequently constrained by fragmented, noisy, and homogeneous interaction logs stored on individual devices. Many existing approaches attempt to compensate through manual data augmentation or additional server-side constraints, but these strategies either introduce limited semantic diversity or increase system overhead. To overcome these challenges, we propose \textbf{LUMOS}, a parameter-isolated FedSeqRec architecture that integrates large language models (LLMs) as \emph{local semantic generators}. Instead of sharing gradients or auxiliary parameters, LUMOS privately invokes an on-device LLM to construct three complementary sequence variants from each user history: (i) \emph{future-oriented} trajectories that infer plausible behavioural continuations, (ii) \emph{semantically equivalent rephrasings} that retain user intent while diversifying interaction patterns, and (iii) \emph{preference-inconsistent counterfactuals} that serve as informative negatives. These synthesized sequences are jointly encoded within the federated backbone through a tri-view contrastive optimisation scheme, enabling richer representation learning without exposing sensitive information. Experimental results across three public benchmarks show that LUMOS achieves consistent gains over competitive centralised and federated baselines on HR@20 and NDCG@20. In addition, the use of semantically grounded positive signals and counterfactual negatives improves robustness under noisy and adversarial environments, even without dedicated server-side protection modules. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of LLM-driven semantic generation as a new paradigm for advancing privacy-preserving federated recommendation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Utilizing Large Language Models (LLM) as chatbots in diverse business scenarios often presents the challenge of maintaining topic continuity. Abrupt shifts in topics can lead to poor user experiences and inefficient utilization of computational resources. In this paper, we present a topic continuity model aimed at assessing whether a response aligns with the initial conversation topic. Our model is built upon the expansion of the corresponding natural language understanding (NLU) model into quantifiable terms using a Naive Bayes approach. Subsequently, we have introduced an attention mechanism and logarithmic nonlinearity to enhance its capability to capture topic continuity. This approach allows us to convert the NLU model into an interpretable analytical formula. In contrast to many NLU models constrained by token limits, our proposed model can seamlessly handle conversations of any length with linear time complexity. Furthermore, the attention mechanism significantly improves the model's ability to identify topic continuity in complex conversations. According to our experiments, our model consistently outperforms traditional methods, particularly in handling lengthy and intricate conversations. This unique capability offers us an opportunity to ensure the responsible and interpretable use of LLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) based Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved superior performance, yet the massive memory overhead caused by storing multiple expert networks severely hinders their practical deployment. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)-based compression has emerged as a promising post-training technique; however, most existing methods apply uniform rank allocation or rely solely on static weight properties. This overlooks the substantial heterogeneity in expert utilization observed in MoE models, where frequent routing patterns and intrinsic information density vary significantly across experts. In this work, we propose RFID-MoE, an effective framework for MoE compression by exploiting heterogeneous Routing Frequency and Information Density. We first introduce a fused metric that combines expert activation frequency with effective rank to measure expert importance, adaptively allocating higher ranks to critical expert groups under a fixed budget. Moreover, instead of discarding compression residuals, we reconstruct them via a parameter-efficient sparse projection mechanism to recover lost information with minimal parameter overhead. Extensive experiments on representative MoE LLMs (e.g., Qwen3, DeepSeekMoE) across multiple compression ratios demonstrate that RFID-MoE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods like MoBE and D2-MoE. Notably, RFID-MoE achieves a perplexity of 16.92 on PTB with the Qwen3-30B model at a 60% compression ratio, reducing perplexity by over 8.0 compared to baselines, and improves zero-shot accuracy on HellaSwag by approximately 8%.</li>

To mitigate these limitations, we propose GAFRNet, a robust and interpretable Graph Attention and FuzzyRule Network specifically engineered for histopathology image classification with scarce supervision.

Extensive evaluations on three benchmark datasets (BreakHis, Mini-DDSM, and ICIAR2018) demonstrate that GAFR-Net consistently outperforms various state-of-the-art methods across multiple magnifications and classification tasks.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a cornerstone of knowledge-intensive applications, including enterprise chatbots, healthcare assistants, and agentic memory management. However, recent studies show that knowledge-extraction attacks can recover sensitive knowledge-base content through maliciously crafted queries, raising serious concerns about intellectual property theft and privacy leakage. While prior work has explored individual attack and defense techniques, the research landscape remains fragmented, spanning heterogeneous retrieval embeddings, diverse generation models, and evaluations based on non-standardized metrics and inconsistent datasets. To address this gap, we introduce the first systematic benchmark for knowledge-extraction attacks on RAG systems. Our benchmark covers a broad spectrum of attack and defense strategies, representative retrieval embedding models, and both open- and closed-source generators, all evaluated under a unified experimental framework with standardized protocols across multiple datasets. By consolidating the experimental landscape and enabling reproducible, comparable evaluation, this benchmark provides actionable insights and a practical foundation for developing privacy-preserving RAG systems in the face of emerging knowledge extraction threats.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep models based on vision transformer (ViT) and convolutional neural network (CNN) have demonstrated remarkable performance on natural datasets. However, these models may not be similar in medical imaging, where abnormal regions cover only a small portion of the image. This challenge motivates this study to investigate the latest deep models for bladder cancer classification tasks. We propose the following to evaluate these deep models: 1) standard classification using 13 models (four CNNs and eight transormer-based models), 2) calibration analysis to examine if these models are well calibrated for bladder cancer classification, and 3) we use GradCAM++ to evaluate the interpretability of these models for clinical diagnosis. We simulate $\sim 300$ experiments on a publicly multicenter bladder cancer dataset, and the experimental results demonstrate that the ConvNext series indicate limited generalization ability to classify bladder cancer images (e.g., $\sim 60\%$ accuracy). In addition, ViTs show better calibration effects compared to ConvNext and swin transformer series. We also involve test time augmentation to improve the models interpretability. Finally, no model provides a one-size-fits-all solution for a feasible interpretable model. ConvNext series are suitable for in-distribution samples, while ViT and its variants are suitable for interpreting out-of-distribution samples.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Quality benchmarks are essential for fairly and accurately tracking scientific progress and enabling practitioners to make informed methodological choices. Outlier detection (OD) on tabular data underpins numerous real-world applications, yet existing OD benchmarks remain limited. The prominent OD benchmark AdBench is the de facto standard in the literature, yet comprises only 57 datasets. In addition to other shortcomings discussed in this work, its small scale severely restricts diversity and statistical power. We introduce MacrOData, a large-scale benchmark suite for tabular OD comprising three carefully curated components: OddBench, with 790 datasets containing real-world semantic anomalies; OvrBench, with 856 datasets featuring real-world statistical outliers; and SynBench, with 800 synthetically generated datasets spanning diverse data priors and outlier archetypes. Owing to its scale and diversity, MacrOData enables comprehensive and statistically robust evaluation of tabular OD methods. Our benchmarks further satisfy several key desiderata: We provide standardized train/test splits for all datasets, public/private benchmark partitions with held-out test labels for the latter reserved toward an online leaderboard, and annotate our datasets with semantic metadata. We conduct extensive experiments across all benchmarks, evaluating a broad range of OD methods comprising classical, deep, and foundation models, over diverse hyperparameter configurations.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We study privacy amplification for BandMF, i.e., DP-SGD with correlated noise across iterations via a banded correlation matrix. We propose $b$-min-sep subsampling, a new subsampling scheme that generalizes Poisson and balls-in-bins subsampling, extends prior practical batching strategies for BandMF, and enables stronger privacy amplification than cyclic Poisson while preserving the structural properties needed for analysis. We give a near-exact privacy analysis using Monte Carlo accounting, based on a dynamic program that leverages the Markovian structure in the subsampling procedure. We show that $b$-min-sep matches cyclic Poisson subsampling in the high noise regime and achieves strictly better guarantees in the mid-to-low noise regime, with experimental results that bolster our claims. We further show that unlike previous BandMF subsampling schemes, our $b$-min-sep subsampling naturally extends to the multi-attribution user-level privacy setting.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative AI systems are increasingly embedded in everyday life, yet empirical understanding of how psychological risk associated with AI use emerges, is experienced, and is regulated by users remains limited. We present a large-scale computational thematic analysis of posts collected between 2023 and 2025 from two Reddit communities, r/AIDangers and r/ChatbotAddiction, explicitly focused on AI-related harm and distress. Using a multi-agent, LLM-assisted thematic analysis grounded in Braun and Clarke's reflexive framework, we identify 14 recurring thematic categories and synthesize them into five higher-order experiential dimensions. To further characterize affective patterns, we apply emotion labeling using a BERT-based classifier and visualize emotional profiles across dimensions. Our findings reveal five empirically derived experiential dimensions of AI-related psychological risk grounded in real-world user discourse, with self-regulation difficulties emerging as the most prevalent and fear concentrated in concerns related to autonomy, control, and technical risk. These results provide early empirical evidence from lived user experience of how AI safety is perceived and emotionally experienced outside laboratory or speculative contexts, offering a foundation for future AI safety research, evaluation, and responsible governance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This study examines the extent to which Large Language Models (LLMs) capture geographic lexical variation in Spanish, a language that exhibits substantial regional variation. Treating LLMs as virtual informants, we probe their dialectal knowledge using two survey-style question formats: Yes-No questions and multiple-choice questions. To this end, we exploited a large-scale, expert-curated database of Spanish lexical variation. Our evaluation covers more than 900 lexical items across 21 Spanish-speaking countries and is conducted at both the country and dialectal area levels. Across both evaluation formats, the results reveal systematic differences in how LLMs represent Spanish language varieties. Lexical variation associated with Spain, Equatorial Guinea, Mexico & Central America, and the La Plata River is recognized more accurately by the models, while the Chilean variety proves particularly difficult for the models to distinguish. Importantly, differences in the volume of country-level digital resources do not account for these performance patterns, suggesting that factors beyond data quantity shape dialectal representation in LLMs. By providing a fine-grained, large-scale evaluation of geographic lexical variation, this work advances empirical understanding of dialectal knowledge in LLMs and contributes new evidence to discussions of Digital Linguistic Bias in Spanish.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Participatory budgeting (PB) is a democratic paradigm for deciding the funding of public projects given the residents' preferences, which has been adopted in numerous cities across the world. The main focus of PB is designing rules, functions that return feasible budget allocations for a set of projects subject to some budget constraint. Designing PB rules that optimize both utility and fairness objectives based on agent preferences had been challenging due to the extensive domain knowledge required and the proven trade-off between the two notions. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly employed for automated algorithmic design. Given the resemblance of PB rules to algorithms for classical knapsack problems, in this paper, we introduce a novel framework, named LLMRule, that addresses the limitations of existing works by incorporating LLMs into an evolutionary search procedure for automating the design of PB rules. Our experimental results, evaluated on more than 600 real-world PB instances obtained from the U.S., Canada, Poland, and the Netherlands with different representations of agent preferences, demonstrate that the LLM-generated rules generally outperform existing handcrafted rules in terms of overall utility while still maintaining a similar degree of fairness.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>federate, interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Domain adaptation (DA) is a quickly expanding area in machine learning that involves adjusting a model trained in one domain to perform well in another domain. While there have been notable progressions, the fundamental concept of numerous DA methodologies has persisted: aligning the data from various domains into a shared feature space. In this space, knowledge acquired from labeled source data can improve the model training on target data that lacks sufficient labels. In this study, we demonstrate the use of 10 deep learning models to simulate common DA techniques and explore their application in four medical image datasets. We have considered various situations such as multi-modality, noisy data, federated learning (FL), interpretability analysis, and classifier calibration. The experimental results indicate that using DA with ResNet34 in a brain tumor (BT) data set results in an enhancement of 4.7\% in model performance. Similarly, the use of DA can reduce the impact of Gaussian noise, as it provides $\sim 3\%$ accuracy increase using ResNet34 on a BT dataset. Furthermore, simply introducing DA into FL framework shows limited potential (e.g., $\sim 0.3\%$ increase in performance) for skin cancer classification. In addition, the DA method can improve the interpretability of the models using the gradcam++ technique, which offers clinical values. Calibration analysis also demonstrates that using DA provides a lower expected calibration error (ECE) value $\sim 2\%$ compared to CNN alone on a multi-modality dataset.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Model agents demonstrate potential in solving real-world problems via tools, yet generalist intelligence is bottlenecked by scarce high-quality, long-horizon data. Existing methods collect privacy-constrained API logs or generate scripted interactions lacking diversity, which struggle to produce data requisite for scaling capabilities. We propose AgentSkiller, a fully automated framework synthesizing multi-turn interaction data across realistic, semantically linked domains. It employs a DAG-based architecture with explicit state transitions to ensure determinism and recoverability. The pipeline builds a domain ontology and Person-Centric Entity Graph, defines tool interfaces via Service Blueprints for Model Context Protocol servers, and populates environments with consistent databases and strict Domain Policies. A cross-domain fusion mechanism links services to simulate complex tasks. Finally, the pipeline creates user tasks by verifying solution paths, filtering via execution-based validation, and generating queries using a Persona-based Simulator for automated rollout. This produces reliable environments with clear state changes. To demonstrate effectiveness, we synthesized $\approx$ 11K interaction samples; experimental results indicate that models trained on this dataset achieve significant improvements on function calling over baselines, particularly in larger parameter regimes.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this work, we present AfriNLLB, a series of lightweight models for efficient translation from and into African languages. AfriNLLB supports 15 language pairs (30 translation directions), including Swahili, Hausa, Yoruba, Amharic, Somali, Zulu, Lingala, Afrikaans, Wolof, and Egyptian Arabic, as well as other African Union official languages such as Arabic (MSA), French, Portuguese, and Spanish. Our training data covers bidirectional translation between English and 13 languages, and between French and two languages (Lingala and Wolof). AfriNLLB models are based on NLLB-200 600M, which we compress using iterative layer pruning and quantization. We fine-tune the pruned models on parallel corpora we curated for African languages, employing knowledge distillation from a larger teacher model. Our work aims at enabling efficient deployment of translation models for African languages in resource-constrained settings. Our evaluation results demonstrate that AfriNLLB models achieve performance comparable to the baseline while being significantly faster. We release two versions of the AfriNLLB models, a Transformers version that allows further fine-tuning and a CTranslate2 version for efficient inference. Moreover, we release all the training data that we used for fine-tuning the baseline and pruned models to facilitate further research.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Semi-supervised learning relaxes the need of large pixel-wise labeled datasets for image segmentation by leveraging unlabeled data. The scarcity of high-quality labeled data remains a major challenge in medical image analysis due to the high annotation costs and the need for specialized clinical expertise. Semi-supervised learning has demonstrated significant potential in addressing this bottleneck, with pseudo-labeling and consistency regularization emerging as two predominant paradigms. Dual-task collaborative learning, an emerging consistency-aware paradigm, seeks to derive supplementary supervision by establishing prediction consistency between related tasks. However, current methodologies are limited to unidirectional interaction mechanisms (typically regression-to-segmentation), as segmentation results can only be transformed into regression outputs in an offline manner, thereby failing to fully exploit the potential benefits of online bidirectional cross-task collaboration. Thus, we propose a fully Differentiable Bidirectional Synergistic Learning (DBiSL) framework, which seamlessly integrates and enhances four critical SSL components: supervised learning, consistency regularization, pseudo-supervised learning, and uncertainty estimation. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate our method's state-of-the-art performance. Beyond technical contributions, this work provides new insights into unified SSL framework design and establishes a new architectural foundation for dual-task-driven SSL, while offering a generic multitask learning framework applicable to broader computer vision applications. The code will be released on github upon acceptance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>LLM-as-a-Judge has been widely adopted across various research and practical applications, yet the robustness and reliability of its evaluation remain a critical issue. A core challenge it faces is bias, which has primarily been studied in terms of known biases and their impact on evaluation outcomes, while automated and systematic exploration of potential unknown biases is still lacking. Nevertheless, such exploration is crucial for enhancing the robustness and reliability of evaluations. To bridge this gap, we propose BiasScope, a LLM-driven framework for automatically and at scale discovering potential biases that may arise during model evaluation. BiasScope can uncover potential biases across different model families and scales, with its generality and effectiveness validated on the JudgeBench dataset. It overcomes the limitations of existing approaches, transforming bias discovery from a passive process relying on manual effort and predefined bias lists into an active and comprehensive automated exploration. Moreover, based on BiasScope, we propose JudgeBench-Pro, an extended version of JudgeBench and a more challenging benchmark for evaluating the robustness of LLM-as-a-judge. Strikingly, even powerful LLMs as evaluators show error rates above 50\% on JudgeBench-Pro, underscoring the urgent need to strengthen evaluation robustness and to mitigate potential biases further.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Notwithstanding their unprecedented ability to generate text, LLMs do not understand the meaning of words, have no sense of context and cannot reason. Their output constitutes an approximation of statistically dominant word patterns. And yet, the drafting of contracts is often presented as a typical legal task that could be facilitated by this technology. This paper seeks to put an end to such unreasonable ideas. Predicting words differs from using language in the circumstances of specific transactions and reconstituting common contractual phrases differs from reasoning about the law. LLMs seem to be able to generate generic and superficially plausible contractual documents. In the cold light of day, such documents may turn out to be useless assemblages of inconsistent provisions or contracts that are enforceable but unsuitable for a given transaction. This paper casts a shadow on the simplistic assumption that LLMs threaten the continued viability of the legal industry.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multilingual pre-trained language models(mPLMs) offer significant benefits for many low-resource languages. To further expand the range of languages these models can support, many works focus on continued pre-training of these models. However, few works address how to extend mPLMs to low-resource languages that were previously unsupported. To tackle this issue, we expand the model's vocabulary using a target language corpus. We then screen out a subset from the model's original vocabulary, which is biased towards representing the source language(e.g. English), and utilize bilingual dictionaries to initialize the representations of the expanded vocabulary. Subsequently, we continue to pre-train the mPLMs using the target language corpus, based on the representations of these expanded vocabulary. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms the baseline, which uses randomly initialized expanded vocabulary for continued pre-training, in POS tagging and NER tasks, achieving improvements by 0.54% and 2.60%, respectively. Furthermore, our method demonstrates high robustness in selecting the training corpora, and the models' performance on the source language does not degrade after continued pre-training.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Today's business organizations need access control systems that can handle complex, changing security requirements that go beyond what traditional methods can manage. Current approaches, such as Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC), and Discretionary Access Control (DAC), were designed for specific purposes. They cannot effectively manage the dynamic, situation-dependent workflows that modern systems require. In this research, we introduce LLMAC, a new unified approach using Large Language Models (LLMs) to combine these different access control methods into one comprehensive, understandable system. We used an extensive synthetic dataset that represents complex real-world scenarios, including policies for ownership verification, version management, workflow processes, and dynamic role separation. Using Mistral 7B, our trained LLM model achieved outstanding results with 98.5% accuracy, significantly outperforming traditional methods (RBAC: 14.5%, ABAC: 58.5%, DAC: 27.5%) while providing clear, human readable explanations for each decision. Performance testing shows that the system can be practically deployed with reasonable response times and computing resources.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) seeks the minima with a flat loss landscape to improve the generalization performance in machine learning tasks, including fine-tuning. However, its extra parameter perturbation step doubles the computation cost, which becomes the bottleneck of SAM in the practical implementation. In this work, we propose an approach SL-SAM to break this bottleneck by introducing the sparse technique to layers. Our key innovation is to frame the dynamic selection of layers for both the gradient ascent (perturbation) and descent (update) steps as a multi-armed bandit problem. At the beginning of each iteration, SL-SAM samples a part of the layers of the model according to the gradient norm to participate in the backpropagation of the following parameter perturbation and update steps, thereby reducing the computation complexity. We then provide the analysis to guarantee the convergence of SL-SAM. In the experiments of fine-tuning models in several tasks, SL-SAM achieves the performances comparable to the state-of-the-art baselines, including a \#1 rank on LLM fine-tuning. Meanwhile, SL-SAM significantly reduces the ratio of active parameters in backpropagation compared to vanilla SAM (SL-SAM activates 47\%, 22\% and 21\% parameters on the vision, moderate and large language model respectively while vanilla SAM always activates 100\%), verifying the efficiency of our proposed algorithm.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid development of visual generative models raises the need for more scalable and human-aligned evaluation methods. While the crowdsourced Arena platforms offer human preference assessments by collecting human votes, they are costly and time-consuming, inherently limiting their scalability. Leveraging vision-language model (VLMs) as substitutes for manual judgments presents a promising solution. However, the inherent hallucinations and biases of VLMs hinder alignment with human preferences, thus compromising evaluation reliability. Additionally, the static evaluation approach lead to low efficiency. In this paper, we propose K-Sort Eval, a reliable and efficient VLM-based evaluation framework that integrates posterior correction and dynamic matching. Specifically, we curate a high-quality dataset from thousands of human votes in K-Sort Arena, with each instance containing the outputs and rankings of K models. When evaluating a new model, it undergoes (K+1)-wise free-for-all comparisons with existing models, and the VLM provide the rankings. To enhance alignment and reliability, we propose a posterior correction method, which adaptively corrects the posterior probability in Bayesian updating based on the consistency between the VLM prediction and human supervision. Moreover, we propose a dynamic matching strategy, which balances uncertainty and diversity to maximize the expected benefit of each comparison, thus ensuring more efficient evaluation. Extensive experiments show that K-Sort Eval delivers evaluation results consistent with K-Sort Arena, typically requiring fewer than 90 model runs, demonstrating both its efficiency and reliability.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Model merging aims to combine multiple fine-tuned models into a single multi-task model without access to training data. Existing task-vector merging methods such as TIES, TSV-M, and Iso-C/CTS differ in their aggregation rules but treat all layers nearly uniformly. This assumption overlooks the strong layer-wise heterogeneity in large vision transformers, where shallow layers are sensitive to interference while deeper layers encode stable task-specific features. We introduce LARV, a training-free, data-free, merger-agnostic Layer-wise Adaptive Rescaling Veneer that plugs into any task-vector merger and assigns a per-layer scale to each task vector before aggregation, and show it consistently boosts diverse merging rules. LARV adaptively suppresses shallow-layer interference and amplifies deeper-layer alignment using a simple deterministic schedule, requiring no retraining or modification to existing mergers. To our knowledge, this is the first work to perform layer-aware scaling for task-vector merging. LARV computes simple data-free layer proxies and turns them into scales through a lightweight rule; we study several instantiations within one framework (e.g., tiered two/three-level scaling with fixed values, or continuous mappings) and show that tiered choices offer the best robustness, while continuous mappings remain an ablation. LARV is orthogonal to the base merger and adds negligible cost. On FusionBench with Vision Transformers, LARV consistently improves all task-vector baselines across 8/14/20-task settings; for example, Iso-C + LARV reaches 85.9% on ViT-B/32, 89.2% on ViT-B/16, and 92.6% on ViT-L/14. Layerwise analysis and corruption tests further indicate that LARV suppresses shallow-layer interference while modestly amplifying deeper, task-stable features, turning model merging into a robust, layer-aware procedure rather than a uniform one.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the rapid development and uptake of large language models (LLMs) across high-stakes settings, it is increasingly important to ensure that LLMs behave in ways that align with human values. Existing moral benchmarks prompt LLMs with value statements, moral scenarios, or psychological questionnaires, with the implicit underlying assumption that LLMs report somewhat stable moral preferences. However, moral psychology research has shown that human moral judgements are sensitive to morally irrelevant situational factors, such as smelling cinnamon rolls or the level of ambient noise, thereby challenging moral theories that assume the stability of human moral judgements. Here, we draw inspiration from this "situationist" view of moral psychology to evaluate whether LLMs exhibit similar cognitive moral biases to humans. We curate a novel multimodal dataset of 60 "moral distractors" from existing psychological datasets of emotionally-valenced images and narratives which have no moral relevance to the situation presented. After injecting these distractors into existing moral benchmarks to measure their effects on LLM responses, we find that moral distractors can shift the moral judgements of LLMs by over 30% even in low-ambiguity scenarios, highlighting the need for more contextual moral evaluations and more nuanced cognitive moral modeling of LLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Discrete diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful class of generative models for chemistry and biology data. In these fields, the goal is to generate various samples with high rewards (e.g., drug-likeness in molecules), making reward-based guidance crucial. Most existing methods are based on guiding the diffusion model using intermediate rewards but tend to underperform since intermediate rewards are noisy due to the non-smooth nature of reward functions used in scientific domains. To address this, we propose Clean-Sample Markov Chain (CSMC) Sampler, a method that performs effective test-time reward-guided sampling for discrete diffusion models, enabling local search without relying on intermediate rewards. CSMC constructs a Markov chain of clean samples using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm such that its stationary distribution is the target distribution. We design a proposal distribution by sequentially applying the forward and backward diffusion processes, making the acceptance probability tractable. Experiments on molecule and biological sequence generation with various reward functions demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms prior approaches that rely on intermediate rewards.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, defense, attack, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive success across multimodal tasks, but their reliance on visual inputs exposes them to significant adversarial threats. Existing encoder-based attacks perturb the input image by optimizing solely on the vision encoder, rather than the entire LVLM, offering a computationally efficient alternative to end-to-end optimization. However, their transferability across different LVLM architectures in realistic black-box scenarios remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we present the first systematic study towards encoder-based adversarial transferability in LVLMs. Our contributions are threefold. First, through large-scale benchmarking over eight diverse LVLMs, we reveal that existing attacks exhibit severely limited transferability. Second, we perform in-depth analysis, disclosing two root causes that hinder the transferability: (1) inconsistent visual grounding across models, where different models focus their attention on distinct regions; (2) redundant semantic alignment within models, where a single object is dispersed across multiple overlapping token representations. Third, we propose Semantic-Guided Multimodal Attack (SGMA), a novel framework to enhance the transferability. Inspired by the discovered causes in our analysis, SGMA directs perturbations toward semantically critical regions and disrupts cross-modal grounding at both global and local levels. Extensive experiments across different victim models and tasks show that SGMA achieves higher transferability than existing attacks. These results expose critical security risks in LVLM deployment and underscore the urgent need for robust multimodal defenses.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Current one-pass 3D scene synthesis methods often suffer from spatial hallucinations, such as collisions, due to a lack of deliberative reasoning. To bridge this gap, we introduce SceneReVis, a vision-grounded self-reflection framework that employs an iterative ``diagnose-and-act'' loop to explicitly intercept and resolve spatial conflicts using multi-modal feedback. To support this step-wise paradigm, we construct SceneChain-12k, a large-scale dataset of causal construction trajectories derived through a novel reverse engineering pipeline. We further propose a two-stage training recipe that transitions from Supervised Fine-Tuning to Agentic Reinforcement Learning, evolving the model into an active spatial planner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SceneReVis achieves state-of-the-art performance in high-fidelity generation and goal-oriented optimization, with robust generalization to long-tail domains.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, protect, defense, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As artificial intelligence systems evolve from passive assistants into autonomous agents capable of executing consequential actions, the security boundary shifts from model outputs to tool execution. Traditional security paradigms - log aggregation, perimeter defense, and post-hoc forensics - cannot protect systems where AI-driven actions are irreversible, execute at machine speed, and originate from potentially compromised orchestration layers. This paper introduces Autonomous Action Runtime Management (AARM), an open specification for securing AI-driven actions at runtime. AARM defines a runtime security system that intercepts actions before execution, accumulates session context, evaluates against policy and intent alignment, enforces authorization decisions, and records tamper-evident receipts for forensic reconstruction. We formalize a threat model addressing prompt injection, confused deputy attacks, data exfiltration, and intent drift. We introduce an action classification framework distinguishing forbidden, context-dependent deny, and context-dependent allow actions. We propose four implementation architectures - protocol gateway, SDK instrumentation, kernel eBPF, and vendor integration - with distinct trust properties, and specify minimum conformance requirements for AARM-compliant systems. AARM is model-agnostic, framework-agnostic, and vendor-neutral, treating action execution as the stable security boundary. This specification aims to establish industry-wide requirements before proprietary fragmentation forecloses interoperability.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, protect, attack, robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Protecting the intellectual property of large language models (LLMs) is a critical challenge due to the proliferation of unauthorized derivative models. We introduce a novel fingerprinting framework that leverages the behavioral patterns induced by safety alignment, applying the concept of refusal vectors for LLM provenance tracking. These vectors, extracted from directional patterns in a model's internal representations when processing harmful versus harmless prompts, serve as robust behavioral fingerprints. Our contribution lies in developing a fingerprinting system around this concept and conducting extensive validation of its effectiveness for IP protection. We demonstrate that these behavioral fingerprints are highly robust against common modifications, including finetunes, merges, and quantization. Our experiments show that the fingerprint is unique to each model family, with low cosine similarity between independently trained models. In a large-scale identification task across 76 offspring models, our method achieves 100\% accuracy in identifying the correct base model family. Furthermore, we analyze the fingerprint's behavior under alignment-breaking attacks, finding that while performance degrades significantly, detectable traces remain. Finally, we propose a theoretical framework to transform this private fingerprint into a publicly verifiable, privacy-preserving artifact using locality-sensitive hashing and zero-knowledge proofs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the growing interest in foundation models for brain signals, graph-based pretraining has emerged as a promising paradigm for learning transferable representations from connectome data. However, existing contrastive and masked autoencoder methods typically rely on naive random dropping or masking for augmentation, which is ill-suited for brain graphs and hypergraphs as it disrupts semantically meaningful connectivity patterns. Moreover, commonly used graph-level readout and reconstruction schemes fail to capture global structural information, limiting the robustness of learned representations. In this work, we propose a unified diffusion-based pretraining framework that addresses both limitations. First, diffusion is designed to guide structure-aware dropping and masking strategies, preserving brain graph semantics while maintaining effective pretraining diversity. Second, diffusion enables topology-aware graph-level readout and node-level global reconstruction by allowing graph embeddings and masked nodes to aggregate information from globally related regions. Extensive experiments across multiple neuroimaging datasets with over 25,000 subjects and 60,000 scans involving various mental disorders and brain atlases demonstrate consistent performance improvements.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Self-Consistency (SC) is an effective decoding strategy that improves the reasoning performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) by generating multiple chain-of-thought reasoning paths and selecting the final answer via majority voting. However, it suffers from substantial inference costs because it requires a large number of samples. To mitigate this issue, Difficulty-Adaptive Self-Consistency (DSC) was proposed to reduce unnecessary token usage for easy problems by adjusting the number of samples according to problem difficulty. However, DSC requires additional model calls and pre-sampling to estimate difficulty, and this process is repeated when applying to each dataset, leading to significant computational overhead. In this work, we propose Activation-Informed Difficulty-Aware Self-Consistency (ACTSC) to address these limitations. ACTSC leverages internal difficulty signals reflected in the feed-forward network neuron activations to construct a lightweight difficulty estimation probe, without any additional token generation or model calls. The probe dynamically adjusts the number of samples for SC and can be applied to new datasets without requiring pre-sampling for difficulty estimation. To validate its effectiveness, we conduct experiments on five benchmarks. Experimental results show that ACTSC effectively reduces inference costs while maintaining accuracy relative to existing methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>High-quality and open datasets remain a major bottleneck for text-to-image (T2I) fine-tuning. Despite rapid progress in model architectures and training pipelines, most publicly available fine-tuning datasets suffer from low resolution, poor text-image alignment, or limited diversity, resulting in a clear performance gap between open research models and enterprise-grade models. In this work, we present Fine-T2I, a large-scale, high-quality, and fully open dataset for T2I fine-tuning. Fine-T2I spans 10 task combinations, 32 prompt categories, 11 visual styles, and 5 prompt templates, and combines synthetic images generated by strong modern models with carefully curated real images from professional photographers. All samples are rigorously filtered for text-image alignment, visual fidelity, and prompt quality, with over 95% of initial candidates removed. The final dataset contains over 6 million text-image pairs, around 2 TB on disk, approaching the scale of pretraining datasets while maintaining fine-tuning-level quality. Across a diverse set of pretrained diffusion and autoregressive models, fine-tuning on Fine-T2I consistently improves both generation quality and instruction adherence, as validated by human evaluation, visual comparison, and automatic metrics. We release Fine-T2I under an open license to help close the data gap in T2I fine-tuning in the open community.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair, generative, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Social biases inherent in large language models (LLMs) raise significant fairness concerns. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures, which retrieve external knowledge sources to enhance the generative capabilities of LLMs, remain susceptible to the same bias-related challenges. This work focuses on evaluating and understanding the social bias implications of RAG. Through extensive experiments across various retrieval corpora, LLMs, and bias evaluation datasets, encompassing more than 13 different bias types, we surprisingly observe a reduction in bias in RAG. This suggests that the inclusion of external context can help counteract stereotype-driven predictions, potentially improving fairness by diversifying the contextual grounding of the model's outputs. To better understand this phenomenon, we then explore the model's reasoning process by integrating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting into RAG while assessing the faithfulness of the model's CoT. Our experiments reveal that the model's bias inclinations shift between stereotype and anti-stereotype responses as more contextual information is incorporated from the retrieved documents. Interestingly, we find that while CoT enhances accuracy, contrary to the bias reduction observed with RAG, it increases overall bias across datasets, highlighting the need for bias-aware reasoning frameworks that can mitigate this trade-off.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multicultural settings; however, systematic evaluation of cultural specificity at the sentence level remains underexplored. We propose the Conceptual Cultural Index (CCI), which estimates cultural specificity at the sentence level. CCI is defined as the difference between the generality estimate within the target culture and the average generality estimate across other cultures. This formulation enables users to operationally control the scope of culture via comparison settings and provides interpretability, since the score derives from the underlying generality estimates. We validate CCI on 400 sentences (200 culture-specific and 200 general), and the resulting score distribution exhibits the anticipated pattern: higher for culture-specific sentences and lower for general ones. For binary separability, CCI outperforms direct LLM scoring, yielding more than a 10-point improvement in AUC for models specialized to the target culture.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances have reformulated diffusion models as deterministic ordinary differential equations (ODEs) through the framework of flow matching, providing a unified formulation for the noise-to-data generative process. Various training-free flow matching approaches have been developed to improve image generation through flow velocity field adjustment, eliminating the need for costly retraining. However, Modifying the velocity field $v$ introduces errors that propagate through the full generation path, whereas adjustments to the latent trajectory $z$ are naturally corrected by the pretrained velocity network, reducing error accumulation. In this paper, we propose two complementary training-free latent-trajectory adjustment approaches based on future and past velocity $v$ and latent trajectory $z$ information that refine the generative path directly in latent space. We propose two training-free trajectory smoothing schemes: \emph{Look-Ahead}, which averages the current and next-step latents using a curvature-gated weight, and \emph{Look-Back}, which smoothes latents using an exponential moving average with decay. We demonstrate through extensive experiments and comprehensive evaluation metrics that the proposed training-free trajectory smoothing models substantially outperform various state-of-the-art models across multiple datasets including COCO17, CUB-200, and Flickr30K.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Increasing penetration of inverter-based resources, flexible loads, and rapidly changing operating conditions make higher-order $N\!-\!k$ contingency assessment increasingly important but computationally prohibitive. Exhaustive evaluation of all outage combinations using AC power-flow or ACOPF is infeasible in routine operation. This fact forces operators to rely on heuristic screening methods whose ability to consistently retain all critical contingencies is not formally established. This paper proposes a scalable, state-aware contingency inference framework designed to directly generate high-impact $N\!-\!k$ outage scenarios without enumerating the combinatorial contingency space. The framework employs a conditional diffusion model to produce candidate contingencies tailored to the current operating state, while a topology-aware graph neural network trained only on base and $N\!-\!1$ cases efficiently constructs high-risk training samples offline. Finally, the framework is developed to provide controllable coverage guarantees for severe contingencies, allowing operators to explicitly manage the risk of missing critical events under limited AC power-flow evaluation budgets. Experiments on IEEE benchmark systems show that, for a given evaluation budget, the proposed approach consistently evaluates higher-severity contingencies than uniform sampling. This allows critical outages to be identified more reliably with reduced computational effort.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Extracting drug use information from unstructured Electronic Health Records remains a major challenge in clinical Natural Language Processing. While Large Language Models demonstrate advancements, their use in clinical NLP is limited by concerns over trust, control, and efficiency. To address this, we present NOWJ submission to the ToxHabits Shared Task at BioCreative IX. This task targets the detection of toxic substance use and contextual attributes in Spanish clinical texts, a domain-specific, low-resource setting. We propose a multi-output ensemble system tackling both Subtask 1 - ToxNER and Subtask 2 - ToxUse. Our system integrates BETO with a CRF layer for sequence labeling, employs diverse training strategies, and uses sentence filtering to boost precision. Our top run achieved 0.94 F1 and 0.97 precision for Trigger Detection, and 0.91 F1 for Argument Detection.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Synthetic data provide low-cost, accurately annotated samples for geometry-sensitive vision tasks, but appearance and imaging differences between synthetic and real domains cause severe domain shift and degrade downstream performance. Unpaired synthetic-to-real translation can reduce this gap without paired supervision, yet existing methods often face a trade-off between photorealism and structural stability: unconstrained generation may introduce deformation or spurious textures, while overly rigid constraints limit adaptation to real-domain statistics. We propose FD-DB, a frequency-decoupled dual-branch model that separates appearance transfer into low-frequency interpretable editing and high-frequency residual compensation. The interpretable branch predicts physically meaningful editing parameters (white balance, exposure, contrast, saturation, blur, and grain) to build a stable low-frequency appearance base with strong content preservation. The free branch complements fine details through residual generation, and a gated fusion mechanism combines the two branches under explicit frequency constraints to limit low-frequency drift. We further adopt a two-stage training schedule that first stabilizes the editing branch and then releases the residual branch to improve optimization stability. Experiments on the YCB-V dataset show that FD-DB improves real-domain appearance consistency and significantly boosts downstream semantic segmentation performance while preserving geometric and semantic structures.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate impressive cross-modal capabilities, yet their substantial size poses significant deployment challenges. Knowledge distillation (KD) is a promising solution for compressing these models, but existing methods primarily rely on static next-token alignment, neglecting the dynamic token interactions, which embed essential capabilities for multimodal understanding and generation. To this end, we introduce Align-TI, a novel KD framework designed from the perspective of Token Interactions. Our approach is motivated by the insight that MLLMs rely on two primary interactions: vision-instruction token interactions to extract relevant visual information, and intra-response token interactions for coherent generation. Accordingly, Align-TI introduces two components: IVA enables the student model to imitate the teacher's instruction-relevant visual information extract capability by aligning on salient visual regions. TPA captures the teacher's dynamic generative logic by aligning the sequential token-to-token transition probabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate Align-TI's superiority. Notably, our approach achieves $2.6\%$ relative improvement over Vanilla KD, and our distilled Align-TI-2B even outperforms LLaVA-1.5-7B (a much larger MLLM) by $7.0\%$, establishing a new state-of-the-art distillation framework for training parameter-efficient MLLMs. Code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to generating fluent yet factually incorrect text-a phenomenon known as hallucinations, undermining their reliability and utility in downstream tasks. We hypothesize that a generated text span's factuality is correlated with its representational instability across the model's internal layers. Based on this, we propose the CoCoA (Confusion and Consistency Aware) decoder, a novel, training-free decoding algorithm that mitigates hallucinations at inference time by listening to these signals in the middle layers. We propose two metrics to quantify this instability in the middle layers, and use it to penalize outputs that exhibit high internal confusion, thereby steering the model towards more internally consistent and factually grounded outputs. We further propose a self-information gated variant, CoCoA-SIG, that dynamically modulates this penalty to selectively target high-surprise, unstable generations. Extensive experiments on diverse tasks, including question-answering, summarization and code generation demonstrate that CoCoA significantly improves factual correctness across multiple model families (e.g., Llama-3, Qwen-2.5, Mistral). By leveraging model-intrinsic signals, CoCoA offers an effective and broadly applicable method for enhancing the trustworthiness of LLMs at inference time, without requiring any model retraining.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Reaction-diffusion (RD) equations underpin pattern formation across chemistry, biology, and physics, yet learning stable operators that forecast their long-term dynamics from data remains challenging. Neural-operator surrogates provide resolution-robust prediction, but autoregressive rollouts can drift due to the accumulation of error, and out-of-distribution (OOD) initial conditions often degrade accuracy. Physics-based numerical residual objectives can regularize operator learning, although they introduce additional assumptions, sensitivity to discretization and loss design, and higher training cost. Here we develop a purely data-driven operator learner with adaptive recurrent training (DDOL-ART) using a robust recurrent strategy with lightweight validation milestones that early-exit unproductive rollout segments and redirect optimization. Trained only on a single in-distribution toroidal Gaussian family over short horizons, DDOL-ART learns one-step operators that remain stable under long rollouts and generalize zero-shot to strong morphology shifts across FitzHugh-Nagumo (FN), Gray-Scott (GS), and Lambda-Omega (LO) systems. Across these benchmarks, DDOL-ART delivers a strong accuracy and cost trade-off. It is several-fold faster than a physics-based numerical-loss operator learner (NLOL) under matched settings, and it remains competitive on both in-distribution stability and OOD robustness. Training-dynamics diagnostics show that adaptivity strengthens the correlation between validation error and OOD test error performance, acting as a feedback controller that limits optimization drift. Our results indicate that feedback-controlled recurrent training of DDOL-ART generates robust flow-map surrogates without PDE residuals, while simultaneously maintaining competitiveness with NLOL at significantly reduced training costs.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a standard approach for fine-tuning large language models, yet its many variants report conflicting empirical gains, often on the same benchmarks. We show that these contradictions arise from a single overlooked factor: the batch size. When properly tuned, vanilla LoRA often matches the performance of more complex variants. We further propose a proxy-based, cost-efficient strategy for batch size tuning, revealing the impact of rank, dataset size, and model capacity on the optimal batch size. Our findings elevate batch size from a minor implementation detail to a first-order design parameter, reconciling prior inconsistencies and enabling more reliable evaluations of LoRA variants.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>protect, extraction, watermark, diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Watermarking is an important mechanism for provenance and copyright protection of diffusion-generated images. Training-free methods, exemplified by Gaussian Shading, embed watermarks into the initial noise of diffusion models with negligible impact on the quality of generated images. However, extracting this type of watermark typically requires multi-step diffusion inversion to obtain precise initial noise, which is computationally expensive and time-consuming. To address this issue, we propose One-step Inversion (OSI), a significantly faster and more accurate method for extracting Gaussian Shading style watermarks. OSI reformulates watermark extraction as a learnable sign classification problem, which eliminates the need for precise regression of the initial noise. Then, we initialize the OSI model from the diffusion backbone and finetune it on synthesized noise-image pairs with a sign classification objective. In this manner, the OSI model is able to accomplish the watermark extraction efficiently in only one step. Our OSI substantially outperforms the multi-step diffusion inversion method: it is 20x faster, achieves higher extraction accuracy, and doubles the watermark payload capacity. Extensive experiments across diverse schedulers, diffusion backbones, and cryptographic schemes consistently show improvements, demonstrating the generality of our OSI framework.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We study the computational relationship between replicability (Impagliazzo et al. [STOC `22], Ghazi et al. [NeurIPS `21]) and other stability notions. Specifically, we focus on replicable PAC learning and its connections to differential privacy (Dwork et al. [TCC 2006]) and to the statistical query (SQ) model (Kearns [JACM `98]). Statistically, it was known that differentially private learning and replicable learning are equivalent and strictly more powerful than SQ-learning. Yet, computationally, all previously known efficient (i.e., polynomial-time) replicable learning algorithms were confined to SQ-learnable tasks or restricted distributions, in contrast to differentially private learning. Our main contribution is the first computationally efficient replicable algorithm for realizable learning of parities over arbitrary distributions, a task that is known to be hard in the SQ-model, but possible under differential privacy. This result provides the first evidence that efficient replicable learning over general distributions strictly extends efficient SQ-learning, and is closer in power to efficient differentially private learning, despite computational separations between replicability and privacy. Our main building block is a new, efficient, and replicable algorithm that, given a set of vectors, outputs a subspace of their linear span that covers most of them.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Masked Diffusion Language Models (MDLMs) generate text by iteratively filling masked tokens, requiring two coupled decisions at each step: which positions to unmask (where-to-unmask) and which tokens to place (what-to-unmask). While standard MDLM training directly optimizes token prediction (what-to-unmask), inference-time unmasking orders (where-to-unmask) are typically determined by heuristic confidence measures or trained through reinforcement learning with costly on-policy rollouts. To address this, we introduce Gt-Margin, a position-wise score derived from ground-truth tokens, defined as the probability margin between the correct token and its strongest alternative. Gt-Margin yields an oracle unmasking order that prioritizes easier positions first under each partially masked state. We demonstrate that leveraging this oracle unmasking order significantly enhances final generation quality, particularly on logical reasoning benchmarks. Building on this insight, we train a supervised unmasking planner via learning-to-rank to imitate the oracle ordering from masked contexts. The resulting planner integrates into standard MDLM sampling to select where-to-unmask, improving reasoning accuracy without modifying the token prediction model.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multimodal representation learning aims to construct a shared embedding space in which heterogeneous modalities are semantically aligned. Despite strong empirical results, InfoNCE-based objectives introduce inherent conflicts that yield distribution gaps across modalities. In this work, we identify two conflicts in the multimodal regime, both exacerbated as the number of modalities increases: (i) an alignment-uniformity conflict, whereby the repulsion of uniformity undermines pairwise alignment, and (ii) an intra-alignment conflict, where aligning multiple modalities induces competing alignment directions. To address these issues, we propose a principled decoupling of alignment and uniformity for multimodal representations, providing a conflict-free recipe for multimodal learning that simultaneously supports discriminative and generative use cases without task-specific modules. We then provide a theoretical guarantee that our method acts as an efficient proxy for a global Hölder divergence over multiple modality distributions, and thus reduces the distribution gap among modalities. Extensive experiments on retrieval and UnCLIP-style generation demonstrate consistent gains.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose AdaDS, a generalizable framework for depth super-resolution that robustly recovers high-resolution depth maps from arbitrarily degraded low-resolution inputs. Unlike conventional approaches that directly regress depth values and often exhibit artifacts under severe or unknown degradation, AdaDS capitalizes on the contraction property of Gaussian smoothing: as noise accumulates in the forward process, distributional discrepancies between degraded inputs and their pristine high-quality counterparts diminish, ultimately converging to isotropic Gaussian prior. Leveraging this, AdaDS adaptively selects a starting timestep in the reverse diffusion trajectory based on estimated refinement uncertainty, and subsequently injects tailored noise to position the intermediate sample within the high-probability region of the target posterior distribution. This strategy ensures inherent robustness, enabling generative prior of a pre-trained diffusion model to dominate recovery even when upstream estimations are imperfect. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic benchmarks demonstrate AdaDS's superior zero-shot generalization and resilience to diverse degradation patterns compared to state-of-the-art methods.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Long-horizon planning is widely recognized as a core capability of autonomous LLM-based agents; however, current evaluation frameworks suffer from being largely episodic, domain-specific, or insufficiently grounded in persistent economic dynamics. We introduce EcoGym, a generalizable benchmark for continuous plan-and-execute decision making in interactive economies. EcoGym comprises three diverse environments: Vending, Freelance, and Operation, implemented in a unified decision-making process with standardized interfaces, and budgeted actions over an effectively unbounded horizon (1000+ steps if 365 day-loops for evaluation). The evaluation of EcoGym is based on business-relevant outcomes (e.g., net worth, income, and DAU), targeting long-term strategic coherence and robustness under partial observability and stochasticity. Experiments across eleven leading LLMs expose a systematic tension: no single model dominates across all three scenarios. Critically, we find that models exhibit significant suboptimality in either high-level strategies or efficient actions executions. EcoGym is released as an open, extensible testbed for transparent long-horizon agent evaluation and for studying controllability-utility trade-offs in realistic economic settings.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper presents an Internet of Things (IoT) application that utilizes an AI classifier for fast-object detection using the frame difference method. This method, with its shorter duration, is the most efficient and suitable for fast-object detection in IoT systems, which require energy-efficient applications compared to end-to-end methods. We have implemented this technique on three edge devices: AMD AlveoT M U50, Jetson Orin Nano, and Hailo-8T M AI Accelerator, and four models with artificial neural networks and transformer models. We examined various classes, including birds, cars, trains, and airplanes. Using the frame difference method, the MobileNet model consistently has high accuracy, low latency, and is highly energy-efficient. YOLOX consistently shows the lowest accuracy, lowest latency, and lowest efficiency. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has improved the average accuracy gain by 28.314%, the average efficiency gain by 3.6 times, and the average latency reduction by 39.305% compared to the end-to-end method. Of all these classes, the faster objects are trains and airplanes. Experiments show that the accuracy percentage for trains and airplanes is lower than other categories. So, in tasks that require fast detection and accurate results, end-to-end methods can be a disaster because they cannot handle fast object detection. To improve computational efficiency, we designed our proposed method as a lightweight detection algorithm. It is well suited for applications in IoT systems, especially those that require fast-moving object detection and higher accuracy.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex tasks by employing search-augmented reasoning to incorporate external knowledge into long chains of thought. However, we identify a critical yet underexplored bottleneck in this paradigm, termed Knowledge Integration Decay (KID). Specifically, we observe that as the length of reasoning generated before search grows, models increasingly fail to integrate retrieved evidence into subsequent reasoning steps, limiting performance even when relevant information is available. To address this, we propose Self-Anchored Knowledge Encoding (SAKE), a training-free inference-time strategy designed to stabilize knowledge utilization. By anchoring retrieved knowledge at both the beginning and end of the reasoning process, SAKE prevents it from being overshadowed by prior context, thereby preserving its semantic integrity. Extensive experiments on multi-hop QA and complex reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that SAKE significantly mitigates KID and improves performance, offering a lightweight yet effective solution for knowledge integration in agentic LLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Analyzing animal and human behavior has long been a challenging task in computer vision. Early approaches from the 1970s to the 1990s relied on hand-crafted edge detection, segmentation, and low-level features such as color, shape, and texture to locate objects and infer their identities-an inherently ill-posed problem. Behavior analysis in this era typically proceeded by tracking identified objects over time and modeling their trajectories using sparse feature points, which further limited robustness and generalization. A major shift occurred with the introduction of ImageNet by Deng and Li in 2010, which enabled large-scale visual recognition through deep neural networks and effectively served as a comprehensive visual dictionary. This development allowed object recognition to move beyond complex low-level processing toward learned high-level representations. In this work, we follow this paradigm to build a large-scale Universal Action Space (UAS) using existing labeled human-action datasets. We then use this UAS as the foundation for analyzing and categorizing mammalian and chimpanzee behavior datasets. The source code is released on GitHub at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The Rashomon set captures the collection of models that achieve near-identical empirical performance yet may differ substantially in their decision boundaries. Understanding the differences among these models, i.e., their multiplicity, is recognized as a crucial step toward model transparency, fairness, and robustness, as it reveals decision boundaries instabilities that standard metrics obscure. However, the existing definitions of Rashomon set and multiplicity metrics assume centralized learning and do not extend naturally to decentralized, multi-party settings like Federated Learning (FL). In FL, multiple clients collaboratively train models under a central server's coordination without sharing raw data, which preserves privacy but introduces challenges from heterogeneous client data distribution and communication constraints. In this setting, the choice of a single best model may homogenize predictive behavior across diverse clients, amplify biases, or undermine fairness guarantees. In this work, we provide the first formalization of Rashomon sets in this http URL, we adapt the Rashomon set definition to FL, distinguishing among three perspectives: (I) a global Rashomon set defined over aggregated statistics across all clients, (II) a t-agreement Rashomon set representing the intersection of local Rashomon sets across a fraction t of clients, and (III) individual Rashomon sets specific to each client's local this http URL, we show how standard multiplicity metrics can be estimated under FL's privacy constraints. Finally, we introduce a multiplicity-aware FL pipeline and conduct an empirical study on standard FL benchmark datasets. Our results demonstrate that all three proposed federated Rashomon set definitions offer valuable insights, enabling clients to deploy models that better align with their local data, fairness considerations, and practical requirements.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present Singpath-VL, a vision-language large model, to fill the vacancy of AI assistant in cervical cytology. Recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have significantly propelled the field of computational pathology. However, their application in cytopathology, particularly cervical cytology, remains underexplored, primarily due to the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality annotated datasets. To bridge this gap, we first develop a novel three-stage pipeline to synthesize a million-scale image-description dataset. The pipeline leverages multiple general-purpose MLLMs as weak annotators, refines their outputs through consensus fusion and expert knowledge injection, and produces high-fidelity descriptions of cell morphology. Using this dataset, we then fine-tune the Qwen3-VL-4B model via a multi-stage strategy to create a specialized cytopathology MLLM. The resulting model, named Singpath-VL, demonstrates superior performance in fine-grained morphological perception and cell-level diagnostic classification. To advance the field, we will open-source a portion of the synthetic dataset and benchmark.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved significant success across various domains. However, their use in high-stakes fields like healthcare remains limited due to persistent hallucinations, where generated text contradicts or ignores visual input. We contend that MLLMs can comprehend images but struggle to produce accurate token sequences. Minor perturbations can shift attention from truthful to untruthful states, and the autoregressive nature of text generation often prevents error correction. To address this, we propose SchröMind-a novel framework reducing hallucinations via solving the Schrödinger bridge problem. It establishes a token-level mapping between hallucinatory and truthful activations with minimal transport cost through lightweight training, while preserving the model's original capabilities. Extensive experiments on the POPE and MME benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of Schrödinger, which achieves state-of-the-art performance while introducing only minimal computational overhead.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Automated change detection in remote sensing imagery is critical for urban management, environmental monitoring, and disaster assessment. While deep learning models have advanced this field, they often struggle with challenges like low sensitivity to small objects and high computational costs. This paper presents SCA-Net, an enhanced architecture built upon the Change-Agent framework for precise building and road change detection in bi-temporal images. Our model incorporates several key innovations: a novel Difference Pyramid Block for multi-scale change analysis, an Adaptive Multi-scale Processing module combining shape-aware and high-resolution enhancement blocks, and multi-level attention mechanisms (PPM and CSAGate) for joint contextual and detail processing. Furthermore, a dynamic composite loss function and a four-phase training strategy are introduced to stabilize training and accelerate convergence. Comprehensive evaluations on the LEVIR-CD and LEVIR-MCI datasets demonstrate SCA-Net's superior performance over Change-Agent and other state-of-the-art methods. Our approach achieves a significant 2.64% improvement in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) on LEVIR-MCI and a remarkable 57.9% increase in IoU for small buildings, while reducing the training time by 61%. This work provides an efficient, accurate, and robust solution for practical change detection applications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Realistic talking-head video generation is critical for virtual avatars, film production, and interactive systems. Current methods struggle with nuanced emotional expressions due to the lack of fine-grained emotion control. To address this issue, we introduce a novel two-stage method (AUHead) to disentangle fine-grained emotion control, i.e. , Action Units (AUs), from audio and achieve controllable generation. In the first stage, we explore the AU generation abilities of large audio-language models (ALMs), by spatial-temporal AU tokenization and an "emotion-then-AU" chain-of-thought mechanism. It aims to disentangle AUs from raw speech, effectively capturing subtle emotional cues. In the second stage, we propose an AU-driven controllable diffusion model that synthesizes realistic talking-head videos conditioned on AU sequences. Specifically, we first map the AU sequences into the structured 2D facial representation to enhance spatial fidelity, and then model the AU-vision interaction within cross-attention modules. To achieve flexible AU-quality trade-off control, we introduce an AU disentanglement guidance strategy during inference, further refining the emotional expressiveness and identity consistency of the generated videos. Results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive performance in emotional realism, accurate lip synchronization, and visual coherence, significantly surpassing existing techniques.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multi-objective alignment aims to align LLM responses with multiple human preference objectives. Among existing methods, guiding the generation of frozen LLMs through autoregressive reward models (ARMs) to accomplish multi-objective test-time alignment is a low-cost solution. However, these methods typically rely on independent parameters for each preference objective, either by training ARMs independently across preference dimensions, which neglects interactions among preference features, or by training a single ARM with separate feature extraction modules for each preference, which can cause feature entanglement. Both strategies can result in misalignment between generated outputs and user preferences. To address this limitation, we propose Preference-Modulated \& Shared Low-Rank Adaptation (MoSLoRA) for ARM training, which first extracts shared features via a preference-agnostic module and then applies affine transformations to shared features via a preference modulation module conditioned on mixed preference vectors. This design mitigates feature entanglement and enables precise control over preference trade-offs during inference. Building on this, we introduce the Unified Autoregressive Reward Model (UniARM), a novel framework for multi-objective test-time alignment. UniARM jointly models all preference dimensions in a single parameter space, eliminating the need for independent parameters for each preference objective. es on larger-scale LLMs, enhancing its practical usability.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Rapid progress in large vision-language models (LVLMs) has achieved unprecedented performance in vision-language tasks. However, due to the strong prior of large language models (LLMs) and misaligned attention across modalities, LVLMs often generate outputs inconsistent with visual content - termed hallucination. To address this, we propose \textbf{Scalpel}, a method that reduces hallucination by refining attention activation distributions toward more credible regions. Scalpel predicts trusted attention directions for each head in Transformer layers during inference and adjusts activations accordingly. It employs a Gaussian mixture model to capture multi-peak distributions of attention in trust and hallucination manifolds, and uses entropic optimal transport (equivalent to Schrödinger bridge problem) to map Gaussian components precisely. During mitigation, Scalpel dynamically adjusts intervention strength and direction based on component membership and mapping relationships between hallucination and trust activations. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and benchmarks demonstrate that Scalpel effectively mitigates hallucinations, outperforming previous methods and achieving state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, Scalpel is model- and data-agnostic, requiring no additional computation, only a single decoding step.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Binary Function Similarity (BFS), the problem of determining whether two binary functions originate from the same source code, has been extensively studied in recent research across security, software engineering, and machine learning communities. This interest arises from its central role in developing vulnerability detection systems, copyright infringement analysis, and malware phylogeny tools. Nearly all binary function similarity systems embed assembly functions into real-valued vectors, where similar functions map to points that lie close to each other in the metric space. These embeddings enable function search: a query function is embedded and compared against a database of candidate embeddings to retrieve the most similar matches. Despite their effectiveness, such systems rely on bi-encoder architectures that embed functions independently, limiting their ability to capture cross-function relationships and similarities. To address this limitation, we introduce ReSIM, a novel and enhanced function search system that complements embedding-based search with a neural re-ranker. Unlike traditional embedding models, our reranking module jointly processes query-candidate pairs to compute ranking scores based on their mutual representation, allowing for more accurate similarity assessment. By re-ranking the top results from embedding-based retrieval, ReSIM leverages fine-grained relation information that bi-encoders cannot capture. We evaluate ReSIM across seven embedding models on two benchmark datasets, demonstrating consistent improvements in search effectiveness, with average gains of 21.7% in terms of nDCG and 27.8% in terms of Recall.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Conversational question answering increasingly relies on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ground large language models (LLMs) in external knowledge. Yet, most existing studies evaluate RAG methods in isolation and primarily focus on single-turn settings. This paper addresses the lack of a systematic comparison of RAG methods for multi-turn conversational QA, where dialogue history, coreference, and shifting user intent substantially complicate retrieval. We present a comprehensive empirical study of vanilla and advanced RAG methods across eight diverse conversational QA datasets spanning multiple domains. Using a unified experimental setup, we evaluate retrieval quality and answer generation using generator and retrieval metrics, and analyze how performance evolves across conversation turns. Our results show that robust yet straightforward methods, such as reranking, hybrid BM25, and HyDE, consistently outperform vanilla RAG. In contrast, several advanced techniques fail to yield gains and can even degrade performance below the No-RAG baseline. We further demonstrate that dataset characteristics and dialogue length strongly influence retrieval effectiveness, explaining why no single RAG strategy dominates across settings. Overall, our findings indicate that effective conversational RAG depends less on method complexity than on alignment between the retrieval strategy and the dataset structure. We publish the code used.\footnote{\href{this https URL}{GitHub Repository}}</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in block diffusion language models have demonstrated competitive performance and strong scalability on reasoning tasks. However, existing BDLMs have limited exploration under the test-time scaling setting and face more severe decoding challenges in long Chain-of-Thought reasoning, particularly in balancing the decoding speed and effectiveness. In this work, we propose a unified framework for test-time scaling in BDLMs that introduces adaptivity in both decoding and block-wise generation. At the decoding level, we propose Bounded Adaptive Confidence Decoding (BACD), a difficulty-aware sampling strategy that dynamically adjusts denoising based on model confidence, accelerating inference while controlling error accumulation. Beyond step-wise adaptivity, we introduce Think Coarse, Critic Fine (TCCF), a test-time scaling paradigm that allocates large block sizes to exploratory reasoning and smaller block sizes to refinement, achieving an effective efficiency-effectiveness balance. To enable efficient and effective decoding with a large block size, we adopt Progressive Block Size Extension, which mitigates performance degradation when scaling block sizes. Extensive experiments show that applying BACD and TCCF to TDAR-8B yields significant improvements over strong baselines such as TraDo-8B (2.26x speedup, +11.2 points on AIME24). These results mark an important step toward unlocking the potential of BDLMs for test-time scaling in complex reasoning tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability, explainability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep learning has achieved expert-level performance in automated electrocardiogram (ECG) diagnosis, yet the "black-box" nature of these models hinders their clinical deployment. Trust in medical AI requires not just high accuracy but also transparency regarding the specific physiological features driving predictions. Existing explainability methods for ECGs typically rely on post-hoc approximations (e.g., Grad-CAM and SHAP), which can be unstable, computationally expensive, and unfaithful to the model's actual decision-making process. In this work, we propose the ECG-IMN, an Interpretable Mesomorphic Neural Network tailored for high-resolution 12-lead ECG classification. Unlike standard classifiers, the ECG-IMN functions as a hypernetwork: a deep convolutional backbone generates the parameters of a strictly linear model specific to each input sample. This architecture enforces intrinsic interpretability, as the decision logic is mathematically transparent and the generated weights (W) serve as exact, high-resolution feature attribution maps. We introduce a transition decoder that effectively maps latent features to sample-wise weights, enabling precise localization of pathological evidence (e.g., ST-elevation, T-wave inversion) in both time and lead dimensions. We evaluate our approach on the PTB-XL dataset for classification tasks, demonstrating that the ECG-IMN achieves competitive predictive performance (AUROC comparable to black-box baselines) while providing faithful, instance-specific explanations. By explicitly decoupling parameter generation from prediction execution, our framework bridges the gap between deep learning capability and clinical trustworthiness, offering a principled path toward "white-box" cardiac diagnostics.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, extraction, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to access legal information. Yet, their deployment in multilingual legal settings is constrained by unreliable retrieval and the lack of domain-adapted, open-embedding models. In particular, existing multilingual legal corpora are not designed for semantic retrieval, and PDF-based legislative sources introduce substantial noise due to imperfect text extraction. To address these challenges, we introduce LEMUR, a large-scale multilingual corpus of EU environmental legislation constructed from 24,953 official EUR-Lex PDF documents covering 25 languages. We quantify the fidelity of PDF-to-text conversion by measuring lexical consistency against authoritative HTML versions using the Lexical Content Score (LCS). Building on LEMUR, we fine-tune three state-of-the-art multilingual embedding models using contrastive objectives in both monolingual and bilingual settings, reflecting realistic legal-retrieval scenarios. Experiments across low- and high-resource languages demonstrate that legal-domain fine-tuning consistently improves Top-k retrieval accuracy relative to strong baselines, with particularly pronounced gains for low-resource languages. Cross-lingual evaluations show that these improvements transfer to unseen languages, indicating that fine-tuning primarily enhances language-independent, content-level legal representations rather than language-specific cues.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Tree-search decoding is an effective form of test-time scaling for large language models (LLMs), but real-world deployment imposes a fixed per-query token budget that varies across settings. Existing tree-search policies are largely budget-agnostic, treating the budget as a termination condition, which can lead to late-stage over-branching or premature termination. We propose {Budget-Guided MCTS} (BG-MCTS), a tree-search decoding algorithm that aligns its search policy with the remaining token budget: it starts with broad exploration, then prioritizes refinement and answer completion as the budget depletes while reducing late-stage branching from shallow nodes. BG-MCTS consistently outperforms budget-agnostic tree-search baselines across different budgets on MATH500 and AIME24/25 with open-weight LLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep generative models that can tractably compute input likelihoods, including normalizing flows, often assign unexpectedly high likelihoods to out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. We mitigate this likelihood paradox by manipulating input entropy based on semantic similarity, applying stronger perturbations to inputs that are less similar to an in-distribution memory bank. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that entropy control increases the expected log-likelihood gap between in-distribution and OOD samples in favor of the in-distribution, and we explain why the procedure works without any additional training of the density model. We then evaluate our method against likelihood-based OOD detectors on standard benchmarks and find consistent AUROC improvements over baselines, supporting our explanation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Spectral clustering is known as a powerful technique in unsupervised data analysis. The vast majority of approaches to spectral clustering are driven by a single modality, leaving the rich information in multi-modal representations untapped. Inspired by the recent success of vision-language pre-training, this paper enriches the landscape of spectral clustering from a single-modal to a multi-modal regime. Particularly, we propose Neural Tangent Kernel Spectral Clustering that leverages cross-modal alignment in pre-trained vision-language models. By anchoring the neural tangent kernel with positive nouns, i.e., those semantically close to the images of interest, we arrive at formulating the affinity between images as a coupling of their visual proximity and semantic overlap. We show that this formulation amplifies within-cluster connections while suppressing spurious ones across clusters, hence encouraging block-diagonal structures. In addition, we present a regularized affinity diffusion mechanism that adaptively ensembles affinity matrices induced by different prompts. Extensive experiments on \textbf{16} benchmarks -- including classical, large-scale, fine-grained and domain-shifted datasets -- manifest that our method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art by a large margin.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The scarcity of high-quality data remains a primary bottleneck in adapting multimodal generative models for medical image editing. Existing medical image editing datasets often suffer from limited diversity, neglect of medical image understanding and inability to balance quality with scalability. To address these gaps, we propose MieDB-100k, a large-scale, high-quality and diverse dataset for text-guided medical image editing. It categorizes editing tasks into perspectives of Perception, Modification and Transformation, considering both understanding and generation abilities. We construct MieDB-100k via a data curation pipeline leveraging both modality-specific expert models and rule-based data synthetic methods, followed by rigorous manual inspection to ensure clinical fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that model trained with MieDB-100k consistently outperform both open-source and proprietary models while exhibiting strong generalization ability. We anticipate that this dataset will serve as a cornerstone for future advancements in specialized medical image editing.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Reinforcement learning substantially improves reasoning in large language models, but it also tends to lengthen chain of thought outputs and increase computational cost during both training and inference. Though length control methods have been proposed, it remains unclear what the optimal output length is for balancing efficiency and performance. In this work, we compare several length control methods on two models, Qwen3-1.7B Base and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B. Our results indicate that length penalties may hinder reasoning acquisition, while properly tuned length control can improve efficiency for models with strong prior reasoning. By extending prior work to RL trained policies, we identify two failure modes, 1) long outputs increase dispersion, and 2) short outputs lead to under-thinking.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep generative models with tractable and analytically computable likelihoods, exemplified by normalizing flows, offer an effective basis for anomaly detection through likelihood-based scoring. We demonstrate that, unlike in the image domain where deep generative models frequently assign higher likelihoods to anomalous data, such counterintuitive behavior occurs far less often in tabular settings. We first introduce a domain-agnostic formulation that enables consistent detection and evaluation of the counterintuitive phenomenon, addressing the absence of precise definition. Through extensive experiments on 47 tabular datasets and 10 CV/NLP embedding datasets in ADBench, benchmarked against 13 baseline models, we demonstrate that the phenomenon, as defined, is consistently rare in general tabular data. We further investigate this phenomenon from both theoretical and empirical perspectives, focusing on the roles of data dimensionality and difference in feature correlation. Our results suggest that likelihood-only detection with normalizing flows offers a practical and reliable approach for anomaly detection in tabular domains.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Egocentric interactive world models are essential for augmented reality and embodied AI, where visual generation must respond to user input with low latency, geometric consistency, and long-term stability. We study egocentric interaction generation from a single scene image under free-space hand gestures, aiming to synthesize photorealistic videos in which hands enter the scene, interact with objects, and induce plausible world dynamics under head motion. This setting introduces fundamental challenges, including distribution shift between free-space gestures and contact-heavy training data, ambiguity between hand motion and camera motion in monocular views, and the need for arbitrary-length video generation. We present Hand2World, a unified autoregressive framework that addresses these challenges through occlusion-invariant hand conditioning based on projected 3D hand meshes, allowing visibility and occlusion to be inferred from scene context rather than encoded in the control signal. To stabilize egocentric viewpoint changes, we inject explicit camera geometry via per-pixel Plücker-ray embeddings, disentangling camera motion from hand motion and preventing background drift. We further develop a fully automated monocular annotation pipeline and distill a bidirectional diffusion model into a causal generator, enabling arbitrary-length synthesis. Experiments on three egocentric interaction benchmarks show substantial improvements in perceptual quality and 3D consistency while supporting camera control and long-horizon interactive generation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Automated traffic continued to surpass human-generated traffic on the web, and a rising proportion of this automation was explicitly malicious. Evasive bots could pretend to be real users, even solve Captchas and mimic human interaction patterns. This work explores a less intrusive, protocol-level method: using TLS fingerprinting with the JA4 technique to tell apart bots from real users. Two gradient-boosted machine learning classifiers (XGBoost and CatBoost) were trained and evaluated on a dataset of real TLS fingerprints (JA4DB) after feature extraction, which derived informative signals from JA4 fingerprints that describe TLS handshake parameters. The CatBoost model performed better, achieving an AUC of 0.998 and an F1 score of 0.9734. It was accurate 0.9863 of the time on the test set. The XGBoost model showed almost similar results. Feature significance analyses identified JA4 components, especially ja4\_b, cipher\_count, and ext\_count, as the most influential on model effectiveness. Future research will extend this method to new protocols, such as HTTP/3, and add additional device-fingerprinting features to test how well the system resists advanced bot evasion tactics.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in diffusion-based video generation have substantially improved visual fidelity and temporal coherence. However, most existing approaches remain task-specific and rely primarily on textual instructions, limiting their ability to handle multimodal inputs, contextual references, and diverse video generation and editing scenarios within a unified framework. Moreover, many video editing methods depend on carefully engineered pipelines tailored to individual operations, which hinders scalability and composability. In this paper, we propose Tele-Omni, a unified multimodal framework for video generation and editing that follows multimodal instructions, including text, images, and reference videos, within a single model. Tele-Omni leverages pretrained multimodal large language models to parse heterogeneous instructions and infer structured generation or editing intents, while diffusion-based generators perform high-quality video synthesis conditioned on these structured signals. To enable joint training across heterogeneous video tasks, we introduce a task-aware data processing pipeline that unifies multimodal inputs into a structured instruction format while preserving task-specific constraints. Tele-Omni supports a wide range of video-centric tasks, including text-to-video generation, image-to-video generation, first-last-frame video generation, in-context video generation, and in-context video editing. By decoupling instruction parsing from video synthesis and combining it with task-aware data design, Tele-Omni achieves flexible multimodal control while maintaining strong temporal coherence and visual consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that Tele-Omni achieves competitive performance across multiple tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>protect, attack, robust, watermark</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Watermarking has emerged as a pivotal solution for content traceability and intellectual property protection in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). However, vision-agnostic watermarks may introduce visually irrelevant tokens and disrupt visual grounding by enforcing indiscriminate pseudo-random biases. Additionally, current vision-specific watermarks rely on a static, one-time estimation of vision critical weights and ignore the weight distribution density when determining the proportion of protected tokens. This design fails to account for dynamic changes in visual dependence during generation and may introduce low-quality tokens in the long tail. To address these challenges, we propose Attention-Guided Dynamic Watermarking (AGMark), a novel framework that embeds detectable signals while strictly preserving visual fidelity. At each decoding step, AGMark first dynamically identifies semantic-critical evidence based on attention weights for visual relevance, together with context-aware coherence cues, resulting in a more adaptive and well-calibrated evidence-weight distribution. It then determines the proportion of semantic-critical tokens by jointly considering uncertainty awareness (token entropy) and evidence calibration (weight density), thereby enabling adaptive vocabulary partitioning to avoid irrelevant tokens. Empirical results confirm that AGMark outperforms conventional methods, observably improving generation quality and yielding particularly strong gains in visual semantic fidelity in the later stages of generation. The framework maintains highly competitive detection accuracy (at least 99.36\% AUC) and robust attack resilience (at least 88.61\% AUC) without sacrificing inference efficiency, effectively establishing a new standard for reliability-preserving multi-modal watermarking.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Post-training alignment is central to deploying large language models (LLMs), yet practical workflows remain split across backend-specific tools and ad-hoc glue code, making experiments hard to reproduce. We identify backend interference, reward fragmentation, and irreproducible pipelines as key obstacles in alignment research. We introduce AlignTune, a modular toolkit exposing a unified interface for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and RLHF-style optimization with interchangeable TRL and Unsloth backends. AlignTune standardizes configuration, provides an extensible reward layer (rule-based and learned), and integrates evaluation over standard benchmarks and custom tasks. By isolating backend-specific logic behind a single factory boundary, AlignTune enables controlled comparisons and reproducible alignment experiments.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Differential Privacy (DP) considers a scenario in which an adversary has almost complete information about the entries of a database. This worst-case assumption is likely to overestimate the privacy threat faced by an individual in practice. In contrast, Statistical Privacy (SP), as well as related notions such as noiseless privacy or limited background knowledge privacy, describe a setting in which the adversary knows the distribution of the database entries, but not their exact realizations. In this case, privacy analysis must account for the interaction between uncertainty induced by the entropy of the underlying distributions and privacy mechanisms that distort query answers, which can be highly non-trivial. This paper investigates this problem for multiple queries (composition). A privacy mechanism is proposed that is based on subsampling and randomly partitioning the database to bound the dependency among queries. This way for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, upper privacy bounds against limited adversaries are obtained without any further restriction on the database. These bounds show that in realistic application scenarios taking the entropy of distributions into account yields improvements of privacy and precision guarantees. We illustrate examples where for fixed privacy parameters and utility loss SP allows significantly more queries than DP.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>defense, attack, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) deploy safety mechanisms to prevent harmful outputs, yet these defenses remain vulnerable to adversarial prompts. While existing research demonstrates that jailbreak attacks succeed, it does not explain \textit{where} defenses fail or \textit{why}. To address this gap, we propose that LLM safety operates as a sequential pipeline with distinct checkpoints. We introduce the \textbf{Four-Checkpoint Framework}, which organizes safety mechanisms along two dimensions: processing stage (input vs.\ output) and detection level (literal vs.\ intent). This creates four checkpoints, CP1 through CP4, each representing a defensive layer that can be independently evaluated. We design 13 evasion techniques, each targeting a specific checkpoint, enabling controlled testing of individual defensive layers. Using this framework, we evaluate GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro across 3,312 single-turn, black-box test cases. We employ an LLM-as-judge approach for response classification and introduce Weighted Attack Success Rate (WASR), a severity-adjusted metric that captures partial information leakage overlooked by binary evaluation. Our evaluation reveals clear patterns. Traditional Binary ASR reports 22.6\% attack success. However, WASR reveals 52.7\%, a 2.3$\times$ higher vulnerability. Output-stage defenses (CP3, CP4) prove weakest at 72--79\% WASR, while input-literal defenses (CP1) are strongest at 13\% WASR. Claude achieves the strongest safety (42.8\% WASR), followed by GPT-5 (55.9\%) and Gemini (59.5\%). These findings suggest that current defenses are strongest at input-literal checkpoints but remain vulnerable to intent-level manipulation and output-stage techniques. The Four-Checkpoint Framework provides a structured approach for identifying and addressing safety vulnerabilities in deployed systems.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Feature selection (FS) remains essential for building accurate and interpretable detection models, particularly in high-dimensional malware datasets. Conventional FS methods such as Extra Trees, Variance Threshold, Tree-based models, Chi-Squared tests, ANOVA, Random Selection, and Sequential Attention rely primarily on statistical heuristics or model-driven importance scores, often overlooking the semantic context of features. Motivated by recent progress in LLM-driven FS, we investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can guide feature selection in a zero-shot setting, using only feature names and task descriptions, as a viable alternative to traditional approaches. We evaluate multiple LLMs (GPT-5.0, GPT-4.0, Gemini-2.5 etc.) on the EMBOD dataset (a fusion of EMBER and BODMAS benchmark datasets), comparing them against established FS methods across several classifiers, including Random Forest, Extra Trees, MLP, and KNN. Performance is assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, F1, AUC, MCC, and runtime. Our results demonstrate that LLM-guided zero-shot feature selection achieves competitive performance with traditional FS methods while offering additional advantages in interpretability, stability, and reduced dependence on labeled data. These findings position zero-shot LLM-based FS as a promising alternative strategy for effective and interpretable malware detection, paving the way for knowledge-guided feature selection in security-critical applications</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The proliferation of hateful content in online videos poses severe threats to individual well-being and societal harmony. However, existing solutions for video hate detection either rely heavily on large-scale human annotations or lack fine-grained temporal precision. In this work, we propose LELA, the first training-free Large Language Model (LLM) based framework for hate video localization. Distinct from state-of-the-art models that depend on supervised pipelines, LELA leverages LLMs and modality-specific captioning to detect and temporally localize hateful content in a training-free manner. Our method decomposes a video into five modalities, including image, speech, OCR, music, and video context, and uses a multi-stage prompting scheme to compute fine-grained hateful scores for each frame. We further introduce a composition matching mechanism to enhance cross-modal reasoning. Experiments on two challenging benchmarks, HateMM and MultiHateClip, demonstrate that LELA outperforms all existing training-free baselines by a large margin. We also provide extensive ablations and qualitative visualizations, establishing LELA as a strong foundation for scalable and interpretable hate video localization.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>3D affordance grounding aims to highlight the actionable regions on 3D objects, which is crucial for robotic manipulation. Previous research primarily focused on learning affordance knowledge from static cues such as language and images, which struggle to provide sufficient dynamic interaction context that can reveal temporal and causal cues. To alleviate this predicament, we collect a comprehensive video-based 3D affordance dataset, \textit{VIDA}, which contains 38K human-object-interaction videos covering 16 affordance types, 38 object categories, and 22K point clouds. Based on \textit{VIDA}, we propose a strong baseline: VideoAfford, which activates multimodal large language models with additional affordance segmentation capabilities, enabling both world knowledge reasoning and fine-grained affordance grounding within a unified framework. To enhance action understanding capability, we leverage a latent action encoder to extract dynamic interaction priors from HOI videos. Moreover, we introduce a \textit{spatial-aware} loss function to enable VideoAfford to obtain comprehensive 3D spatial knowledge. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms well-established methods and exhibits strong open-world generalization with affordance reasoning abilities. All datasets and code will be publicly released to advance research in this area.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We analyze, theoretically and empirically, the performance of generative diffusion models based on \emph{blind denoisers}, in which the denoiser is not given the noise amplitude in either the training or sampling processes. Assuming that the data distribution has low intrinsic dimensionality, we prove that blind denoising diffusion models (BDDMs), despite not having access to the noise amplitude, \emph{automatically} track a particular \emph{implicit} noise schedule along the reverse process. Our analysis shows that BDDMs can accurately sample from the data distribution in polynomially many steps as a function of the intrinsic dimension. Empirical results corroborate these mathematical findings on both synthetic and image data, demonstrating that the noise variance is accurately estimated from the noisy image. Remarkably, we observe that schedule-free BDDMs produce samples of higher quality compared to their non-blind counterparts. We provide evidence that this performance gain arises because BDDMs correct the mismatch between the true residual noise (of the image) and the noise assumed by the schedule used in non-blind diffusion models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved table understanding tasks such as Table Question Answering (TableQA), yet challenges remain in ensuring reliability, scalability, and efficiency, especially in resource-constrained or privacy-sensitive environments. In this paper, we introduce MATA, a multi-agent TableQA framework that leverages multiple complementary reasoning paths and a set of tools built with small language models. MATA generates candidate answers through diverse reasoning styles for a given table and question, then refines or selects the optimal answer with the help of these tools. Furthermore, it incorporates an algorithm designed to minimize expensive LLM agent calls, enhancing overall efficiency. MATA maintains strong performance with small, open-source models and adapts easily across various LLM types. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks of varying difficulty with ten different LLMs demonstrate that MATA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and highly efficient reasoning while avoiding excessive LLM inference. Our results highlight that careful orchestration of multiple reasoning pathways yields scalable and reliable TableQA. The code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Domain Generalized Video Semantic Segmentation (DGVSS) is trained on a single labeled driving domain and is directly deployed on unseen domains without target labels and test-time adaptation while maintaining temporally consistent predictions over video streams. In practice, both domain shift and temporal-sampling shift break correspondence-based propagation and fixed-stride temporal aggregation, causing severe frame-to-frame flicker even in label-stable regions. We propose Time2General, a DGVSS framework built on Stability Queries. Time2General introduces a Spatio-Temporal Memory Decoder that aggregates multi-frame context into a clip-level spatio-temporal memory and decodes temporally consistent per-frame masks without explicit correspondence propagation. To further suppress flicker and improve robustness to varying sampling rates, the Masked Temporal Consistency Loss is proposed to regularize temporal prediction discrepancies across different strides, and randomize training strides to expose the model to diverse temporal gaps. Extensive experiments on multiple driving benchmarks show that Time2General achieves a substantial improvement in cross-domain accuracy and temporal stability over prior DGSS and VSS baselines while running at up to 18 FPS. Code will be released after the review process.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Liver fibrosis poses a substantial challenge in clinical practice, emphasizing the necessity for precise liver segmentation and accurate disease staging. Based on the CARE Liver 2025 Track 4 Challenge, this study introduces a multi-task deep learning framework developed for liver segmentation (LiSeg) and liver fibrosis staging (LiFS) using multiparametric MRI. The LiSeg phase addresses the challenge of limited annotated images and the complexities of multi-parametric MRI data by employing a semi-supervised learning model that integrates image segmentation and registration. By leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data, the model overcomes the difficulties introduced by domain shifts and variations across modalities. In the LiFS phase, we employed a patchbased method which allows the visualization of liver fibrosis stages based on the classification outputs. Our approach effectively handles multimodality imaging data, limited labels, and domain shifts. The proposed method has been tested by the challenge organizer on an independent test set that includes in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) cases using three-channel MRIs (T1, T2, DWI) and seven-channel MRIs (T1, T2, DWI, GED1-GED4).

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, data-free</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Fine-tuning large pre-trained models on a target distribution often improves in-distribution (ID) accuracy, but at the cost of out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness as representations specialize to the fine-tuning data. Weight-space ensembling methods, such as Model Soups, mitigate this effect by averaging multiple checkpoints, but they are computationally prohibitive, requiring the training and storage of dozens of fine-tuned models. In this paper, we introduce MonoSoup, a simple, data-free, hyperparameter-free, post-hoc method that achieves a strong ID-OOD balance using only a single checkpoint. Our method applies Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to each layer's update and decomposes it into high-energy directions that capture task-specific adaptation and low-energy directions that introduce noise but may still encode residual signals useful for robustness. MonoSoup then uses entropy-based effective rank to automatically re-weigh these components with layer-wise coefficients that account for the spectral and geometric structure of the model. Experiments on CLIP models fine-tuned on ImageNet and evaluated under natural distribution shifts, as well as on Qwen language models tested on mathematical reasoning and multiple-choice benchmarks, show that this plug-and-play approach is a practical and effective alternative to multi-checkpoint methods, retaining much of their benefits without their computational overhead.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Univariate time series (UTS), where each timestamp records a single variable, serve as crucial indicators in web systems and cloud servers. Anomaly detection in UTS plays an essential role in both data mining and system reliability management. However, existing reconstruction-based and prediction-based methods struggle to capture certain subtle anomalies, particularly small point anomalies and slowly rising anomalies. To address these challenges, we propose a novel prediction-based framework named Contextual and Seasonal LSTMs (CS-LSTMs). CS-LSTMs are built upon a noise decomposition strategy and jointly leverage contextual dependencies and seasonal patterns, thereby strengthening the detection of subtle anomalies. By integrating both time-domain and frequency-domain representations, CS-LSTMs achieve more accurate modeling of periodic trends and anomaly localization. Extensive evaluations on public benchmark datasets demonstrate that CS-LSTMs consistently outperform state-of-the-art methods, highlighting their effectiveness and practical value in robust time series anomaly detection.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We study fine-grained referring image segmentation via a decoupled reason-then-segment pipeline. A vision-language model (VLM) receives an image and a natural-language query, reasons about the scene, and emits structured spatial prompts: a bounding box plus two interior keypoints for every referred instance. A frozen promptable segmenter (SAM 2) converts these prompts into high-quality masks. Within our GenSeg-R1 framework we finetune Qwen3-VL models (4B and 8B parameters) using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), requiring no supervised reasoning-chain annotations. On RefCOCOg validation our best model (GenSeg-R1-8B) achieves 0.7127 cIoU and 0.7382 mIoU, substantially outperforming the corresponding Qwen3-VL Instruct baselines (+15.3 and +21.9 points, respectively) and surpassing Seg-Zero-7B [3] by +3.3 cIoU under identical evaluation. We further introduce GenSeg-R1-G, a variant trained on GRefCOCO [9] with a SAM 2 in-the-loop reward that directly optimizes mask quality. On GRefCOCO validation GenSeg-R1-G achieves 76.69% target mIoU with 82.40% accuracy on negative (no-target) prompts, substantially outperforming Seg-R1-7B and Seg-Zero-7B, which lack no-target detection capability. On ReasonSeg test, GenSeg-R1-4B reaches 68.40% mIoU, surpassing Seg-Zero-7B by +7.0 and Seg-R1-7B by +10.7 points.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly multilingual, supporting hundreds of languages, especially high resource ones. Unfortunately, Dialect variations are still underrepresented due to limited data and linguistic variation. In this work, we adapt a pre-trained LLM to improve dialectal performance. Specifically, we use Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning on monolingual and English Dialect parallel data, adapter merging and dialect-aware MBR decoding to improve dialectal fidelity generation and translation. Experiments on Syrian, Moroccan, and Saudi Arabic show that merging and MBR improve dialectal fidelity while preserving semantic accuracy. This combination provides a compact and effective framework for robust dialectal Arabic generation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, security</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0 devices provide efficient hardware-based cryptographic security through tamper-resistant key storage and computation, making them ideal building blocks for multi-party signature schemes in distributed systems. However, existing TPM-based multi-signature constructions suffer from a fundamental limitation, they require interactive protocols where all participants must coordinate during the commitment phase, before any signature can be computed. This interactive requirement creates several critical problems, such as synchronization bottlenecks, quadratic communication complexity, and aborted protocols as a result of participant failure. These limitations become particularly heightened for applications that require cross-device cryptographic operations. This paper presents PiTPM, an Aggregator Framework built upon Schnorr's digital signature. Our protocol eliminates the interactive requirement using a hybrid trust architecture. The proposed framework uses pre-shared randomness seeds stored securely in an Aggregator, enabling deterministic computation of global commitments without inter-participant communication. The resulting signatures of the proposed framework are of constant size regardless of signer count. Our experimental results show a possible paradigm shift in TPM-based cryptographic system design, demonstrating that hybrid trust architectures can achieve significant performance improvements while maintaining rigorous security guarantees. We provide a comprehensive formal security analysis proving EU-CMA security under the discrete logarithm assumption in the random oracle model.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose a methodology that combines generative latent diffusion models with physics-informed machine learning to generate solutions of parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) conditioned on partial observations, which includes, in particular, forward and inverse PDE problems. We learn the joint distribution of PDE parameters and solutions via a diffusion process in a latent space of scaled spectral representations, where Gaussian noise corresponds to functions with controlled regularity. This spectral formulation enables significant dimensionality reduction compared to grid-based diffusion models and ensures that the induced process in function space remains within a class of functions for which the PDE operators are well defined. Building on diffusion posterior sampling, we enforce physics-informed constraints and measurement conditions during inference, applying Adam-based updates at each diffusion step. We evaluate the proposed approach on Poisson, Helmholtz, and incompressible Navier--Stokes equations, demonstrating improved accuracy and computational efficiency compared with existing diffusion-based PDE solvers, which are state of the art for sparse observations.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Sustaining long-term interactions remains a bottleneck for Large Language Models (LLMs), as their limited context windows struggle to manage dialogue histories that extend over time. Existing memory systems often treat interactions as disjointed snippets, failing to capture the underlying narrative coherence of the dialogue stream. We propose TraceMem, a cognitively-inspired framework that weaves structured, narrative memory schemata from user conversational traces through a three-stage pipeline: (1) Short-term Memory Processing, which employs a deductive topic segmentation approach to demarcate episode boundaries and extract semantic representation; (2) Synaptic Memory Consolidation, a process that summarizes episodes into episodic memories before distilling them alongside semantics into user-specific traces; and (3) Systems Memory Consolidation, which utilizes two-stage hierarchical clustering to organize these traces into coherent, time-evolving narrative threads under unifying themes. These threads are encapsulated into structured user memory cards, forming narrative memory schemata. For memory utilization, we provide an agentic search mechanism to enhance reasoning process. Evaluation on the LoCoMo benchmark shows that TraceMem achieves state-of-the-art performance with a brain-inspired architecture. Analysis shows that by constructing coherent narratives, it surpasses baselines in multi-hop and temporal reasoning, underscoring its essential role in deep narrative comprehension. Additionally, we provide an open discussion on memory systems, offering our perspectives and future outlook on the field. Our code implementation is available at: this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Rigged 3D assets are fundamental to 3D deformation and animation. However, existing 3D generation methods face challenges in generating animatable geometry, while rigging techniques lack fine-grained structural control over skeleton creation. To address these limitations, we introduce Stroke3D, a novel framework that directly generates rigged meshes from user inputs: 2D drawn strokes and a descriptive text prompt. Our approach pioneers a two-stage pipeline that separates the generation into: 1) Controllable Skeleton Generation, we employ the Skeletal Graph VAE (Sk-VAE) to encode the skeleton's graph structure into a latent space, where the Skeletal Graph DiT (Sk-DiT) generates a skeletal embedding. The generation process is conditioned on both the text for semantics and the 2D strokes for explicit structural control, with the VAE's decoder reconstructing the final high-quality 3D skeleton; and 2) Enhanced Mesh Synthesis via TextuRig and SKA-DPO, where we then synthesize a textured mesh conditioned on the generated skeleton. For this stage, we first enhance an existing skeleton-to-mesh model by augmenting its training data with TextuRig: a dataset of textured and rigged meshes with captions, curated from Objaverse-XL. Additionally, we employ a preference optimization strategy, SKA-DPO, guided by a skeleton-mesh alignment score, to further improve geometric fidelity. Together, our framework enables a more intuitive workflow for creating ready to animate 3D content. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to generate rigged 3D meshes conditioned on user-drawn 2D strokes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Stroke3D produces plausible skeletons and high-quality meshes.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Test-time adaptation (TTA) for large language models (LLMs) updates model parameters at inference time using signals available at deployment. This paper focuses on a common yet under-explored regime: unsupervised, sample-specific TTA, where the model adapts independently for each prompt using only the prompt itself, without gold answers or external supervision. Although appealing, naive unsupervised TTA with a fixed, handcrafted learning rate can be unstable: updates may overfit to prompt-specific statistics, drift from the desired answer distribution, and ultimately degrade generation quality. This failure mode is not surprising, as in this case TTA must adapt to a single prompt within only a few gradient steps, unlike standard training that averages updates over large datasets and long optimization horizons. Therefore, we propose layer-wise dynamic test-time adaptation, a framework which explicitly modulates TTA strength as a function of prompt representation, LLM structure and adaptation step. In our setting, TTA updates only LoRA parameters, and a lightweight hypernetwork predicts per-layer, per-step learning-rate multipliers, enabling fine-grained control. Experiments across various datasets and LLMs consistently show that our method substantially strengthens TTA by learning effective scaling patterns over adaptation steps and transformer layer projections, improving stability while delivering better performance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in imaging technologies, deep learning and numerical performance have enabled non-invasive detailed analysis of artworks, supporting their documentation and conservation. In particular, automated detection of craquelure in digitized paintings is crucial for assessing degradation and guiding restoration, yet remains challenging due to the possibly complex scenery and the visual similarity between cracks and crack-like artistic features such as brush strokes or hair. We propose a hybrid approach that models crack detection as an inverse problem, decomposing an observed image into a crack-free painting and a crack component. A deep generative model is employed as powerful prior for the underlying artwork, while crack structures are captured using a Mumford--Shah-type variational functional together with a crack prior. Joint optimization yields a pixel-level map of crack localizations in the painting.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This article investigates the robustness of vision systems in Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), which is critical for developing Level-5 autonomous driving capabilities. Safe and reliable CAV navigation undeniably depends on robust vision systems that enable accurate detection of objects, lane markings, and traffic signage. We analyze the key sensors and vision components essential for CAV navigation to derive a reference architecture for CAV vision system (CAVVS). This reference architecture provides a basis for identifying potential attack surfaces of CAVVS. Subsequently, we elaborate on identified attack vectors targeting each attack surface, rigorously evaluating their implications for confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA). Our study provides a comprehensive understanding of attack vector dynamics in vision systems, which is crucial for formulating robust security measures that can uphold the principles of the CIA triad.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, defense, attack, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Understanding the reliability of natural language generation is critical for deploying foundation models in security-sensitive domains. While certified poisoning defenses provide provable robustness bounds for classification tasks, they are fundamentally ill-equipped for autoregressive generation: they cannot handle sequential predictions or the exponentially large output space of language models. To establish a framework for certified natural language generation, we formalize two security properties: stability (robustness to any change in generation) and validity (robustness to targeted, harmful changes in generation). We introduce Targeted Partition Aggregation (TPA), the first algorithm to certify validity/targeted attacks by computing the minimum poisoning budget needed to induce a specific harmful class, token, or phrase. Further, we extend TPA to provide tighter guarantees for multi-turn generations using mixed integer linear programming (MILP). Empirically, we demonstrate TPA's effectiveness across diverse settings including: certifying validity of agent tool-calling when adversaries modify up to 0.5% of the dataset and certifying 8-token stability horizons in preference-based alignment. Though inference-time latency remains an open challenge, our contributions enable certified deployment of language models in security-critical applications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Lexical Semantic Change (LSC) is the phenomenon in which the meaning of a word change over time. Most studies on LSC focus on improving the performance of estimating the degree of LSC, however, it is often difficult to interpret how the meaning of a word change. Enhancing the interpretability of LSC is a significant challenge as it could lead to novel insights in this field. To tackle this challenge, we propose a method to map the semantic space of contextualized embeddings of words obtained by a pre-trained language model to a neurobiological feature space. In the neurobiological feature space, each dimension corresponds to a primitive feature of words, and its value represents the intensity of that feature. This enables humans to interpret LSC systematically. When employed for the estimation of the degree of LSC, our method demonstrates superior performance in comparison to the majority of the previous methods. In addition, given the high interpretability of the proposed method, several analyses on LSC are carried out. The results demonstrate that our method not only discovers interesting types of LSC that have been overlooked in previous studies but also effectively searches for words with specific types of LSC.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools are integral to modern DevSecOps pipelines, yet tools like CodeQL, Semgrep, and SonarQube remain fundamentally constrained: they require expert-crafted queries, generate excessive false positives, and detect only predefined vulnerability patterns. Recent work has explored augmenting SAST with Large Language Models (LLMs), but these approaches typically use LLMs to triage existing tool outputs rather than to reason about vulnerability semantics directly. We introduce QRS (Query, Review, Sanitize), a neuro-symbolic framework that inverts this paradigm. Rather than filtering results from static rules, QRS employs three autonomous agents that generate CodeQL queries from a structured schema definition and few-shot examples, then validate findings through semantic reasoning and automated exploit synthesis. This architecture enables QRS to discover vulnerability classes beyond predefined patterns while substantially reducing false positives. We evaluate QRS on full Python packages rather than isolated snippets. In 20 historical CVEs in popular PyPI libraries, QRS achieves 90.6% detection accuracy. Applied to the 100 most-downloaded PyPI packages, QRS identified 39 medium-to-high-severity vulnerabilities, 5 of which were assigned new CVEs, 5 received documentation updates, while the remaining 29 were independently discovered by concurrent researchers, validating both the severity and discoverability of these findings. QRS accomplishes this with low time overhead and manageable token costs, demonstrating that LLM-driven query synthesis and code review can complement manually curated rule sets and uncover vulnerability patterns that evade existing industry tools.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent studies show that text-to-image models often fail to generate geographically representative images, raising concerns about the representativeness of their training data and motivating the question: which parts of the world do these training examples come from? We geographically profile large-scale multimodal datasets by mapping image-caption pairs to countries based on location information extracted from captions using LLMs. Studying English captions from three widely used datasets (Re-LAION, DataComp1B, and Conceptual Captions) across $20$ common entities (e.g., house, flag), we find that the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada account for $48.0\%$ of samples, while South American and African countries are severely under-represented with only $1.8\%$ and $3.8\%$ of images, respectively. We observe a strong correlation between a country's GDP and its representation in the data ($\rho = 0.82$). Examining non-English subsets for $4$ languages from the Re-LAION dataset, we find that representation skews heavily toward countries where these languages are predominantly spoken. Additionally, we find that higher representation does not necessarily translate to greater visual or semantic diversity. Finally, analyzing country-specific images generated by Stable Diffusion v1.3 trained on Re-LAION, we show that while generations appear realistic, they are severely limited in their coverage compared to real-world images.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This study investigates the explainability of generative diffusion models in the context of medical imaging, focusing on Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) synthesis. Although diffusion models have shown strong performance in generating realistic medical images, their internal decision making process remains largely opaque. We present a faithfulness-based explainability framework that analyzes how prototype-based explainability methods like ProtoPNet (PPNet), Enhanced ProtoPNet (EPPNet), and ProtoPool can link the relationship between generated and training features. Our study focuses on understanding the reasoning behind image formation through denoising trajectory of diffusion model and subsequently prototype explainability with faithfulness analysis. Experimental analysis shows that EPPNet achieves the highest faithfulness (with score 0.1534), offering more reliable insights, and explainability into the generative process. The results highlight that diffusion models can be made more transparent and trustworthy through faithfulness-based explanations, contributing to safer and more interpretable applications of generative AI in healthcare.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a critical method for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, continuous training often leads to policy entropy collapse, characterized by a rapid decay in entropy that results in premature overconfidence, reduced output diversity, and vanishing gradient norms that inhibit learning. Gradient-Preserving Clipping is a primary factor influencing these dynamics, but existing mitigation strategies are largely static and lack a framework connecting clipping mechanisms to precise entropy control. This paper proposes reshaping entropy control in RL from the perspective of Gradient-Preserving Clipping. We first theoretically and empirically verify the contributions of specific importance sampling ratio regions to entropy growth and reduction. Leveraging these findings, we introduce a novel regulation mechanism using dynamic clipping threshold to precisely manage entropy. Furthermore, we design and evaluate dynamic entropy control strategies, including increase-then-decrease, decrease-increase-decrease, and oscillatory decay. Experimental results demonstrate that these strategies effectively mitigate entropy collapse, and achieve superior performance across multiple benchmarks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Linear probes and sparse autoencoders consistently recover meaningful structure from transformer representations -- yet why should such simple methods succeed in deep, nonlinear systems? We show this is not merely an empirical regularity but a consequence of architectural necessity: transformers communicate information through linear interfaces (attention OV circuits, unembedding matrices), and any semantic feature decoded through such an interface must occupy a context-invariant linear subspace. We formalize this as the \emph{Invariant Subspace Necessity} theorem and derive the \emph{Self-Reference Property}: tokens directly provide the geometric direction for their associated features, enabling zero-shot identification of semantic structure without labeled data or learned probes. Empirical validation in eight classification tasks and four model families confirms the alignment between class tokens and semantically related instances. Our framework provides \textbf{a principled architectural explanation} for why linear interpretability methods work, unifying linear probes and sparse autoencoders.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Circuit discovery and activation steering in transformers have developed as separate research threads, yet both operate on the same representational space. Are they two views of the same underlying structure? We show they follow a single geometric principle: answer tokens, processed in isolation, encode the directions that would produce them. This Circuit Fingerprint hypothesis enables circuit discovery without gradients or causal intervention -- recovering comparable structure to gradient-based methods through geometric alignment alone. We validate this on standard benchmarks (IOI, SVA, MCQA) across four model families, achieving circuit discovery performance comparable to gradient-based methods. The same directions that identify circuit components also enable controlled steering -- achieving 69.8\% emotion classification accuracy versus 53.1\% for instruction prompting while preserving factual accuracy. Beyond method development, this read-write duality reveals that transformer circuits are fundamentally geometric structures: interpretability and controllability are two facets of the same object.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Scaling up model parameters has long been a prevalent training paradigm driven by the assumption that larger models yield superior generation capabilities. However, under lossy context compression in a compressor-decoder setup, we observe a Size-Fidelity Paradox: increasing the compressor size can lessen the faithfulness of reconstructed contexts though training loss decreases. Through extensive experiments across models from 0.6B to 90B, we coin this paradox arising from two dominant factors: 1) knowledge overwriting: larger models increasingly replace source facts with their own prior beliefs, e.g., ``the white strawberry'' $\to$ ``the red strawberry''; and 2) semantic drift: larger models tend to paraphrase or restructure content instead of reproducing it verbatim, e.g., ``Alice hit Bob'' $\to$ ``Bob hit Alice''. By holding model size fixed, we reflect on the emergent properties of compressed context representations. We show that the culprit is not parameter count itself, but the excessive semantic capacity and amplified generative uncertainty that accompany scaling. Specifically, the increased rank of context embeddings facilitates prior knowledge intrusion, whereas higher entropy over token prediction distributions promotes rewriting. Our results complement existing evaluations over context compression paradigm, underpinning a breakdown in scaling laws for faithful preservation in open-ended generation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Isolated REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) is a key prodromal marker of Parkinson's disease (PD), and video-polysomnography (vPSG) remains the diagnostic gold standard. However, manual sleep staging is particularly challenging in neurodegenerative diseases due to EEG abnormalities and fragmented sleep, making PSG assessments a bottleneck for deploying new RBD screening technologies at scale. We adapted U-Sleep, a deep neural network, for generalizable sleep staging in PD and iRBD. A pretrained U-Sleep model, based on a large publicly available, multisite non-neurodegenerative dataset (PUB; 19,236 PSGs across 12 sites), was fine-tuned on research datasets from two centers (Lundbeck Foundation Parkinson's Disease Research Center (PACE) and the Cologne-Bonn Cohort (CBC); 112 PD, 138 iRBD, 89 age-matched controls. The resulting model was evaluated on an independent dataset from the Danish Center for Sleep Medicine (DCSM; 81 PD, 36 iRBD, 87 sleep-clinic controls). A subset of PSGs with low agreement between the human rater and the model (\k{appa} < 0.6) was re-scored by a second blinded human rater to identify sources of disagreement. Finally, we applied confidence-based thresholds to optimize REM sleep staging. The pretrained model achieved mean \k{appa} = 0.81 in PUB, but \k{appa} = 0.66 when applied directly to PACE/CBC. By fine-tuning the model, we developed a generalized model with \k{appa} = 0.74 on PACE/CBC (p < 0.001 vs. the pretrained model). In DCSM, mean and median \k{appa} increased from 0.60 to 0.64 (p < 0.001) and 0.64 to 0.69 (p < 0.001), respectively. In the interrater study, PSGs with low agreement between the model and the initial scorer showed similarly low agreement between human scorers. Applying a confidence threshold increased the proportion of correctly identified REM sleep epochs from 85% to 95.5%, while preserving sufficient (> 5 min) REM sleep for 95% of subjects.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models trained for reasoning trade off inference tokens against accuracy, yet standard evaluations report only final accuracy, obscuring where tokens are spent or wasted. We introduce a trace-optional framework that decomposes token efficiency into interpretable factors: completion under a fixed token budget (avoiding truncation), conditional correctness given completion, and verbosity (token usage). When benchmark metadata provides per-instance workload proxies, we further factor verbosity into two components: mean verbalization overhead (tokens per work unit) and a coupling coefficient capturing how overhead scales with task workload. When reasoning traces are available, we add deterministic trace-quality measures (grounding, repetition, prompt copying) to separate degenerate looping from verbose-but-engaged reasoning, avoiding human labeling and LLM judges. Evaluating 25 models on CogniLoad, we find that accuracy and token-efficiency rankings diverge (Spearman $\rho=0.63$), efficiency gaps are often driven by conditional correctness, and verbalization overhead varies by about 9 times (only weakly related to model scale). Our decomposition reveals distinct bottleneck profiles that suggest different efficiency interventions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Transfer learning in deep reinforcement learning is often motivated by improved stability and reduced training cost, but it can also fail under substantial domain shift. This paper presents a controlled empirical study examining how architectural differences between Double Deep Q-Networks (DDQN) and Dueling DQN influence transfer behavior across environments. Using CartPole as a source task and LunarLander as a structurally distinct target task, we evaluate a fixed layer-wise representation transfer protocol under identical hyperparameters and training conditions, with baseline agents trained from scratch used to contextualize transfer effects. Empirical results show that DDQN consistently avoids negative transfer under the examined setup and maintains learning dynamics comparable to baseline performance in the target environment. In contrast, Dueling DQN consistently exhibits negative transfer under identical conditions, characterized by degraded rewards and unstable optimization behavior. Statistical analysis across multiple random seeds confirms a significant performance gap under transfer. These findings suggest that architectural inductive bias is strongly associated with robustness to cross-environment transfer in value-based deep reinforcement learning under the examined transfer protocol.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>High-quality novel view synthesis (NVS) from real-world videos is crucial for applications such as cultural heritage preservation, digital twins, and immersive media. However, real-world videos typically contain long sequences with irregular camera trajectories and unknown poses, leading to pose drift, feature misalignment, and geometric distortion during reconstruction. Moreover, lossy compression amplifies these issues by introducing inconsistencies that gradually degrade geometry and rendering quality. While recent studies have addressed either long-sequence NVS or unposed reconstruction, compression-aware approaches still focus on specific artifacts or limited scenarios, leaving diverse compression patterns in long videos insufficiently explored. In this paper, we propose CompSplat, a compression-aware training framework that explicitly models frame-wise compression characteristics to mitigate inter-frame inconsistency and accumulated geometric errors. CompSplat incorporates compression-aware frame weighting and an adaptive pruning strategy to enhance robustness and geometric consistency, particularly under heavy compression. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks, including Tanks and Temples, Free, and Hike, demonstrate that CompSplat achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality and pose accuracy, significantly surpassing most recent state-of-the-art NVS approaches under severe compression conditions.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper introduces AnalyticsGPT, an intuitive and efficient large language model (LLM)-powered workflow for scientometric question answering. This underrepresented downstream task addresses the subcategory of meta-scientific questions concerning the "science of science." When compared to traditional scientific question answering based on papers, the task poses unique challenges in the planning phase. Namely, the need for named-entity recognition of academic entities within questions and multi-faceted data retrieval involving scientometric indices, e.g. impact factors. Beyond their exceptional capacity for treating traditional natural language processing tasks, LLMs have shown great potential in more complex applications, such as task decomposition and planning and reasoning. In this paper, we explore the application of LLMs to scientometric question answering, and describe an end-to-end system implementing a sequential workflow with retrieval-augmented generation and agentic concepts. We also address the secondary task of effectively synthesizing the data into presentable and well-structured high-level analyses. As a database for retrieval-augmented generation, we leverage a proprietary research performance assessment platform. For evaluation, we consult experienced subject matter experts and leverage LLMs-as-judges. In doing so, we provide valuable insights on the efficacy of LLMs towards a niche downstream task.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>protect, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text summarization is a fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP), and the information explosion has made long-document processing increasingly demanding, making summarization essential. Existing research mainly focuses on model improvements and sentence-level pruning, but often overlooks global structure, leading to disrupted coherence and weakened downstream performance. Some studies employ large language models (LLMs), which achieve higher accuracy but incur substantial resource and time costs. To address these issues, we introduce GloSA-sum, the first summarization approach that achieves global structure awareness via topological data analysis (TDA). GloSA-sum summarizes text efficiently while preserving semantic cores and logical dependencies. Specifically, we construct a semantic-weighted graph from sentence embeddings, where persistent homology identifies core semantics and logical structures, preserved in a ``protection pool'' as the backbone for summarization. We design a topology-guided iterative strategy, where lightweight proxy metrics approximate sentence importance to avoid repeated high-cost computations, thus preserving structural integrity while improving efficiency. To further enhance long-text processing, we propose a hierarchical strategy that integrates segment-level and global summarization. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that GloSA-sum reduces redundancy while preserving semantic and logical integrity, striking a balance between accuracy and efficiency, and further benefits LLM downstream tasks by shortening contexts while retaining essential reasoning chains.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) pose significant security and reliability risks in real-world applications. Inspired by the observation that humans are more error-prone when uncertain or hesitant, we investigate how instability in a model 's internal knowledge contributes to LVLM hallucinations. We conduct extensive empirical analyses from three perspectives, namely attention heads, model layers, and decoding tokens, and identify three key hallucination patterns: (i) visual activation drift across attention heads, (ii) pronounced knowledge fluctuations across layers, and (iii) visual focus distraction between neighboring output tokens. Building on these findings, we propose Stability-Aware Knowledge-Enhanced Decoding (SAKED), which introduces a layer-wise Knowledge Stability Score (KSS) to quantify knowledge stability throughout the model. By contrasting the most stability-aware and stability-agnostic layers, SAKED suppresses decoding noise and dynamically leverages the most reliable internal knowledge for faithful token generation. Moreover, SAKED is training-free and can be seamlessly integrated into different architectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAKED achieves state-of-the-art performance for hallucination mitigation on various models, tasks, and benchmarks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed to automatically label and analyze educational dialogue at scale, yet current pipelines lack reliable ways to detect when models are wrong. We investigate whether reasoning generated by LLMs can be used to predict the correctness of a model's own predictions. We analyze 30,300 teacher utterances from classroom dialogue, each labeled by multiple state-of-the-art LLMs with an instructional move construct and an accompanying reasoning. Using human-verified ground-truth labels, we frame the task as predicting whether a model's assigned label for a given utterance is correct. We encode LLM reasoning using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and evaluate five supervised classifiers. A Random Forest classifier achieves an F1 score of 0.83 (Recall = 0.854), successfully identifying most incorrect predictions and outperforming baselines. Training specialist detectors for specific instructional move constructs further improves performance on difficult constructs, indicating that error detection benefits from construct-specific linguistic cues. Using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) framework, we examine four linguistic markers of correctness: Causation, Differentiation, Tentativeness, and Insight. Correct predictions exhibit grounded causal language (e.g., because, therefore), while incorrect reasoning is substantially more likely to rely on epistemic hedging (e.g., might, could) and performative metacognition (e.g., think, realize). Syntactic complexity does not distinguish correct from incorrect reasoning, and longer reasoning is not more reliable. These findings demonstrate that reasoning-based error detection offers a practical and scalable approach to quality control in automated educational dialogue analysis.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) scale well by expressing diverse tasks as sequences of discrete natural-language tokens and training with next-token prediction, which unifies comprehension and generation under self-supervision. Extending this paradigm to multimodal data requires a shared, discrete representation across modalities. However, most vision-language models (VLMs) still rely on a hybrid interface: discrete text tokens paired with continuous Vision Transformer (ViT) features. Because supervision is largely text-driven, these models are often biased toward understanding and cannot fully leverage large-scale self-supervised learning on non-text data. Recent work has explored discrete visual tokenization to enable fully autoregressive multimodal modeling, showing promising progress toward unified understanding and generation. Yet existing discrete vision tokens frequently lose information due to limited code capacity, resulting in noticeably weaker understanding than continuous-feature VLMs. We present Kelix, a fully discrete autoregressive unified model that closes the understanding gap between discrete and continuous visual representations.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Industrial anomaly detection demands precise reasoning over fine-grained defect patterns. However, existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs), pretrained on general-domain data, often struggle to capture category-specific anomalies, thereby limiting both detection accuracy and interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose Reason-IAD, a knowledge-guided dynamic latent reasoning framework for explainable industrial anomaly detection. Reason-IAD comprises two core components. First, a retrieval-augmented knowledge module incorporates category-specific textual descriptions into the model input, enabling context-aware reasoning over domain-specific defects. Second, an entropy-driven latent reasoning mechanism conducts iterative exploration within a compact latent space using optimizable latent think tokens, guided by an entropy-based reward that encourages confident and stable predictions. Furthermore, a dynamic visual injection strategy selectively incorporates the most informative image patches into the latent sequence, directing the reasoning process toward regions critical for anomaly detection. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Reason-IAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The code will be publicly available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Feature Engineering (FE) is pivotal in automated machine learning (AutoML) but remains a bottleneck for traditional methods, which treat it as a black-box search, operating within rigid, predefined search spaces and lacking domain awareness. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative by leveraging semantic reasoning to generate unbounded operators, existing methods fail to construct free-form FE pipelines, remaining confined to isolated subtasks such as feature generation. Most importantly, they are rarely optimized jointly with hyperparameter optimization (HPO) of the ML model, leading to greedy "FE-then-HPO" workflows that cannot capture strong FE-HPO interactions. In this paper, we present CoFEH, a collaborative framework that interleaves LLM-based FE and Bayesian HPO for robust end-to-end AutoML. CoFEH uses an LLM-driven FE optimizer powered by Tree of Thought (ToT) to explore flexible FE pipelines, a Bayesian optimization (BO) module to solve HPO, and a dynamic optimizer selector that realizes interleaved optimization by adaptively scheduling FE and HPO steps. Crucially, we introduce a mutual conditioning mechanism that shares context between LLM and BO, enabling mutually informed decisions. Experiments show that CoFEH not only outperforms traditional and LLM-based FE baselines, but also achieves superior end-to-end performance under joint optimization.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Clustering heterogeneous relational data remains a central challenge in graph learning, particularly when interactions involve more than two types of entities. While differentiable modularity objectives such as DMoN have enabled end-to-end community detection on homogeneous and bipartite graphs, extending these approaches to higher-order relational structures remains non-trivial. In this work, we introduce a differentiable formulation of tripartite modularity for graphs composed of three node types connected through mediated interactions. Community structure is defined in terms of weighted co-paths across the tripartite graph, together with an exact factorized computation that avoids the explicit construction of dense third-order tensors. A structural normalization at pivot nodes is introduced to control extreme degree heterogeneity and ensure stable optimization. The resulting objective can be optimized jointly with a graph neural network in an end-to-end manner, while retaining linear complexity in the number of edges. We validate the proposed framework on large-scale urban cadastral data, where it exhibits robust convergence behavior and produces spatially coherent partitions. These results highlight differentiable tripartite modularity as a generic methodological building block for unsupervised clustering of heterogeneous graphs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Building on recent advances in video generation, generative video compression has emerged as a new paradigm for achieving visually pleasing reconstructions. However, existing methods exhibit limited exploitation of temporal correlations, causing noticeable flicker and degraded temporal coherence at ultra-low bitrates. In this paper, we propose Free-GVC, a training-free generative video compression framework that reformulates video coding as latent trajectory compression guided by a video diffusion prior. Our method operates at the group-of-pictures (GOP) level, encoding video segments into a compact latent space and progressively compressing them along the diffusion trajectory. To ensure perceptually consistent reconstruction across GOPs, we introduce an Adaptive Quality Control module that dynamically constructs an online rate-perception surrogate model to predict the optimal diffusion step for each GOP. In addition, an Inter-GOP Alignment module establishes frame overlap and performs latent fusion between adjacent groups, thereby mitigating flicker and enhancing temporal coherence. Experiments show that Free-GVC achieves an average of 93.29% BD-Rate reduction in DISTS over the latest neural codec DCVC-RT, and a user study further confirms its superior perceptual quality and temporal coherence at ultra-low bitrates.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We study the performance of transformer architectures for multivariate time-series forecasting in low-data regimes consisting of only a few years of daily observations. Using synthetically generated processes with known temporal and cross-sectional dependency structures and varying signal-to-noise ratios, we conduct bootstrapped experiments that enable direct evaluation via out-of-sample correlations with the optimal ground-truth predictor. We show that two-way attention transformers, which alternate between temporal and cross-sectional self-attention, can outperform standard baselines-Lasso, boosting methods, and fully connected multilayer perceptrons-across a wide range of settings, including low signal-to-noise regimes. We further introduce a dynamic sparsification procedure for attention matrices applied during training, and demonstrate that it becomes significantly effective in noisy environments, where the correlation between the target variable and the optimal predictor is on the order of a few percent. Analysis of the learned attention patterns reveals interpretable structure and suggests connections to sparsity-inducing regularization in classical regression, providing insight into why these models generalize effectively under noise.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Steering methods influence Large Language Model behavior by identifying semantic directions in hidden representations, but are typically realized through inference-time activation interventions that apply a fixed, global modification to the model's internal states. While effective, such interventions often induce unfavorable attribute-utility trade-offs under strong control, as they ignore the fact that many behaviors are governed by a small and heterogeneous subset of model components. We propose Steer2Edit, a theoretically grounded, training-free framework that transforms steering vectors from inference-time control signals into diagnostic signals for component-level rank-1 weight editing. Instead of uniformly injecting a steering direction during generation, Steer2Edit selectively redistributes behavioral influence across individual attention heads and MLP neurons, yielding interpretable edits that preserve the standard forward pass and remain compatible with optimized parallel inference. Across safety alignment, hallucination mitigation, and reasoning efficiency, Steer2Edit consistently achieves more favorable attribute-utility trade-offs: at matched downstream performance, it improves safety by up to 17.2%, increases truthfulness by 9.8%, and reduces reasoning length by 12.2% on average. Overall, Steer2Edit provides a principled bridge between representation steering and weight editing by translating steering signals into interpretable, training-free parameter updates.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The emergence of multi-agent systems built from large language models (LLMs) offers a promising paradigm for scalable collective intelligence and self-evolution. Ideally, such systems would achieve continuous self-improvement in a fully closed loop while maintaining robust safety alignment--a combination we term the self-evolution trilemma. However, we demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that an agent society satisfying continuous self-evolution, complete isolation, and safety invariance is impossible. Drawing on an information-theoretic framework, we formalize safety as the divergence degree from anthropic value distributions. We theoretically demonstrate that isolated self-evolution induces statistical blind spots, leading to the irreversible degradation of the system's safety alignment. Empirical and qualitative results from an open-ended agent community (Moltbook) and two closed self-evolving systems reveal phenomena that align with our theoretical prediction of inevitable safety erosion. We further propose several solution directions to alleviate the identified safety concern. Our work establishes a fundamental limit on the self-evolving AI societies and shifts the discourse from symptom-driven safety patches to a principled understanding of intrinsic dynamical risks, highlighting the need for external oversight or novel safety-preserving mechanisms.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>World-model-based imagine-then-act becomes a promising paradigm for robotic manipulation, yet existing approaches typically support either purely image-based forecasting or reasoning over partial 3D geometry, limiting their ability to predict complete 4D scene dynamics. This work proposes a novel embodied 4D world model that enables geometrically consistent, arbitrary-view RGBD generation: given only a single-view RGBD observation as input, the model imagines the remaining viewpoints, which can then be back-projected and fused to assemble a more complete 3D structure across time. To efficiently learn the multi-view, cross-modality generation, we explicitly design cross-view and cross-modality feature fusion that jointly encourage consistency between RGB and depth and enforce geometric alignment across views. Beyond prediction, converting generated futures into actions is often handled by inverse dynamics, which is ill-posed because multiple actions can explain the same transition. We address this with a test-time action optimization strategy that backpropagates through the generative model to infer a trajectory-level latent best matching the predicted future, and a residual inverse dynamics model that turns this trajectory prior into accurate executable actions. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate strong performance on both 4D scene generation and downstream manipulation, and ablations provide practical insights into the key design choices.</li>

Commun. 2025) derived from the Tillich-Zemor paradigm (Eurocrypt 2008) with security rooted in the hardness of navigating expander graphs over SL_n(F_p), a problem believed to be hard even for quantum adversaries. We first provide empirical evidence of the security of this hash function, complementing the original theoretical analysis. We then show how the hash function can be integrated within the SPHINCS+ framework to give a secure signature scheme. We then model and analyze the security degradation of the proposed scheme, which informs the parameter selection we discuss next. Finally, we provide an implementation of the hash function and the proposed signature scheme Spinel as well as detailed empirical results for the performance of Spinel showing its feasibility in practice. Our approach lays the foundations for the design of algebraic hash-based signature schemes, expanding the toolkit of post-quantum cryptography.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, transformer, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have emerged as the state-of-the-art backbone for high-fidelity image and video generation. However, their massive computational cost and memory footprint hinder deployment on edge devices. While post-training quantization (PTQ) has proven effective for large language models (LLMs), directly applying existing methods to DiTs yields suboptimal results due to the neglect of the unique temporal dynamics inherent in diffusion processes. In this paper, we propose AdaTSQ, a novel PTQ framework that pushes the Pareto frontier of efficiency and quality by exploiting the temporal sensitivity of DiTs. First, we propose a Pareto-aware timestep-dynamic bit-width allocation strategy. We model the quantization policy search as a constrained pathfinding problem. We utilize a beam search algorithm guided by end-to-end reconstruction error to dynamically assign layer-wise bit-widths across different timesteps. Second, we propose a Fisher-guided temporal calibration mechanism. It leverages temporal Fisher information to prioritize calibration data from highly sensitive timesteps, seamlessly integrating with Hessian-based weight optimization. Extensive experiments on four advanced DiTs (e.g., Flux-Dev, Flux-Schnell, Z-Image, and Wan2.1) demonstrate that AdaTSQ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods like SVDQuant and ViDiT-Q. Our code will be released at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Since the COVID-19 pandemic, online courses have expanded access to education, yet the absence of direct instructor support challenges learners' ability to self-regulate attention and engagement. Mind wandering and disengagement can be detrimental to learning outcomes, making their automated detection via video-based indicators a promising approach for real-time learner support. However, machine learning-based approaches often require sharing sensitive data, raising privacy concerns. Federated learning offers a privacy-preserving alternative by enabling decentralized model training while also distributing computational load. We propose a framework exploiting cross-device federated learning to address different manifestations of behavioral and cognitive disengagement during remote learning, specifically behavioral disengagement, mind wandering, and boredom. We fit video-based cognitive disengagement detection models using facial expressions and gaze features. By adopting federated learning, we safeguard users' data privacy through privacy-by-design and introduce a novel solution with the potential for real-time learner support. We further address challenges posed by eyeglasses by incorporating related features, enhancing overall model performance. To validate the performance of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on five datasets and benchmark multiple federated learning algorithms. Our results show great promise for privacy-preserving educational technologies promoting learner engagement.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, protect, defense</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) framework provides a common standard for protecting sensitive unclassified information in defense contracting. While CMMC defines assessment objectives and control requirements, limited formal guidance exists regarding evidence sampling, the process by which assessors select, review, and validate artifacts to substantiate compliance. Analyzing data collected through an anonymous survey of CMMC-certified assessors and lead assessors, this exploratory study investigates whether inconsistencies in evidence sampling practices exist within the CMMC assessment ecosystem and evaluates the need for a risk-informed standardized sampling methodology. Across 17 usable survey responses, results indicate that evidence sampling practices are predominantly driven by assessor judgment, perceived risk, and environmental complexity rather than formalized standards, with formal statistical sampling models rarely referenced. Participants frequently reported inconsistencies across assessments and expressed broad support for the development of standardized guidance, while generally opposing rigid percentage-based requirements. The findings support the conclusion that the absence of a uniform evidence sampling framework introduces variability that may affect assessment reliability and confidence in certification outcomes. Recommendations are provided to inform future CMMC assessment methodology development and further empirical research.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Neural retrieval and GPT-style generative models rely on large, high-quality supervised data, which is still scarce for low-resource languages such as Amharic. We release an Amharic data resource consisting of two datasets that supports research on (i) neural retrieval-ranking and (ii) instruction-following text generation. The retrieval-ranking dataset contains 1,091 manually verified query-positive-negative document triplets drawn from diverse Amharic sources and constructed to support contrastive training and benchmarking of neural retrievers (e.g., DPR, ColBERT-style late interaction and SPLADE-style sparse neural retrieval). Triplets are created through a combination of expert-curated queries, web-derived queries, and LLM-assisted generation, with positive/negative documents selected from the web or synthesized by LLMs and then validated by native speakers. The instruction prompt-response dataset comprises 6,285 Amharic prompt-response pairs spanning multiple domains and instruction types, generated with several LLMs and refined through manual review and correction for grammaticality, relevance, fluency, and factual plausibility. We release both datasets with standardized splits and formats (CSV,JSON,JSONL) to enable reproducible work on Amharic retrieval, ranking, and generative modelling. These datasets also come with a methodology that can be generalized to other low-resource languages.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The design of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) hardware is a complex and hierarchical process with many challenges. A primary bottleneck is the conversion of PQC reference codes from C to high-level synthesis (HLS) specifications, which requires extensive manual refactoring [1]-[3]. Another bottleneck is the scalability of synthesis for complex PQC primitives, including number theoretic transform (NTT) accelerators and wide memory interfaces. While large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable results for coding in general-purpose languages like Python, coding for hardware design is more challenging; feedback-driven and agentic integration are key principles of successful state-of-the-art approaches. Here, we propose LLM4PQC, an LLM-based agentic framework that refactors high-level PQC specifications and reference C codes into HLS-ready and synthesizable C code. Our framework generates and verifies the resulting RTL code. For correctness, we leverage a hierarchy of checks, covering fast C compilation and simulation as well as RTL simulation. Case studies on NIST PQC reference designs demonstrate a reduction in manual effort and accelerated design-space exploration compared to traditional flows. Overall, LLM4PQC provides a powerful and efficient pathway for synthesizing complex hardware accelerators.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Monocular normal estimation aims to estimate the normal map from a single RGB image of an object under arbitrary lights. Existing methods rely on deep models to directly predict normal maps. However, they often suffer from 3D misalignment: while the estimated normal maps may appear to have a correct appearance, the reconstructed surfaces often fail to align with the geometric details. We argue that this misalignment stems from the current paradigm: the model struggles to distinguish and reconstruct varying geometry represented in normal maps, as the differences in underlying geometry are reflected only through relatively subtle color variations. To address this issue, we propose a new paradigm that reformulates normal estimation as shading sequence estimation, where shading sequences are more sensitive to various geometric information. Building on this paradigm, we present RoSE, a method that leverages image-to-video generative models to predict shading sequences. The predicted shading sequences are then converted into normal maps by solving a simple ordinary least-squares problem. To enhance robustness and better handle complex objects, RoSE is trained on a synthetic dataset, MultiShade, with diverse shapes, materials, and light conditions. Experiments demonstrate that RoSE achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world benchmark datasets for object-based monocular normal estimation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Accurate three-dimensional urban data are critical for climate modelling, disaster risk assessment, and urban planning, yet remain scarce due to reliance on proprietary sensors or poor cross-city generalisation. We propose GeoFormer, an open-source Swin Transformer framework that jointly estimates building height (BH) and footprint (BF) on a 100 m grid using only Sentinel-1/2 imagery and open DEM data. A geo-blocked splitting strategy ensures strict spatial independence between training and test sets. Evaluated over 54 diverse cities, GeoFormer achieves a BH RMSE of 3.19 m and a BF RMSE of 0.05, improving 7.5% and 15.3% over the strongest CNN baseline, while maintaining under 3.5 m BH RMSE in cross-continent transfer. Ablation studies confirm that DEM is indispensable for height estimation and that optical reflectance dominates over SAR, though multi-source fusion yields the best overall accuracy. All code, weights, and global products are publicly released.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Evaluating lesion evolution in longitudinal CT scans of can cer patients is essential for assessing treatment response, yet establishing reliable lesion correspondence across time remains challenging. Standard bipartite matchers, which rely on geometric proximity, struggle when lesions appear, disappear, merge, or split. We propose a registration-aware matcher based on unbalanced optimal transport (UOT) that accommodates unequal lesion mass and adapts priors to patient-level tumor-load changes. Our transport cost blends (i) size-normalized geometry, (ii) local registration trust from the deformation-field Jacobian, and (iii) optional patch-level appearance consistency. The resulting transport plan is sparsified by relative pruning, yielding one-to-one matches as well as new, disappearing, merging, and splitting lesions without retraining or heuristic rules. On longitudinal CT data, our approach achieves consistently higher edge-detection precision and recall, improved lesion-state recall, and superior lesion-graph component F1 scores versus distance-only baselines.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable success in visual-language understanding, demonstrating superior high-level semantic alignment within their vision encoders. An important question thus arises: Can these encoders serve as versatile vision backbones, capable of reliably performing classic vision-centric tasks as well? To address the question, we make the following contributions: (i) we identify that the vision encoders within MLLMs exhibit deficiencies in their dense feature representations, as evidenced by their suboptimal performance on dense prediction tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation, depth estimation); (ii) we propose VersaViT, a well-rounded vision transformer that instantiates a novel multi-task framework for collaborative post-training. This framework facilitates the optimization of the vision backbone via lightweight task heads with multi-granularity supervision; (iii) extensive experiments across various downstream tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, yielding a versatile vision backbone suited for both language-mediated reasoning and pixel-level understanding.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, defense, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Current agentic AI architectures are fundamentally incompatible with the security and epistemological requirements of high-stakes scientific workflows. The problem is not inadequate alignment or insufficient guardrails, it is architectural: autoregressive language models process all tokens uniformly, making deterministic command--data separation unattainable through training alone. We argue that deterministic, architectural enforcement, not probabilistic learned behavior, is a necessary condition for trustworthy AI-assisted science. We introduce the Trinity Defense Architecture, which enforces security through three mechanisms: action governance via a finite action calculus with reference-monitor enforcement, information-flow control via mandatory access labels preventing cross-scope leakage, and privilege separation isolating perception from execution. We show that without unforgeable provenance and deterministic mediation, the ``Lethal Trifecta'' (untrusted inputs, privileged data access, external action capability) turns authorization security into an exploit-discovery problem: training-based defenses may reduce empirical attack rates but cannot provide deterministic guarantees. The ML community must recognize that alignment is insufficient for authorization security, and that architectural mediation is required before agentic AI can be safely deployed in consequential scientific domains.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Urinary bladder cancer surveillance requires tracking tumor sites across repeated interventions, yet the deformable and hollow bladder lacks stable landmarks for orientation. While blood vessels visible during endoscopy offer a patient-specific "vascular fingerprint" for navigation, automated segmentation is challenged by imperfect endoscopic data, including sparse labels, artifacts like bubbles or variable lighting, continuous deformation, and mucosal folds that mimic vessels. State-of-the-art vessel segmentation methods often fail to address these domain-specific complexities. We introduce a Hybrid Attention-Convolution (HAC) architecture that combines Transformers to capture global vessel topology prior with a CNN that learns a residual refinement map to precisely recover thin-vessel details. To prioritize structural connectivity, the Transformer is trained on optimized ground truth data that exclude short and terminal branches. Furthermore, to address data scarcity, we employ a physics-aware pretraining, that is a self-supervised strategy using clinically grounded augmentations on unlabeled data. Evaluated on the BlaVeS dataset, consisting of endoscopic video frames, our approach achieves high accuracy (0.94) and superior precision (0.61) and clDice (0.66) compared to state-of-the-art medical segmentation models. Crucially, our method successfully suppresses false positives from mucosal folds that dynamically appear and vanish as the bladder fills and empties during surgery. Hence, HAC provides the reliable structural stability required for clinical navigation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Accurate modeling of drug release is essential for designing and developing controlled-release systems. Classical models (Fick, Higuchi, Peppas) rely on simplifying assumptions that limit their accuracy in complex geometries and release mechanisms. Here, we propose a novel approach using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Bayesian PINNs (BPINNs) for predicting release from planar, 1D-wrinkled, and 2D-crumpled films. This approach uniquely integrates Fick's diffusion law with limited experimental data to enable accurate long-term predictions from short-term measurements, and is systematically benchmarked against classical drug release models. We embedded Fick's second law into PINN as loss with 10,000 Latin-hypercube collocation points and utilized previously published experimental datasets to assess drug release performance through mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE), considering noisy conditions and limited-data scenarios. Our approach reduced mean error by up to 40% relative to classical baselines across all film types. The PINN formulation achieved RMSE <0.05 utilizing only the first 6% of the release time data (reducing 94% of release time required for the experiments) for the planar film. For wrinkled and crumpled films, the PINN reached RMSE <0.05 in 33% of the release time data. BPINNs provide tighter and more reliable uncertainty quantification under noise. By combining physical laws with experimental data, the proposed framework yields highly accurate long-term release predictions from short-term measurements, offering a practical route for accelerated characterization and more efficient early-stage drug release system formulation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Monitoring leftover products provides valuable insights that can be used to optimize future production. This is especially important for German bakeries because freshly baked goods have a very short shelf life. Automating this process can reduce labor costs, improve accuracy, and streamline operations. We propose automating this process using an object detection model to identify baked goods from images. However, the large diversity of German baked goods makes fully supervised training prohibitively expensive and limits scalability. Although open-vocabulary detectors (e.g., OWLv2, Grounding DINO) offer lexibility, we demonstrate that they are insufficient for our task. While motivated by bakeries, our work addresses the broader challenges of deploying computer vision in industries, where tasks are specialized and annotated datasets are scarce. We compile dataset splits with varying supervision levels, covering 19 classes of baked goods. We propose two training workflows to train an object detection model with limited supervision. First, we combine OWLv2 and Grounding DINO localization with image-level supervision to train the model in a weakly supervised manner. Second, we improve viewpoint robustness by fine-tuning on video frames annotated using Segment Anything 2 as a pseudo-label propagation model. Using these workflows, we train YOLOv11 for our detection task due to its favorable speed accuracy tradeoff. Relying solely on image-level supervision, the model achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.91. Finetuning with pseudo-labels raises model performance by 19.3% under non-ideal deployment conditions. Combining these workflows trains a model that surpasses our fully-supervised baseline model under non-ideal deployment conditions, despite relying only on image-level supervision.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Many visual scenes can be described as compositions of latent factors. Effective recognition, reasoning, and editing often require not only forming such compositional representations, but also solving the decomposition problem. One popular choice for constructing these representations is through the binding operation. Resonator networks, which can be understood as coupled Hopfield networks, were proposed as a way to perform decomposition on such bound representations. Recent works have shown notable similarities between Hopfield networks and diffusion models. Motivated by these observations, we introduce a framework for semantic decomposition using coupled inference in diffusion models. Our method frames semantic decomposition as an inverse problem and couples the diffusion processes using a reconstruction-driven guidance term that encourages the composition of factor estimates to match the bound vector. We also introduce a novel iterative sampling scheme that improves the performance of our model. Finally, we show that attention-based resonator networks are a special case of our framework. Empirically, we demonstrate that our coupled inference framework outperforms resonator networks across a range of synthetic semantic decomposition tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Influence functions are commonly used to attribute model behavior to training documents. We explore the reverse: crafting training data that induces model behavior. Our framework, Infusion, uses scalable influence-function approximations to compute small perturbations to training documents that induce targeted changes in model behavior through parameter shifts. We evaluate Infusion on data poisoning tasks across vision and language domains. On CIFAR-10, we show that making subtle edits via Infusion to just 0.2% (100/45,000) of the training documents can be competitive with the baseline of inserting a small number of explicit behavior examples. We also find that Infusion transfers across architectures (ResNet $\leftrightarrow$ CNN), suggesting a single poisoned corpus can affect multiple independently trained models. In preliminary language experiments, we characterize when our approach increases the probability of target behaviors and when it fails, finding it most effective at amplifying behaviors the model has already learned. Taken together, these results show that small, subtle edits to training data can systematically shape model behavior, underscoring the importance of training data interpretability for adversaries and defenders alike.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Stains are essential in histopathology to visualize specific tissue characteristics, with Haematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) serving as the clinical standard. However, pathologists frequently utilize a variety of special stains for the diagnosis of specific morphologies. Maintaining accurate metadata for these slides is critical for quality control in clinical archives and for the integrity of computational pathology datasets. In this work, we compare two approaches for automated classification of stains using whole slide images, covering the 14 most commonly used special stains in our institute alongside standard and frozen-section H&E. We evaluate a Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) pipeline and a proposed lightweight thumbnail-based approach. On internal test data, MIL achieved the highest performance (macro F1: 0.941 for 16 classes; 0.969 for 14 merged classes), while the thumbnail approach remained competitive (0.897 and 0.953, respectively). On external TCGA data, the thumbnail model generalized best (weighted F1: 0.843 vs. 0.807 for MIL). The thumbnail approach also increased throughput by two orders of magnitude (5.635 vs. 0.018 slides/s for MIL with all patches). We conclude that thumbnail-based classification provides a scalable and robust solution for routine visual quality control in digital pathology workflows.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>How can children acquire native-level syntax from limited input? According to the Poverty of the Stimulus Hypothesis (PoSH), the linguistic input children receive is insufficient to explain certain generalizations that are robustly learned; innate linguistic constraints, many have argued, are thus necessary to explain language learning. Neural language models, which lack such language-specific constraints in their design, offer a computational test of this longstanding (but controversial) claim. We introduce \poshbench, a training-and-evaluation suite targeting question formation, islands to movement, and other English phenomena at the center of the PoSH arguments. Training Transformer models on 10--50M words of developmentally plausible text, we find indications of generalization on all phenomena even without direct positive evidence -- yet neural models remain less data-efficient and their generalizations are weaker than those of children. We further enhance our models with three recently proposed cognitively motivated inductive biases. We find these biases improve general syntactic competence but not \poshbench performance. Our findings challenge the claim that innate syntax is the only possible route to generalization, while suggesting that human-like data efficiency requires inductive biases beyond those tested here.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have focused on accelerating optimization while preserving reconstruction quality. However, many proposed methods entangle implementation-level improvements with fundamental algorithmic modifications or trade performance for fidelity, leading to a fragmented research landscape that complicates fair comparison. In this work, we consolidate and evaluate the most effective and broadly applicable strategies from prior 3DGS research and augment them with several novel optimizations. We further investigate underexplored aspects of the framework, including numerical stability, Gaussian truncation, and gradient approximation. The resulting system, Faster-GS, provides a rigorously optimized algorithm that we evaluate across a comprehensive suite of benchmarks. Our experiments demonstrate that Faster-GS achieves up to 5$\times$ faster training while maintaining visual quality, establishing a new cost-effective and resource efficient baseline for 3DGS optimization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that optimizations can be applied to 4D Gaussian reconstruction, leading to efficient non-rigid scene optimization.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Building a search relevance model that achieves both low latency and high performance is a long-standing challenge in the search industry. To satisfy the millisecond-level response requirements of online systems while retaining the interpretable reasoning traces of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose a novel \textbf{Answer-First, Reason Later (AFRL)} paradigm. This paradigm requires the model to output the definitive relevance score in the very first token, followed by a structured logical explanation. Inspired by the success of reasoning models, we adopt a "Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) + Reinforcement Learning (RL)" pipeline to achieve AFRL. However, directly applying existing RL training often leads to \textbf{mode collapse} in the search relevance task, where the model forgets complex long-tail rules in pursuit of high rewards. From an information theory perspective: RL inherently minimizes the \textbf{Reverse KL divergence}, which tends to seek probability peaks (mode-seeking) and is prone to "reward hacking." On the other hand, SFT minimizes the \textbf{Forward KL divergence}, forcing the model to cover the data distribution (mode-covering) and effectively anchoring expert rules. Based on this insight, we propose a \textbf{Mode-Balanced Optimization} strategy, incorporating an SFT auxiliary loss into Stepwise-GRPO training to balance these two properties. Furthermore, we construct an automated instruction evolution system and a multi-stage curriculum to ensure expert-level data quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our 32B teacher model achieves state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, the AFRL architecture enables efficient knowledge distillation, successfully transferring expert-level logic to a 0.6B model, thereby reconciling reasoning depth with deployment latency.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Iterative self-improvement fine-tunes an autoregressive large language model (LLM) on reward-verified outputs generated by the LLM itself. In contrast to the empirical success of self-improvement, the theoretical foundation of this generative, iterative procedure in a practical, finite-sample setting remains limited. We make progress toward this goal by modeling each round of self-improvement as maximum-likelihood fine-tuning on a reward-filtered distribution and deriving finite-sample guarantees for the expected reward. Our analysis reveals an explicit feedback loop where better models accept more data per iteration, supporting sustained self-improvement while explaining eventual saturation of such improvement. Adopting a task-centric view by considering reasoning tasks with multiple difficulty levels, we further prove quantifiable conditions on model initialization, task difficulty, and sample budget where easy-to-hard curricula provably achieve better guarantees than training on fixed mixtures of tasks. Our analyses are validated via Monte-Carlo simulations and controlled experiments on graph-based reasoning tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to support question answering and decision-making in high-stakes, domain-specific settings such as natural hazard response and infrastructure planning, where effective answers must convey fine-grained, decision-critical details. However, existing evaluation frameworks for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and open-ended question answering primarily rely on surface-level similarity, factual consistency, or semantic relevance, and often fail to assess whether responses provide the specific information required for domain-sensitive decisions. To address this gap, we propose a multi-dimensional, reference-free evaluation framework that assesses LLM outputs along four complementary dimensions: specificity, robustness to paraphrasing and semantic perturbations, answer relevance, and context utilization. We introduce a curated dataset of 1,412 domain-specific question-answer pairs spanning 40 professional roles and seven natural hazard types to support systematic evaluation. We further conduct human evaluation to assess inter-annotator agreement and alignment between model outputs and human judgments, which highlights the inherent subjectivity of open-ended, domain-specific evaluation. Our results show that no single metric sufficiently captures answer quality in isolation and demonstrate the need for structured, multi-metric evaluation frameworks when deploying LLMs in high-stakes applications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Reinforcement learning has become a cornerstone technique for developing reasoning models in complex tasks, ranging from mathematical problem-solving to imaginary reasoning. The optimization of these models typically relies on policy gradient methods, whose efficacy hinges on the accurate estimation of an advantage function. However, prevailing methods typically employ static advantage estimation, a practice that leads to inefficient credit assignment by neglecting the dynamic utility of training samples over time. This limitation results in suboptimal policy updates, which in turn manifest as slower convergence rates and increased learning instability, as models fail to adapt to evolving sample utilities effectively. To address this problem, we introduce \textbf{ADORA} (\textbf{A}dvantage \textbf{D}ynamics via \textbf{O}nline \textbf{R}ollout \textbf{A}daptation), a novel framework for policy optimization. ADORA dynamically adjusts the advantage function's weighting by adaptively categorizing training data into temporarily advantageous and disadvantageous samples, based on their evolving utility during online model rollouts. This tailored data differentiation strategy allows ADORA to be seamlessly integrated into existing policy optimization algorithms without significant architectural modifications, enabling the policy to prioritize learning from more informative experiences and thereby achieve more efficient policy updates. Extensive evaluations across diverse model families and varying data scales demonstrate that ADORA is a robust and efficient framework. It significantly enhances long reasoning in both geometric and mathematical tasks, consistently achieving notable performance gains without requiring sensitive hyperparameter tuning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The integration of extensive, dynamic knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs) remains a significant challenge due to the inherent entanglement of factual data and reasoning patterns. Existing solutions, ranging from non-parametric Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to parametric knowledge editing, are often constrained in practice by finite context windows, retriever noise, or the risk of catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we propose DRIFT, a novel dual-model architecture designed to explicitly decouple knowledge extraction from the reasoning process. Unlike static prompt compression, DRIFT employs a lightweight knowledge model to dynamically compress document chunks into implicit fact tokens conditioned on the query. These dense representations are projected into the reasoning model's embedding space, replacing raw, redundant text while maintaining inference accuracy. Extensive experiments show that DRIFT significantly improves performance on long-context tasks, outperforming strong baselines among comparably sized models. Our approach provides a scalable and efficient paradigm for extending the effective context window and reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Our code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>explainability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Verifying the truthfulness of claims usually requires joint multi-modal reasoning over both textual and visual evidence, such as analyzing both textual caption and chart image for claim verification. In addition, to make the reasoning process transparent, a textual explanation is necessary to justify the verification result. However, most claim verification works mainly focus on the reasoning over textual evidence only or ignore the explainability, resulting in inaccurate and unconvincing verification. To address this problem, we propose a novel model that jointly achieves evidence retrieval, multi-modal claim verification, and explanation generation. For evidence retrieval, we construct a two-layer multi-modal graph for claims and evidence, where we design image-to-text and text-to-image reasoning for multi-modal retrieval. For claim verification, we propose token- and evidence-level fusion to integrate claim and evidence embeddings for multi-modal verification. For explanation generation, we introduce multi-modal Fusion-in-Decoder for explainability. Finally, since almost all the datasets are in general domain, we create a scientific dataset, AIChartClaim, in AI domain to complement claim verification community. Experiments show the strength of our model.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent studies have demonstrated that incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning into the detection process can enhance a model's ability to detect synthetic images. However, excessively lengthy reasoning incurs substantial resource overhead, including token consumption and latency, which is particularly redundant when handling obviously generated forgeries. To address this issue, we propose Fake-HR1, a large-scale hybrid-reasoning model that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to adaptively determine whether reasoning is necessary based on the characteristics of the generative detection task. To achieve this, we design a two-stage training framework: we first perform Hybrid Fine-Tuning (HFT) for cold-start initialization, followed by online reinforcement learning with Hybrid-Reasoning Grouped Policy Optimization (HGRPO) to implicitly learn when to select an appropriate reasoning mode. Experimental results show that Fake-HR1 adaptively performs reasoning across different types of queries, surpassing existing LLMs in both reasoning ability and generative detection performance, while significantly improving response efficiency.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Head Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is routinely collected and shared for research under strict regulatory frameworks. These frameworks require removing potential identifiers before sharing. But, even after skull stripping, the brain parenchyma contains unique signatures that can match other MRIs from the same participants across databases, posing a privacy risk if additional data features are available. Current regulatory frameworks often mandate evaluating such risks based on the assessment of a certain level of reasonableness. Prior studies have already suggested that a brain MRI could enable participant linkage, but they have relied on training-based or computationally intensive methods. Here, we demonstrate that linking an individual's skull-stripped T1-weighted MRI, which may lead to re-identification if other identifiers are available, is possible using standard preprocessing followed by image similarity computation. Nearly perfect linkage accuracy was achieved in matching data samples across various time intervals, scanner types, spatial resolutions, and acquisition protocols, despite potential cognitive decline, simulating MRI matching across databases. These results aim to contribute meaningfully to the development of thoughtful, forward-looking policies in medical data sharing.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Current instance segmentation models achieve high performance on average predictions, but lack principled uncertainty quantification: their outputs are not calibrated, and there is no guarantee that a predicted mask is close to the ground truth. To address this limitation, we introduce a conformal prediction algorithm to generate adaptive confidence sets for instance segmentation. Given an image and a pixel coordinate query, our algorithm generates a confidence set of instance predictions for that pixel, with a provable guarantee for the probability that at least one of the predictions has high Intersection-Over-Union (IoU) with the true object instance mask. We apply our algorithm to instance segmentation examples in agricultural field delineation, cell segmentation, and vehicle detection. Empirically, we find that our prediction sets vary in size based on query difficulty and attain the target coverage, outperforming existing baselines such as Learn Then Test, Conformal Risk Control, and morphological dilation-based methods. We provide versions of the algorithm with asymptotic and finite sample guarantees.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate unnecessarily verbose Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning that increases computational costs and latency without proportional performance gains. In this paper, we propose \textbf{F}ine-grained \textbf{G}roup policy \textbf{O}ptimization (\textbf{FGO}), a Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm that refines group responses by subdividing them and assigning appropriate weights based on length and entropy, thereby enabling effective CoT compression. Meanwhile, as an enhanced variant of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), FGO successfully addresses two major limitations of the GRPO: inefficient data utilization and entropy collapse. We evaluate FGO on multiple reasoning LLMs and benchmarks, including MATH500, AIME24, AMC23, and Minerva. Experimental results show that FGO achieves efficient CoT compression without degrading performance, and simultaneously resolves the key limitations of GRPO.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep neural networks, especially transformer-based architectures, have achieved remarkable success in semantic segmentation for environmental perception. However, existing models process video frames independently, thus failing to leverage temporal consistency, which could significantly improve both accuracy and stability in dynamic scenes. In this work, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Attention (STA) mechanism that extends transformer attention blocks to incorporate multi-frame context, enabling robust temporal feature representations for video semantic segmentation. Our approach modifies standard self-attention to process spatio-temporal feature sequences while maintaining computational efficiency and requiring minimal changes to existing architectures. STA demonstrates broad applicability across diverse transformer architectures and remains effective across both lightweight and larger-scale models. A comprehensive evaluation on the Cityscapes and BDD100k datasets shows substantial improvements of 9.20 percentage points in temporal consistency metrics and up to 1.76 percentage points in mean intersection over union compared to single-frame baselines. These results demonstrate STA as an effective architectural enhancement for video-based semantic segmentation applications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Language models trained on large-scale datasets have been shown to learn features that encode abstract concepts such as factuality or intent. Such features are traditionally used for test-time monitoring or steering. We present an alternative affordance: features as scalable supervision for open-ended tasks. We consider the case of hallucination-reduction as a desirable, yet open-ended behavior and design a reinforcement learning (RL) pipeline, titled RLFR (Reinforcement Learning from Feature Rewards), that uses features as reward functions. Grounded in a novel probing framework that identifies candidate hallucinated claims, our pipeline teaches a model to intervene and correct its completions when it is uncertain of their factuality. Furthermore, the pipeline enables scalable test-time compute, guided once more by our reward features. This end-to-end process operationalized on Gemma-3-12B-IT results in a policy that is 58% less likely to hallucinate compared to the original model, while preserving performance on standard benchmarks. Taken together, by grounding supervision in the language of features, this paper introduces a novel paradigm in the use of interpretability for learning open-ended tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Detecting personally identifiable information (PII) in user queries is critical for ensuring privacy in question-answering systems. Current approaches mainly redact all PII, disregarding the fact that some of them may be contextually relevant to the user's question, resulting in a degradation of response quality. Large language models (LLMs) might be able to help determine which PII are relevant, but due to their closed source nature and lack of privacy guarantees, they are unsuitable for sensitive data processing. To achieve privacy-preserving PII detection, we propose CAPID, a practical approach that fine-tunes a locally owned small language model (SLM) that filters sensitive information before it is passed to LLMs for QA. However, existing datasets do not capture the context-dependent relevance of PII needed to train such a model effectively. To fill this gap, we propose a synthetic data generation pipeline that leverages LLMs to produce a diverse, domain-rich dataset spanning multiple PII types and relevance levels. Using this dataset, we fine-tune an SLM to detect PII spans, classify their types, and estimate contextual relevance. Our experiments show that relevance-aware PII detection with a fine-tuned SLM substantially outperforms existing baselines in span, relevance and type accuracy while preserving significantly higher downstream utility under anonymization.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Language models have become practical tools for quantum computing education and research, from summarizing technical papers to explaining theoretical concepts and answering questions about recent developments in the field. While existing benchmarks evaluate quantum code generation and circuit design, their understanding of quantum computing concepts has not been systematically measured. Quantum-Audit addresses this gap with 2,700 questions covering core quantum computing topics. We evaluate 26 models from leading organizations. Our benchmark comprises 1,000 expert-written questions, 1,000 questions extracted from research papers using LLMs and validated by experts, plus an additional 700 questions including 350 open-ended questions and 350 questions with false premises to test whether models can correct erroneous assumptions. Human participants scored between 23% and 86%, with experts averaging 74%. Top-performing models exceeded the expert average, with Claude Opus 4.5 reaching 84% accuracy, though top models showed an average 12-point accuracy drop on expert-written questions compared to LLM-generated ones. Performance declined further on advanced topics, dropping to 73% on security questions. Additionally, models frequently accepted and reinforced false premises embedded in questions instead of identifying them, with accuracy below 66% on these critical reasoning tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present 4RC, a unified feed-forward framework for 4D reconstruction from monocular videos. Unlike existing approaches that typically decouple motion from geometry or produce limited 4D attributes such as sparse trajectories or two-view scene flow, 4RC learns a holistic 4D representation that jointly captures dense scene geometry and motion dynamics. At its core, 4RC introduces a novel encode-once, query-anywhere and anytime paradigm: a transformer backbone encodes the entire video into a compact spatio-temporal latent space, from which a conditional decoder can efficiently query 3D geometry and motion for any query frame at any target timestamp. To facilitate learning, we represent per-view 4D attributes in a minimally factorized form by decomposing them into base geometry and time-dependent relative motion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 4RC outperforms prior and concurrent methods across a wide range of 4D reconstruction tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, transformer, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Causality -- referring to temporal, uni-directional cause-effect relationships between components -- underlies many complex generative processes, including videos, language, and robot trajectories. Current causal diffusion models entangle temporal reasoning with iterative denoising, applying causal attention across all layers, at every denoising step, and over the entire context. In this paper, we show that the causal reasoning in these models is separable from the multi-step denoising process. Through systematic probing of autoregressive video diffusers, we uncover two key regularities: (1) early layers produce highly similar features across denoising steps, indicating redundant computation along the diffusion trajectory; and (2) deeper layers exhibit sparse cross-frame attention and primarily perform intra-frame rendering. Motivated by these findings, we introduce Separable Causal Diffusion (SCD), a new architecture that explicitly decouples once-per-frame temporal reasoning, via a causal transformer encoder, from multi-step frame-wise rendering, via a lightweight diffusion decoder. Extensive experiments on both pretraining and post-training tasks across synthetic and real benchmarks show that SCD significantly improves throughput and per-frame latency while matching or surpassing the generation quality of strong causal diffusion baselines.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We study how individual training examples shape the internal computation of looped transformers, where a shared block is applied for $\tau$ recurrent iterations to enable latent reasoning. Existing training-data influence estimators such as TracIn yield a single scalar score that aggregates over all loop iterations, obscuring when during the recurrent computation a training example matters. We introduce \textit{Step-Decomposed Influence (SDI)}, which decomposes TracIn into a length-$\tau$ influence trajectory by unrolling the recurrent computation graph and attributing influence to specific loop iterations. To make SDI practical at transformer scale, we propose a TensorSketch implementation that never materialises per-example gradients. Experiments on looped GPT-style models and algorithmic reasoning tasks show that SDI scales excellently, matches full-gradient baselines with low error and supports a broad range of data attribution and interpretability tasks with per-step insights into the latent reasoning process.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, transformer, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Leveraging representation encoders for generative modeling offers a path for efficient, high-fidelity synthesis. However, standard diffusion transformers fail to converge on these representations directly. While recent work attributes this to a capacity bottleneck proposing computationally expensive width scaling of diffusion transformers we demonstrate that the failure is fundamentally geometric. We identify Geometric Interference as the root cause: standard Euclidean flow matching forces probability paths through the low-density interior of the hyperspherical feature space of representation encoders, rather than following the manifold surface. To resolve this, we propose Riemannian Flow Matching with Jacobi Regularization (RJF). By constraining the generative process to the manifold geodesics and correcting for curvature-induced error propagation, RJF enables standard Diffusion Transformer architectures to converge without width scaling. Our method RJF enables the standard DiT-B architecture (131M parameters) to converge effectively, achieving an FID of 3.37 where prior methods fail to converge. Code: this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, protect, federate, explainability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Data privacy and eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) are two important aspects for modern Machine Learning systems. To enhance data privacy, recent machine learning models have been designed as a Federated Learning (FL) system. On top of that, additional privacy layers can be added, via Differential Privacy (DP). On the other hand, to improve explainability, ML must consider more interpretable approaches with reduced number of features and less complex internal architecture. In this context, this paper aims to achieve a machine learning (ML) model that combines enhanced data privacy with explainability. So, we propose a FL solution, called Federated EXplainable Trees with Differential Privacy (FEXT-DP), that: (i) is based on Decision Trees, since they are lightweight and have superior explainability than neural networks-based FL systems; (ii) provides additional layer of data privacy protection applying Differential Privacy (DP) to the Tree-Based model. However, there is a side effect adding DP: it harms the explainability of the system. So, this paper also presents the impact of DP protection on the explainability of the ML model. The carried out performance assessment shows improvements of FEXT-DP in terms of a faster training, i.e., numbers of rounds, Mean Squared Error and explainability.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Learning transferable knowledge from unlabeled video data and applying it in new environments is a fundamental capability of intelligent agents. This work presents VideoWorld 2, which extends VideoWorld and offers the first investigation into learning transferable knowledge directly from raw real-world videos. At its core, VideoWorld 2 introduces a dynamic-enhanced Latent Dynamics Model (dLDM) that decouples action dynamics from visual appearance: a pretrained video diffusion model handles visual appearance modeling, enabling the dLDM to learn latent codes that focus on compact and meaningful task-related dynamics. These latent codes are then modeled autoregressively to learn task policies and support long-horizon reasoning. We evaluate VideoWorld 2 on challenging real-world handcraft making tasks, where prior video generation and latent-dynamics models struggle to operate reliably. Remarkably, VideoWorld 2 achieves up to 70% improvement in task success rate and produces coherent long execution videos. In robotics, we show that VideoWorld 2 can acquire effective manipulation knowledge from the Open-X dataset, which substantially improves task performance on CALVIN. This study reveals the potential of learning transferable world knowledge directly from raw videos, with all code, data, and models to be open-sourced for further research.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Image-to-Video generation (I2V) animates a static image into a temporally coherent video sequence following textual instructions, yet preserving fine-grained object identity under changing viewpoints remains a persistent challenge. Unlike text-to-video models, existing I2V pipelines often suffer from appearance drift and geometric distortion, artifacts we attribute to the sparsity of single-view 2D observations and weak cross-modal alignment. Here we address this problem from both data and model perspectives. First, we curate ConsIDVid, a large-scale object-centric dataset built with a scalable pipeline for high-quality, temporally aligned videos, and establish ConsIDVid-Bench, where we present a novel benchmarking and evaluation framework for multi-view consistency using metrics sensitive to subtle geometric and appearance deviations. We further propose ConsID-Gen, a view-assisted I2V generation framework that augments the first frame with unposed auxiliary views and fuses semantic and structural cues via a dual-stream visual-geometric encoder as well as a text-visual connector, yielding unified conditioning for a Diffusion Transformer backbone. Experiments across ConsIDVid-Bench demonstrate that ConsID-Gen consistently outperforms in multiple metrics, with the best overall performance surpassing leading video generation models like Wan2.1 and HunyuanVideo, delivering superior identity fidelity and temporal coherence under challenging real-world scenarios. We will release our model and dataset at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) often provide chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning traces that appear plausible, but may hide internal biases. We call these *unverbalized biases*. Monitoring models via their stated reasoning is therefore unreliable, and existing bias evaluations typically require predefined categories and hand-crafted datasets. In this work, we introduce a fully automated, black-box pipeline for detecting task-specific unverbalized biases. Given a task dataset, the pipeline uses LLM autoraters to generate candidate bias concepts. It then tests each concept on progressively larger input samples by generating positive and negative variations, and applies statistical techniques for multiple testing and early stopping. A concept is flagged as an unverbalized bias if it yields statistically significant performance differences while not being cited as justification in the model's CoTs. We evaluate our pipeline across six LLMs on three decision tasks (hiring, loan approval, and university admissions). Our technique automatically discovers previously unknown biases in these models (e.g., Spanish fluency, English proficiency, writing formality). In the same run, the pipeline also validates biases that were manually identified by prior work (gender, race, religion, ethnicity). More broadly, our proposed approach provides a practical, scalable path to automatic task-specific bias discovery.</li>
