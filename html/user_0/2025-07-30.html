<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, privacy, protect</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into medical diagnostics has raised pressing concerns about patient privacy, especially when sensitive imaging data must be transferred, stored, or processed. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for privacy-preserving diagnostic inference on encrypted medical images using a modified convolutional neural network (Masked-CNN) capable of operating on transformed or ciphered image formats. Our approach leverages AES-CBC encryption coupled with JPEG2000 compression to protect medical images while maintaining their suitability for AI inference. We evaluate the system using public DICOM datasets (NIH ChestX-ray14 and LIDC-IDRI), focusing on diagnostic accuracy, inference latency, storage efficiency, and privacy leakage resistance. Experimental results show that the encrypted inference model achieves performance comparable to its unencrypted counterpart, with only marginal trade-offs in accuracy and latency. The proposed framework bridges the gap between data privacy and clinical utility, offering a practical, scalable solution for secure AI-driven diagnostics.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>What makes safety claims about general purpose AI systems such as large language models trustworthy? We show that rather than the capabilities of security tools such as alignment and red teaming procedures, it is security practices based on these tools that contributed to reconfiguring the image of AI safety and made the claims acceptable. After showing what causes the gap between the capabilities of security tools and the desired safety guarantees, we critically investigate how AI security practices attempt to fill the gap and identify several shortcomings in diversity and participation. We found that these security practices are part of securitization processes aiming to support (commercial) development of general purpose AI systems whose trustworthiness can only be imperfectly tested instead of guaranteed. We conclude by offering several improvements to the current AI security practices.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing extensive offline datasets. However, they often face challenges in acquiring and integrating complex, knowledge online. Traditional AI training paradigms, predominantly based on supervised learning or reinforcement learning, mirror a 'Piagetian' model of independent exploration. These approaches typically rely on large datasets and sparse feedback signals, limiting the models' ability to learn efficiently from interactions. Drawing inspiration from Vygotsky's sociocultural theory, this study explores the potential of socially mediated learning paradigms to address these limitations. We introduce a dynamic environment, termed the 'AI Social Gym', where an AI learner agent engages in dyadic pedagogical dialogues with knowledgeable AI teacher agents. These interactions emphasize external, structured dialogue as a core mechanism for knowledge acquisition, contrasting with methods that depend solely on internal inference or pattern recognition. Our investigation focuses on how different pedagogical strategies impact the AI learning process in the context of ontology acquisition. Empirical results indicate that such dialogic approaches-particularly those involving mixed-direction interactions combining top-down explanations with learner-initiated questioning-significantly enhance the LLM's ability to acquire and apply new knowledge, outperforming both unidirectional instructional methods and direct access to structured knowledge, formats typically present in training datasets. These findings suggest that integrating pedagogical and psychological insights into AI and robot training can substantially improve post-training knowledge acquisition and response quality. This approach offers a complementary pathway to existing strategies like prompt engineering</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, protect, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose a technique to protect and preserve a private key or a passcode in an encrypted two-dimensional graphical image. The plaintext private key or the passcode is converted into an encrypted QR code and embedded into a real-life color image with a steganographic scheme. The private key or the passcode is recovered from the stego color image by first extracting the encrypted QR code from the color image, followed by decryption of the QR code. The cryptographic key for encryption of the QR code is generated from the output of a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR), initialized by a seed image chosen by the user. The user can store the seed image securely, without the knowledge of an attacker. Even if an active attacker modifies the seed image (without knowledge of the fact that it is the seed image), the user can easily restore it if he/she keeps multiple copies of it, so that the encryption key can be regenerated easily. Our experiments prove the feasibility of the technique using sample private key data and real-life color images.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs) offer a cost-effective and scalable means to assess human movement quality in clinical and everyday settings. However, the development of robust sensor-based classification models for physiotherapeutic exercises and gait analysis requires large, diverse datasets, which are costly and time-consuming to collect. Here, we present a multimodal dataset of physiotherapeutic exercises - including correct and clinically relevant variants - and gait-related exercises - including both normal and impaired gait patterns - recorded from 19 participants using synchronized IMUs and marker-based motion capture (MoCap). The dataset includes raw data from nine IMUs and thirty-five optical markers capturing full-body kinematics. Each IMU is additionally equipped with four optical markers, enabling precise comparison between IMU-derived orientation estimates and reference values from the MoCap system. To support further analysis, we also provide processed IMU orientations aligned with common segment coordinate systems, subject-specific OpenSim models, inverse kinematics results, and tools for visualizing IMU orientations in the musculoskeletal context. Detailed annotations of movement execution quality and time-stamped segmentations support diverse analysis goals. This dataset supports the development and benchmarking of machine learning models for tasks such as automatic exercise evaluation, gait analysis, temporal activity segmentation, and biomechanical parameter estimation. To facilitate reproducibility, we provide code for postprocessing, sensor-to-segment alignment, inverse kinematics computation, and technical validation. This resource is intended to accelerate research in machine learning-driven human movement analysis.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models like GPT-4 adjust their responses not only based on the question asked, but also on how it is emotionally phrased. We systematically vary the emotional tone of 156 prompts - spanning controversial and everyday topics - and analyze how it affects model responses. Our findings show that GPT-4 is three times less likely to respond negatively to a negatively framed question than to a neutral one. This suggests a "rebound" bias where the model overcorrects, often shifting toward neutrality or positivity. On sensitive topics (e.g., justice or politics), this effect is even more pronounced: tone-based variation is suppressed, suggesting an alignment override. We introduce concepts like the "tone floor" - a lower bound in response negativity - and use tone-valence transition matrices to quantify behavior. Visualizations based on 1536-dimensional embeddings confirm semantic drift based on tone. Our work highlights an underexplored class of biases driven by emotional framing in prompts, with implications for AI alignment and trust. Code and data are available at: this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) are frequently fine-tuned or unlearned to adapt to new tasks or eliminate undesirable behaviors. While existing evaluation methods assess performance after such interventions, there remains no general approach for detecting unintended side effects, such as unlearning biology content degrading performance on chemistry tasks, particularly when these effects are unpredictable or emergent. To address this issue, we introduce MNEME, Model diffiNg for Evaluating Mechanistic Effects, a lightweight framework for identifying these side effects using sparse model diffing. MNEME compares base and fine-tuned models on task-agnostic data (for example, The Pile, LMSYS-Chat-1M) without access to fine-tuning data to isolate behavioral shifts. Applied to five LLMs across three scenarios: WMDP knowledge unlearning, emergent misalignment, and benign fine-tuning, MNEME achieves up to 95 percent accuracy in predicting side effects, aligning with known benchmarks and requiring no custom heuristics. Furthermore, we show that retraining on high-activation samples can partially reverse these effects. Our results demonstrate that sparse probing and diffing offer a scalable and automated lens into fine-tuning-induced model changes, providing practical tools for understanding and managing LLM behavior.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, privacy</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper explores how zero-knowledge proofs can enhance Bitcoin's functionality and privacy. First, we consider Proof-of-Reserve schemes: by using zk-STARKs, a custodian can prove its Bitcoin holdings are more than a predefined threshold X, without revealing addresses or actual balances. We outline a STARK-based protocol for Bitcoin UTXOs and discuss its efficiency. Second, we examine ZK Light Clients, where a mobile or lightweight device verifies Bitcoin's proof-of-work chain using succinct proofs. We propose a protocol for generating and verifying a STARK-based proof of a chain of block headers, enabling trust-minimized client operation. Third, we explore Privacy-Preserving Rollups via BitVM: leveraging BitVM, we design a conceptual rollup that keeps transaction data confidential using zero-knowledge proofs. In each case, we analyze security, compare with existing approaches, and discuss implementation considerations. Our contributions include the design of concrete protocols adapted to Bitcoin's UTXO model and an assessment of their practicality. The results suggest that while ZK proofs can bring powerful features (e.g., on-chain reserve audits, trustless light clients, and private layer-2 execution) to Bitcoin, each application requires careful trade-offs in efficiency and trust assumptions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, attack, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) spoofing remains a critical threat to IoT networks, enabling attackers to intercept, modify, or disrupt data transmission by exploiting ARP's lack of authentication. The decentralized and resource-constrained nature of IoT environments amplifies this vulnerability, making conventional detection mechanisms ineffective at scale. This paper introduces an intelligent, multi-layered machine learning framework designed to detect ARP spoofing in real-time IoT deployments. Our approach combines feature engineering based on ARP header behavior, traffic flow analysis, and temporal packet anomalies with a hybrid detection pipeline incorporating decision trees, ensemble models, and deep learning classifiers. We propose a hierarchical architecture to prioritize lightweight models at edge gateways and deeper models at centralized nodes to balance detection accuracy and computational efficiency. The system is validated on both simulated IoT traffic and the CICIDS2017 dataset, achieving over 97% detection accuracy with low false positive rates. Comparative evaluations with signature-based and rule-based systems demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of our approach. Our results show that intelligent machine learning integration enables proactive ARP spoofing detection tailored for IoT scenarios, laying the groundwork for scalable and autonomous network security solutions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, protect, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In recent years, cloud security has emerged as a primary concern for enterprises due to the increasing trend of migrating internal infrastructure and applications to cloud environments. This shift is driven by the desire to reduce the high costs and maintenance fees associated with traditional on-premise infrastructure. By leveraging cloud capacities such as high availability and scalability, companies can achieve greater operational efficiency and flexibility. However, this migration also introduces new security challenges. Ensuring the protection of sensitive data, maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements, and mitigating the risks of cyber threats are critical issues that must be addressed. Identity and Access Management (IAM) constitutes the critical security backbone of most cloud deployments, particularly within AWS environments. As organizations adopt AWS to scale applications and store data, the need for a thorough, methodical, and precise enumeration of IAM configurations grows exponentially. Enumeration refers to the systematic mapping and interrogation of identities, permissions, and resource authorizations with the objective of gaining situational awareness. By understanding the interplay between users, groups, and their myriads of policies, whether inline or attached managed policies, security professionals need to enumerate and identify misconfigurations, reduce the risk of unauthorized privilege escalation, and maintain robust compliance postures. This paper will present SkyEye, a cooperative multi-principal IAM enumeration framework, which comprises cutting-edge enumeration models in supporting complete situational awareness regarding the IAMs of provided AWS credentials, crossing the boundary of principal-specific IAM entitlement vision to reveal the complete visionary while insufficient authorization is the main challenge.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper presents our approach to the CheckThat! 2025 Task 1 on subjectivity detection, where systems are challenged to distinguish whether a sentence from a news article expresses the subjective view of the author or presents an objective view on the covered topic. We propose a feature-augmented transformer architecture that combines contextual embeddings from pre-trained language models with statistical and linguistic features. Our system leveraged pre-trained transformers with additional lexical features: for Arabic we used AraELECTRA augmented with part-of-speech (POS) tags and TF-IDF features, while for the other languages we fine-tuned a cross-lingual DeBERTa~V3 model combined with TF-IDF features through a gating mechanism. We evaluated our system in monolingual, multilingual, and zero-shot settings across multiple languages including English, Arabic, German, Italian, and several unseen languages. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving competitive performance across different languages with notable success in the monolingual setting for English (rank 1st with macro-F1=0.8052), German (rank 3rd with macro-F1=0.8013), Arabic (rank 4th with macro-F1=0.5771), and Romanian (rank 1st with macro-F1=0.8126) in the zero-shot setting. We also conducted an ablation analysis that demonstrated the importance of combining TF-IDF features with the gating mechanism and the cross-lingual transfer for subjectivity detection. Furthermore, our analysis reveals the model's sensitivity to both the order of cross-lingual fine-tuning and the linguistic proximity of the training languages.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, protect, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the realm of big data and cloud computing, distributed systems are tasked with proficiently managing, storing, and validating extensive datasets across numerous nodes, all while maintaining robust data integrity. Conventional hashing methods, though straightforward, encounter substan tial difficulties in dynamic settings due to the necessity for thorough rehashing when nodes are altered. Consistent hashing mitigates some of these challenges by reducing data redistribution; however, it still contends with limitations in load balancing and scalability under intensive update conditions. This paper introduces an innovative approach using a lattice based homomorphic hash function HexaMorphHash that facilitates constant time, incremental updates while preserving a constant digest size. By utilizing the complexity of the Short Integer Solutions SIS problem, our method secures strong protective measures, even against quantum threats. We further com pare our method with existing ones such as direct signatures for each update, comprehensive database signing, Merkle tree based techniques, AdHash, MuHash, ECMH, and homomorphic sig nature schemes highlighting notable advancements in computational efficiency, memory usage, and scalability. Our contributions present a viable solution for frequent update dissemination in expansive distributed systems, safeguarding both data integrity and system performance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, security, watermark, diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper presents the Singularity Cipher, a novel cryptographic-steganographic framework that integrates topological transformations and visual paradoxes to achieve multidimensional security. Inspired by the non-orientable properties of the Klein bottle -- constructed from two Mobius strips -- the cipher applies symbolic twist functions to simulate topological traversal, producing high confusion and diffusion in the ciphertext. The resulting binary data is then encoded using perceptual illusions, such as the missing square paradox, to visually obscure the presence of encrypted content. Unlike conventional ciphers that rely solely on algebraic complexity, the Singularity Cipher introduces a dual-layer approach: symbolic encryption rooted in topology and visual steganography designed for human cognitive ambiguity. This combination enhances both cryptographic strength and detection resistance, making it well-suited for secure communication, watermarking, and plausible deniability in adversarial environments. The paper formalizes the architecture, provides encryption and decryption algorithms, evaluates security properties, and compares the method against classical, post-quantum, and steganographic approaches. Potential applications and future research directions are also discussed.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, privacy</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As mobile computing becomes central to digital interaction, researchers have turned their attention to adaptive authentication for its real-time, context- and behavior-aware verification capabilities. However, many implementations remain fragmented, inconsistently apply intelligent techniques, and fall short of user expectations. In this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK), we analyze 41 peer-reviewed studies since 2011 that focus on adaptive authentication in mobile environments. Our analysis spans seven dimensions: privacy and security models, interaction modalities, user behavior, risk perception, implementation challenges, usability needs, and machine learning frameworks. Our findings reveal a strong reliance on machine learning (64.3%), especially for continuous authentication (61.9%) and unauthorized access prevention (54.8%). AI-driven approaches such as anomaly detection (57.1%) and spatio-temporal analysis (52.4%) increasingly shape the interaction landscape, alongside growing use of sensor-based and location-aware models.</li>

Across 20 matched prompts spanning emotional, moral, perspective, logical, identity, environmental, and nonsense domains, we analyse Gemma3-1b and LLaMA3.2-3b using five native-space metrics, with a primary focus on curvature (\k{appa}_i) and salience (S(t)). These metrics are computed under a pullback semantic metric derived from the unembedding matrix, ensuring that all measurements reflect token-aligned geometry rather than raw coordinate structure. We find that concern-shifted prompts reliably alter internal activation trajectories in both models - with LLaMA exhibiting consistent, statistically significant scaling in both curvature and salience as concern intensity increases. Gemma also responds to concern but shows weaker differentiation between moderate and strong variants. Our results support a two-layer view of LLM geometry - a latent conceptual structure encoded in the embedding space, and a contextual trajectory shaped by prompt-specific inference. Curved Inference reveals how models navigate, reorient, or reinforce semantic meaning over depth, offering a principled method for diagnosing alignment, abstraction, and emergent inference dynamics. These findings offer fresh insight into semantic abstraction and model alignment through the lens of Curved Inference.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Given the large size and volumes of contracts and their underlying inherent complexity, manual reviews become inefficient and prone to errors, creating a clear need for automation. Automatic Legal Contract Classification (LCC) revolutionizes the way legal contracts are analyzed, offering substantial improvements in speed, accuracy, and accessibility. This survey delves into the challenges of automatic LCC and a detailed examination of key tasks, datasets, and methodologies. We identify seven classification tasks within LCC, and review fourteen datasets related to English-language contracts, including public, proprietary, and non-public sources. We also introduce a methodology taxonomy for LCC, categorized into Traditional Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Transformer-based approaches. Additionally, the survey discusses evaluation techniques and highlights the best-performing results from the reviewed studies. By providing a thorough overview of current methods and their limitations, this survey suggests future research directions to improve the efficiency, accuracy, and scalability of LCC. As the first comprehensive survey on LCC, it aims to support legal NLP researchers and practitioners in improving legal processes, making legal information more accessible, and promoting a more informed and equitable society.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep Neural Networks often suffer from a critical limitation known as Catastrophic Forgetting, where performance on past tasks degrades after learning new ones. This paper introduces a novel continual learning approach inspired by human learning strategies like Active Recall, Deliberate Practice and Spaced Repetition, named Task Focused Consolidation with Spaced Recall (TFC-SR). TFC-SR enhances the standard experience replay with a mechanism we termed the Active Recall Probe. It is a periodic, task-aware evaluation of the model's memory that stabilizes the representations of past knowledge. We test TFC-SR on the Split MNIST and Split CIFAR-100 benchmarks against leading regularization-based and replay-based baselines. Our results show that TFC-SR performs significantly better than these methods. For instance, on the Split CIFAR-100, it achieves a final accuracy of 13.17% compared to standard replay's 7.40%. We demonstrate that this advantage comes from the stabilizing effect of the probe itself, and not from the difference in replay volume. Additionally, we analyze the trade-off between memory size and performance and show that while TFC-SR performs better in memory-constrained environments, higher replay volume is still more effective when available memory is abundant. We conclude that TFC-SR is a robust and efficient approach, highlighting the importance of integrating active memory retrieval mechanisms into continual learning systems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper introduces SemRAG, an enhanced Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that efficiently integrates domain-specific knowledge using semantic chunking and knowledge graphs without extensive fine-tuning. Integrating domain-specific knowledge into large language models (LLMs) is crucial for improving their performance in specialized tasks. Yet, existing adaptations are computationally expensive, prone to overfitting and limit scalability. To address these challenges, SemRAG employs a semantic chunking algorithm that segments documents based on the cosine similarity from sentence embeddings, preserving semantic coherence while reducing computational overhead. Additionally, by structuring retrieved information into knowledge graphs, SemRAG captures relationships between entities, improving retrieval accuracy and contextual understanding. Experimental results on MultiHop RAG and Wikipedia datasets demonstrate SemRAG has significantly enhances the relevance and correctness of retrieved information from the Knowledge Graph, outperforming traditional RAG methods. Furthermore, we investigate the optimization of buffer sizes for different data corpus, as optimizing buffer sizes tailored to specific datasets can further improve retrieval performance, as integration of knowledge graphs strengthens entity relationships for better contextual comprehension. The primary advantage of SemRAG is its ability to create an efficient, accurate domain-specific LLM pipeline while avoiding resource-intensive fine-tuning. This makes it a practical and scalable approach aligned with sustainability goals, offering a viable solution for AI applications in domain-specific fields.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper presents a comprehensive refutation of the so-called "blockchain trilemma," a widely cited but formally ungrounded claim asserting an inherent trade-off between decentralisation, security, and scalability in blockchain protocols. Through formal analysis, empirical evidence, and detailed critique of both methodology and terminology, we demonstrate that the trilemma rests on semantic equivocation, misuse of distributed systems theory, and a failure to define operational metrics. Particular focus is placed on the conflation of topological network analogies with protocol-level architecture, the mischaracterisation of Bitcoin's design--including the role of miners, SPV clients, and header-based verification--and the failure to ground claims in complexity-theoretic or adversarial models. By reconstructing Bitcoin as a deterministic, stateless distribution protocol governed by evidentiary trust, we show that scalability is not a trade-off but an engineering outcome. The paper concludes by identifying systemic issues in academic discourse and peer review that have allowed such fallacies to persist, and offers formal criteria for evaluating future claims in blockchain research.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, security, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As the frequency of cyber threats increases, conventional penetration testing is failing to capture the entirety of todays complex environments. To solve this problem, we propose the Vulnerability Mitigation System (VMS), a novel agent based on a Large Language Model (LLM) capable of performing penetration testing without human intervention. The VMS has a two-part architecture for planning and a Summarizer, which enable it to generate commands and process feedback. To standardize testing, we designed two new Capture the Flag (CTF) benchmarks based on the PicoCTF and OverTheWire platforms with 200 challenges. These benchmarks allow us to evaluate how effectively the system functions. We performed a number of experiments using various LLMs while tuning the temperature and top-p parameters and found that GPT-4o performed best, sometimes even better than expected. The results indicate that LLMs can be effectively applied to many cybersecurity tasks; however, there are risks. To ensure safe operation, we used a containerized environment. Both the VMS and the benchmarks are publicly available, advancing the creation of secure, autonomous cybersecurity tools.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, protect</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Kintsugi is a protocol for key recovery, allowing a user to regain access to end-to-end encrypted data after they have lost their device, but still have their (potentially low-entropy) password. Existing E2EE key recovery methods, such as those deployed by Signal and WhatsApp, centralize trust by relying on servers administered by a single provider. Kintsugi is decentralized, distributing trust over multiple recovery nodes, which could be servers run by independent parties, or end user devices in a peer-to-peer setting. To recover a user's keys, a threshold $t+1$ of recovery nodes must assist the user in decrypting a shared backup. Kintsugi is password-authenticated and protects against offline brute-force password guessing without requiring any specialized secure hardware. Kintsugi can tolerate up to $t$ honest-but-curious colluding recovery nodes, as well as $n - t - 1$ offline nodes, and operates safely in an asynchronous network model where messages can be arbitrarily delayed.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Plugin systems are a class of external programmes that provide users with a wide range of functionality, and while they enhance the user experience, their security is always a challenge. Especially due to the diversity and complexity of developers, many plugin systems lack adequate regulation. As ChatGPT has become a popular large-scale language modelling platform, its plugin system is also gradually developing, and the open platform provides creators with the opportunity to upload plugins covering a wide range of application scenarios. However, current research and discussions mostly focus on the security issues of the ChatGPT model itself, while ignoring the possible security risks posed by the plugin system. This study aims to analyse the security of plugins in the ChatGPT plugin shop, reveal its major security vulnerabilities, and propose corresponding improvements.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate complex responses to threat-based manipulations, revealing both vulnerabilities and unexpected performance enhancement opportunities. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of 3,390 experimental responses from three major LLMs (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini) across 10 task domains under 6 threat conditions. We introduce a novel threat taxonomy and multi-metric evaluation framework to quantify both negative manipulation effects and positive performance improvements. Results reveal systematic vulnerabilities, with policy evaluation showing the highest metric significance rates under role-based threats, alongside substantial performance enhancements in numerous cases with effect sizes up to +1336%. Statistical analysis indicates systematic certainty manipulation (pFDR < 0.0001) and significant improvements in analytical depth and response quality. These findings have dual implications for AI safety and practical prompt engineering in high-stakes applications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-risk domains such as law, finance, and medicine, systematically evaluating their domain-specific safety and compliance becomes critical. While prior work has largely focused on improving LLM performance in these domains, it has often neglected the evaluation of domain-specific safety risks. To bridge this gap, we first define domain-specific safety principles for LLMs based on the AMA Principles of Medical Ethics, the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct, and the CFA Institute Code of Ethics. Building on this foundation, we introduce Trident-Bench, a benchmark specifically targeting LLM safety in the legal, financial, and medical domains. We evaluated 19 general-purpose and domain-specialized models on Trident-Bench and show that it effectively reveals key safety gaps -- strong generalist models (e.g., GPT, Gemini) can meet basic expectations, whereas domain-specialized models often struggle with subtle ethical nuances. This highlights an urgent need for finer-grained domain-specific safety improvements. By introducing Trident-Bench, our work provides one of the first systematic resources for studying LLM safety in law and finance, and lays the groundwork for future research aimed at reducing the safety risks of deploying LLMs in professionally regulated fields.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Unsupervised and supervised learning methods conventionally use kernels to capture nonlinearities inherent in data structure. However experts have to ensure their proposed nonlinearity maximizes variability and capture inherent diversity of data. We reviewed all independence criteria to design unsupervised learners. Then we proposed 3 independence criteria and used them to design unsupervised and supervised dimensionality reduction methods. We evaluated contrast, accuracy and interpretability of these methods in both linear and neural nonlinear settings. The results show that the methods have outperformed the baseline (tSNE, PCA, regularized LDA, VAE with (un)supervised learner and layer sharing) and opened a new line of interpretable machine learning (ML) for the researchers.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce Inworld TTS-1, a set of two Transformer-based autoregressive text-to-speech (TTS) models. Our largest model, TTS-1-Max, has 8.8B parameters and is designed for utmost quality and expressiveness in demanding applications. TTS-1 is our most efficient model, with 1.6B parameters, built for real-time speech synthesis and on-device use cases. By scaling train-time compute and applying a sequential process of pre-training, fine-tuning, and RL-alignment of the speech-language model (SpeechLM) component, both models achieve state-of-the-art performance on a variety of benchmarks, demonstrating exceptional quality relying purely on in-context learning of the speaker's voice. Inworld TTS-1 and TTS-1-Max can generate high-resolution 48 kHz speech with low latency, and support 11 languages with fine-grained emotional control and non-verbal vocalizations through audio markups. We additionally open-source our training and modeling code under an MIT license.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, privacy, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Publishing graph data is widely desired to enable a variety of structural analyses and downstream tasks. However, it also potentially poses severe privacy leakage, as attackers may leverage the released graph data to launch attacks and precisely infer private information such as the existence of hidden sensitive links in the graph. Prior studies on privacy-preserving graph data publishing relied on heuristic graph modification strategies and it is difficult to determine the graph with the optimal privacy--utility trade-off for publishing. In contrast, we propose the first privacy-preserving graph structure learning framework against sensitive link inference attacks, named PPGSL, which can automatically learn a graph with the optimal privacy--utility trade-off. The PPGSL operates by first simulating a powerful surrogate attacker conducting sensitive link attacks on a given graph. It then trains a parameterized graph to defend against the simulated adversarial attacks while maintaining the favorable utility of the original graph. To learn the parameters of both parts of the PPGSL, we introduce a secure iterative training protocol. It can enhance privacy preservation and ensure stable convergence during the training process, as supported by the theoretical proof. Additionally, we incorporate multiple acceleration techniques to improve the efficiency of the PPGSL in handling large-scale graphs. The experimental results confirm that the PPGSL achieves state-of-the-art privacy--utility trade-off performance and effectively thwarts various sensitive link inference attacks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Enterprise environments contain a heterogeneous, rapidly growing collection of internal artifacts related to code, data, and many different tools. Critical information for assessing privacy risk and ensuring regulatory compliance is often embedded across these varied resources, each with their own arcane discovery and extraction techniques. Therefore, large-scale privacy compliance in adherence to governmental regulations requires systems to discern the interconnected nature of diverse artifacts in a common, shared universe. We present Privacy Artifact ConnecT or (PACT), an embeddings-driven graph that links millions of artifacts spanning multiple artifact types generated by a variety of teams and projects. Powered by the state-of-the-art DRAGON embedding model, PACT uses a contrastive learning objective with light fine-tuning to link artifacts via their textual components such as raw metadata, ownership specifics, and compliance context. Experimental results show that PACT's fine-tuned model improves recall@1 from 18% to 53%, the query match rate from 9.6% to 69.7% when paired with a baseline AI agent, and the hitrate@1 from 25.7% to 44.9% for candidate selection in a standard recommender system.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, defense, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multi-Domain Operations (MDOs) emphasize cross-domain defense against complex and synergistic threats, with civilian infrastructures like smart cities and Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) emerging as primary targets. As dual-use assets, CAVs are vulnerable to Multi-Surface Threats (MSTs), particularly from Adversarial Machine Learning (AML) which can simultaneously compromise multiple in-vehicle ML systems (e.g., Intrusion Detection Systems, Traffic Sign Recognition Systems). Therefore, this study investigates how key hyperparameters in Decision Tree-based ensemble models-Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting (GB), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB)-affect the time required for a Black-Box AML attack i.e. Zeroth Order Optimization (ZOO). Findings show that parameters like the number of trees or boosting rounds significantly influence attack execution time, with RF and GB being more sensitive than XGB. Adversarial Training (AT) time is also analyzed to assess the attacker's window of opportunity. By optimizing hyperparameters, this research supports Defensive Trustworthy AI (D-TAI) practices within MST scenarios and contributes to the development of resilient ML systems for civilian and military domains, aligned with Cyber Social Security framework in MDOs and Human-AI Multi-Domain Task Forces.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Evolving AI systems increasingly deploy multi-agent architectures where autonomous agents collaborate, share information, and delegate tasks through developing protocols. This connectivity, while powerful, introduces novel security risks. One such risk is a cascading risk: a breach in one agent can cascade through the system, compromising others by exploiting inter-agent trust. In tandem with OWASP's initiative for an Agentic AI Vulnerability Scoring System we define an attack vector, Agent Cascading Injection, analogous to Agent Impact Chain and Blast Radius, operating across networks of agents. In an ACI attack, a malicious input or tool exploit injected at one agent leads to cascading compromises and amplified downstream effects across agents that trust its outputs. We formalize this attack with an adversarial goal equation and key variables (compromised agent, injected exploit, polluted observations, etc.), capturing how a localized vulnerability can escalate into system-wide failure. We then analyze ACI's properties -- propagation chains, amplification factors, and inter-agent compound effects -- and map these to OWASP's emerging Agentic AI risk categories (e.g. Impact Chain and Orchestration Exploits). Finally, we argue that ACI highlights a critical need for quantitative benchmarking frameworks to evaluate the security of agent-to-agent communication protocols. We outline a methodology for stress-testing multi-agent systems (using architectures such as Google's A2A and Anthropic's MCP) against cascading trust failures, developing upon groundwork for measurable, standardized agent-to-agent security evaluation. Our work provides the necessary apparatus for engineers to benchmark system resilience, make data-driven architectural trade-offs, and develop robust defenses against a new generation of agentic threats.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, watermark</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid advancement of voice generation technologies has enabled the synthesis of speech that is perceptually indistinguishable from genuine human voices. While these innovations facilitate beneficial applications such as personalized text-to-speech systems and voice preservation, they have also introduced significant risks, including deepfake impersonation scams and synthetic media-driven disinformation campaigns. Recent reports indicate that in 2024, deepfake fraud attempts surged by over 1,300% compared to 2023, underscoring the urgent need for robust audio content authentication. The financial sector has been particularly impacted, with a loss of over 10 million USD to voice scams and individual victims reporting losses exceeding $6,000 from AI-generated deepfake calls. In response, regulators and governments worldwide are enacting measures to improve AI content transparency and traceability, emphasizing the development of forensic tools and watermarking techniques as essential strategies to uphold media integrity.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In recent years, the advancement of quantum computing technology has posed potential security threats to RSA cryptography and elliptic curve cryptography. In response, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) published several Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) in August 2024, including the Module-Lattice-Based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism (ML-KEM), Module-Lattice-Based Digital Signature Algorithm (ML-DSA), and Stateless Hash-Based Digital Signature Algorithm (SLH-DSA). Although these PQC algorithms are designed to resist quantum computing attacks, they may not provide adequate security in certain specialized application scenarios. To address this issue, this study proposes quantum random number generator (QRNG)-based PQC algorithms. These algorithms leverage quantum computing to generate random numbers, which serve as the foundation for key pair generation, key encapsulation, and digital signature generation. A generalized architecture of QRNG is proposed, along with the design of six QRNGs. Each generator is evaluated according to the statistical validation procedures outlined in NIST SP 800-90B, including tests for verification of entropy sources and independent and identically distributed (IID) outputs. Experimental results assess the computation time of the six QRNGs, as well as the performance of QRNG-based ML-KEM, QRNG-based ML-DSA, and QRNG-based SLH-DSA. These findings provide valuable reference data for future deployment of PQC systems.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper explores the implementation of a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-optimized energy management system for e-commerce data centers, aimed at enhancing energy efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and environmental sustainability. The proposed system leverages DRL algorithms to dynamically manage the integration of renewable energy sources, energy storage, and grid power, adapting to fluctuating energy availability in real time. The study demonstrates that the DRL-optimized system achieves a 38\% reduction in energy costs, significantly outperforming traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods (28\%) and heuristic approaches (22\%). Additionally, it maintains a low SLA violation rate of 1.5\%, compared to 3.0\% for RL and 4.8\% for heuristic methods. The DRL-optimized approach also results in an 82\% improvement in energy efficiency, surpassing other methods, and a 45\% reduction in carbon emissions, making it the most environmentally friendly solution. The system's cumulative reward of 950 reflects its superior performance in balancing multiple objectives. Through rigorous testing and ablation studies, the paper validates the effectiveness of the DRL model's architecture and parameters, offering a robust solution for energy management in data centers. The findings highlight the potential of DRL in advancing energy optimization strategies and addressing sustainability challenges.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The integration of electric vehicles (EVs) into power grids via Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) system technology is increasing day by day, but these phenomena present both advantages and disadvantages. V2G can increase grid reliability by providing distributed energy storage and ancillary services. However, on the other hand, it has a scope that encompasses the cyber-physical attack surface of the national power grid, introducing new vulnerabilities in monitoring and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. This paper investigates the maliciousness caused by Autonomous Vehicle to Grid (AV2G) communication infrastructures and assesses their impacts on SCADA system reliability. This paper presents a quantitative reliability assessment using Bayesian attack graph combined with probabilistic capacity outage modeling based on IEEE RTS-79 system data. This work presents how AV2G-based attacks degrade system performance by using Monte Carlo simulations method, highlighting the need for cybersecurity-hardening strategies in smart grid design.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Despite significant advancements in time series forecasting, accurate modeling of time series with strong heterogeneity in magnitude and/or sparsity patterns remains challenging for state-of-the-art deep learning architectures. We identify several factors that lead existing models to systematically underperform on low-magnitude and sparse time series, including loss functions with implicit biases toward high-magnitude series, training-time sampling methods, and limitations of time series encoding methods. SPADE-S is a robust forecasting architecture that significantly reduces magnitude- and sparsity-based systematic biases and improves overall prediction accuracy. Empirical results demonstrate that SPADE-S outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches across a diverse set of use cases in demand forecasting. In particular, we show that, depending on the quantile forecast and magnitude of the series, SPADE-S can improve forecast accuracy by up to 15%. This results in P90 overall forecast accuracy gains of 2.21%, 6.58%, and 4.28%, and P50 forecast accuracy gains of 0.92%, 0.77%, and 1.95%, respectively, for each of three distinct datasets, ranging from 3 million to 700 million series, from a large online retailer.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid advancement of Generative Artificial Intelligence has fueled deepfake proliferation-synthetic media encompassing fully generated content and subtly edited authentic material-posing challenges to digital security, misinformation mitigation, and identity preservation. This systematic review evaluates state-of-the-art deepfake detection methodologies, emphasizing reproducible implementations for transparency and validation. We delineate two core paradigms: (1) detection of fully synthetic media leveraging statistical anomalies and hierarchical feature extraction, and (2) localization of manipulated regions within authentic content employing multi-modal cues such as visual artifacts and temporal inconsistencies. These approaches, spanning uni-modal and multi-modal frameworks, demonstrate notable precision and adaptability in controlled settings, effectively identifying manipulations through advanced learning techniques and cross-modal fusion. However, comprehensive assessment reveals insufficient evaluation of adversarial robustness across both paradigms. Current methods exhibit vulnerability to adversarial perturbations-subtle alterations designed to evade detection-undermining reliability in real-world adversarial contexts. This gap highlights critical disconnect between methodological development and evolving threat landscapes. To address this, we contribute a curated GitHub repository aggregating open-source implementations, enabling replication and testing. Our findings emphasize urgent need for future work prioritizing adversarial resilience, advocating scalable, modality-agnostic architectures capable of withstanding sophisticated manipulations. This review synthesizes strengths and shortcomings of contemporary deepfake detection while charting paths toward robust trustworthy systems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, attack, diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Adversarial attack methods for 3D point cloud classification reveal the vulnerabilities of point cloud recognition models. This vulnerability could lead to safety risks in critical applications that use deep learning models, such as autonomous vehicles. To uncover the deficiencies of these models, researchers can evaluate their security through adversarial attacks. However, most existing adversarial attack methods are based on white-box attacks. While these methods achieve high attack success rates and imperceptibility, their applicability in real-world scenarios is limited. Black-box attacks, which are more meaningful in real-world scenarios, often yield poor results. This paper proposes a novel black-box adversarial example generation method that utilizes a diffusion model to improve the attack success rate and imperceptibility in the black-box setting, without relying on the internal information of the point cloud classification model to generate adversarial samples. We use a 3D diffusion model to use the compressed features of the point cloud as prior knowledge to guide the reverse diffusion process to add adversarial points to clean examples. Subsequently, its reverse process is employed to transform the distribution of other categories into adversarial points, which are then added to the point cloud.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) aims to detect anomalies without labeled data, a necessity in many machine learning applications where anomalous samples are rare or not available. Most state-of-the-art methods fall into two categories: reconstruction-based approaches, which often reconstruct anomalies too well, and decoupled representation learning with density estimators, which can suffer from suboptimal feature spaces. While some recent methods attempt to couple feature learning and anomaly detection, they often rely on surrogate objectives, restrict kernel choices, or introduce approximations that limit their expressiveness and robustness. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method that tightly couples representation learning with an analytically solvable one-class SVM (OCSVM), through a custom loss formulation that directly aligns latent features with the OCSVM decision boundary. The model is evaluated on two tasks: a new benchmark based on MNIST-C, and a challenging brain MRI subtle lesion detection task. Unlike most methods that focus on large, hyperintense lesions at the image level, our approach succeeds to target small, non-hyperintense lesions, while we evaluate voxel-wise metrics, addressing a more clinically relevant scenario. Both experiments evaluate a form of robustness to domain shifts, including corruption types in MNIST-C and scanner/age variations in MRI. Results demonstrate performance and robustness of our proposed mode,highlighting its potential for general UAD and real-world medical imaging applications.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Charts are a fundamental visualization format widely used in data analysis across research and industry. While enabling users to edit charts based on high-level intentions is of great practical value, existing methods primarily rely on natural language instructions, which are often too ambiguous to support fine-grained editing. In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm for multimodal chart editing, where user intent is expressed through a combination of natural language and visual indicators that explicitly highlight the elements to be modified. To support this paradigm, we present Chart$\text{M}^3$, a new benchmark for Multimodal chart editing with Multi-level complexity and Multi-perspective evaluation. Chart$\text{M}^3$ contains 1,000 samples spanning four levels of editing difficulty. Each sample includes triplets in the form of (chart, code, multimodal instructions). To comprehensively evaluate chart editing models, Chart$\text{M}^3$ provides metrics that assess both visual appearance and code correctness. Our benchmark reveals significant limitations in current multimodal large language models (MLLMs), including GPT-4o, particularly in their ability to interpret and act on visual indicators. To address this, we construct Chart$\text{M}^3$-Train, a large-scale training set with 24,000 multimodal chart editing samples. Fine-tuning MLLMs on this dataset leads to substantial improvements, demonstrating the importance of multimodal supervision in building practical chart editing systems.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Effectively leveraging diversity has been shown to improve performance for various machine learning models, including large language models (LLMs). However, determining the most effective way of using diversity remains a challenge. In this work, we compare two diversity approaches for answering binary questions using LLMs: model diversity, which relies on multiple models answering the same question, and question interpretation diversity, which relies on using the same model to answer the same question framed in different ways. For both cases, we apply majority voting as the ensemble consensus heuristic to determine the final answer. Our experiments on boolq, strategyqa, and pubmedqa show that question interpretation diversity consistently leads to better ensemble accuracy compared to model diversity. Furthermore, our analysis of GPT and LLaMa shows that model diversity typically produces results between the best and the worst ensemble members without clear improvement.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rise of Large Language Models has created a general excitement about the great potential for a myriad of applications. While LLMs offer many possibilities, questions about safety, privacy, and ethics have emerged, and all the key actors are working to address these issues with protective measures for their own models and standalone solutions. The constantly evolving nature of LLMs makes the task of universally shielding users against their potential risks extremely challenging, and one-size-fits-all solutions unfeasible. In this work, we propose OneShield, our stand-alone, model-agnostic and customizable solution to safeguard LLMs. OneShield aims to provide facilities for defining risk factors, expressing and declaring contextual safety and compliance policies, and mitigating LLM risks, with a focus on each specific customer. We describe the implementation of the framework, the scalability considerations and provide usage statistics of OneShield since its first deployment.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, defense, attack, robust, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training while preserving data privacy, but it is highly vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Most existing defense methods in FL have limited effectiveness due to their neglect of the model's over-reliance on backdoor triggers, particularly as the proportion of malicious clients increases. In this paper, we propose FedBAP, a novel defense framework for mitigating backdoor attacks in FL by reducing the model's reliance on backdoor triggers. Specifically, first, we propose a perturbed trigger generation mechanism that creates perturbation triggers precisely matching backdoor triggers in location and size, ensuring strong influence on model outputs. Second, we utilize these perturbation triggers to generate benign adversarial perturbations that disrupt the model's dependence on backdoor triggers while forcing it to learn more robust decision boundaries. Finally, we design an adaptive scaling mechanism to dynamically adjust perturbation intensity, effectively balancing defense strength and model performance. The experimental results demonstrate that FedBAP reduces the attack success rates by 0.22%-5.34%, 0.48%-6.34%, and 97.22%-97.6% under three types of backdoor attacks, respectively. In particular, FedBAP demonstrates outstanding performance against novel backdoor attacks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The advantages of IoT in strengthening commercial, industrial, and social ecosystems have led to its widespread expansion. Nevertheless, because endpoint devices have limited computation, storage, and communication capabilities, the IoT infrastructure is vulnerable to several cyber threats. As a result, DDoS attacks pose a severe risk to the security of IoT. By taking advantage of these weaknesses, attackers may quickly employ IoT devices as a component of botnets to execute DDoS attacks. The most critical development is how more armies of robots are being constructed from IoT devices. We offer a Model for dealing with DDOS attacks on botnets in the Internet of Things via trust management. In this Model, an attempt has been made to consider all aspects of security concerning trust factors to design a reliable and flexible model against DDoS attacks against the Internet of Things. In the initial studies, about 40-50 security models related to the subject have been studied by using review articles</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Background & Aims: High-performance machine learning models like XGBoost are often "black boxes," limiting their clinical adoption due to a lack of interpretability. This study aims to bridge the gap between predictive accuracy and narrative transparency for sarcopenia risk assessment. Methods: We propose the LLM-Adapted Interpretation Framework (LAI-ML), a novel knowledge distillation architecture. LAI-ML transforms feature attributions from a trained XGBoost model into a probabilistic format using specialized techniques (HAGA and CACS). A Large Language Model (LLM), guided by a reinforcement learning loop and case-based retrieval, then generates data-faithful diagnostic narratives. Results: The LAI-ML framework achieved 83% prediction accuracy, significantly outperforming the baseline XGBoost model, 13% higher. Notably, the LLM not only replicated the teacher model's logic but also corrected its predictions in 21.7% of discordant cases, demonstrating enhanced reasoning. Conclusion: LAI-ML effectively translates opaque model predictions into trustworthy and interpretable clinical insights, offering a deployable solution to the "black-box" problem in medical AI.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Social media platforms offer numerous benefits and allow people to come together for various causes. Many communities, academia, government agencies, institutions, healthcare, entertainment, and businesses are on social media platforms. They are intuitive and free for users. It has become unimaginable to live without social media. Their architecture and data handling are geared towards scalability, uninterrupted availability, and both personal and collaborative revenue generation. Primarily, artificial intelligence algorithms are employed on stored user data for optimization and feeds. This has the potential to impact user safety, privacy, and security, even when metadata is used. A new decentralized data arrangement framework based on the Fractal-tree and L-Systems algorithm is proposed to mitigate some of the impacts of social media platforms. Future work will focus on demonstrating the effectiveness of the new decentralized framework by comparing its results against state-of-the-art security methods currently used in databases. A cryptographic algorithm could also be implemented for the framework, employing a new key generation for each branch. This will strengthen database security; for example, if a user key is leaked, regenerating the key for each branch will keep the data secure by applying defense mechanisms in the proposed L-System-based tree framework.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>defense, attack, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) often employ safety alignment methods to resist harmful instructions. However, recent research shows that maliciously fine-tuning these LLMs on harmful data can easily bypass these safeguards. To counter this, we theoretically uncover why malicious fine-tuning succeeds and identify potential defense strategies. Building on the theoretical analysis, we introduce the Self-Degraded Defense (SDD) framework. SDD encourages LLMs to produce high-quality but irrelevant responses to harmful prompts. When attackers attempt malicious fine-tuning, the general capability of the LLM aligned by SDD will significantly decrease, rendering it incapable of following harmful instructions. Our experimental results confirm SDD's effectiveness against such attacks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As the era of large language models (LLMs) on behalf of users unfolds, Preference Optimization (PO) methods have become a central approach to aligning LLMs with human preferences and improving performance. We propose Maximum a Posteriori Preference Optimization (MaPPO), a framework for learning from preferences that explicitly incorporates prior reward knowledge into the optimization objective. While existing methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and its variants treat preference learning as a Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) problem, MaPPO extends this paradigm by integrating prior reward estimates into a principled Maximum a Posteriori (MaP) objective. This not only generalizes DPO and its variants, but also enhances alignment by mitigating the oversimplified binary classification of responses. More importantly, MaPPO introduces no additional hyperparameter, and supports preference optimization in both offline and online settings. In addition, MaPPO can be used as a plugin with consistent improvement on DPO variants, including widely used SimPO, IPO, and CPO. Extensive empirical evaluations of different model sizes and model series on three standard benchmarks, including MT-Bench, AlpacaEval 2.0, and Arena-Hard, demonstrate consistent improvements in alignment performance without sacrificing computational efficiency.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Scaling laws are fundamental mathematical relationships that predict how neural network performance evolves with changes in variables such as model size, dataset size, and computational resources. Traditionally, discovering these laws requires extensive human expertise and manual experimentation. We introduce EvoSLD, an automated framework for Scaling Law Discovery (SLD) that leverages evolutionary algorithms guided by Large Language Models (LLMs) to co-evolve symbolic expressions and their optimization routines. Formulated to handle scaling variables, control variables, and response metrics across diverse experimental settings, EvoSLD searches for parsimonious, universal functional forms that minimize fitting errors on grouped data subsets. Evaluated on five real-world scenarios from recent literature, EvoSLD rediscovers exact human-derived laws in two cases and surpasses them in others, achieving up to orders-of-magnitude reductions in normalized mean squared error on held-out test sets. Compared to baselines like symbolic regression and ablated variants, EvoSLD demonstrates superior accuracy, interpretability, and efficiency, highlighting its potential to accelerate AI research.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Transformers have profoundly influenced AI research, but explaining their decisions remains challenging -- even for relatively simpler tasks such as classification -- which hinders trust and safe deployment in real-world applications. Although activation-based attribution methods effectively explain transformer-based text classification models, our findings reveal that these methods can be undermined by class-irrelevant features within activations, leading to less reliable interpretations. To address this limitation, we propose Contrast-CAT, a novel activation contrast-based attribution method that refines token-level attributions by filtering out class-irrelevant features. By contrasting the activations of an input sequence with reference activations, Contrast-CAT generates clearer and more faithful attribution maps. Experimental results across various datasets and models confirm that Contrast-CAT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Notably, under the MoRF setting, it achieves average improvements of x1.30 in AOPC and x2.25 in LOdds over the most competing methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing interpretability for transformer-based text classification.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>LLMs for clinical decision support often fail under small but clinically meaningful input shifts such as masking a symptom or negating a finding, despite high performance on static benchmarks. These reasoning failures frequently go undetected by standard NLP metrics, which are insensitive to latent representation shifts that drive diagnosis instability. We propose a geometry-aware evaluation framework, LAPD (Latent Agentic Perturbation Diagnostics), which systematically probes the latent robustness of clinical LLMs under structured adversarial edits. Within this framework, we introduce Latent Diagnosis Flip Rate (LDFR), a model-agnostic diagnostic signal that captures representational instability when embeddings cross decision boundaries in PCA-reduced latent space. Clinical notes are generated using a structured prompting pipeline grounded in diagnostic reasoning, then perturbed along four axes: masking, negation, synonym replacement, and numeric variation to simulate common ambiguities and omissions. We compute LDFR across both foundation and clinical LLMs, finding that latent fragility emerges even under minimal surface-level changes. Finally, we validate our findings on 90 real clinical notes from the DiReCT benchmark (MIMIC-IV), confirming the generalizability of LDFR beyond synthetic settings. Our results reveal a persistent gap between surface robustness and semantic stability, underscoring the importance of geometry-aware auditing in safety-critical clinical AI.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, security, attack, explainability, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Next generation Radio Access Networks (RANs) introduce programmability, intelligence, and near real-time control through intelligent controllers, enabling enhanced security within the RAN and across broader 5G/6G infrastructures. This paper presents a comprehensive survey highlighting opportunities, challenges, and research gaps for Large Language Models (LLMs)-assisted explainable (XAI) intrusion detection (IDS) for secure future RAN environments. Motivated by this, we propose an LLM interpretable anomaly-based detection system for distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks using multivariate time series key performance measures (KPMs), extracted from E2 nodes, within the Near Real-Time RAN Intelligent Controller (Near-RT RIC). An LSTM-based model is trained to identify malicious User Equipment (UE) behavior based on these KPMs. To enhance transparency, we apply post-hoc local explainability methods such as LIME and SHAP to interpret individual predictions. Furthermore, LLMs are employed to convert technical explanations into natural-language insights accessible to non-expert users. Experimental results on real 5G network KPMs demonstrate that our framework achieves high detection accuracy (F1-score > 0.96) while delivering actionable and interpretable outputs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>protect, attack, robust, watermark, diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The great success of the diffusion model in image synthesis led to the release of gigantic commercial models, raising the issue of copyright protection and inappropriate content generation. Training-free diffusion watermarking provides a low-cost solution for these issues. However, the prior works remain vulnerable to rotation, scaling, and translation (RST) attacks. Although some methods employ meticulously designed patterns to mitigate this issue, they often reduce watermark capacity, which can result in identity (ID) collusion. To address these problems, we propose MaXsive, a training-free diffusion model generative watermarking technique that has high capacity and robustness. MaXsive best utilizes the initial noise to watermark the diffusion model. Moreover, instead of using a meticulously repetitive ring pattern, we propose injecting the X-shape template to recover the RST distortions. This design significantly increases robustness without losing any capacity, making ID collusion less likely to happen. The effectiveness of MaXsive has been verified on two well-known watermarking benchmarks under the scenarios of verification and identification.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, attack, robust, diffusion, transformer, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce EdgeAgentX-DT, an advanced extension of the EdgeAgentX framework that integrates digital twin simulations and generative AI-driven scenario training to significantly enhance edge intelligence in military networks. EdgeAgentX-DT utilizes network digital twins, virtual replicas synchronized with real-world edge devices, to provide a secure, realistic environment for training and validation. Leveraging generative AI methods, such as diffusion models and transformers, the system creates diverse and adversarial scenarios for robust simulation-based agent training. Our multi-layer architecture includes: (1) on-device edge intelligence; (2) digital twin synchronization; and (3) generative scenario training. Experimental simulations demonstrate notable improvements over EdgeAgentX, including faster learning convergence, higher network throughput, reduced latency, and improved resilience against jamming and node failures. A case study involving a complex tactical scenario with simultaneous jamming attacks, agent failures, and increased network loads illustrates how EdgeAgentX-DT sustains operational performance, whereas baseline methods fail. These results highlight the potential of digital-twin-enabled generative training to strengthen edge AI deployments in contested environments.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Machine learning interpretation has primarily been leveraged to build clinician trust and uncover actionable insights in EHRs. However, the intrinsic complexity and heterogeneity of EHR data limit its effectiveness in guiding subgroup-specific modeling. We propose AdaptHetero, a novel MLI-driven framework that transforms interpretability insights into actionable guidance for tailoring model training and evaluation across subpopulations within individual hospital systems. Evaluated on three large-scale EHR datasets - GOSSIS-1-eICU, WiDS, and MIMIC-IV - AdaptHetero consistently identifies heterogeneous model behaviors in predicting ICU mortality, in-hospital death, and hidden hypoxemia. By integrating SHAP-based interpretation and unsupervised clustering, the framework enhances the identification of clinically meaningful subgroup-specific characteristics, leading to improved predictive performance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, attack, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The gradient inversion attack has been demonstrated as a significant privacy threat to federated learning (FL), particularly in continuous domains such as vision models. In contrast, it is often considered less effective or highly dependent on impractical training settings when applied to language models, due to the challenges posed by the discrete nature of tokens in text data. As a result, its potential privacy threats remain largely underestimated, despite FL being an emerging training method for language models. In this work, we propose a domain-specific gradient inversion attack named Grab (gradient inversion with hybrid optimization). Grab features two alternating optimization processes to address the challenges caused by practical training settings, including a simultaneous optimization on dropout masks between layers for improved token recovery and a discrete optimization for effective token sequencing. Grab can recover a significant portion (up to 92.9% recovery rate) of the private training data, outperforming the attack strategy of utilizing discrete optimization with an auxiliary model by notable improvements of up to 28.9% recovery rate in benchmark settings and 48.5% recovery rate in practical settings. Grab provides a valuable step forward in understanding this privacy threat in the emerging FL training mode of language models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Interactive multimodal applications (IMAs), such as route planning in the Internet of Vehicles, enrich users' personalized experiences by integrating various forms of data over wireless networks. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) utilize mixture-of-experts (MoE) mechanisms to empower multiple IMAs, with each LLM trained individually for a specific task that presents different business workflows. In contrast to existing approaches that rely on multiple LLMs for IMAs, this paper presents a novel paradigm that accomplishes various IMAs using a single compositional LLM over wireless networks. The two primary challenges include 1) guiding a single LLM to adapt to diverse IMA objectives and 2) ensuring the flexibility and efficiency of the LLM in resource-constrained mobile environments. To tackle the first challenge, we propose ContextLoRA, a novel method that guides an LLM to learn the rich structured context among IMAs by constructing a task dependency graph. We partition the learnable parameter matrix of neural layers for each IMA to facilitate LLM composition. Then, we develop a step-by-step fine-tuning procedure guided by task relations, including training, freezing, and masking phases. This allows the LLM to learn to reason among tasks for better adaptation, capturing the latent dependencies between tasks. For the second challenge, we introduce ContextGear, a scheduling strategy to optimize the training procedure of ContextLoRA, aiming to minimize computational and communication costs through a strategic grouping mechanism. Experiments on three benchmarks show the superiority of the proposed ContextLoRA and ContextGear. Furthermore, we prototype our proposed paradigm on a real-world wireless testbed, demonstrating its practical applicability for various IMAs. We will release our code to the community.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper presents the development of a generative adversarial network (GAN) for synthesizing dental panoramic radiographs. Although exploratory in nature, the study aims to address the scarcity of data in dental research and education. We trained a deep convolutional GAN (DCGAN) using a Wasserstein loss with gradient penalty (WGANGP) on a dataset of 2322 radiographs of varying quality. The focus was on the dentoalveolar regions, other anatomical structures were cropped out. Extensive preprocessing and data cleaning were performed to standardize the inputs while preserving anatomical variability. We explored four candidate models by varying critic iterations, feature depth, and the use of denoising prior to training. A clinical expert evaluated the generated radiographs based on anatomical visibility and realism, using a 5-point scale (1 very poor 5 excellent). Most images showed moderate anatomical depiction, although some were degraded by artifacts. A trade-off was observed the model trained on non-denoised data yielded finer details especially in structures like the mandibular canal and trabecular bone, while a model trained on denoised data offered superior overall image clarity and sharpness. These findings provide a foundation for future work on GAN-based methods in dental imaging.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The distribution of data in the world (eg, internet, etc.) significantly differs from the well-curated datasets and is often over-populated with samples from common categories. The algorithms designed for well-curated datasets perform suboptimally when used for learning from imperfect datasets with long-tailed imbalances and distribution shifts. To expand the use of deep models, it is essential to overcome the labor-intensive curation process by developing robust algorithms that can learn from diverse, real-world data distributions. Toward this goal, we develop practical algorithms for Deep Neural Networks which can learn from limited and imperfect data present in the real world. This thesis is divided into four segments, each covering a scenario of learning from limited or imperfect data. The first part of the thesis focuses on Learning Generative Models from Long-Tail Data, where we mitigate the mode-collapse and enable diverse aesthetic image generations for tail (minority) classes. In the second part, we enable effective generalization on tail classes through Inductive Regularization schemes, which allow tail classes to generalize as effectively as the head classes without requiring explicit generation of images. In the third part, we develop algorithms for Optimizing Relevant Metrics for learning from long-tailed data with limited annotation (semi-supervised), followed by the fourth part, which focuses on the Efficient Domain Adaptation of the model to various domains with very few to zero labeled samples.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In recent years, social media platforms have become prominent spaces for individuals to express their opinions on ongoing events, including criminal incidents. As a result, public sentiment can shift dynamically over time. This study investigates the evolving public perception of crime-related news by classifying user-generated comments into three categories: positive, negative, and neutral. A newly curated dataset comprising 28,528 Bangla-language social media comments was developed for this purpose. We propose a transformer-based model utilizing the XLM-RoBERTa Base architecture, which achieves a classification accuracy of 97%, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods in Bangla sentiment analysis. To enhance model interpretability, explainable AI technique is employed to identify the most influential features driving sentiment classification. The results underscore the effectiveness of transformer-based models in processing low-resource languages such as Bengali and demonstrate their potential to extract actionable insights that can support public policy formulation and crime prevention strategies.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the current digital landscape, misinformation circulates rapidly, shaping public perception and causing societal divisions. It is difficult to identify hyperpartisan news in Bangla since there aren't many sophisticated natural language processing methods available for this low-resource language. Without effective detection methods, biased content can spread unchecked, posing serious risks to informed discourse. To address this gap, our research fine-tunes Bangla BERT. This is a state-of-the-art transformer-based model, designed to enhance classification accuracy for hyperpartisan news. We evaluate its performance against traditional machine learning models and implement semi-supervised learning to enhance predictions further. Not only that, we use LIME to provide transparent explanations of the model's decision-making process, which helps to build trust in its outcomes. With a remarkable accuracy score of 95.65%, Bangla BERT outperforms conventional approaches, according to our trial data. The findings of this study demonstrate the usefulness of transformer models even in environments with limited resources, which opens the door to further improvements in this area.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Modeling boiling (an inherently chaotic, multiphase process central to energy and thermal systems) remains a significant challenge for neural PDE surrogates. Existing models require future input (e.g., bubble positions) during inference because they fail to learn nucleation from past states, limiting their ability to autonomously forecast boiling dynamics. They also fail to model flow boiling velocity fields, where sharp interface-momentum coupling demands long-range and directional inductive biases. We introduce Bubbleformer, a transformer-based spatiotemporal model that forecasts stable and long-range boiling dynamics including nucleation, interface evolution, and heat transfer without dependence on simulation data during inference. Bubbleformer integrates factorized axial attention, frequency-aware scaling, and conditions on thermophysical parameters to generalize across fluids, geometries, and operating conditions. To evaluate physical fidelity in chaotic systems, we propose interpretable physics-based metrics that evaluate heat-flux consistency, interface geometry, and mass conservation. We also release BubbleML 2.0, a high-fidelity dataset that spans diverse working fluids (cryogens, refrigerants, dielectrics), boiling configurations (pool and flow boiling), flow regimes (bubbly, slug, annular), and boundary conditions. Bubbleformer sets new benchmark results in both prediction and forecasting of two-phase boiling flows.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability, explainability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have made tremendous progress in multimodal tasks such as image captioning. However, explaining/interpreting how these models integrate visual information, language information and knowledge representation to generate meaningful captions remains a challenging problem. Standard metrics to measure performance typically rely on comparing generated captions with human-written ones that may not provide a user with a deep insights into this integration. In this work, we develop a novel explanation framework that is easily interpretable based on Hybrid Markov Logic Networks (HMLNs) - a language that can combine symbolic rules with real-valued functions - where we hypothesize how relevant examples from the training data could have influenced the generation of the observed caption. To do this, we learn a HMLN distribution over the training instances and infer the shift in distributions over these instances when we condition on the generated sample which allows us to quantify which examples may have been a source of richer information to generate the observed caption. Our experiments on captions generated for several state-of-the-art captioning models using Amazon Mechanical Turk illustrate the interpretability of our explanations, and allow us to compare these models along the dimension of explainability.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In an inverse problem, the goal is to recover an unknown parameter (e.g., an image) that has typically undergone some lossy or noisy transformation during measurement. Recently, deep generative models, particularly diffusion models, have emerged as powerful priors for protein structure generation. However, integrating noisy experimental data from multiple sources to guide these models remains a significant challenge. Existing methods often require precise knowledge of experimental noise levels and manually tuned weights for each data modality. In this work, we introduce Adam-PnP, a Plug-and-Play framework that guides a pre-trained protein diffusion model using gradients from multiple, heterogeneous experimental sources. Our framework features an adaptive noise estimation scheme and a dynamic modality weighting mechanism integrated into the diffusion process, which reduce the need for manual hyperparameter tuning. Experiments on complex reconstruction tasks demonstrate significantly improved accuracy using Adam-PnP.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We advance the field of HDR environment map estimation from a single-view image by establishing a novel approach leveraging the Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to produce high-quality environment maps that can plausibly light mirror-reflective surfaces. A common issue when using the ERP representation, the format used by the vast majority of approaches, is distortions at the poles and a seam at the sides of the environment map. We remove the border seam artefact by proposing an ERP convolutional padding in the latent autoencoder. Additionally, we investigate whether adapting the diffusion network architecture to the ERP format can improve the quality and accuracy of the estimated environment map by proposing a panoramically-adapted Diffusion Transformer architecture. Our proposed PanoDiT network reduces ERP distortions and artefacts, but at the cost of image quality and plausibility. We evaluate with standard benchmarks to demonstrate that our models estimate high-quality environment maps that perform competitively with state-of-the-art approaches in both image quality and lighting accuracy.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In recommendation systems, diversity and novelty are essential for capturing varied user preferences and encouraging exploration, yet many systems prioritize click relevance. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been explored to improve diversity, it often depends on random exploration that may not align with user interests. We propose LAAC (LLM-guided Adversarial Actor Critic), a novel method that leverages large language models (LLMs) as reference policies to suggest novel items, while training a lightweight policy to refine these suggestions using system-specific data. The method formulates training as a bilevel optimization between actor and critic networks, enabling the critic to selectively favor promising novel actions and the actor to improve its policy beyond LLM recommendations. To mitigate overestimation of unreliable LLM suggestions, we apply regularization that anchors critic values for unexplored items close to well-estimated dataset actions. Experiments on real-world datasets show that LAAC outperforms existing baselines in diversity, novelty, and accuracy, while remaining robust on imbalanced data, effectively integrating LLM knowledge without expensive fine-tuning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Motivated by the strong performance of CLIP-based models in natural image-text domains, recent efforts have adapted these architectures to medical tasks, particularly in radiology, where large paired datasets of images and reports, such as chest X-rays, are available. While these models have shown encouraging results in terms of accuracy and discriminative performance, their fairness and robustness in the different clinical tasks remain largely underexplored. In this study, we extensively evaluate six widely used CLIP-based models on chest X-ray classification using three publicly available datasets: MIMIC-CXR, NIH-CXR14, and NEATX. We assess the models fairness across six conditions and patient subgroups based on age, sex, and race. Additionally, we assess the robustness to shortcut learning by evaluating performance on pneumothorax cases with and without chest drains. Our results indicate performance gaps between patients of different ages, but more equitable results for the other attributes. Moreover, all models exhibit lower performance on images without chest drains, suggesting reliance on spurious correlations. We further complement the performance analysis with a study of the embeddings generated by the models. While the sensitive attributes could be classified from the embeddings, we do not see such patterns using PCA, showing the limitations of these visualisation techniques when assessing models.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>explainability, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>AI-driven clinical text classification is vital for explainable automated retrieval of population-level health information. This work investigates whether human-based clinical rationales can serve as additional supervision to improve both performance and explainability of transformer-based models that automatically encode clinical documents. We analyzed 99,125 human-based clinical rationales that provide plausible explanations for primary cancer site diagnoses, using them as additional training samples alongside 128,649 electronic pathology reports to evaluate transformer-based models for extracting primary cancer sites. We also investigated sufficiency as a way to measure rationale quality for pre-selecting rationales. Our results showed that clinical rationales as additional training data can improve model performance in high-resource scenarios but produce inconsistent behavior when resources are limited. Using sufficiency as an automatic metric to preselect rationales also leads to inconsistent results. Importantly, models trained on rationales were consistently outperformed by models trained on additional reports instead. This suggests that clinical rationales don't consistently improve model performance and are outperformed by simply using more reports. Therefore, if the goal is optimizing accuracy, annotation efforts should focus on labeling more reports rather than creating rationales. However, if explainability is the priority, training models on rationale-supplemented data may help them better identify rationale-like features. We conclude that using clinical rationales as additional training data results in smaller performance improvements and only slightly better explainability (measured as average token-level rationale coverage) compared to training on additional reports.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Virtual 3D meetings offer the potential to enhance copresence, increase engagement and thus improve effectiveness of remote meetings compared to standard 2D video calls. However, representing people in 3D meetings remains a challenge; existing solutions achieve high quality by using complex hardware, making use of fixed appearance via enrolment, or by inverting a pre-trained generative model. These approaches lead to constraints that are unwelcome and ill-fitting for videoconferencing applications. We present the first method to predict 3D Gaussian reconstructions in real time from a single 2D webcam feed, where the 3D representation is not only live and realistic, but also authentic to the input video. By conditioning the 3D representation on each video frame independently, our reconstruction faithfully recreates the input video from the captured viewpoint (a property we call authenticity), while generalizing realistically to novel viewpoints. Additionally, we introduce a stability loss to obtain reconstructions that are temporally stable on video sequences. We show that our method delivers state-of-the-art accuracy in visual quality and stability metrics compared to existing methods, and demonstrate our approach in live one-to-one 3D meetings using only a standard 2D camera and display. This demonstrates that our approach can allow anyone to communicate volumetrically, via a method for 3D videoconferencing that is not only highly accessible, but also realistic and authentic.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, fair, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have established them as powerful tools across numerous domains. However, persistent concerns about embedded biases, such as gender, racial, and cultural biases arising from their training data, raise significant questions about the ethical use and societal consequences of these technologies. This study investigates the extent to which LLMs capture cross-cultural differences and similarities in moral perspectives. Specifically, we examine whether LLM outputs align with patterns observed in international survey data on moral attitudes. To this end, we employ three complementary methods: (1) comparing variances in moral scores produced by models versus those reported in surveys, (2) conducting cluster alignment analyses to assess correspondence between country groupings derived from LLM outputs and survey data, and (3) directly probing models with comparative prompts using systematically chosen token pairs. Our results reveal that current LLMs often fail to reproduce the full spectrum of cross-cultural moral variation, tending to compress differences and exhibit low alignment with empirical survey patterns. These findings highlight a pressing need for more robust approaches to mitigate biases and improve cultural representativeness in LLMs. We conclude by discussing the implications for the responsible development and global deployment of LLMs, emphasizing fairness and ethical alignment.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Accurate segmentation of tubular structures, such as vascular networks, plays a critical role in various medical domains. A remaining significant challenge in this task is structural fragmentation, which can adversely impact downstream applications. Existing methods primarily focus on designing various loss functions to constrain global topological structures. However, they often overlook local discontinuity regions, leading to suboptimal segmentation results. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Global-to-Local Connectivity Preservation (GLCP) framework that can simultaneously perceive global and local structural characteristics of tubular networks. Specifically, we propose an Interactive Multi-head Segmentation (IMS) module to jointly learn global segmentation, skeleton maps, and local discontinuity maps, respectively. This enables our model to explicitly target local discontinuity regions while maintaining global topological integrity. In addition, we design a lightweight Dual-Attention-based Refinement (DAR) module to further improve segmentation quality by refining the resulting segmentation maps. Extensive experiments on both 2D and 3D datasets demonstrate that our GLCP achieves superior accuracy and continuity in tubular structure segmentation compared to several state-of-the-art approaches.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Extracting structured information from text, such as key-value pairs that could augment tabular data, is quite useful in many enterprise use cases. Although large language models (LLMs) have enabled numerous automated pipelines for converting natural language into structured formats, there is still a lack of benchmarks for evaluating their extraction quality, especially in specific domains or focused documents specific to a given organization. Building such benchmarks by manual annotations is labour-intensive and limits the size and scalability of the benchmarks. In this work, we present StructText, an end-to-end framework for automatically generating high-fidelity benchmarks for key-value extraction from text using existing tabular data. It uses available tabular data as structured ground truth, and follows a two-stage ``plan-then-execute'' pipeline to synthetically generate corresponding natural-language text. To ensure alignment between text and structured source, we introduce a multi-dimensional evaluation strategy that combines (a) LLM-based judgments on factuality, hallucination, and coherence and (b) objective extraction metrics measuring numeric and temporal accuracy. We evaluated the proposed method on 71,539 examples across 49 datasets. Results reveal that while LLMs achieve strong factual accuracy and avoid hallucination, they struggle with narrative coherence in producing extractable text. Notably, models presume numerical and temporal information with high fidelity yet this information becomes embedded in narratives that resist automated extraction. We release a framework, including datasets, evaluation tools, and baseline extraction systems, to support continued research.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a crucial medical imaging modality. However, long acquisition times remain a significant challenge, leading to increased costs, and reduced patient comfort. Recent studies have shown the potential of using deep learning models that incorporate information from prior subject-specific MRI scans to improve reconstruction quality of present scans. Integrating this prior information requires registration of the previous scan to the current image reconstruction, which can be time-consuming. We propose a novel deep-learning-based MRI reconstruction framework which consists of an initial reconstruction network, a deep registration model, and a transformer-based enhancement network. We validated our method on a longitudinal dataset of T1-weighted MRI scans with 2,808 images from 18 subjects at four acceleration factors (R5, R10, R15, R20). Quantitative metrics confirmed our approach's superiority over existing methods (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Furthermore, we analyzed the impact of our MRI reconstruction method on the downstream task of brain segmentation and observed improved accuracy and volumetric agreement with reference segmentations. Our approach also achieved a substantial reduction in total reconstruction time compared to methods that use traditional registration algorithms, making it more suitable for real-time clinical applications.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>explainability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Neural networks have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling physical systems, offering the ability to learn complex representations from limited data while integrating foundational scientific knowledge. In particular, neuro-symbolic approaches that combine data-driven learning, the neuro, with symbolic equations and rules, the symbolic, address the tension between methods that are purely empirical, which risk straying from established physical principles, and traditional numerical solvers that demand complete geometric knowledge and can be prohibitively expensive for high-fidelity simulations. In this work, we present a novel neuro-symbolic framework for reconstructing and simulating elastic objects directly from sparse multi-view image sequences, without requiring explicit geometric information. Specifically, we integrate a neural radiance field (NeRF) for object reconstruction with physics-informed neural networks (PINN) that incorporate the governing partial differential equations of elasticity. In doing so, our method learns a spatiotemporal representation of deforming objects that leverages both image supervision and symbolic physical constraints. To handle complex boundary and initial conditions, which are traditionally confronted using finite element methods, boundary element methods, or sensor-based measurements, we employ an energy-constrained Physics-Informed Neural Network architecture. This design enhances both simulation accuracy and the explainability of results.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Adapting large Video-Language Models (VLMs) for action detection using only a few examples poses challenges like overfitting and the granularity mismatch between scene-level pre-training and required person-centric understanding. We propose an efficient adaptation strategy combining parameter-efficient tuning (LoRA) with a novel learnable internal feature augmentation. Applied within the frozen VLM backbone using FiLM, these augmentations generate diverse feature variations directly relevant to the task. Additionally, we introduce a group-weighted loss function that dynamically modulates the training contribution of each augmented sample based on its prediction divergence relative to the group average. This promotes robust learning by prioritizing informative yet reasonable augmentations. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness on complex multi-label, multi-person action detection datasets (AVA, MOMA), achieving strong mAP performance and showcasing significant data efficiency for adapting VLMs from limited examples.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep learning models are widely used for time series classification (TSC) due to their scalability and efficiency. However, their performance degrades under challenging data conditions such as class similarity, multimodal distributions, and noise. To address these limitations, we propose CDNet, a Contrastive Diffusion-based Network that enhances existing classifiers by generating informative positive and negative samples via a learned diffusion process. Unlike traditional diffusion models that denoise individual samples, CDNet learns transitions between samples--both within and across classes--through convolutional approximations of reverse diffusion steps. We introduce a theoretically grounded CNN-based mechanism to enable both denoising and mode coverage, and incorporate an uncertainty-weighted composite loss for robust training. Extensive experiments on the UCR Archive and simulated datasets demonstrate that CDNet significantly improves state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning classifiers, particularly under noisy, similar, and multimodal conditions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vision-based bird's-eye-view (BEV) 3D object detection has advanced significantly in autonomous driving by offering cost-effectiveness and rich contextual information. However, existing methods often construct BEV representations by collapsing extracted object features, neglecting intrinsic environmental contexts, such as roads and pavements. This hinders detectors from comprehensively perceiving the characteristics of the physical world. To alleviate this, we introduce a multi-task learning framework, Collaborative Perceiver (CoP), that leverages spatial occupancy as auxiliary information to mine consistent structural and conceptual similarities shared between 3D object detection and occupancy prediction tasks, bridging gaps in spatial representations and feature refinement. To this end, we first propose a pipeline to generate dense occupancy ground truths incorporating local density information (LDO) for reconstructing detailed environmental information. Next, we employ a voxel-height-guided sampling (VHS) strategy to distill fine-grained local features according to distinct object properties. Furthermore, we develop a global-local collaborative feature fusion (CFF) module that seamlessly integrates complementary knowledge between both tasks, thus composing more robust BEV representations. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that CoP outperforms existing vision-based frameworks, achieving 49.5\% mAP and 59.2\% NDS on the test set.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Wildlife populations in Africa face severe threats, with vertebrate numbers declining by over 65% in the past five decades. In response, image classification using deep learning has emerged as a promising tool for biodiversity monitoring and conservation. This paper presents a comparative study of deep learning models for automatically classifying African wildlife images, focusing on transfer learning with frozen feature extractors. Using a public dataset of four species: buffalo, elephant, rhinoceros, and zebra; we evaluate the performance of DenseNet-201, ResNet-152, EfficientNet-B4, and Vision Transformer ViT-H/14. DenseNet-201 achieved the best performance among convolutional networks (67% accuracy), while ViT-H/14 achieved the highest overall accuracy (99%), but with significantly higher computational cost, raising deployment concerns. Our experiments highlight the trade-offs between accuracy, resource requirements, and deployability. The best-performing CNN (DenseNet-201) was integrated into a Hugging Face Gradio Space for real-time field use, demonstrating the feasibility of deploying lightweight models in conservation settings. This work contributes to African-grounded AI research by offering practical insights into model selection, dataset preparation, and responsible deployment of deep learning tools for wildlife conservation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) is a critical yet challenging task, as domain shifts in unseen environments can severely compromise model performance. While recent studies enhance feature alignment by projecting features into the source domain, they often neglect intrinsic latent domain priors, leading to suboptimal results. In this paper, we introduce PDAF, a Probabilistic Diffusion Alignment Framework that enhances the generalization of existing segmentation networks through probabilistic diffusion modeling. PDAF introduces a Latent Domain Prior (LDP) to capture domain shifts and uses this prior as a conditioning factor to align both source and unseen target domains. To achieve this, PDAF integrates into a pre-trained segmentation model and utilizes paired source and pseudo-target images to simulate latent domain shifts, enabling LDP modeling. The framework comprises three modules: the Latent Prior Extractor (LPE) predicts the LDP by supervising domain shifts; the Domain Compensation Module (DCM) adjusts feature representations to mitigate domain shifts; and the Diffusion Prior Estimator (DPE) leverages a diffusion process to estimate the LDP without requiring paired samples. This design enables PDAF to iteratively model domain shifts, progressively refining feature representations to enhance generalization under complex target conditions. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of PDAF across diverse and challenging urban scenes.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generating immersive 360° indoor panoramas from 2D top-down views has applications in virtual reality, interior design, real estate, and robotics. This task is challenging due to the lack of explicit 3D structure and the need for geometric consistency and photorealism. We propose Top2Pano, an end-to-end model for synthesizing realistic indoor panoramas from top-down views. Our method estimates volumetric occupancy to infer 3D structures, then uses volumetric rendering to generate coarse color and depth panoramas. These guide a diffusion-based refinement stage using ControlNet, enhancing realism and structural fidelity. Evaluations on two datasets show Top2Pano outperforms baselines, effectively reconstructing geometry, occlusions, and spatial arrangements. It also generalizes well, producing high-quality panoramas from schematic floorplans. Our results highlight Top2Pano's potential in bridging top-down views with immersive indoor synthesis.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Surface electromyography (EMG) enables non-invasive human-computer interaction in rehabilitation, prosthetics, and virtual reality. While deep learning models achieve over 97% classification accuracy, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks remains largely unexplored in the physical domain. We present ERa Attack, the first radio frequency (RF) adversarial method targeting EMG devices through intentional electromagnetic interference (IEMI). Using low-power software-defined radio transmitters, attackers inject optimized RF perturbations to mislead downstream models. Our approach bridges digital and physical domains: we generate adversarial perturbations using Projected Gradient Descent, extract 50-150 Hz components via inverse STFT, and employ synchronization-free strategies (constant spectrum noise or narrowband modulation). Perturbations, constrained to 1-10% of signal amplitude, are amplitude-modulated onto 433 MHz carriers. Experiments on the Myo Dataset (7 gestures, 350 samples) demonstrate significant impact: at 1 meter and 0 dBm transmission power, classification accuracy drops from 97.8% to 58.3%, with 41.7% misclassification rate and 25.6% targeted attack success rate. Attack effectiveness decreases exponentially with distance, recovering to 85% accuracy at 3 meters. Increasing power to 10 dBm reduces accuracy by an additional 15% at 1 meter. This work pioneers RF-based adversarial attacks on EMG recognition systems, revealing critical vulnerabilities in safety-critical applications. We quantify attack effectiveness across different perturbation modes and distances, and propose defenses including hardware shielding, spectrum monitoring, and adversarial training. Our findings inform the design of robust EMG systems against electromagnetic threats.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce LLaVA-Reward, an efficient reward model designed to automatically evaluate text-to-image (T2I) generations across multiple perspectives, leveraging pretrained multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Existing MLLM-based approaches require instruction-following data for supervised fine-tuning and evaluate generation quality on analyzing text response, which is time-consuming and difficult to train. To address this problem, we propose LLaVA-Reward, which directly utilizes the hidden states of MLLMs given text-image pairs. To enhance the bidirectional interaction between visual and textual representations in decoder-only MLLMs, we further propose adding a Skip-connection Cross Attention (SkipCA) module. This design enhances text-image correlation reasoning by connecting early-layer visual features with later-layer hidden this http URL addition, LLaVA-Reward supports different types of preference data for efficient fine-tuning, including paired preference data and unpaired data. We train LLaVA-Reward on four evaluation perspectives: text-image alignment, fidelity/artifact, safety, and overall ranking. Empirical results demonstrate that LLaVA-Reward outperforms conventional and MLLM-based methods in generating human-aligned scores for automatic evaluations and inference-time scaling in text-to-image generations.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Sequence modeling is crucial for AI to understand temporal data and detect complex time-dependent patterns. While recurrent neural networks (RNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and Transformers have advanced in capturing long-range dependencies, they struggle with achieving high accuracy with very long sequences due to limited memory retention (fixed context window). State-Space Models (SSMs) leverage exponentially decaying memory enabling lengthy context window and so they process very long data sequences more efficiently than recurrent and Transformer-based models. Unlike traditional neural models like CNNs and RNNs, SSM-based models require solving differential equations through continuous integration, making training and inference both compute- and memory-intensive on conventional CPUs and GPUs. In this paper we introduce a specialized hardware accelerator, EpochCore, for accelerating SSMs. EpochCore is based on systolic arrays (SAs) and is designed to enhance the energy efficiency and throughput of inference of SSM-based models for long-range sequence tasks. Within the SA, we propose a versatile processing element (PE) called LIMA-PE to perform traditional and specialized MAC operations to support traditional DNNs and SSMs. To complement the EpochCore microarchitecture, we propose a novel dataflow, ProDF, which enables highly efficient execution of SSM-based models. By leveraging the LIMA-PE microarchitecture and ProDF, EpochCore achieves on average 250x gains in performance and 45x improvement in energy efficiency, at the expense of 2x increase in area cost over traditional SA-based accelerators, and around ~2,000x improvement in latency/inference on LRA datasets compared to GPU kernel operations.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>LIT-PCBA is a widely used benchmark for virtual screening, but our audit reveals it is fundamentally compromised. The dataset suffers from egregious data leakage, rampant duplication, and pervasive analog redundancy -- flaws that invalidate its use for fair model evaluation. Notably, we identify 2,491 inactives duplicated across training and validation sets, and thousands more repeated within individual data splits (2,945 in training, 789 in validation). Critically, three ligands in the query set -- meant to represent unseen test cases -- are leaked: two appear in the training set, one in validation. Structural redundancy compounds these issues: for some targets, over 80% of query ligands are near duplicates, with Tanimoto similarity >= 0.9. In ALDH1 alone, we find 323 highly similar active pairs between training and validation sets, invalidating claims of chemical diversity. These and other flaws collectively cause models trained on LIT-PCBA to memorize rather than generalize. To demonstrate the consequences of these data integrity failures, we implement a trivial memorization-based baseline -- using no learning, no physics, and no modeling -- that outperforms state-of-the-art models, including deep neural networks like CHEESE, on LIT-PCBA simply by exploiting these artifacts. Our findings render the benchmark unfit for its intended purpose and call into question previous results based on its use. We share this audit to raise awareness and provide tooling to help the community develop more rigorous and reliable datasets going forward.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>A Membership Inference Attack (MIA) assesses how much a trained machine learning model reveals about its training data by determining whether specific query instances were included in the dataset. We classify existing MIAs into adaptive or non-adaptive, depending on whether the adversary is allowed to train shadow models on membership queries. In the adaptive setting, where the adversary can train shadow models after accessing query instances, we highlight the importance of exploiting membership dependencies between instances and propose an attack-agnostic framework called Cascading Membership Inference Attack (CMIA), which incorporates membership dependencies via conditional shadow training to boost membership inference performance. In the non-adaptive setting, where the adversary is restricted to training shadow models before obtaining membership queries, we introduce Proxy Membership Inference Attack (PMIA). PMIA employs a proxy selection strategy that identifies samples with similar behaviors to the query instance and uses their behaviors in shadow models to perform a membership posterior odds test for membership inference. We provide theoretical analyses for both attacks, and extensive experimental results demonstrate that CMIA and PMIA substantially outperform existing MIAs in both settings, particularly in the low false-positive regime, which is crucial for evaluating privacy risks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The computational cost of training multimodal large language models (MLLMs) rapidly increases with the number of tokens involved. Existing efficiency methods primarily target inference and rely on token reduction or merging, offering limited benefit during training. In this paper, we propose ReGATE (Reference$-$Guided Adaptive Token Elision), an adaptive token pruning method for accelerating MLLM training. Specifically, ReGATE adopts a teacher-student framework in which the MLLM being trained serves as the student, and a frozen reference large language model (LLM) acts as the teacher. The teacher computes per-token reference losses, which are combined with an exponential moving average (EMA) of the student's own difficulty scores. This adaptive difficulty-based scoring enables the selective processing of crucial tokens while bypassing less informative ones in the forward pass, significantly reducing computational overhead. Experiments demonstrate that ReGATE, when applied to VideoLLaMA2, matches the peak accuracy of standard training on MVBench up to 2$\times$ faster, using only 35% of the tokens. With additional training, it even surpasses the baseline on several multimodal benchmarks, all while reducing the total token count by over 41%. Code and models will be released soon.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning from graph-structured data, leveraging message passing to diffuse information and update node representations. However, most efforts have suggested that native interactions encoded in the graph may not be friendly for this process, motivating the development of graph rewiring methods. In this work, we propose a torque-driven hierarchical rewiring strategy, inspired by the notion of torque in classical mechanics, dynamically modulating message passing to improve representation learning in heterophilous graphs and enhance robustness against noisy graphs. Specifically, we define an interference-aware torque metric that integrates structural distance and energy scores to quantify the perturbation induced by edges, thereby encouraging each node to aggregate information from its nearest low-energy neighbors. We use the metric to hierarchically reconfigure the receptive field of each layer by judiciously pruning high-torque edges and adding low-torque links, suppressing propagation noise and boosting pertinent signals. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods on both heterophilous and homophilous graphs, and maintains high accuracy on noisy graph.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Autonomous driving requires an understanding of the static environment from sensor data. Learned Bird's-Eye View (BEV) encoders are commonly used to fuse multiple inputs, and a vector decoder predicts a vectorized map representation from the latent BEV grid. However, traditional map construction models provide deterministic point estimates, failing to capture uncertainty and the inherent ambiguities of real-world environments, such as occlusions and missing lane markings. We propose MapDiffusion, a novel generative approach that leverages the diffusion paradigm to learn the full distribution of possible vectorized maps. Instead of predicting a single deterministic output from learned queries, MapDiffusion iteratively refines randomly initialized queries, conditioned on a BEV latent grid, to generate multiple plausible map samples. This allows aggregating samples to improve prediction accuracy and deriving uncertainty estimates that directly correlate with scene ambiguity. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MapDiffusion achieves state-of-the-art performance in online map construction, surpassing the baseline by 5% in single-sample performance. We further show that aggregating multiple samples consistently improves performance along the ROC curve, validating the benefit of distribution modeling. Additionally, our uncertainty estimates are significantly higher in occluded areas, reinforcing their value in identifying regions with ambiguous sensor input. By modeling the full map distribution, MapDiffusion enhances the robustness and reliability of online vectorized HD map construction, enabling uncertainty-aware decision-making for autonomous vehicles in complex environments.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown significant autonomous capabilities in dynamically searching and incorporating relevant tools or Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for individual queries. However, fixed context windows limit effectiveness in multi-turn interactions requiring repeated, independent tool usage. We introduce MemTool, a short-term memory framework enabling LLM agents to dynamically manage tools or MCP server contexts across multi-turn conversations. MemTool offers three agentic architectures: 1) Autonomous Agent Mode, granting full tool management autonomy, 2) Workflow Mode, providing deterministic control without autonomy, and 3) Hybrid Mode, combining autonomous and deterministic control. Evaluating each MemTool mode across 13+ LLMs on the ScaleMCP benchmark, we conducted experiments over 100 consecutive user interactions, measuring tool removal ratios (short-term memory efficiency) and task completion accuracy. In Autonomous Agent Mode, reasoning LLMs achieve high tool-removal efficiency (90-94% over a 3-window average), while medium-sized models exhibit significantly lower efficiency (0-60%). Workflow and Hybrid modes consistently manage tool removal effectively, whereas Autonomous and Hybrid modes excel at task completion. We present trade-offs and recommendations for each MemTool mode based on task accuracy, agency, and model capabilities.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This study investigates the adoption of open-access, locally deployable causal large language models (LLMs) for travel mode choice prediction and introduces LiTransMC, the first fine-tuned causal LLM developed for this task. We systematically benchmark eleven LLMs (1-12B parameters) across three stated and revealed preference datasets, testing 396 configurations and generating over 79,000 synthetic commuter predictions. Beyond predictive accuracy, we evaluate models generated reasoning using BERTopic for topic modelling and a novel Explanation Strength Index, providing the first structured analysis of how LLMs articulate decision factors in alignment with behavioural theory. LiTransMC, fine-tuned using parameter efficient and loss masking strategy, achieved a weighted F1 score of 0.6845 and a Jensen-Shannon Divergence of 0.000245, surpassing both untuned local models and larger proprietary systems, including GPT-4o with advanced persona inference and embedding-based loading, while also outperforming classical mode choice methods such as discrete choice models and machine learning classifiers for the same dataset. This dual improvement, i.e., high instant-level accuracy and near-perfect distributional calibration, demonstrates the feasibility of creating specialist, locally deployable LLMs that integrate prediction and interpretability. Through combining structured behavioural prediction with natural language reasoning, this work unlocks the potential for conversational, multi-task transport models capable of supporting agent-based simulations, policy testing, and behavioural insight generation. These findings establish a pathway for transforming general purpose LLMs into specialized, explainable tools for transportation research and policy formulation, while maintaining privacy, reducing cost, and broadening access through local deployment.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Semi-supervised learning has proven highly effective in tackling the challenge of limited labeled training data in medical image segmentation. In general, current approaches, which rely on intra-image pixel-wise consistency training via pseudo-labeling, overlook the consistency at more comprehensive semantic levels (e.g., object region) and suffer from severe discrepancy of extracted features resulting from an imbalanced number of labeled and unlabeled data. To overcome these limitations, we present a new \underline{Du}al \underline{C}ross-\underline{i}mage \underline{S}emantic \underline{C}onsistency (DuCiSC) learning framework, for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Concretely, beyond enforcing pixel-wise semantic consistency, DuCiSC proposes dual paradigms to encourage region-level semantic consistency across: 1) labeled and unlabeled images; and 2) labeled and fused images, by explicitly aligning their prototypes. Relying on the dual paradigms, DuCiSC can effectively establish consistent cross-image semantics via prototype representations, thereby addressing the feature discrepancy issue. Moreover, we devise a novel self-aware confidence estimation strategy to accurately select reliable pseudo labels, allowing for exploiting the training dynamics of unlabeled data. Our DuCiSC method is extensively validated on four datasets, including two popular binary benchmarks in segmenting the left atrium and pancreas, a multi-class Automatic Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge dataset, and a challenging scenario of segmenting the inferior alveolar nerve that features complicated anatomical structures, showing superior segmentation results over previous state-of-the-art approaches.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion Policies (DPs) have attracted attention for their ability to achieve significant accuracy improvements in various imitation learning tasks. However, DPs depend on Diffusion Models, which require multiple noise removal steps to generate a single action, resulting in long generation times. To solve this problem, knowledge distillation-based methods such as Consistency Policy (CP) have been proposed. However, these methods require a significant amount of training time, especially for difficult tasks. In this study, we propose RAGDP (Retrieve-Augmented Generation for Diffusion Policies) as a novel framework that eliminates the need for additional training using a knowledge base to expedite the inference of pre-trained DPs. In concrete, RAGDP encodes observation-action pairs through the DP encoder to construct a vector database of expert demonstrations. During inference, the current observation is embedded, and the most similar expert action is extracted. This extracted action is combined with an intermediate noise removal step to reduce the number of steps required compared to the original diffusion step. We show that by using RAGDP with the base model and existing acceleration methods, we improve the accuracy and speed trade-off with no additional training. Even when accelerating the models 20 times, RAGDP maintains an advantage in accuracy, with a 7% increase over distillation models such as CP.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present HumorBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate large language models' (LLMs) ability to reason about and explain sophisticated humor in cartoon captions. As reasoning models increasingly saturate existing benchmarks in mathematics and science, novel and challenging evaluations of model intelligence beyond STEM domains are essential. Reasoning is fundamentally involved in text-based humor comprehension, requiring the identification of connections between concepts in cartoons/captions and external cultural references, wordplays, and other mechanisms. HumorBench includes approximately 300 unique cartoon-caption pairs from the New Yorker Caption Contest and this http URL, with expert-annotated evaluation rubrics identifying essential joke elements. LLMs are evaluated based on their explanations towards the humor and abilities in identifying the joke elements. To perform well on this task, models must form and test hypotheses about associations between concepts, potentially backtracking from initial interpretations to arrive at the most plausible explanation. Our extensive benchmarking of current SOTA models reveals three key insights: (1) LLM progress on STEM reasoning transfers effectively to humor comprehension; (2) models trained exclusively on STEM reasoning data still perform well on HumorBench, demonstrating strong transferability of reasoning abilities; and (3) test-time scaling by increasing thinking token budgets yields mixed results across different models in humor reasoning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse domains, but developing high-performing models for specialized applications often requires substantial human annotation -- a process that is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and expensive. In this paper, we address the label-efficient learning problem for supervised finetuning (SFT) by leveraging task-diversity as a fundamental principle for effective data selection. This is markedly different from existing methods based on the prompt-diversity. Our approach is based on two key observations: 1) task labels for different prompts are often readily available; 2) pre-trained models have significantly varying levels of confidence across tasks. We combine these facts to devise a simple yet effective sampling strategy: we select examples across tasks using an inverse confidence weighting strategy. This produces models comparable to or better than those trained with more complex sampling procedures, while being significantly easier to implement and less computationally intensive. Notably, our experimental results demonstrate that this method can achieve better accuracy than training on the complete dataset (a 4\% increase in MMLU score). Across various annotation budgets and two instruction finetuning datasets, our algorithm consistently performs at or above the level of the best existing methods, while reducing annotation costs by up to 80\%.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, defense, attack, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Neural networks have received a lot of attention recently, and related security issues have come with it. Many studies have shown that neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples that have been artificially perturbed with modification, which is too small to be distinguishable by human perception. Different attacks and defenses have been proposed to solve these problems, but there is little research on evaluating the robustness of neural networks and their inputs. In this work, we propose a metric called the neuron cover change rate (NCCR) to measure the ability of deep learning models to resist attacks and the stability of adversarial examples. NCCR monitors alterations in the output of specifically chosen neurons when the input is perturbed, and networks with a smaller degree of variation are considered to be more robust. The results of the experiment on image recognition and the speaker recognition model show that our metrics can provide a good assessment of the robustness of neural networks or their inputs. It can also be used to detect whether an input is adversarial or not, as adversarial examples are always less robust.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Open-set 3D object retrieval (3DOR) is an emerging task aiming to retrieve 3D objects of unseen categories beyond the training set. Existing methods typically utilize all modalities (i.e., voxels, point clouds, multi-view images) and train specific backbones before fusion. However, they still struggle to produce generalized representations due to insufficient 3D training data. Being contrastively pre-trained on web-scale image-text pairs, CLIP inherently produces generalized representations for a wide range of downstream tasks. Building upon it, we present a simple yet effective framework named Describe, Adapt and Combine (DAC) by taking only multi-view images for open-set 3DOR. DAC innovatively synergizes a CLIP model with a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) to learn generalized 3D representations, where the MLLM is used for dual purposes. First, it describes the seen category information to align with CLIP's training objective for adaptation during training. Second, it provides external hints about unknown objects complementary to visual cues during inference. To improve the synergy, we introduce an Additive-Bias Low-Rank adaptation (AB-LoRA), which alleviates overfitting and further enhances the generalization to unseen categories. With only multi-view images, DAC significantly surpasses prior arts by an average of +10.01\% mAP on four open-set 3DOR datasets. Moreover, its generalization is also validated on image-based and cross-dataset setups. Code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Test-time adaptation with pre-trained vision-language models has gained increasing attention for addressing distribution shifts during testing. Among these approaches, memory-based algorithms stand out due to their training-free nature and ability to leverage historical test data. However, existing test-time adaptation methods are typically designed for a single domain with abundant data. In decentralized settings such as federated learning, applying these methods individually to each client suffers from limited test data, while directly sharing a single global memory via the server prevents proper personalization to each client's unique distribution. To address this, we propose Latte, a novel framework where each client maintains a local memory to store embeddings from its own historical test data and an external memory to store class prototypes from other relevant clients. During communication, each client retrieves prototypes from similar clients under the server's coordination to expand its memory. For local adaptation, Latte utilizes both embedding similarity and uncertainty to enhance model performance. Our theoretical analysis shows that Latte effectively leverages in-distribution clients while remaining robust to out-of-distribution clients. Extensive experiments on domain adaptation and corruption benchmarks validate that Latte achieves superior performance in decentralized settings, while introducing only negligible communication and computation costs.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vietnam ranks among the top countries in terms of both internet traffic and online toxicity. As a result, implementing embedding models for recommendation and content control duties in applications is crucial. However, a lack of large-scale test datasets, both in volume and task diversity, makes it tricky for scientists to effectively evaluate AI models before deploying them in real-world, large-scale projects. To solve this important problem, we introduce a Vietnamese benchmark, VN-MTEB for embedding models, which we created by translating a large number of English samples from the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark using our new automated framework. We leverage the strengths of large language models (LLMs) and cutting-edge embedding models to conduct translation and filtering processes to retain high-quality samples, guaranteeing a natural flow of language and semantic fidelity while preserving named entity recognition (NER) and code snippets. Our comprehensive benchmark consists of 41 datasets from six tasks specifically designed for Vietnamese text embeddings. In our analysis, we find that bigger and more complex models using Rotary Positional Embedding outperform those using Absolute Positional Embedding in embedding tasks.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to identify anomalous events in videos and accurately determine their time intervals. Current VAD methods mainly fall into two categories: traditional DNN-based approaches that focus on temporal localization, and LLM-based approaches that emphasize semantic understanding. Both anomaly understanding and grounding are essential for comprehensive video anomaly detection and can complement each other. However, no existing model or dataset supports both tasks simultaneously. To address this, we introduce VAGU (Video Anomaly Grounding and Understanding), the first benchmark to integrate both tasks. Each VAGU instance includes annotations for anomaly category, semantic explanation, precise temporal grounding and Video QA. We also provide multiple-choice Video QA for objective evaluation. Based on this dataset, we propose Glance then Scrutinize (GtS), a training-free framework guided by textual prompts. The framework first enables coarse localization of high-probability anomalous regions, followed by detailed anomaly interpretation and temporal boundary refinement. Additionally, we propose the JeAUG metric, which jointly evaluates semantic interpretability and temporal precision, overcoming the limitations of traditional metrics. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our benchmark, framework, and evaluation metric.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models interact with users through a simulated 'Assistant' persona. While the Assistant is typically trained to be helpful, harmless, and honest, it sometimes deviates from these ideals. In this paper, we identify directions in the model's activation space-persona vectors-underlying several traits, such as evil, sycophancy, and propensity to hallucinate. We confirm that these vectors can be used to monitor fluctuations in the Assistant's personality at deployment time. We then apply persona vectors to predict and control personality shifts that occur during training. We find that both intended and unintended personality changes after finetuning are strongly correlated with shifts along the relevant persona vectors. These shifts can be mitigated through post-hoc intervention, or avoided in the first place with a new preventative steering method. Moreover, persona vectors can be used to flag training data that will produce undesirable personality changes, both at the dataset level and the individual sample level. Our method for extracting persona vectors is automated and can be applied to any personality trait of interest, given only a natural-language description.</li>

Speculative decoding (SD) mitigates this issue by using a smaller draft model to propose candidate tokens, which are then verified by the main model. However, this approach is impractical for devices lacking hardware accelerators like GPUs. To address this, we propose \emph{Token Map Drafting}, a model-free SD technique that eliminates the need for a separate draft model. Instead, we leverage a precomputed n-gram token map derived from domain-specific training data, enabling efficient speculative decoding with minimal overhead. Our method significantly accelerates ASR inference in structured, low-perplexity domains without sacrificing transcription accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate decoding speed-ups of $1.27\times$ on the CI-AVSR dataset and $1.37\times$ on our internal dataset without degrading recognition accuracy. Additionally, our approach achieves a $10\%$ absolute improvement in decoding speed over the Distill-spec baseline running on CPU, highlighting its effectiveness for on-device ASR applications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on attention mechanisms whose time complexity grows quadratically with input sequence length, creating significant computational bottlenecks during the prefilling stage. Existing static sparse attention methods typically degrade accuracy, while dynamic sparsity methods introduce additional computational overhead due to runtime sparse index estimation. To address these limitations, we propose TriangleMix, a novel training-free static attention pattern. TriangleMix employs dense attention in shallow layers and switches to a triangle-shaped sparse pattern in deeper layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TriangleMix reduces attention overhead by 3.7x to 15.3x in deep layers, and decreases overall Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) by 12% to 32% for sequence lengths ranging from 32K to 128K, without sacrificing model accuracy. Moreover, TriangleMix can be seamlessly integrated with dynamic sparsity methods to achieve further speedup, e.g. accelerating MInference by 19% at 128K, highlighting its potential to enhance LLM inference efficiency.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Robust deepfake detection models must be capable of generalizing to ever-evolving manipulation techniques beyond training data. A promising strategy is to augment the training data with online synthesized fake images containing broadly generalizable artifacts. However, in the context of deepfake detection, it is surprising that jointly training on both original and online synthesized forgeries may result in degraded performance. This contradicts the common belief that incorporating more source-domain data should enhance detection accuracy. Through empirical analysis, we trace this degradation to gradient conflicts during backpropagation which force a trade-off between source domain accuracy and target domain generalization. To overcome this issue, we propose a Conflict-Suppressed Deepfake Detection (CS-DFD) framework that explicitly mitigates the gradient conflict via two synergistic modules. First, an Update Vector Search (UVS) module searches for an alternative update vector near the initial gradient vector to reconcile the disparities of the original and online synthesized forgeries. By further transforming the search process into an extremum optimization problem, UVS yields the uniquely update vector, which maximizes the simultaneous loss reductions for each data type. Second, a Conflict Gradient Reduction (CGR) module enforces a low-conflict feature embedding space through a novel Conflict Descent Loss. This loss penalizes misaligned gradient directions and guides the learning of representations with aligned, non-conflicting gradients. The synergy of UVS and CGR alleviates gradient interference in both parameter optimization and representation learning. Experiments on multiple deepfake benchmarks demonstrate that CS-DFD achieves state-of-the-art performance in both in-domain detection accuracy and cross-domain generalization.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The manifold hypothesis suggests that high-dimensional neural time series lie on a low-dimensional manifold shaped by simpler underlying dynamics. To uncover this structure, latent dynamical variable models such as state-space models, recurrent neural networks, neural ordinary differential equations, and Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models are widely used. We propose a novel hierarchical stochastic differential equation (SDE) model that balances computational efficiency and interpretability, addressing key limitations of existing methods. Our model assumes the trajectory of a manifold can be reconstructed from a sparse set of samples from the manifold trajectory. The latent space is modeled using Brownian bridge SDEs, with points - specified in both time and value - sampled from a multivariate marked point process. These Brownian bridges define the drift of a second set of SDEs, which are then mapped to the observed data. This yields a continuous, differentiable latent process capable of modeling arbitrarily complex time series as the number of manifold points increases. We derive training and inference procedures and show that the computational cost of inference scales linearly with the length of the observation data. We then validate our model on both synthetic data and neural recordings to demonstrate that it accurately recovers the underlying manifold structure and scales effectively with data dimensionality.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, defense, attack, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Anticipating emerging attack methodologies is crucial for proactive cybersecurity. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled the automated generation of phishing messages and accelerated research into potential attack techniques. However, predicting future threats remains challenging due to reliance on existing training data. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that integrates LLM-based phishing attack simulations with a genetic algorithm in a psychological context, enabling phishing strategies to evolve dynamically through adversarial interactions with simulated victims. Through simulations using Llama 3.1, we demonstrate that (1) self-evolving phishing strategies employ increasingly sophisticated psychological manipulation techniques, surpassing naive LLM-generated attacks, (2) variations in a victim's prior knowledge significantly influence the evolution of attack strategies, and (3) adversarial interactions between evolving attacks and adaptive defenses create a cat-and-mouse dynamic, revealing an inherent asymmetry in cybersecurity -- attackers continuously refine their methods, whereas defenders struggle to comprehensively counter all evolving threats. Our approach provides a scalable, cost-effective method for analyzing the evolution of phishing strategies and defenses, offering insights into future social engineering threats and underscoring the necessity of proactive cybersecurity measures.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, security, defense, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The increasing sophistication of large vision-language models (LVLMs) has been accompanied by advances in safety alignment mechanisms designed to prevent harmful content generation. However, these defenses remain vulnerable to sophisticated adversarial attacks. Existing jailbreak methods typically rely on direct and semantically explicit prompts, overlooking subtle vulnerabilities in how LVLMs compose information over multiple reasoning steps. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective jailbreak framework inspired by Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) techniques from software security. Our approach decomposes a harmful instruction into a sequence of individually benign visual gadgets. A carefully engineered textual prompt directs the sequence of inputs, prompting the model to integrate the benign visual gadgets through its reasoning process to produce a coherent and harmful output. This makes the malicious intent emergent and difficult to detect from any single component. We validate our method through extensive experiments on established benchmarks including SafeBench and MM-SafetyBench, targeting popular LVLMs. Results show that our approach consistently and substantially outperforms existing baselines on state-of-the-art models, achieving near-perfect attack success rates (over 0.90 on SafeBench) and improving ASR by up to 0.39. Our findings reveal a critical and underexplored vulnerability that exploits the compositional reasoning abilities of LVLMs, highlighting the urgent need for defenses that secure the entire reasoning process.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Knowledge conflict often arises in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, where retrieved documents may be inconsistent with one another or contradict the model's parametric knowledge. Existing benchmarks for investigating the phenomenon have notable limitations, including a narrow focus on the question answering setup, heavy reliance on entity substitution techniques, and a restricted range of conflict types. To address these issues, we propose a knowledge graph (KG)-based framework that generates varied and subtle conflicts between two similar yet distinct contexts, while ensuring interpretability through the explicit relational structure of KGs. Experimental results on our benchmark, MAGIC, provide intriguing insights into the inner workings of LLMs regarding knowledge conflict: both open-source and proprietary models struggle with conflict detection -- especially when multi-hop reasoning is required -- and often fail to pinpoint the exact source of contradictions. Finally, we present in-depth analyses that serve as a foundation for improving LLMs in integrating diverse, sometimes even conflicting, information.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This study investigates the cognitive plausibility of the Spanish irregular morphomic pattern by directly comparing transformer-based neural networks to human behavioral data from \citet{Nevins2015TheRA}. Using the same analytical framework as the original human study, we evaluate whether transformer models can replicate human-like sensitivity to a complex linguistic phenomena, the morphome, under controlled input conditions. Our experiments focus on three frequency conditions: natural, low-frequency, and high-frequency distributions of verbs exhibiting irregular morphomic patterns. While the models outperformed humans in stem and suffix accuracy, a clear divergence emerged in response preferences. Unlike humans, who consistently favored natural responses across all test items, models' preferred irregular responses and were influenced by the proportion of irregular verbs in their training data. Additionally, models trained on the natural and low-frequency distributions, but not the high-frequency distribution, were sensitive to the phonological similarity between test items and real Spanish L-shaped verbs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Online high-definition (HD) map construction plays an increasingly important role in scaling autonomous driving systems. Transformer-based methods have become prevalent in online HD map construction; however, existing approaches often neglect the inherent spatial and semantic relationships among map elements, which limits their accuracy and generalization. To address this, we propose RelMap, an end-to-end framework that enhances online map construction by incorporating spatial relations and semantic priors. We introduce a Class-aware Spatial Relation Prior, which explicitly encodes relative positional dependencies between map elements using a learnable class-aware relation encoder. Additionally, we propose a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based Semantic Prior, which routes features to class-specific experts based on predicted class probabilities, refining instance feature decoding. Our method is compatible with both single-frame and temporal perception backbones, achieving state-of-the-art performance on both the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable vision-language reasoning, yet often generate plausible outputs that are factually incorrect or visually ungrounded, thereby compromising their reliability. Direct preference optimization (DPO) is a common strategy for correcting hallucinations by aligning model outputs with human preferences. Existing DPO strategies typically treat hallucination-related preferences as fixed targets, relying on static supervision signals during training. This approach tends to overfit to superficial linguistic cues in preference data, leading to distributional rigidity and spurious correlations that impair grounding in causally relevant visual information. To overcome this limitation, we propose TARS, a token-adaptive preference strategy that reformulates DPO as a min-max optimization problem. TARS maximizes token-level distributional shifts under semantic constraints to simulate alignment uncertainty, and simultaneously minimizes the expected preference loss under these controlled perturbations. This joint objective preserves causal grounding while mitigating overfitting to preference patterns, thereby reducing hallucinations in multimodal reasoning. We evaluate TARS on multiple hallucination benchmarks and find consistently strong performance. Using only 4.8k preference samples and no expert feedback, TARS reduces hallucination rates from 26.4% to 13.2% and decreases cognition value from 2.5 to 0.4. It outperforms standard DPO and matches GPT-4o on several key metrics.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Unlike fully supervised semantic segmentation, weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) relies on weaker forms of supervision to perform dense prediction tasks. Among the various types of weak supervision, WSSS with image level annotations is considered both the most challenging and the most practical, attracting significant research attention. Therefore, in this review, we focus on WSSS with image level annotations. Additionally, this review concentrates on mainstream research directions, deliberately omitting less influential branches. Given the rapid development of new methods and the limitations of existing surveys in capturing recent trends, there is a pressing need for an updated and comprehensive review. Our goal is to fill this gap by synthesizing the latest advancements and state-of-the-art techniques in WSSS with image level labels. Basically, we provide a comprehensive review of recent advancements in WSSS with image level labels, categorizing existing methods based on the types and levels of additional supervision involved. We also examine the challenges of applying advanced methods to domain specific datasets in WSSS,a topic that remains underexplored. Finally, we discuss the current challenges, evaluate the limitations of existing approaches, and outline several promising directions for future research. This review is intended for researchers who are already familiar with the fundamental concepts of WSSS and are seeking to deepen their understanding of current advances and methodological innovations.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present a novel approach to face aging that addresses the limitations of current methods which treat aging as a global, homogeneous process. Existing techniques using GANs and diffusion models often condition generation on a reference image and target age, neglecting that facial regions age heterogeneously due to both intrinsic chronological factors and extrinsic elements like sun exposure. Our method leverages latent diffusion models to selectively age specific facial regions using local aging signs. This approach provides significantly finer-grained control over the generation process, enabling more realistic and personalized aging. We employ a latent diffusion refiner to seamlessly blend these locally aged regions, ensuring a globally consistent and natural-looking synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively achieves three key criteria for successful face aging: robust identity preservation, high-fidelity and realistic imagery, and a natural, controllable aging progression.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The success of visual tracking has been largely driven by datasets with manual box annotations. However, these box annotations require tremendous human effort, limiting the scale and diversity of existing tracking datasets. In this work, we present a novel Self-Supervised Tracking framework named \textbf{\tracker}, designed to eliminate the need of box annotations. Specifically, a decoupled spatio-temporal consistency training framework is proposed to learn rich target information across timestamps through global spatial localization and local temporal association. This allows for the simulation of appearance and motion variations of instances in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, an instance contrastive loss is designed to learn instance-level correspondences from a multi-view perspective, offering robust instance supervision without additional labels. This new design paradigm enables {\tracker} to effectively learn generic tracking representations in a self-supervised manner, while reducing reliance on extensive box annotations. Extensive experiments on nine benchmark datasets demonstrate that {\tracker} surpasses \textit{SOTA} self-supervised tracking methods, achieving an improvement of more than 25.3\%, 20.4\%, and 14.8\% in AUC (AO) score on the GOT10K, LaSOT, TrackingNet datasets, respectively.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Medical image segmentation requires not only accuracy but also robustness under challenging imaging conditions. In this study, we show that a carefully configured DeepLabv3 model can achieve high performance in segmenting induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell colonies, and, under our experimental conditions, outperforms large-scale foundation models such as SAM2 and its medical variant MedSAM2 without structural modifications. These results suggest that, for specialized tasks characterized by subtle, low-contrast boundaries, increased model complexity does not necessarily translate to better performance. Our work revisits the assumption that ever-larger and more generalized architectures are always preferable, and provides evidence that appropriately adapted, simpler models may offer strong accuracy and practical reliability in domain-specific biomedical applications. We also offer an open-source implementation that includes strategies for small datasets and domain-specific encoding, with the aim of supporting further advances in semantic segmentation for regenerative medicine and related fields.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) plays a crucial role in maintaining the safety and reliability of manufacturing systems. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show strong vision-language reasoning abilities, their effectiveness in IAD remains limited without domain-specific adaptation. In this work, we propose EMIT, a unified framework that enhances MLLMs for IAD via difficulty-aware group relative policy optimization (GRPO). EMIT constructs a multi-task IAD dataset and utilizes GPT-generated object text descriptions to compensate for missing defective images. For few-shot anomaly detection, it integrates a soft prompt and heatmap-guided contrastive embeddings derived from patch-level comparisons. To better handle difficult data samples, i.e., cases where the MLLM struggles to generate correct answers, we propose a difficulty-aware GRPO that extends the original GRPO by incorporating a response resampling strategy to ensure the inclusion of correct answers in the sampled responses, as well as an advantage reweighting mechanism to strengthen learning from such difficult data samples. Extensive experiments on the MMAD benchmark demonstrate that EMIT significantly enhances the IAD performance of MLLMs, achieving an average improvement of 7.77\% over the base model (InternVL3-8B) across seven tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In recent years, diffusion models have been widely adopted for image inpainting tasks due to their powerful generative capabilities, achieving impressive results. Existing multimodal inpainting methods based on diffusion models often require architectural modifications and retraining, resulting in high computational cost. In contrast, context-aware diffusion inpainting methods leverage the model's inherent priors to adjust intermediate denoising steps, enabling high-quality inpainting without additional training and significantly reducing computation. However, these methods lack fine-grained control over the masked regions, often leading to semantically inconsistent or visually implausible content. To address this issue, we propose GuidPaint, a training-free, class-guided image inpainting framework. By incorporating classifier guidance into the denoising process, GuidPaint enables precise control over intermediate generations within the masked areas, ensuring both semantic consistency and visual realism. Furthermore, it integrates stochastic and deterministic sampling, allowing users to select preferred intermediate results and deterministically refine them. Experimental results demonstrate that GuidPaint achieves clear improvements over existing context-aware inpainting methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Modern in-vehicle networks face various cyber threats due to the lack of encryption and authentication in the Controller Area Network (CAN). To address this security issue, this paper presents GUARD-CAN, an anomaly detection framework that combines graph-based representation learning with time-series modeling. GUARD-CAN splits CAN messages into fixed-length windows and converts each window into a graph that preserves message order. To detect anomalies in the timeaware and structure-aware context at the same window, GUARD-CAN takes advantage of the overcomplete Autoencoder (AE) and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to generate graph embedding vectors. The model groups these vectors into sequences and feeds them into the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to detect temporal anomaly patterns across the graphs. GUARD-CAN performs anomaly detection at both the sequence level and the window level, and this allows multi-perspective performance evaluation. The model also verifies the importance of window size selection through an analysis based on Shannon entropy. As a result, GUARD-CAN shows that the proposed model detects four types of CAN attacks (flooding, fuzzing, replay and spoofing attacks) effectively without relying on complex feature engineering.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Reinforcement learning (RL) has significantly improved the reasoning ability of large language models. However, current reward models underperform in challenging reasoning scenarios and predominant RL training paradigms rely on rule-based or reference-based rewards, which impose two critical limitations: 1) the dependence on finely annotated reference answer to attain rewards; and 2) the requirement for constrained output format. These limitations fundamentally hinder further RL data scaling and sustained enhancement of model reasoning performance. To address these limitations, we propose a comprehensive framework for evaluating and improving the performance of reward models in complex reasoning scenarios. We first present a reasoning-oriented benchmark (Libra Bench), systematically constructed from a diverse collection of challenging mathematical problems and advanced reasoning models, to address the limitations of existing reward model benchmarks in reasoning scenarios. We further introduce a novel approach for improving the generative reward model via learning-to-think methodologies. Based on the proposed approach, we develop Libra-RM series, a collection of generative reward models with reasoning capabilities that achieve state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks. Comprehensive downstream experiments are conducted and the experimental results demonstrate the correlation between our Libra Bench and downstream application, and the potential of Libra-RM to further improve reasoning models with unlabeled data.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Current approaches to genomic sequence modeling often struggle to align the inductive biases of machine learning models with the evolutionarily-informed structure of biological systems. To this end, we formulate a novel application of hyperbolic CNNs that exploits this structure, enabling more expressive DNA sequence representations. Our strategy circumvents the need for explicit phylogenetic mapping while discerning key properties of sequences pertaining to core functional and regulatory behavior. Across 37 out of 42 genome interpretation benchmark datasets, our hyperbolic models outperform their Euclidean equivalents. Notably, our approach even surpasses state-of-the-art performance on seven GUE benchmark datasets, consistently outperforming many DNA language models while using orders of magnitude fewer parameters and avoiding pretraining. Our results include a novel set of benchmark datasets--the Transposable Elements Benchmark--which explores a major but understudied component of the genome with deep evolutionary significance. We further motivate our work by exploring how our hyperbolic models recognize genomic signal under various data-generating conditions and by constructing an empirical method for interpreting the hyperbolicity of dataset embeddings. Throughout these assessments, we find persistent evidence highlighting the potential of our hyperbolic framework as a robust paradigm for genome representation learning.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Video anomaly detection (VAD) aims to identify and ground anomalous behaviors or events in videos, serving as a core technology in the fields of intelligent surveillance and public safety. With the advancement of deep learning, the continuous evolution of deep model architectures has driven innovation in VAD methodologies, significantly enhancing feature representation and scene adaptability, thereby improving algorithm generalization and expanding application boundaries. More importantly, the rapid development of multi-modal large language (MLLMs) and large language models (LLMs) has introduced new opportunities and challenges to the VAD field. Under the support of MLLMs and LLMs, VAD has undergone significant transformations in terms of data annotation, input modalities, model architectures, and task objectives. The surge in publications and the evolution of tasks have created an urgent need for systematic reviews of recent advancements. This paper presents the first comprehensive survey analyzing VAD methods based on MLLMs and LLMs, providing an in-depth discussion of the changes occurring in the VAD field in the era of large models and their underlying causes. Additionally, this paper proposes a unified framework that encompasses both deep neural network (DNN)-based and LLM-based VAD methods, offering a thorough analysis of the new VAD paradigms empowered by LLMs, constructing a classification system, and comparing their strengths and weaknesses. Building on this foundation, this paper focuses on current VAD methods based on MLLMs/LLMs. Finally, based on the trajectory of technological advancements and existing bottlenecks, this paper distills key challenges and outlines future research directions, offering guidance for the VAD community.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are generally trained at fixed resolutions, limiting their capability when scaling up to high-resolution images. While training-based approaches address this limitation by training on high-resolution datasets, they require large amounts of data and considerable computational resources, making them less practical. Consequently, training-free methods, particularly patch-based approaches, have become a popular alternative. These methods divide an image into patches and fuse the denoising paths of each patch, showing strong performance on high-resolution generation. However, we observe two critical issues for patch-based approaches, which we call ``patch-level distribution shift" and ``increased patch monotonicity." To address these issues, we propose Adaptive Path Tracing (APT), a framework that combines Statistical Matching to ensure patch distributions remain consistent in upsampled latents and Scale-aware Scheduling to deal with the patch monotonicity. As a result, APT produces clearer and more refined details in high-resolution images. In addition, APT enables a shortcut denoising process, resulting in faster sampling with minimal quality degradation. Our experimental results confirm that APT produces more detailed outputs with improved inference speed, providing a practical approach to high-resolution image generation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Medical imaging has significantly advanced computer-aided diagnosis, yet its re-identification (ReID) risks raise critical privacy concerns, calling for de-identification (DeID) techniques. Unfortunately, existing DeID methods neither particularly preserve medical semantics, nor are flexibly adjustable towards different privacy levels. To address these issues, we propose a divide-and-conquer framework comprising two steps: (1) Identity-Blocking, which blocks varying proportions of identity-related regions, to achieve different privacy levels; and (2) Medical-Semantics-Compensation, which leverages pre-trained Medical Foundation Models (MFMs) to extract medical semantic features to compensate the blocked regions. Moreover, recognizing that features from MFMs may still contain residual identity information, we introduce a Minimum Description Length principle-based feature decoupling strategy, to effectively decouple and discard such identity components. Extensive evaluations against existing approaches across seven datasets and three downstream tasks, demonstrates our state-of-the-art performance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, explainability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Accurately forecasting commodity demand remains a critical challenge due to volatile market dynamics, nonlinear dependencies, and the need for economically consistent predictions. This paper introduces PREIG, a novel deep learning framework tailored for commodity demand forecasting. The model uniquely integrates a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) architecture with physics-informed neural network (PINN) principles by embedding a domain-specific economic constraint: the negative elasticity between price and demand. This constraint is enforced through a customized loss function that penalizes violations of the physical rule, ensuring that model predictions remain interpretable and aligned with economic theory. To further enhance predictive performance and stability, PREIG incorporates a hybrid optimization strategy that couples NAdam and L-BFGS with Population-Based Training (POP). Experiments across multiple commodities datasets demonstrate that PREIG significantly outperforms traditional econometric models (ARIMA,GARCH) and deep learning baselines (BPNN,RNN) in both RMSE and MAPE. When compared with GRU,PREIG maintains good explainability while still performing well in prediction. By bridging domain knowledge, optimization theory and deep learning, PREIG provides a robust, interpretable, and scalable solution for high-dimensional nonlinear time series forecasting in economy.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce local matching stability and furthest matchable frame as quantitative measures for evaluating the success of underwater image enhancement. This enhancement process addresses visual degradation caused by light absorption, scattering, marine growth, and debris. Enhanced imagery plays a critical role in downstream tasks such as path detection and autonomous navigation for underwater vehicles, relying on robust feature extraction and frame matching. To assess the impact of enhancement techniques on frame-matching performance, we propose a novel evaluation framework tailored to underwater environments. Through metric-based analysis, we identify strengths and limitations of existing approaches and pinpoint gaps in their assessment of real-world applicability. By incorporating a practical matching strategy, our framework offers a robust, context-aware benchmark for comparing enhancement methods. Finally, we demonstrate how visual improvements affect the performance of a complete real-world algorithm -- Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) -- reinforcing the framework's relevance to operational underwater scenarios.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, interpretability, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In recent years, Explainable AI has gained traction as an approach to enhancing model interpretability and transparency, particularly in complex models such as detection transformers. Despite rapid advancements, a substantial research gap remains in understanding the distinct roles of internal components - knowledge that is essential for improving transparency and efficiency. Inspired by neuroscientific ablation studies, which investigate the functions of brain regions through selective impairment, we systematically analyze the impact of ablating key components in three state-of-the-art detection transformer models: Detection transformer (DETR), deformable detection transformer (DDETR), and DETR with improved denoising anchor boxes (DINO). The ablations target query embeddings, encoder and decoder multi-head self-attentions (MHSA) as well as decoder multi-head cross-attention (MHCA) layers. We evaluate the effects of these ablations on the performance metrics gIoU and F1-score, quantifying effects on both the classification and regression sub-tasks on the COCO dataset. To facilitate reproducibility and future research, we publicly release the DeepDissect library. Our findings reveal model-specific resilience patterns: while DETR is particularly sensitive to ablations in encoder MHSA and decoder MHCA, DDETR's multi-scale deformable attention enhances robustness, and DINO exhibits the greatest resilience due to its look-forward twice update rule, which helps distributing knowledge across blocks. These insights also expose structural redundancies, particularly in DDETR's and DINO's decoder MHCA layers, highlighting opportunities for model simplification without sacrificing performance. This study advances XAI for DETRs by clarifying the contributions of internal components to model performance, offering insights to optimize and improve transparency and efficiency in critical applications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the latest advancements in multimodal learning, effectively addressing the spatial and semantic losses of visual data after encoding remains a critical challenge. This is because the performance of large multimodal models is positively correlated with the coupling between visual encoders and large language models. Existing approaches often face issues such as vector gaps or semantic disparities, resulting in information loss during the propagation process. To address these issues, we propose MAGE (Multimodal Alignment and Generation Enhancement), a novel framework that bridges the semantic spaces of vision and text through an innovative alignment mechanism. By introducing the Intelligent Alignment Network (IAN), MAGE achieves dimensional and semantic alignment. To reduce the gap between synonymous heterogeneous data, we employ a training strategy that combines cross-entropy and mean squared error, significantly enhancing the alignment effect. Moreover, to enhance MAGE's "Any-to-Any" capability, we developed a fine-tuning dataset for multimodal tool-calling instructions to expand the model's output capability boundaries. Finally, our proposed multimodal large model architecture, MAGE, achieved significantly better performance compared to similar works across various evaluation benchmarks, including MME, MMBench, and SEED.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Existing fine-grained image retrieval (FGIR) methods predominantly rely on supervision from predefined categories to learn discriminative representations for retrieving fine-grained objects. However, they inadvertently introduce category-specific semantics into the retrieval representation, creating semantic dependencies on predefined classes that critically hinder generalization to unseen categories. To tackle this, we propose AdvRF, a novel adversarial reconstruction feedback framework aimed at learning category-agnostic discrepancy representations. Specifically, AdvRF reformulates FGIR as a visual discrepancy reconstruction task via synergizing category-aware discrepancy localization from retrieval models with category-agnostic feature learning from reconstruction models. The reconstruction model exposes residual discrepancies overlooked by the retrieval model, forcing it to improve localization accuracy, while the refined signals from the retrieval model guide the reconstruction model to improve its reconstruction ability. Consequently, the retrieval model localizes visual differences, while the reconstruction model encodes these differences into category-agnostic representations. This representation is then transferred to the retrieval model through knowledge distillation for efficient deployment. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that our AdvRF achieves impressive performance on both widely-used fine-grained and coarse-grained datasets.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in large language and vision-language models have enabled strong reasoning capabilities, yet they remain impractical for specialized domains like remote sensing, where annotated data is scarce and expensive. We present the first few-shot reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR) framework for satellite imagery that eliminates the need for caption supervision--relying solely on lightweight, rule-based binary or IoU-based rewards. Adapting the "1-shot RLVR" paradigm from language models to vision-language models, we employ policy-gradient optimization with as few as one curated example to align model outputs for satellite reasoning tasks. Comprehensive experiments across multiple remote sensing benchmarks--including classification, visual question answering, and grounding--show that even a single example yields substantial improvements over the base model. Scaling to 128 examples matches or exceeds models trained on thousands of annotated samples. While the extreme one-shot setting can induce mild, task-specific overfitting, our approach consistently demonstrates robust generalization and efficiency across diverse tasks. Further, we find that prompt design and loss weighting significantly influence training stability and final accuracy. Our method enables cost-effective and data-efficient development of domain-specialist vision-language reasoning models, offering a pragmatic recipe for data-scarce fields: start from a compact VLM, curate a handful of reward-checkable cases, and train via RLVR.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have driven substantial progress in natural language processing but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, raising concerns about their robustness in real-world applications. Previous studies have sought to mitigate the impact of adversarial attacks by introducing adversarial perturbations into the training process, either implicitly or explicitly. While both strategies enhance robustness, they often incur high computational costs. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective add-on module that enhances the adversarial robustness of PLMs by removing instance-level principal components, without relying on conventional adversarial defences or perturbing the original training data. Our approach transforms the embedding space to approximate Gaussian properties, thereby reducing its susceptibility to adversarial perturbations while preserving semantic relationships. This transformation aligns embedding distributions in a way that minimises the impact of adversarial noise on decision boundaries, enhancing robustness without requiring adversarial examples or costly training-time augmentation. Evaluations on eight benchmark datasets show that our approach improves adversarial robustness while maintaining comparable before-attack accuracy to baselines, achieving a balanced trade-off between robustness and generalisation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved remarkable success in image recognition, yet standard ViT architectures are hampered by substantial parameter redundancy and high computational cost, limiting their practical deployment. While recent efforts on efficient ViTs primarily focus on static model compression or token-level sparsification, they remain constrained by fixed computational depth for all tokens. In this work, we present MoR-ViT, a novel vision transformer framework that, for the first time, incorporates a token-level dynamic recursion mechanism inspired by the Mixture-of-Recursions (MoR) paradigm. This approach enables each token to adaptively determine its processing depth, yielding a flexible and input-dependent allocation of computational resources. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K and transfer benchmarks demonstrate that MoR-ViT not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with up to 70% parameter reduction and 2.5x inference acceleration, but also outperforms leading efficient ViT baselines such as DynamicViT and TinyViT under comparable conditions. These results establish dynamic recursion as an effective strategy for efficient vision transformers and open new avenues for scalable and deployable deep learning models in real-world scenarios.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Retrosynthesis planning remains a central challenge in molecular discovery due to the vast and complex chemical reaction space. While traditional template-based methods offer tractability, they suffer from poor scalability and limited generalization, and template-free generative approaches risk generating invalid reactions. In this work, we propose TempRe, a generative framework that reformulates template-based approaches as sequence generation, enabling scalable, flexible, and chemically plausible retrosynthesis. We evaluated TempRe across single-step and multi-step retrosynthesis tasks, demonstrating its superiority over both template classification and SMILES-based generation methods. On the PaRoutes multi-step benchmark, TempRe achieves strong top-k route accuracy. Furthermore, we extend TempRe to direct multi-step synthesis route generation, providing a lightweight and efficient alternative to conventional single-step and search-based approaches. These results highlight the potential of template generative modeling as a powerful paradigm in computer-aided synthesis planning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the agricultural domain, the deployment of large language models (LLMs) is hindered by the lack of training data and evaluation benchmarks. To mitigate this issue, we propose AgriEval, the first comprehensive Chinese agricultural benchmark with three main characteristics: (1) Comprehensive Capability Evaluation. AgriEval covers six major agriculture categories and 29 subcategories within agriculture, addressing four core cognitive scenarios: memorization, understanding, inference, and generation. (2) High-Quality Data. The dataset is curated from university-level examinations and assignments, providing a natural and robust benchmark for assessing the capacity of LLMs to apply knowledge and make expert-like decisions. (3) Diverse Formats and Extensive Scale. AgriEval comprises 14,697 multiple-choice questions and 2,167 open-ended question-and-answer questions, establishing it as the most extensive agricultural benchmark available to date. We also present comprehensive experimental results over 51 open-source and commercial LLMs. The experimental results reveal that most existing LLMs struggle to achieve 60% accuracy, underscoring the developmental potential in agricultural LLMs. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments to investigate factors influencing model performance and propose strategies for enhancement.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The detection of micro-expression Action Units (AUs) is a formidable challenge in affective computing, pivotal for decoding subtle, involuntary human emotions. While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate profound reasoning abilities, their application to the fine-grained, low-intensity domain of micro-expression AU detection remains unexplored. This paper pioneers this direction by introducing \textbf{AU-LLM}, a novel framework that for the first time uses LLM to detect AUs in micro-expression datasets with subtle intensities and the scarcity of data. We specifically address the critical vision-language semantic gap, the \textbf{Enhanced Fusion Projector (EFP)}. The EFP employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to intelligently fuse mid-level (local texture) and high-level (global semantics) visual features from a specialized 3D-CNN backbone into a single, information-dense token. This compact representation effectively empowers the LLM to perform nuanced reasoning over subtle facial muscle this http URL extensive evaluations on the benchmark CASME II and SAMM datasets, including stringent Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) and cross-domain protocols, AU-LLM establishes a new state-of-the-art, validating the significant potential and robustness of LLM-based reasoning for micro-expression analysis.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Studying the robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) to unsafe behaviors is an important topic of research today. Building safety classification models or guard models, which are fine-tuned models for input/output safety classification for LLMs, is seen as one of the solutions to address the issue. Although there is a lot of research on the safety testing of LLMs themselves, there is little research on evaluating the effectiveness of such safety classifiers or the evaluation datasets used for testing them, especially in multilingual scenarios. In this position paper, we demonstrate how multilingual disparities exist in 5 safety classification models by considering datasets covering 18 languages. At the same time, we identify potential issues with the evaluation datasets, arguing that the shortcomings of current safety classifiers are not only because of the models themselves. We expect that these findings will contribute to the discussion on developing better methods to identify harmful content in LLM inputs across languages.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vision-language pre-trained models (VLMs) such as CLIP have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot generalization, and prompt learning has emerged as an efficient alternative to full fine-tuning. However, existing methods often struggle with generalization to novel classes, a phenomenon attributed to overfitting on seen classes and forgetting general knowledge. Furthermore, recent approaches that improve generalization often introduce complex architectures or heavy computational overhead. In this paper, we propose a Multiple Semantic-Guided Context Optimization (MSGCoOp) framework to enhance few-shot generalization while maintaining computational efficiency. Our approach leverages an ensemble of parallel learnable context vectors to capture diverse semantic aspects. To enrich these prompts, we introduce a semantic guidance mechanism that aligns them with comprehensive class descriptions automatically generated by a Large Language Model (LLM). Furthermore, a diversity regularization loss encourages the prompts to learn complementary and orthogonal features, preventing them from collapsing into redundant representations. Extensive experiments on 11 benchmark datasets show that MSGCoOp significantly improves performance on base-to-novel generalization, achieving an average harmonic mean improvement of 1.10\% over the strong KgCoOp baseline. Our method also demonstrates enhanced robustness in cross-domain generalization tasks. Our code is avaliable at: \href{this https URL}{this https URL}.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Medical image-language pre-training aims to align medical images with clinically relevant text to improve model performance on various downstream tasks. However, existing models often struggle with the variability and ambiguity inherent in medical data, limiting their ability to capture nuanced clinical information and uncertainty. This work introduces an uncertainty-aware medical image-text pre-training model that enhances generalization capabilities in medical image analysis. Building on previous methods and focusing on Chest X-Rays, our approach utilizes structured text reports generated by a large language model (LLM) to augment image data with clinically relevant context. These reports begin with a definition of the disease, followed by the `appearance' section to highlight critical regions of interest, and finally `observations' and `verdicts' that ground model predictions in clinical semantics. By modeling both inter- and intra-modal uncertainty, our framework captures the inherent ambiguity in medical images and text, yielding improved representations and performance on downstream tasks. Our model demonstrates significant advances in medical image-text pre-training, obtaining state-of-the-art performance on multiple downstream tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, interpretability, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The empirical success of deep learning has spurred its application to the radio-frequency (RF) domain, leading to significant advances in Deep Wireless Sensing (DWS). However, most existing DWS models function as black boxes with limited interpretability, which hampers their generalizability and raises concerns in security-sensitive physical applications. In this work, inspired by the remarkable advances of white-box transformers, we present RF-CRATE, the first mathematically interpretable deep network architecture for RF sensing, grounded in the principles of complex sparse rate reduction. To accommodate the unique RF signals, we conduct non-trivial theoretical derivations that extend the original real-valued white-box transformer to the complex domain. By leveraging the CR-Calculus framework, we successfully construct a fully complex-valued white-box transformer with theoretically derived self-attention and residual multi-layer perceptron modules. Furthermore, to improve the model's ability to extract discriminative features from limited wireless data, we introduce Subspace Regularization, a novel regularization strategy that enhances feature diversity, resulting in an average performance improvement of 19.98% across multiple sensing tasks. We extensively evaluate RF-CRATE against seven baselines with multiple public and self-collected datasets involving different RF signals. The results show that RF-CRATE achieves performance on par with thoroughly engineered black-box models, while offering full mathematical interpretability. More importantly, by extending CRATE to the complex domain, RF-CRATE yields substantial improvements, achieving an average classification gain of 5.08% and reducing regression error by 10.34% across diverse sensing tasks compared to CRATE.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Millions of individuals' well-being are challenged by the harms of substance use. Harm reduction as a public health strategy is designed to improve their health outcomes and reduce safety risks. Some large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated a decent level of medical knowledge, promising to address the information needs of people who use drugs (PWUD). However, their performance in relevant tasks remains largely unexplored. We introduce HRIPBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLM's accuracy and safety risks in harm reduction information provision. The benchmark dataset HRIP-Basic has 2,160 question-answer-evidence pairs. The scope covers three tasks: checking safety boundaries, providing quantitative values, and inferring polysubstance use risks. We build the Instruction and RAG schemes to evaluate model behaviours based on their inherent knowledge and the integration of domain knowledge. Our results indicate that state-of-the-art LLMs still struggle to provide accurate harm reduction information, and sometimes, carry out severe safety risks to PWUD. The use of LLMs in harm reduction contexts should be cautiously constrained to avoid inducing negative health outcomes.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>defense, attack, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Despite significant advancements in alignment and content moderation, large language models (LLMs) and text-to-image (T2I) systems remain vulnerable to prompt-based attacks known as jailbreaks. Unlike traditional adversarial examples requiring expert knowledge, many of today's jailbreaks are low-effort, high-impact crafted by everyday users with nothing more than cleverly worded prompts. This paper presents a systems-style investigation into how non-experts reliably circumvent safety mechanisms through techniques such as multi-turn narrative escalation, lexical camouflage, implication chaining, fictional impersonation, and subtle semantic edits. We propose a unified taxonomy of prompt-level jailbreak strategies spanning both text-output and T2I models, grounded in empirical case studies across popular APIs. Our analysis reveals that every stage of the moderation pipeline, from input filtering to output validation, can be bypassed with accessible strategies. We conclude by highlighting the urgent need for context-aware defenses that reflect the ease with which these jailbreaks can be reproduced in real-world settings.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While the task of assessing the plausibility of events such as ''news is relevant'' has been addressed by a growing body of work, less attention has been paid to capturing changes in plausibility as triggered by event modification. Understanding changes in plausibility is relevant for tasks such as dialogue generation, commonsense reasoning, and hallucination detection as it allows to correctly model, for example, ''gentle sarcasm'' as a sign of closeness rather than unkindness among friends [9]. In this work, we tackle the ADEPT challenge benchmark [6] consisting of 16K English sentence pairs differing by exactly one adjectival modifier. Our modeling experiments provide a conceptually novel method by using sentence transformers, and reveal that both they and transformer-based models struggle with the task at hand, and sentence transformers - despite their conceptual alignment with the task - even under-perform in comparison to models like RoBERTa. Furthermore, an in-depth comparison with prior work highlights the importance of a more realistic, balanced evaluation method: imbalances distort model performance and evaluation metrics, and weaken result trustworthiness.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs), when enhanced through reasoning-oriented post-training, evolve into powerful Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) further extends their capabilities by incorporating external tools, but existing methods often rely on rigid, predefined tool-use patterns that risk degrading core language competence. Inspired by the human ability to adaptively select tools, we introduce AutoTIR, a reinforcement learning framework that enables LLMs to autonomously decide whether and which tool to invoke during the reasoning process, rather than following static tool-use strategies. AutoTIR leverages a hybrid reward mechanism that jointly optimizes for task-specific answer correctness, structured output adherence, and penalization of incorrect tool usage, thereby encouraging both precise reasoning and efficient tool integration. Extensive evaluations across diverse knowledge-intensive, mathematical, and general language modeling tasks demonstrate that AutoTIR achieves superior overall performance, significantly outperforming baselines and exhibits superior generalization in tool-use behavior. These results highlight the promise of reinforcement learning in building truly generalizable and scalable TIR capabilities in LLMs. The code and data are available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The data-driven discovery of interpretable models approximating the underlying dynamics of a physical system has gained attraction in the past decade. Current approaches employ pre-specified functional forms or basis functions and often result in models that lack physical meaning and interpretability, let alone represent the true physics of the system. We propose an unsupervised parameter estimation methodology that first finds an approximate general solution, followed by a spline transformation to linearly estimate the coefficients of the governing ordinary differential equation (ODE). The approximate general solution is postulated using the same functional form as the analytical solution of a general homogeneous, linear, constant-coefficient ODE. An added advantage is its ability to produce a high-fidelity, smooth functional form even in the presence of noisy data. The spline approximation obtains gradient information from the functional form which are linearly independent and creates the basis of the gradient matrix. This gradient matrix is used in a linear system to find the coefficients of the ODEs. From the case studies, we observed that our modeling approach discovers ODEs with high accuracy and also promotes sparsity in the solution without using any regularization techniques. The methodology is also robust to noisy data and thus allows the integration of data-driven techniques into real experimental setting for data-driven learning of physical phenomena.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Video editing is a critical component of content creation that transforms raw footage into coherent works aligned with specific visual and narrative objectives. Existing approaches face two major challenges: temporal inconsistencies due to failure in capturing complex motion patterns, and overfitting to simple prompts arising from limitations in UNet backbone architectures. While learning-based methods can enhance editing quality, they typically demand substantial computational resources and are constrained by the scarcity of high-quality annotated data. In this paper, we present Vid-TTA, a lightweight test-time adaptation framework that personalizes optimization for each test video during inference through self-supervised auxiliary tasks. Our approach incorporates a motion-aware frame reconstruction mechanism that identifies and preserves crucial movement regions, alongside a prompt perturbation and reconstruction strategy that strengthens model robustness to diverse textual descriptions. These innovations are orchestrated by a meta-learning driven dynamic loss balancing mechanism that adaptively adjusts the optimization process based on video characteristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Vid-TTA significantly improves video temporal consistency and mitigates prompt overfitting while maintaining low computational overhead, offering a plug-and-play performance boost for existing video editing models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce Aether Weaver, a novel, integrated framework for multimodal narrative co-generation that overcomes limitations of sequential text-to-visual pipelines. Our system concurrently synthesizes textual narratives, dynamic scene graph representations, visual scenes, and affective soundscapes, driven by a tightly integrated, co-generation mechanism. At its core, the Narrator, a large language model, generates narrative text and multimodal prompts, while the Director acts as a dynamic scene graph manager, and analyzes the text to build and maintain a structured representation of the story's world, ensuring spatio-temporal and relational consistency for visual rendering and subsequent narrative generation. Additionally, a Narrative Arc Controller guides the high-level story structure, influencing multimodal affective consistency, further complemented by an Affective Tone Mapper that ensures congruent emotional expression across all modalities. Through qualitative evaluations on a diverse set of narrative prompts encompassing various genres, we demonstrate that Aether Weaver significantly enhances narrative depth, visual fidelity, and emotional resonance compared to cascaded baseline approaches. This integrated framework provides a robust platform for rapid creative prototyping and immersive storytelling experiences.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a main cause of mortality globally, accounting for 31% of all deaths. This study involves a cardiovascular disease (CVD) dataset comprising 68,119 records to explore the influence of numerical (age, height, weight, blood pressure, BMI) and categorical gender, cholesterol, glucose, smoking, alcohol, activity) factors on CVD occurrence. We have performed statistical analyses, including t-tests, Chi-square tests, and ANOVA, to identify strong associations between CVD and elderly people, hypertension, higher weight, and abnormal cholesterol levels, while physical activity (a protective factor). A logistic regression model highlights age, blood pressure, and cholesterol as primary risk factors, with unexpected negative associations for smoking and alcohol, suggesting potential data issues. Model performance comparisons reveal CatBoost as the top performer with an accuracy of 0.734 and an ECE of 0.0064 and excels in probabilistic prediction (Brier score = 0.1824). Data challenges, including outliers and skewed distributions, indicate a need for improved preprocessing to enhance predictive reliability.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, privacy, protect, attack, interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>System and network event logs are essential for security analytics, threat detection, and operational monitoring. However, these logs often contain Personally Identifiable Information (PII), raising significant privacy concerns when shared or analyzed. A key challenge in log anonymization is balancing privacy protection with the retention of sufficient structure for meaningful analysis. Overly aggressive anonymization can destroy contextual integrity, while weak techniques risk re-identification through linkage or inference attacks. This paper introduces novel field-specific anonymization methods that address this trade-off. For IP addresses, we propose a salt-based hashing technique applied at the per-octet level, preserving both subnet and host structure to enable correlation across various log entries while ensuring non-reversibility. For port numbers, full-value hashing with range mapping maintains interpretability. We also present an order-preserving timestamp anonymization scheme using adaptive noise injection, which obfuscates exact times without disrupting event sequences. An open-source tool implementing these techniques has been released to support practical deployment and reproducible research. Evaluations using entropy metrics, collision rates, and residual leakage analysis demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively protects privacy while preserving analytical utility.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Analyzing digitized artworks presents unique challenges, requiring not only visual interpretation but also a deep understanding of rich artistic, contextual, and historical knowledge. We introduce ArtSeek, a multimodal framework for art analysis that combines multimodal large language models with retrieval-augmented generation. Unlike prior work, our pipeline relies only on image input, enabling applicability to artworks without links to Wikidata or Wikipedia-common in most digitized collections. ArtSeek integrates three key components: an intelligent multimodal retrieval module based on late interaction retrieval, a contrastive multitask classification network for predicting artist, genre, style, media, and tags, and an agentic reasoning strategy enabled through in-context examples for complex visual question answering and artwork explanation via Qwen2.5-VL. Central to this approach is WikiFragments, a Wikipedia-scale dataset of image-text fragments curated to support knowledge-grounded multimodal reasoning. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, including a +8.4% F1 improvement in style classification over GraphCLIP and a +7.1 BLEU@1 gain in captioning on ArtPedia. Qualitative analyses show that ArtSeek can interpret visual motifs, infer historical context, and retrieve relevant knowledge, even for obscure works. Though focused on visual arts, our approach generalizes to other domains requiring external knowledge, supporting scalable multimodal AI research. Both the dataset and the source code will be made publicly available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In recent years, artificial intelligence has been increasingly applied in the field of medical imaging. Among these applications, fundus image analysis presents special challenges, including small lesion areas in certain fundus diseases and subtle inter-disease differences, which can lead to reduced prediction accuracy and overfitting in the models. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Transformer-based model SwinECAT, which combines the Shifted Window (Swin) Attention with the Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) Attention. SwinECAT leverages the Swin Attention mechanism in the Swin Transformer backbone to effectively capture local spatial structures and long-range dependencies within fundus images. The lightweight ECA mechanism is incorporated to guide the SwinECAT's attention toward critical feature channels, enabling more discriminative feature representation. In contrast to previous studies that typically classify fundus images into 4 to 6 categories, this work expands fundus disease classification to 9 distinct types, thereby enhancing the granularity of diagnosis. We evaluate our method on the Eye Disease Image Dataset (EDID) containing 16,140 fundus images for 9-category classification. Experimental results demonstrate that SwinECAT achieves 88.29\% accuracy, with weighted F1-score of 0.88 and macro F1-score of 0.90. The classification results of our proposed model SwinECAT significantly outperform the baseline Swin Transformer and multiple compared baseline models. To our knowledge, this represents the highest reported performance for 9-category classification on this public dataset.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs), enhanced through agent tuning, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and tool utilization, significantly surpassing the performance of standalone models. However, the multimodal domain still lacks a large-scale, high-quality agent tuning dataset to unlock the full potential of multimodal large language models. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMAT-1M, the first million-scale multimodal agent tuning dataset designed to support CoT, reflection, and dynamic tool usage. Our dataset is constructed through a novel four-stage data engine: 1) We first curate publicly available multimodal datasets containing question-answer pairs; 2) Then, leveraging GPT-4o, we generate rationales for the original question-answer pairs and dynamically integrate API calls and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) information through a multi-turn paradigm; 3) Furthermore, we refine the rationales through reflection to ensure logical consistency and accuracy, creating a multi-turn dialogue dataset with both Rationale and Reflection (RR); 4) Finally, to enhance efficiency, we optionally compress multi-turn dialogues into a One-turn Rationale and Reflection (ORR) format. By fine-tuning open-source multimodal models on the MMAT-1M, we observe significant performance gains. For instance, the InternVL2.5-8B-RR model achieves an average improvement of 2.7% across eight public benchmarks and 8.8% on the RAG benchmark Dyn-VQA, demonstrating the dataset's effectiveness in enhancing multimodal reasoning and tool-based capabilities.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce plausible but poorly-calibrated answers, limiting their reliability on reasoning-intensive tasks. We present Reinforcement Learning from Self-Feedback (RLSF), a post-training stage that uses the model's own confidence as an intrinsic reward, mimicking how humans learn in the absence of external feedback. After a frozen LLM generates several chain-of-thought solutions, we define and compute the confidence of each final answer span and rank the traces accordingly. These synthetic preferences are then used to fine-tune the policy with standard preference optimization, similar to RLHF yet requiring no human labels, gold answers, or externally curated rewards. RLSF simultaneously (i) refines the model's probability estimates -- restoring well-behaved calibration -- and (ii) strengthens step-by-step reasoning, yielding improved performance on arithmetic reasoning and multiple-choice question answering. By turning a model's own uncertainty into useful self-feedback, RLSF affirms reinforcement learning on intrinsic model behaviour as a principled and data-efficient component of the LLM post-training pipeline and warrents further research in intrinsic rewards for LLM post-training.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In cross-cultural recipe adaptation, the goal is not only to ensure cultural appropriateness and retain the original dish's essence, but also to provide diverse options for various dietary needs and preferences. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a promising approach, combining the retrieval of real recipes from the target cuisine for cultural adaptability with large language models (LLMs) for relevance. However, it remains unclear whether RAG can generate diverse adaptation results. Our analysis shows that RAG tends to overly rely on a limited portion of the context across generations, failing to produce diverse outputs even when provided with varied contextual inputs. This reveals a key limitation of RAG in creative tasks with multiple valid answers: it fails to leverage contextual diversity for generating varied responses. To address this issue, we propose CARRIAGE, a plug-and-play RAG framework for cross-cultural recipe adaptation that enhances diversity in both retrieval and context organization. To our knowledge, this is the first RAG framework that explicitly aims to generate highly diverse outputs to accommodate multiple user preferences. Our experiments show that CARRIAGE achieves Pareto efficiency in terms of diversity and quality of recipe adaptation compared to closed-book LLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, robust, diffusion, data-free, transformer, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Post-training quantization (PTQ) improves efficiency but struggles with limited calibration data, especially under privacy constraints. Data-free quantization (DFQ) mitigates this by generating synthetic images using generative models such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and text-conditioned latent diffusion models (LDMs), while applying existing PTQ algorithms. However, the relationship between generated synthetic images and the generalizability of the quantized model during PTQ remains underexplored. Without investigating this relationship, synthetic images generated by previous prompt engineering methods based on single-class prompts suffer from issues such as polysemy, leading to performance degradation. We propose \textbf{mixup-class prompt}, a mixup-based text prompting strategy that fuses multiple class labels at the text prompt level to generate diverse, robust synthetic data. This approach enhances generalization, and improves optimization stability in PTQ. We provide quantitative insights through gradient norm and generalization error analysis. Experiments on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art DFQ methods like GenQ. Furthermore, it pushes the performance boundary in extremely low-bit scenarios, achieving new state-of-the-art accuracy in challenging 2-bit weight, 4-bit activation (W2A4) quantization.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Existing shadow removal methods often rely on shadow masks, which are challenging to acquire in real-world scenarios. Exploring intrinsic image cues, such as local contrast information, presents a potential alternative for guiding shadow removal in the absence of explicit masks. However, the cue's inherent ambiguity becomes a critical limitation in complex scenes, where it can fail to distinguish true shadows from low-reflectance objects and intricate background textures. To address this motivation, we propose the Adaptive Gated Dual-Branch Attention (AGBA) mechanism. AGBA dynamically filters and re-weighs the contrast prior to effectively disentangle shadow features from confounding visual elements. Furthermore, to tackle the persistent challenge of restoring soft shadow boundaries and fine-grained details, we introduce a diffusion-based Frequency-Contrast Fusion Network (FCFN) that leverages high-frequency and contrast cues to guide the generative process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results among mask-free approaches while maintaining competitive performance relative to mask-based methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Scarcity of pixel-level labels is a significant challenge in practical scenarios. In specific domains like industrial smoke, acquiring such detailed annotations is particularly difficult and often requires expert knowledge. To alleviate this, weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) has emerged as a promising approach. However, due to the supervision gap and inherent bias in models trained with only image level labels, existing WSSS methods suffer from limitations such as incomplete foreground coverage, inaccurate object boundaries, and spurious correlations, especially in our domain, where emissions are always spatially coupled with chimneys. Previous solutions typically rely on additional priors or external knowledge to mitigate these issues, but they often lack scalability and fail to address the model's inherent bias toward co-occurring context. To address this, we propose a novel WSSS framework that directly targets the co-occurrence problem without relying on external supervision. Unlike prior methods that adopt a single network, we employ a teacher-student framework that combines CNNs and ViTs. We introduce a knowledge transfer loss that enforces cross-architecture consistency by aligning internal representations. Additionally, we incorporate post-processing techniques to address partial coverage and further improve pseudo mask quality.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Cloud computing offers on-demand resource access, regulated by Service-Level Agreements (SLAs) between consumers and Cloud Service Providers (CSPs). SLA violations can impact efficiency and CSP profitability. In this work, we propose an SLA-aware automated algorithm-selection framework for combinatorial optimization problems in resource-constrained cloud environments. The framework uses an ensemble of machine learning models to predict performance and rank algorithm-hardware pairs based on SLA constraints. We also apply our framework to the 0-1 knapsack problem. We curate a dataset comprising instance specific features along with memory usage, runtime, and optimality gap for 6 algorithms. As an empirical benchmark, we evaluate the framework on both classification and regression tasks. Our ablation study explores the impact of hyperparameters, learning approaches, and large language models effectiveness in regression, and SHAP-based interpretability.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Event-based semantic segmentation explores the potential of event cameras, which offer high dynamic range and fine temporal resolution, to achieve robust scene understanding in challenging environments. Despite these advantages, the task remains difficult due to two main challenges: extracting reliable features from sparse and noisy event streams, and effectively fusing them with dense, semantically rich image data that differ in structure and representation. To address these issues, we propose EIFNet, a multi-modal fusion network that combines the strengths of both event and frame-based inputs. The network includes an Adaptive Event Feature Refinement Module (AEFRM), which improves event representations through multi-scale activity modeling and spatial attention. In addition, we introduce a Modality-Adaptive Recalibration Module (MARM) and a Multi-Head Attention Gated Fusion Module (MGFM), which align and integrate features across modalities using attention mechanisms and gated fusion strategies. Experiments on DDD17-Semantic and DSEC-Semantic datasets show that EIFNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating its effectiveness in event-based semantic segmentation.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Traditional machine learning models struggle to generalize in microbiome studies where only metadata is available, especially in small-sample settings or across studies with heterogeneous label formats. In this work, we explore the use of large language models (LLMs) to classify microbial samples into ontology categories such as EMPO 3 and related biological labels, as well as to predict pathogen contamination risk, specifically the presence of E. Coli, using environmental metadata alone. We evaluate LLMs such as ChatGPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Grok-3, and LLaMA 4 in zero-shot and few-shot settings, comparing their performance against traditional models like Random Forests across multiple real-world datasets. Our results show that LLMs not only outperform baselines in ontology classification, but also demonstrate strong predictive ability for contamination risk, generalizing across sites and metadata distributions. These findings suggest that LLMs can effectively reason over sparse, heterogeneous biological metadata and offer a promising metadata-only approach for environmental microbiology and biosurveillance applications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative artificial intelligence (AI), in particular large language models (LLMs), is poised to drive transformative economic change. LLMs are pre-trained on vast text data to learn general language patterns, but a subsequent post-training phase is critical to align them for specific real-world tasks. Reinforcement learning (RL) is the leading post-training technique, yet its economic impact remains largely underexplored and unquantified. We examine this question through the lens of the first deployment of an RL-trained LLM for generative advertising on Facebook. Integrated into Meta's Text Generation feature, our model, "AdLlama," powers an AI tool that helps advertisers create new variations of human-written ad text. To train this model, we introduce reinforcement learning with performance feedback (RLPF), a post-training method that uses historical ad performance data as a reward signal. In a large-scale 10-week A/B test on Facebook spanning nearly 35,000 advertisers and 640,000 ad variations, we find that AdLlama improves click-through rates by 6.7% (p=0.0296) compared to a supervised imitation model trained on curated ads. This represents a substantial improvement in advertiser return on investment on Facebook. We also find that advertisers who used AdLlama generated more ad variations, indicating higher satisfaction with the model's outputs. To our knowledge, this is the largest study to date on the use of generative AI in an ecologically valid setting, offering an important data point quantifying the tangible impact of RL post-training. Furthermore, the results show that RLPF is a promising and generalizable approach for metric-driven post-training that bridges the gap between highly capable language models and tangible outcomes.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, privacy, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Machine unlearning (MU) removes specific data points or concepts from deep learning models to enhance privacy and prevent sensitive content generation. Adversarial prompts can exploit unlearned models to generate content containing removed concepts, posing a significant security risk. However, existing adversarial attack methods still face challenges in generating content that aligns with an attacker's intent while incurring high computational costs to identify successful prompts. To address these challenges, we propose ZIUM, a Zero-shot Intent-aware adversarial attack on Unlearned Models, which enables the flexible customization of target attack images to reflect an attacker's intent. Additionally, ZIUM supports zero-shot adversarial attacks without requiring further optimization for previously attacked unlearned concepts. The evaluation across various MU scenarios demonstrated ZIUM's effectiveness in successfully customizing content based on user-intent prompts while achieving a superior attack success rate compared to existing methods. Moreover, its zero-shot adversarial attack significantly reduces the attack time for previously attacked unlearned concepts.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We investigate whether knowledge distillation (KD) from multiple heterogeneous teacher models can enhance the generation of transferable adversarial examples. A lightweight student model is trained using two KD strategies: curriculum-based switching and joint optimization, with ResNet50 and DenseNet-161 as teachers. The trained student is then used to generate adversarial examples using FG, FGS, and PGD attacks, which are evaluated against a black-box target model (GoogLeNet). Our results show that student models distilled from multiple teachers achieve attack success rates comparable to ensemble-based baselines, while reducing adversarial example generation time by up to a factor of six. An ablation study further reveals that lower temperature settings and the inclusion of hard-label supervision significantly enhance transferability. These findings suggest that KD can serve not only as a model compression technique but also as a powerful tool for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of black-box adversarial attacks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce new methods of staining and locking computer vision models, to protect their owners' intellectual property. Staining, also known as watermarking, embeds secret behaviour into a model which can later be used to identify it, while locking aims to make a model unusable unless a secret trigger is inserted into input images. Unlike existing methods, our algorithms can be used to stain and lock pre-trained models without requiring fine-tuning or retraining, and come with provable, computable guarantees bounding their worst-case false positive rates. The stain and lock are implemented by directly modifying a small number of the model's weights and have minimal impact on the (unlocked) model's performance. Locked models are unlocked by inserting a small `trigger patch' into the corner of the input image. We present experimental results showing the efficacy of our methods and demonstrating their practical performance on a variety of computer vision models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>protect, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Industrial smoke segmentation is critical for air-quality monitoring and environmental protection but is often hampered by the high cost and scarcity of pixel-level annotations in real-world settings. We introduce CEDANet, a human-in-the-loop, class-aware domain adaptation framework that uniquely integrates weak, citizen-provided video-level labels with adversarial feature alignment. Specifically, we refine pseudo-labels generated by a source-trained segmentation model using citizen votes, and employ class-specific domain discriminators to transfer rich source-domain representations to the industrial domain. Comprehensive experiments on SMOKE5K and custom IJmond datasets demonstrate that CEDANet achieves an F1-score of 0.414 and a smoke-class IoU of 0.261 with citizen feedback, vastly outperforming the baseline model, which scored 0.083 and 0.043 respectively. This represents a five-fold increase in F1-score and a six-fold increase in smoke-class IoU. Notably, CEDANet with citizen-constrained pseudo-labels achieves performance comparable to the same architecture trained on limited 100 fully annotated images with F1-score of 0.418 and IoU of 0.264, demonstrating its ability to reach small-sampled fully supervised-level accuracy without target-domain annotations. Our research validates the scalability and cost-efficiency of combining citizen science with weakly supervised domain adaptation, offering a practical solution for complex, data-scarce environmental monitoring applications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose a novel segmentation-based explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) method for neural networks working on point cloud classification. As one building block of this method, we propose a novel point-shifting mechanism to introduce perturbations in point cloud data. Recently, AI has seen an exponential growth. Hence, it is important to understand the decision-making process of AI algorithms when they are applied in critical areas. Our work focuses on explaining AI algorithms that classify point cloud data. An important aspect of the methods used for explaining AI algorithms is their ability to produce explanations that are easy for humans to understand. This allows them to analyze the AI algorithms better and make appropriate decisions based on that analysis. Therefore, in this work, we intend to generate meaningful explanations that can be easily interpreted by humans. The point cloud data we consider represents 3D objects such as cars, guitars, and laptops. We make use of point cloud segmentation models to generate explanations for the working of classification models. The segments are used to introduce perturbations into the input point cloud data and generate saliency maps. The perturbations are introduced using the novel point-shifting mechanism proposed in this work which ensures that the shifted points no longer influence the output of the classification algorithm. In contrast to previous methods, the segments used by our method are meaningful, i.e. humans can easily interpret the meaning of the segments. Thus, the benefit of our method over other methods is its ability to produce more meaningful saliency maps. We compare our method with the use of classical clustering algorithms to generate explanations. We also analyze the saliency maps generated for example inputs using our method to demonstrate the usefulness of the method in generating meaningful explanations.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, security, defense, attack, robust, generative, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid advancement of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has led to breakthroughs in various applications, yet their security remains a critical challenge. One pressing issue involves unsafe image-query pairs--jailbreak inputs specifically designed to bypass security constraints and elicit unintended responses from MLLMs. Compared to general multimodal data, such unsafe inputs are relatively sparse, which limits the diversity and richness of training samples available for developing robust defense models. Meanwhile, existing guardrail-type methods rely on external modules to enforce security constraints but fail to address intrinsic vulnerabilities within MLLMs. Traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT), on the other hand, often over-refuses harmless inputs, compromising general performance. Given these challenges, we propose Secure Tug-of-War (SecTOW), an innovative iterative defense-attack training method to enhance the security of MLLMs. SecTOW consists of two modules: a defender and an auxiliary attacker, both trained iteratively using reinforcement learning (GRPO). During the iterative process, the attacker identifies security vulnerabilities in the defense model and expands jailbreak data. The expanded data are then used to train the defender, enabling it to address identified security vulnerabilities. We also design reward mechanisms used for GRPO to simplify the use of response labels, reducing dependence on complex generative labels and enabling the efficient use of synthetic data. Additionally, a quality monitoring mechanism is used to mitigate the defender's over-refusal of harmless inputs and ensure the diversity of the jailbreak data generated by the attacker. Experimental results on safety-specific and general benchmarks demonstrate that SecTOW significantly improves security while preserving general performance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper investigates the application of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to classical inventory management problems, with a focus on practical implementation considerations. We apply a DRL algorithm based on DirectBackprop to several fundamental inventory management scenarios including multi-period systems with lost sales (with and without lead times), perishable inventory management, dual sourcing, and joint inventory procurement and removal. The DRL approach learns policies across products using only historical information that would be available in practice, avoiding unrealistic assumptions about demand distributions or access to distribution parameters. We demonstrate that our generic DRL implementation performs competitively against or outperforms established benchmarks and heuristics across these diverse settings, while requiring minimal parameter tuning. Through examination of the learned policies, we show that the DRL approach naturally captures many known structural properties of optimal policies derived from traditional operations research methods. To further improve policy performance and interpretability, we propose a Structure-Informed Policy Network technique that explicitly incorporates analytically-derived characteristics of optimal policies into the learning process. This approach can help interpretability and add robustness to the policy in out-of-sample performance, as we demonstrate in an example with realistic demand data. Finally, we provide an illustrative application of DRL in a non-stationary setting. Our work bridges the gap between data-driven learning and analytical insights in inventory management while maintaining practical applicability.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep learning has witnessed the extensive utilization across a wide spectrum of domains, including fine-grained few-shot learning (FGFSL) which heavily depends on deep backbones. Nonetheless, shallower deep backbones such as ConvNet-4, are not commonly preferred because they're prone to extract a larger quantity of non-abstract visual attributes. In this paper, we initially re-evaluate the relationship between network depth and the ability to fully encode few-shot instances, and delve into whether shallow deep architecture could effectuate comparable or superior performance to mainstream deep backbone. Fueled by the inspiration from vanilla ConvNet-4, we introduce a location-aware constellation network (LCN-4), equipped with a cutting-edge location-aware feature clustering module. This module can proficiently encoder and integrate spatial feature fusion, feature clustering, and recessive feature location, thereby significantly minimizing the overall loss. Specifically, we innovatively put forward a general grid position encoding compensation to effectively address the issue of positional information missing during the feature extraction process of specific ordinary convolutions. Additionally, we further propose a general frequency domain location embedding technique to offset for the location loss in clustering features. We have carried out validation procedures on three representative fine-grained few-shot benchmarks. Relevant experiments have established that LCN-4 notably outperforms the ConvNet-4 based State-of-the-Arts and achieves performance that is on par with or superior to most ResNet12-based methods, confirming the correctness of our conjecture.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many reasoning tasks but struggle with knowledge-intensive queries due to their inability to dynamically access up-to-date or domain-specific information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution, enabling LLMs to ground their responses in external sources. However, existing RAG methods lack fine-grained control over both the query and source sides, often resulting in noisy retrieval and shallow reasoning. In this work, we introduce DeepSieve, an agentic RAG framework that incorporates information sieving via LLM-as-a-knowledge-router. DeepSieve decomposes complex queries into structured sub-questions and recursively routes each to the most suitable knowledge source, filtering irrelevant information through a multi-stage distillation process. Our design emphasizes modularity, transparency, and adaptability, leveraging recent advances in agentic system design. Experiments on multi-hop QA tasks across heterogeneous sources demonstrate improved reasoning depth, retrieval precision, and interpretability over conventional RAG approaches.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Accurate demand forecasting is critical for supply chain optimization, yet remains difficult in practice due to hierarchical complexity, domain shifts, and evolving external factors. While recent foundation models offer strong potential for time series forecasting, they often suffer from architectural rigidity and limited robustness under distributional change. In this paper, we propose a unified ensemble framework that enhances the performance of foundation models for sales forecasting in real-world supply chains. Our method combines two complementary strategies: (1) Hierarchical Ensemble (HE), which partitions training and inference by semantic levels (e.g., store, category, department) to capture localized patterns; and (2) Architectural Ensemble (AE), which integrates predictions from diverse model backbones to mitigate bias and improve stability. We conduct extensive experiments on the M5 benchmark and three external sales datasets, covering both in-domain and zero-shot forecasting. Results show that our approach consistently outperforms strong baselines, improves accuracy across hierarchical levels, and provides a simple yet effective mechanism for boosting generalization in complex forecasting environments.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Difficult few-shot image recognition has significant application prospects, yet remaining the substantial technical gaps with the conventional large-scale image recognition. In this paper, we have proposed an efficient original method for few-shot image recognition, called CIELab-Guided Coherent Meta-Learning (MetaLab). Structurally, our MetaLab comprises two collaborative neural networks: LabNet, which can perform domain transformation for the CIELab color space and extract rich grouped features, and coherent LabGNN, which can facilitate mutual learning between lightness graph and color graph. For sufficient certification, we have implemented extensive comparative studies on four coarse-grained benchmarks, four fine-grained benchmarks, and four cross-domain few-shot benchmarks. Specifically, our method can achieve high accuracy, robust performance, and effective generalization capability with one-shot sample per class. Overall, all experiments have demonstrated that our MetaLab can approach 99\% $\uparrow\downarrow$ accuracy, reaching the human recognition ceiling with little visual deviation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Numerous efforts have been made to extend the ``next token prediction'' paradigm to visual contents, aiming to create a unified approach for both image generation and understanding. Nevertheless, attempts to generate images through autoregressive modeling with discrete tokens have been plagued by issues such as low visual fidelity, distorted outputs, and failure to adhere to complex instructions when rendering intricate details. These shortcomings are likely attributed to cumulative errors during autoregressive inference or information loss incurred during the discretization process. Probably due to this challenge, recent research has increasingly shifted toward jointly training image generation with diffusion objectives and language generation with autoregressive objectives, moving away from unified modeling approaches. In this work, we demonstrate that reinforcement learning can effectively mitigate artifacts and largely enhance the generation quality of a discrete autoregressive modeling method, thereby enabling seamless integration of image and language generation. Our framework comprises a semantic image tokenizer, a unified autoregressive model for both language and images, and an offline diffusion decoder for image generation, termed X-Omni.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This work addresses motion-guided few-shot video object segmentation (FSVOS), which aims to segment dynamic objects in videos based on a few annotated examples with the same motion patterns. Existing FSVOS datasets and methods typically focus on object categories, which are static attributes that ignore the rich temporal dynamics in videos, limiting their application in scenarios requiring motion understanding. To fill this gap, we introduce MOVE, a large-scale dataset specifically designed for motion-guided FSVOS. Based on MOVE, we comprehensively evaluate 6 state-of-the-art methods from 3 different related tasks across 2 experimental settings. Our results reveal that current methods struggle to address motion-guided FSVOS, prompting us to analyze the associated challenges and propose a baseline method, Decoupled Motion Appearance Network (DMA). Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance in few shot motion understanding, establishing a solid foundation for future research in this direction.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) is a popular foundation model, supporting from zero-shot classification, retrieval to encoders for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Although CLIP is successfully trained on billion-scale image-text pairs from the English world, scaling CLIP's training further to learning from the worldwide web data is still challenging: (1) no curation method is available to handle data points from non-English world; (2) the English performance from existing multilingual CLIP is worse than its English-only counterpart, i.e., "curse of multilinguality" that is common in LLMs. Here, we present MetaCLIP 2, the first recipe training CLIP from scratch on worldwide web-scale image-text pairs. To generalize our findings, we conduct rigorous ablations with minimal changes that are necessary to address the above challenges and present a recipe enabling mutual benefits from English and non-English world data. In zero-shot ImageNet classification, MetaCLIP 2 ViT-H/14 surpasses its English-only counterpart by 0.8% and mSigLIP by 0.7%, and surprisingly sets new state-of-the-art without system-level confounding factors (e.g., translation, bespoke architecture changes) on multilingual benchmarks, such as CVQA with 57.4%, Babel-ImageNet with 50.2% and XM3600 with 64.3% on image-to-text retrieval.</li>
