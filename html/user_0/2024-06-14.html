<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper presents a novel anomaly detection methodology termed Statistical Aggregated Anomaly Detection (SAAD). The SAAD approach integrates advanced statistical techniques with machine learning, and its efficacy is demonstrated through validation on real sensor data from a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) environment within the automotive domain. The key innovation of SAAD lies in its ability to significantly enhance the accuracy and robustness of anomaly detection when combined with Fully Connected Networks (FCNs) augmented by dropout layers. Comprehensive experimental evaluations indicate that the standalone statistical method achieves an accuracy of 72.1%, whereas the deep learning model alone attains an accuracy of 71.5%. In contrast, the aggregated method achieves a superior accuracy of 88.3% and an F1 score of 0.921, thereby outperforming the individual models. These results underscore the effectiveness of SAAD, demonstrating its potential for broad application in various domains, including automotive systems.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper describes the creation, optimization, and assessment of a question-answering (QA) model for a personalized learning assistant that uses BERT transformers customized for the Arabic language. The model was particularly finetuned on science textbooks in Palestinian curriculum. Our approach uses BERT's brilliant capabilities to automatically produce correct answers to questions in the field of science education. The model's ability to understand and extract pertinent information is improved by finetuning it using 11th and 12th grade biology book in Palestinian curriculum. This increases the model's efficacy in producing enlightening responses. Exact match (EM) and F1 score metrics are used to assess the model's performance; the results show an EM score of 20% and an F1 score of 51%. These findings show that the model can comprehend and react to questions in the context of Palestinian science book. The results demonstrate the potential of BERT-based QA models to support learning and understanding Arabic students questions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Question generation for education assessments is a growing field within artificial intelligence applied to education. These question-generation tools have significant importance in the educational technology domain, such as intelligent tutoring systems and dialogue-based platforms. The automatic generation of assessment questions, which entail clear-cut answers, usually relies on syntactical and semantic indications within declarative sentences, which are then transformed into questions. Recent research has explored the generation of assessment educational questions in Arabic. The reported performance has been adversely affected by inherent errors, including sentence parsing inaccuracies, name entity recognition issues, and errors stemming from rule-based question transformation. Furthermore, the complexity of lengthy Arabic sentences has contributed to these challenges. This research presents an innovative Arabic question-generation system built upon a three-stage process: keywords and key phrases extraction, question generation, and subsequent ranking. The aim is to tackle the difficulties associated with automatically generating assessment questions in the Arabic language. The proposed approach and results show a precision of 83.50%, a recall of 78.68%, and an Fl score of 80.95%, indicating the framework high efficiency. Human evaluation further confirmed the model efficiency, receiving an average rating of 84%.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, extraction, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated multi-view clustering offers the potential to develop a global clustering model using data distributed across multiple devices. However, current methods face challenges due to the absence of label information and the paramount importance of data privacy. A significant issue is the feature heterogeneity across multi-view data, which complicates the effective mining of complementary clustering information. Additionally, the inherent incompleteness of multi-view data in a distributed setting can further complicate the clustering process. To address these challenges, we introduce a federated incomplete multi-view clustering framework with heterogeneous graph neural networks (FIM-GNNs). In the proposed FIM-GNNs, autoencoders built on heterogeneous graph neural network models are employed for feature extraction of multi-view data at each client site. At the server level, heterogeneous features from overlapping samples of each client are aggregated into a global feature representation. Global pseudo-labels are generated at the server to enhance the handling of incomplete view data, where these labels serve as a guide for integrating and refining the clustering process across different data views. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted on public benchmark datasets to verify the performance of the proposed FIM-GNNs in comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm that enables clients to collaboratively train a shared global model without uploading their local data. To alleviate the heterogeneous data quality among clients, artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) can be leveraged as a novel data synthesis technique for FL model performance enhancement. Due to various costs incurred by AIGC-empowered FL (e.g., costs of local model computation and data synthesis), however, clients are usually reluctant to participate in FL without adequate economic incentives, which leads to an unexplored critical issue for enabling AIGC-empowered FL. To fill this gap, we first devise a data quality assessment method for data samples generated by AIGC and rigorously analyze the convergence performance of FL model trained using a blend of authentic and AI-generated data samples. We then propose a data quality-aware incentive mechanism to encourage clients' participation. In light of information asymmetry incurred by clients' private multi-dimensional attributes, we investigate clients' behavior patterns and derive the server's optimal incentive strategies to minimize server's cost in terms of both model accuracy loss and incentive payments for both complete and incomplete information scenarios. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed mechanism exhibits highest training accuracy and reduces up to 53.34% of the server's cost with real-world datasets, compared with existing benchmark mechanisms.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Learning effective representations from raw data is crucial for the success of deep learning methods. However, in the tabular domain, practitioners often prefer augmenting raw column features over using learned representations, as conventional tree-based algorithms frequently outperform competing approaches. As a result, feature engineering methods that automatically generate candidate features have been widely used. While these approaches are often effective, there remains ambiguity in defining the space over which to search for candidate features. Moreover, they often rely solely on validation scores to select good features, neglecting valuable feedback from past experiments that could inform the planning of future experiments. To address the shortcomings, we propose a new tabular learning framework based on large language models (LLMs), coined Optimizing Column feature generator with decision Tree reasoning (OCTree). Our key idea is to leverage LLMs' reasoning capabilities to find good feature generation rules without manually specifying the search space and provide language-based reasoning information highlighting past experiments as feedback for iterative rule improvements. Here, we choose a decision tree as reasoning as it can be interpreted in natural language, effectively conveying knowledge of past experiments (i.e., the prediction models trained with the generated features) to the LLM. Our empirical results demonstrate that this simple framework consistently enhances the performance of various prediction models across diverse tabular benchmarks, outperforming competing automatic feature engineering methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion Transformers (DiT) excel at image and video generation but face computational challenges due to self-attention's quadratic complexity. We propose DiTFastAttn, a novel post-training compression method to alleviate DiT's computational bottleneck. We identify three key redundancies in the attention computation during DiT inference: 1. spatial redundancy, where many attention heads focus on local information; 2. temporal redundancy, with high similarity between neighboring steps' attention outputs; 3. conditional redundancy, where conditional and unconditional inferences exhibit significant similarity. To tackle these redundancies, we propose three techniques: 1. Window Attention with Residual Caching to reduce spatial redundancy; 2. Temporal Similarity Reduction to exploit the similarity between steps; 3. Conditional Redundancy Elimination to skip redundant computations during conditional generation. To demonstrate the effectiveness of DiTFastAttn, we apply it to DiT, PixArt-Sigma for image generation tasks, and OpenSora for video generation tasks. Evaluation results show that for image generation, our method reduces up to 88\% of the FLOPs and achieves up to 1.6x speedup at high resolution generation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, protect</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Many high-stakes applications require machine learning models that protect user privacy and provide well-calibrated, accurate predictions. While Differential Privacy (DP) is the gold standard for protecting user privacy, standard DP mechanisms typically significantly impair performance. One approach to mitigating this issue is pre-training models on simulated data before DP learning on the private data. In this work we go a step further, using simulated data to train a meta-learning model that combines the Convolutional Conditional Neural Process (ConvCNP) with an improved functional DP mechanism of Hall et al. [2013] yielding the DPConvCNP. DPConvCNP learns from simulated data how to map private data to a DP predictive model in one forward pass, and then provides accurate, well-calibrated predictions. We compare DPConvCNP with a DP Gaussian Process (GP) baseline with carefully tuned hyperparameters. The DPConvCNP outperforms the GP baseline, especially on non-Gaussian data, yet is much faster at test time and requires less tuning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Providing textual concept-based explanations for neurons in deep neural networks (DNNs) is of importance in understanding how a DNN model works. Prior works have associated concepts with neurons based on examples of concepts or a pre-defined set of concepts, thus limiting possible explanations to what the user expects, especially in discovering new concepts. Furthermore, defining the set of concepts requires manual work from the user, either by directly specifying them or collecting examples. To overcome these, we propose to leverage multimodal large language models for automatic and open-ended concept discovery. We show that, without a restricted set of pre-defined concepts, our method gives rise to novel interpretable concepts that are more faithful to the model's behavior. To quantify this, we validate each concept by generating examples and counterexamples and evaluating the neuron's response on this new set of images. Collectively, our method can discover concepts and simultaneously validate them, providing a credible automated tool to explain deep neural networks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Computer Science (CS) stands as a testament to the intricacies of human intelligence, profoundly advancing the development of artificial intelligence and modern society. However, the current community of large language models (LLMs) overly focuses on benchmarks for analyzing specific foundational skills (e.g. mathematics and code generation), neglecting an all-round evaluation of the computer science field. To bridge this gap, we introduce CS-Bench, the first bilingual (Chinese-English) benchmark dedicated to evaluating the performance of LLMs in computer science. CS-Bench comprises approximately 5K meticulously curated test samples, covering 26 subfields across 4 key areas of computer science, encompassing various task forms and divisions of knowledge and reasoning. Utilizing CS-Bench, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of over 30 mainstream LLMs, revealing the relationship between CS performance and model scales. We also quantitatively analyze the reasons for failures in existing LLMs and highlight directions for improvements, including knowledge supplementation and CS-specific reasoning. Further cross-capability experiments show a high correlation between LLMs' capabilities in computer science and their abilities in mathematics and coding. Moreover, expert LLMs specialized in mathematics and coding also demonstrate strong performances in several CS subfields. Looking ahead, we envision CS-Bench serving as a cornerstone for LLM applications in the CS field and paving new avenues in assessing LLMs' diverse reasoning capabilities.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) necessitates robust and challenging benchmarks. Leaderboards like Chatbot Arena rank LLMs based on how well their responses align with human preferences. However, many tasks such as those related to emotional intelligence, creative writing, or persuasiveness, are highly subjective and often lack majoritarian human agreement. Judges may have irreconcilable disagreements about what constitutes a better response. To address the challenge of ranking LLMs on highly subjective tasks, we propose a novel benchmarking framework, the Language Model Council (LMC). The LMC operates through a democratic process to: 1) formulate a test set through equal participation, 2) administer the test among council members, and 3) evaluate responses as a collective jury. We deploy a council of 20 newest LLMs on an open-ended emotional intelligence task: responding to interpersonal dilemmas. Our results show that the LMC produces rankings that are more separable, robust, and less biased than those from any individual LLM judge, and is more consistent with a human-established leaderboard compared to other benchmarks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Due to the high potential for abuse of GenAI systems, the task of detecting synthetic images has recently become of great interest to the research community. Unfortunately, existing image-space detectors quickly become obsolete as new high-fidelity text-to-image models are developed at blinding speed. In this work, we propose a new synthetic image detector that uses features obtained by inverting an open-source pre-trained Stable Diffusion model. We show that these inversion features enable our detector to generalize well to unseen generators of high visual fidelity (e.g., DALL-E 3) even when the detector is trained only on lower fidelity fake images generated via Stable Diffusion. This detector achieves new state-of-the-art across multiple training and evaluation setups. Moreover, we introduce a new challenging evaluation protocol that uses reverse image search to mitigate stylistic and thematic biases in the detector evaluation. We show that the resulting evaluation scores align well with detectors' in-the-wild performance, and release these datasets as public benchmarks for future research.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Argument Mining (AM) is a crucial aspect of computational argumentation, which deals with the identification and extraction of Argumentative Components (ACs) and their corresponding Argumentative Relations (ARs). Most prior works have solved these problems by dividing them into multiple subtasks. And the available end-to-end setups are mostly based on the dependency parsing approach. This work proposes a unified end-to-end framework based on a generative paradigm, in which the argumentative structures are framed into label-augmented text, called Augmented Natural Language (ANL). Additionally, we explore the role of different types of markers in solving AM tasks. Through different marker-based fine-tuning strategies, we present an extensive study by integrating marker knowledge into our generative model. The proposed framework achieves competitive results to the state-of-the-art (SoTA) model and outperforms several baselines.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate extensive capability in learning from documents, LLM unlearning becomes an increasingly important research area to address concerns of LLMs in terms of privacy, copyright, etc. A conventional LLM unlearning task typically involves two goals: (1) The target LLM should forget the knowledge in the specified forget documents, and (2) it should retain the other knowledge that the LLM possesses, for which we assume access to a small number of retain documents. To achieve both goals, a mainstream class of LLM unlearning methods introduces an optimization framework with a combination of two objectives - maximizing the prediction loss on the forget documents while minimizing that on the retain documents, which suffers from two challenges, degenerated output and catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we propose a novel unlearning framework called Unlearning from Logit Difference (ULD), which introduces an assistant LLM that aims to achieve the opposite of the unlearning goals: remembering the forget documents and forgetting the retain knowledge. ULD then derives the unlearned LLM by computing the logit difference between the target and the assistant LLMs. We show that such reversed objectives would naturally resolve both aforementioned challenges while significantly improving the training efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method efficiently achieves the intended forgetting while preserving the LLM's overall capabilities, reducing training time by more than threefold. Notably, our method loses 0% of model utility on the ToFU benchmark, whereas baseline methods may sacrifice 17% of utility on average to achieve comparable forget quality.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid evolution of intelligent document processing systems demands robust solutions that adapt to diverse domains without extensive retraining. Traditional methods often falter with variable document types, leading to poor performance. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a text-graphic layer separation approach that enhances domain adaptability in document image restoration (DIR) systems. We propose LayeredDoc, which utilizes two layers of information: the first targets coarse-grained graphic components, while the second refines machine-printed textual content. This hierarchical DIR framework dynamically adjusts to the characteristics of the input document, facilitating effective domain adaptation. We evaluated our approach both qualitatively and quantitatively using a new real-world dataset, LayeredDocDB, developed for this study. Initially trained on a synthetically generated dataset, our model demonstrates strong generalization capabilities for the DIR task, offering a promising solution for handling variability in real-world data.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The surge in global migration patterns underscores the imperative of integrating migrants seamlessly into host communities, necessitating inclusive and trustworthy public services. Despite the Nordic countries' robust public sector infrastructure, recent immigrants often encounter barriers to accessing these services, exacerbating social disparities and eroding trust. Addressing digital inequalities and linguistic diversity is paramount in this endeavor. This paper explores the utilization of code-mixing, a communication strategy prevalent among multilingual speakers, in migration-related discourse on social media platforms such as Reddit. We present Ensemble Learning for Multilingual Identification of Code-mixed Texts (ELMICT), a novel approach designed to automatically detect code-mixed messages in migration-related discussions. Leveraging ensemble learning techniques for combining multiple tokenizers' outputs and pre-trained language models, ELMICT demonstrates high performance (with F1 more than 0.95) in identifying code-mixing across various languages and contexts, particularly in cross-lingual zero-shot conditions (with avg. F1 more than 0.70). Moreover, the utilization of ELMICT helps to analyze the prevalence of code-mixing in migration-related threads compared to other thematic categories on Reddit, shedding light on the topics of concern to migrant communities. Our findings reveal insights into the communicative strategies employed by migrants on social media platforms, offering implications for the development of inclusive digital public services and conversational systems. By addressing the research questions posed in this study, we contribute to the understanding of linguistic diversity in migration discourse and pave the way for more effective tools for building trust in multicultural societies.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Video generation has many unique challenges beyond those of image generation. The temporal dimension introduces extensive possible variations across frames, over which consistency and continuity may be violated. In this study, we move beyond evaluating simple actions and argue that generated videos should incorporate the emergence of new concepts and their relation transitions like in real-world videos as time progresses. To assess the Temporal Compositionality of video generation models, we propose TC-Bench, a benchmark of meticulously crafted text prompts, corresponding ground truth videos, and robust evaluation metrics. The prompts articulate the initial and final states of scenes, effectively reducing ambiguities for frame development and simplifying the assessment of transition completion. In addition, by collecting aligned real-world videos corresponding to the prompts, we expand TC-Bench's applicability from text-conditional models to image-conditional ones that can perform generative frame interpolation. We also develop new metrics to measure the completeness of component transitions in generated videos, which demonstrate significantly higher correlations with human judgments than existing metrics. Our comprehensive experimental results reveal that most video generators achieve less than 20% of the compositional changes, highlighting enormous space for future improvement. Our analysis indicates that current video generation models struggle to interpret descriptions of compositional changes and synthesize various components across different time steps.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Despite the advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), exemplified by models like GPT-4 and Claude, smaller-scale LLMs such as Llama and Mistral often struggle with generating in-depth and coherent dialogues. This paper presents a novel two-step Coarse-to-Fine Actor model to address the inherent limitations in conversational and analytical capabilities of small-sized LLMs. Our approach begins with the Policy-based Coarse Actor, employing a technique we term "Continuous Maximization". The Coarse Actor establishes an enhanced, knowledge-rich pool adept at aligning with human preference styles in analysis and reasoning. Through the RLHF process, it employs Continuous Maximization, a strategy that dynamically and adaptively extends the output length limit, enabling the generation of more detailed and analytical content. Subsequently, the Fine Actor refines this analytical content, addressing the generation of excessively redundant information from the Coarse Actor. We introduce a "Knowledge Residue Merger" approach, refining the content from the Coarse Actor and merging it with an existing Instruction model to improve quality, correctness, and reduce redundancies. We applied our methodology to the popular Mistral model, creating Mistral-C2F, which has demonstrated exceptional performance across 11 general language tasks and the MT-Bench Dialogue task, outperforming similar-scale models and even larger models with 13B and 30B parameters. Our model has significantly improved conversational and analytical reasoning abilities.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While diffusion models have shown impressive performance in 2D image/video generation, diffusion-based Text-to-Multi-view-Video (T2MVid) generation remains underexplored. The new challenges posed by T2MVid generation lie in the lack of massive captioned multi-view videos and the complexity of modeling such multi-dimensional distribution. To this end, we propose a novel diffusion-based pipeline that generates high-quality multi-view videos centered around a dynamic 3D object from text. Specifically, we factor the T2MVid problem into viewpoint-space and time components. Such factorization allows us to combine and reuse layers of advanced pre-trained multi-view image and 2D video diffusion models to ensure multi-view consistency as well as temporal coherence for the generated multi-view videos, largely reducing the training cost. We further introduce alignment modules to align the latent spaces of layers from the pre-trained multi-view and the 2D video diffusion models, addressing the reused layers' incompatibility that arises from the domain gap between 2D and multi-view data. In support of this and future research, we further contribute a captioned multi-view video dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates high-quality multi-view videos, exhibiting vivid motions, temporal coherence, and multi-view consistency, given a variety of text prompts.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative AI offers a simple, prompt-based alternative to fine-tuning smaller BERT-style LLMs for text classification tasks. This promises to eliminate the need for manually labeled training data and task-specific model training. However, it remains an open question whether tools like ChatGPT can deliver on this promise. In this paper, we show that smaller, fine-tuned LLMs (still) consistently and significantly outperform larger, zero-shot prompted models in text classification. We compare three major generative AI models (ChatGPT with GPT-3.5/GPT-4 and Claude Opus) with several fine-tuned LLMs across a diverse set of classification tasks (sentiment, approval/disapproval, emotions, party positions) and text categories (news, tweets, speeches). We find that fine-tuning with application-specific training data achieves superior performance in all cases. To make this approach more accessible to a broader audience, we provide an easy-to-use toolkit alongside this paper. Our toolkit, accompanied by non-technical step-by-step guidance, enables users to select and fine-tune BERT-like LLMs for any classification task with minimal technical and computational effort.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>High-quality preference datasets are essential for training reward models that can effectively guide large language models (LLMs) in generating high-quality responses aligned with human preferences. As LLMs become stronger and better aligned, permissively licensed preference datasets, such as Open Assistant, HH-RLHF, and HelpSteer need to be updated to remain effective for reward modeling. Methods that distil preference data from proprietary LLMs such as GPT-4 have restrictions on commercial usage imposed by model providers. To improve upon both generated responses and attribute labeling quality, we release HelpSteer2, a permissively licensed preference dataset (CC-BY-4.0). Using a powerful internal base model trained on HelpSteer2, we are able to achieve the SOTA score (92.0%) on Reward-Bench's primary dataset, outperforming currently listed open and proprietary models, as of June 12th, 2024. Notably, HelpSteer2 consists of only ten thousand response pairs, an order of magnitude fewer than existing preference datasets (e.g., HH-RLHF), which makes it highly efficient for training reward models. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that reward models trained with HelpSteer2 are effective in aligning LLMs. In particular, we propose SteerLM 2.0, a model alignment approach that can effectively make use of the rich multi-attribute score predicted by our reward models.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Automatically assessing classroom discussion quality is becoming increasingly feasible with the help of new NLP advancements such as large language models (LLMs). In this work, we examine how the assessment performance of 2 LLMs interacts with 3 factors that may affect performance: task formulation, context length, and few-shot examples. We also explore the computational efficiency and predictive consistency of the 2 LLMs. Our results suggest that the 3 aforementioned factors do affect the performance of the tested LLMs and there is a relation between consistency and performance. We recommend a LLM-based assessment approach that has a good balance in terms of predictive performance, computational efficiency, and consistency.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The study and development of AI agents have been boosted by large language models. AI agents can function as intelligent assistants and complete tasks on behalf of their users with access to tools and the ability to execute commands in their environments, Through studying and experiencing the workflow of typical AI agents, we have raised several concerns regarding their security. These potential vulnerabilities are not addressed by the frameworks used to build the agents, nor by research aimed at improving the agents. In this paper, we identify and describe these vulnerabilities in detail from a system security perspective, emphasizing their causes and severe effects. Furthermore, we introduce defense mechanisms corresponding to each vulnerability with meticulous design and experiments to evaluate their viability. Altogether, this paper contextualizes the security issues in the current development of AI agents and delineates methods to make AI agents safer and more reliable.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>defense, attack, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent studies developed jailbreaking attacks, which construct jailbreaking prompts to ``fool'' LLMs into responding to harmful questions. Early-stage jailbreaking attacks require access to model internals or significant human efforts. More advanced attacks utilize genetic algorithms for automatic and black-box attacks. However, the random nature of genetic algorithms significantly limits the effectiveness of these attacks. In this paper, we propose RLbreaker, a black-box jailbreaking attack driven by deep reinforcement learning (DRL). We model jailbreaking as a search problem and design an RL agent to guide the search, which is more effective and has less randomness than stochastic search, such as genetic algorithms. Specifically, we design a customized DRL system for the jailbreaking problem, including a novel reward function and a customized proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that RLbreaker is much more effective than existing jailbreaking attacks against six state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs. We also show that RLbreaker is robust against three SOTA defenses and its trained agents can transfer across different LLMs. We further validate the key design choices of RLbreaker via a comprehensive ablation study.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multimodal Large Language Models (mLLMs) are trained on a large amount of text-image data. While most mLLMs are trained on caption-like data only, Alayrac et al. [2022] showed that additionally training them on interleaved sequences of text and images can lead to the emergence of in-context learning capabilities. However, the dataset they used, M3W, is not public and is only in English. There have been attempts to reproduce their results but the released datasets are English-only. In contrast, current multilingual and multimodal datasets are either composed of caption-like only or medium-scale or fully private data. This limits mLLM research for the 7,000 other languages spoken in the world. We therefore introduce mOSCAR, to the best of our knowledge the first large-scale multilingual and multimodal document corpus crawled from the web. It covers 163 languages, 315M documents, 214B tokens and 1.2B images. We carefully conduct a set of filtering and evaluation steps to make sure mOSCAR is sufficiently safe, diverse and of good quality. We additionally train two types of multilingual model to prove the benefits of mOSCAR: (1) a model trained on a subset of mOSCAR and captioning data and (2) a model train on captioning data only. The model additionally trained on mOSCAR shows a strong boost in few-shot learning performance across various multilingual image-text tasks and benchmarks, confirming previous findings for English-only mLLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce a pipeline that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform single-turn psychotherapy counseling sessions into multi-turn interactions. While AI-supported online counseling services for individuals with mental disorders exist, they are often constrained by the limited availability of multi-turn training datasets and frequently fail to fully utilize therapists' expertise. Our proposed pipeline effectively addresses these limitations. The pipeline comprises two main steps: 1) Information Extraction and 2) Multi-turn Counseling Generation. Each step is meticulously designed to extract and generate comprehensive multi-turn counseling conversations from the available datasets. Experimental results from both zero-shot and few-shot generation scenarios demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the ability of LLMs to produce higher quality multi-turn dialogues in the context of mental health counseling.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>ARM Memory Tagging Extension (MTE) is a new hardware feature introduced in ARMv8.5-A architecture, aiming to detect memory corruption vulnerabilities. The low overhead of MTE makes it an attractive solution to mitigate memory corruption attacks in modern software systems and is considered the most promising path forward for improving C/C++ software security. This paper explores the potential security risks posed by speculative execution attacks against MTE. Specifically, this paper identifies new TikTag gadgets capable of leaking the MTE tags from arbitrary memory addresses through speculative execution. With TikTag gadgets, attackers can bypass the probabilistic defense of MTE, increasing the attack success rate by close to 100%. We demonstrate that TikTag gadgets can be used to bypass MTE-based mitigations in real-world systems, Google Chrome and the Linux kernel. Experimental results show that TikTag gadgets can successfully leak an MTE tag with a success rate higher than 95% in less than 4 seconds. We further propose new defense mechanisms to mitigate the security risks posed by TikTag gadgets.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>defense, attack, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Modern large language model (LLM) developers typically conduct a safety alignment to prevent an LLM from generating unethical or harmful content. Recent studies have discovered that the safety alignment of LLMs can be bypassed by jailbreaking prompts. These prompts are designed to create specific conversation scenarios with a harmful question embedded. Querying an LLM with such prompts can mislead the model into responding to the harmful question. The stochastic and random nature of existing genetic methods largely limits the effectiveness and efficiency of state-of-the-art (SOTA) jailbreaking attacks. In this paper, we propose RL-JACK, a novel black-box jailbreaking attack powered by deep reinforcement learning (DRL). We formulate the generation of jailbreaking prompts as a search problem and design a novel RL approach to solve it. Our method includes a series of customized designs to enhance the RL agent's learning efficiency in the jailbreaking context. Notably, we devise an LLM-facilitated action space that enables diverse action variations while constraining the overall search space. We propose a novel reward function that provides meaningful dense rewards for the agent toward achieving successful jailbreaking. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that RL-JACK is overall much more effective than existing jailbreaking attacks against six SOTA LLMs, including large open-source models and commercial models. We also show the RL-JACK's resiliency against three SOTA defenses and its transferability across different models. Finally, we validate the insensitivity of RL-JACK to the variations in key hyper-parameters.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this position paper, we explore standard language ideology in language generated by large language models (LLMs). First, we outline how standard language ideology is reflected and reinforced in LLMs. We then present a taxonomy of open problems regarding standard language ideology in AI-generated language with implications for minoritized language communities. We introduce the concept of standard AI-generated language ideology, the process by which AI-generated language regards Standard American English (SAE) as a linguistic default and reinforces a linguistic bias that SAE is the most "appropriate" language. Finally, we discuss tensions that remain, including reflecting on what desirable system behavior looks like, as well as advantages and drawbacks of generative AI tools imitating--or often not--different English language varieties. Throughout, we discuss standard language ideology as a manifestation of existing global power structures in and through AI-generated language before ending with questions to move towards alternative, more emancipatory digital futures.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Explainability is needed to establish confidence in machine learning results. Some explainable methods take a post hoc approach to explain the weights of machine learning models, others highlight areas of the input contributing to decisions. These methods do not adequately explain decisions, in plain terms. Explainable property-based systems have been shown to provide explanations in plain terms, however, they have not performed as well as leading unexplainable machine learning methods. This research focuses on the importance of metrics to explainability and contributes two methods yielding performance gains. The first method introduces a combination of explainable and unexplainable flows, proposing a metric to characterize explainability of a decision. The second method compares classic metrics for estimating the effectiveness of neural networks in the system, posing a new metric as the leading performer. Results from the new methods and examples from handwritten datasets are presented.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent works have shown that large language model (LLM) agents are able to improve themselves from experience, which is an important ability for continuous enhancement post-deployment. However, existing benchmarks primarily evaluate their innate capabilities and do not assess their ability to improve over time. To address this gap, we introduce StreamBench, a pioneering benchmark designed to evaluate the continuous improvement of LLM agents over an input-feedback sequence. StreamBench simulates an online learning environment where LLMs receive a continuous flow of feedback stream and iteratively enhance their performance. In addition, we propose several simple yet effective baselines for improving LLMs on StreamBench, and provide a comprehensive analysis to identify critical components that contribute to successful streaming strategies. Our work serves as a stepping stone towards developing effective online learning strategies for LLMs, paving the way for more adaptive AI systems in streaming scenarios.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in natural language processing but face the risk of jailbreak attacks that maliciously induce them to generate harmful content. Existing jailbreak attacks, including character-level and context-level attacks, mainly focus on the prompt of the plain text without specifically exploring the significant influence of its structure. In this paper, we focus on studying how prompt structure contributes to the jailbreak attack. We introduce a novel structure-level attack method based on tail structures that are rarely used during LLM training, which we refer to as Uncommon Text-Encoded Structure (UTES). We extensively study 12 UTESs templates and 6 obfuscation methods to build an effective automated jailbreak tool named StructuralSleight that contains three escalating attack strategies: Structural Attack, Structural and Character/Context Obfuscation Attack, and Fully Obfuscated Structural Attack. Extensive experiments on existing LLMs show that StructuralSleight significantly outperforms baseline methods. In particular, the attack success rate reaches 94.62\% on GPT-4o, which has not been addressed by state-of-the-art techniques.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have exhibited noteworthy advancements across various applications, including medical imaging. While numerous state-of-the-art Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) architectures are renowned for their proficient feature extraction, this paper investigates their efficacy in the context of medical image deepfake detection. The primary objective is to effectively distinguish real from tampered or manipulated medical images by employing a comprehensive evaluation of 13 state-of-the-art DCNNs. Performance is assessed across diverse evaluation metrics, encompassing considerations of time efficiency and computational resource requirements. Our findings reveal that ResNet50V2 excels in precision and specificity, whereas DenseNet169 is distinguished by its accuracy, recall, and F1-score. We investigate the specific scenarios in which one model would be more favorable than another. Additionally, MobileNetV3Large offers competitive performance, emerging as the swiftest among the considered DCNN models while maintaining a relatively small parameter count. We also assess the latent space separability quality across the examined DCNNs, showing superiority in both the DenseNet and EfficientNet model families and entailing a higher understanding of medical image deepfakes. The experimental analysis in this research contributes valuable insights to the field of deepfake image detection in the medical imaging domain.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Limited by the scale and diversity of time series data, the neural networks trained on time series data often overfit and show unsatisfacotry performances. In comparison, large language models (LLMs) recently exhibit impressive generalization in diverse fields. Although massive LLM based approaches are proposed for time series tasks, these methods require to load the whole LLM in both training and reference. This high computational demands limit practical applications in resource-constrained settings, like edge-computing and IoT devices. To address this issue, we propose Knowledge Pruning (KP), a novel paradigm for time series learning in this paper. For a specific downstream task, we argue that the world knowledge learned by LLMs is much redundant and only the related knowledge termed as "pertinent knowledge" is useful. Unlike other methods, our KP targets to prune the redundant knowledge and only distill the pertinent knowledge into the target model. This reduces model size and computational costs significantly. Additionally, different from existing LLM based approaches, our KP does not require to load the LLM in the process of training and testing, further easing computational burdens. With our proposed KP, a lightweight network can effectively learn the pertinent knowledge, achieving satisfactory performances with a low computation cost. To verify the effectiveness of our KP, two fundamental tasks on edge-computing devices are investigated in our experiments, where eight diverse environments or benchmarks with different networks are used to verify the generalization of our KP. Through experiments, our KP demonstrates effective learning of pertinent knowledge, achieving notable performance improvements in regression (19.7% on average) and classification (up to 13.7%) tasks, showcasing state-of-the-art results.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Current multimodal misinformation detection (MMD) methods often assume a single source and type of forgery for each sample, which is insufficient for real-world scenarios where multiple forgery sources coexist. The lack of a benchmark for mixed-source misinformation has hindered progress in this field. To address this, we introduce MMFakeBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for mixed-source MMD. MMFakeBench includes 3 critical sources: textual veracity distortion, visual veracity distortion, and cross-modal consistency distortion, along with 12 sub-categories of misinformation forgery types. We further conduct an extensive evaluation of 6 prevalent detection methods and 15 large vision-language models (LVLMs) on MMFakeBench under a zero-shot setting. The results indicate that current methods struggle under this challenging and realistic mixed-source MMD setting. Additionally, we propose an innovative unified framework, which integrates rationales, actions, and tool-use capabilities of LVLM agents, significantly enhancing accuracy and generalization. We believe this study will catalyze future research into more realistic mixed-source multimodal misinformation and provide a fair evaluation of misinformation detection methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we propose a novel Denoising Model for Representation Learning and take Person Re-Identification (ReID) as a benchmark task, named DenoiseReID, to improve feature discriminative with joint feature extraction and denoising. In the deep learning epoch, backbones which consists of cascaded embedding layers (e.g. convolutions or transformers) to progressively extract useful features, becomes popular. We first view each embedding layer in a backbone as a denoising layer, processing the cascaded embedding layers as if we are recursively denoise features step-by-step. This unifies the frameworks of feature extraction and feature denoising, where the former progressively embeds features from low-level to high-level, and the latter recursively denoises features step-by-step. Then we design a novel Feature Extraction and Feature Denoising Fusion Algorithm (FEFDFA) and \textit{theoretically demonstrate} its equivalence before and after fusion. FEFDFA merges parameters of the denoising layers into existing embedding layers, thus making feature denoising computation-free. This is a label-free algorithm to incrementally improve feature also complementary to the label if available. Besides, it enjoys two advantages: 1) it's a computation-free and label-free plugin for incrementally improving ReID features. 2) it is complementary to the label if the label is available. Experimental results on various tasks (large-scale image classification, fine-grained image classification, image retrieval) and backbones (transformers and convolutions) show the scalability and stability of our method. Experimental results on 4 ReID datasets and various of backbones show the stability and impressive improvements. We also extend the proposed method to large-scale (ImageNet) and fine-grained (e.g. CUB200) classification tasks, similar improvements are proven.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Labels are the cornerstone of supervised machine learning algorithms. Most visual recognition methods are fully supervised, using bounding boxes or pixel-wise segmentations for object localization. Traditional labeling methods, such as crowd-sourcing, are prohibitive due to cost, data privacy, amount of time, and potential errors on large datasets. To address these issues, we propose a novel annotation framework, Advanced Line Identification and Notation Algorithm (ALINA), which can be used for labeling taxiway datasets that consist of different camera perspectives and variable weather attributes (sunny and cloudy). Additionally, the CIRCular threshoLd pixEl Discovery And Traversal (CIRCLEDAT) algorithm has been proposed, which is an integral step in determining the pixels corresponding to taxiway line markings. Once the pixels are identified, ALINA generates corresponding pixel coordinate annotations on the frame. Using this approach, 60,249 frames from the taxiway dataset, AssistTaxi have been labeled. To evaluate the performance, a context-based edge map (CBEM) set was generated manually based on edge features and connectivity. The detection rate after testing the annotated labels with the CBEM set was recorded as 98.45%, attesting its dependability and effectiveness.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has proven beneficial for efficiently fine-tuning large models, LoRA fine-tuned text-to-image diffusion models lack diversity in the generated images, as the model tends to copy data from the observed training samples. This effect becomes more pronounced at higher values of adapter strength and for adapters with higher ranks which are fine-tuned on smaller datasets. To address these challenges, we present FouRA, a novel low-rank method that learns projections in the Fourier domain along with learning a flexible input-dependent adapter rank selection strategy. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we show that FouRA successfully solves the problems related to data copying and distribution collapse while significantly improving the generated image quality. We demonstrate that FouRA enhances the generalization of fine-tuned models thanks to its adaptive rank selection. We further show that the learned projections in the frequency domain are decorrelated and prove effective when merging multiple adapters. While FouRA is motivated for vision tasks, we also demonstrate its merits for language tasks on the GLUE benchmark.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The field of portrait image animation, driven by speech audio input, has experienced significant advancements in the generation of realistic and dynamic portraits. This research delves into the complexities of synchronizing facial movements and creating visually appealing, temporally consistent animations within the framework of diffusion-based methodologies. Moving away from traditional paradigms that rely on parametric models for intermediate facial representations, our innovative approach embraces the end-to-end diffusion paradigm and introduces a hierarchical audio-driven visual synthesis module to enhance the precision of alignment between audio inputs and visual outputs, encompassing lip, expression, and pose motion. Our proposed network architecture seamlessly integrates diffusion-based generative models, a UNet-based denoiser, temporal alignment techniques, and a reference network. The proposed hierarchical audio-driven visual synthesis offers adaptive control over expression and pose diversity, enabling more effective personalization tailored to different identities. Through a comprehensive evaluation that incorporates both qualitative and quantitative analyses, our approach demonstrates obvious enhancements in image and video quality, lip synchronization precision, and motion diversity.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) are typically fine-tuned on diverse and extensive datasets sourced from various origins to develop a comprehensive range of skills, such as writing, reasoning, chatting, coding, and more. Each skill has unique characteristics, and these datasets are often heterogeneous and imbalanced, making the fine-tuning process highly challenging. Balancing the development of each skill while ensuring the model maintains its overall performance requires sophisticated techniques and careful dataset curation. In this work, we propose a general, model-agnostic, reinforcement learning framework, Mixture-of-Skills (MoS), that learns to optimize data usage automatically during the fine-tuning process. This framework ensures the optimal comprehensive skill development of LLMs by dynamically adjusting the focus on different datasets based on their current learning state. To validate the effectiveness of MoS, we conduct extensive experiments using three diverse LLM backbones on two widely used benchmarks and demonstrate that MoS substantially enhances model performance. Building on the success of MoS, we propose MoSpec, an adaptation for task-specific fine-tuning, which harnesses the utilities of various datasets for a specific purpose. Our work underlines the significance of dataset rebalancing and present MoS as a powerful, general solution for optimizing data usage in the fine-tuning of LLMs for various purposes.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The key to action counting is accurately locating each video's repetitive actions. Instead of estimating the probability of each frame belonging to an action directly, we propose a dual-branch network, i.e., SkimFocusNet, working in a two-step manner. The model draws inspiration from empirical observations indicating that humans typically engage in coarse skimming of entire sequences to grasp the general action pattern initially, followed by a finer, frame-by-frame focus to determine if it aligns with the target action. Specifically, SkimFocusNet incorporates a skim branch and a focus branch. The skim branch scans the global contextual information throughout the sequence to identify potential target action for guidance. Subsequently, the focus branch utilizes the guidance to diligently identify repetitive actions using a long-short adaptive guidance (LSAG) block. Additionally, we have observed that videos in existing datasets often feature only one type of repetitive action, which inadequately represents real-world scenarios. To more accurately describe real-life situations, we establish the Multi-RepCount dataset, which includes videos containing multiple repetitive motions. On Multi-RepCount, our SkimFoucsNet can perform specified action counting, that is, to enable counting a particular action type by referencing an exemplary video. This capability substantially exhibits the robustness of our method. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SkimFocusNet achieves state-of-the-art performances with significant improvements. We also conduct a thorough ablation study to evaluate the network components. The source code will be published upon acceptance.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we propose a novel token selective attention approach, ToSA, which can identify tokens that need to be attended as well as those that can skip a transformer layer. More specifically, a token selector parses the current attention maps and predicts the attention maps for the next layer, which are then used to select the important tokens that should participate in the attention operation. The remaining tokens simply bypass the next layer and are concatenated with the attended ones to re-form a complete set of tokens. In this way, we reduce the quadratic computation and memory costs as fewer tokens participate in self-attention while maintaining the features for all the image patches throughout the network, which allows it to be used for dense prediction tasks. Our experiments show that by applying ToSA, we can significantly reduce computation costs while maintaining accuracy on the ImageNet classification benchmark. Furthermore, we evaluate on the dense prediction task of monocular depth estimation on NYU Depth V2, and show that we can achieve similar depth prediction accuracy using a considerably lighter backbone with ToSA.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Data collected in the real world often encapsulates historical discrimination against disadvantaged groups and individuals. Existing fair machine learning (FairML) research has predominantly focused on mitigating discriminative bias in the model prediction, with far less effort dedicated towards exploring how to trace biases present in the data, despite its importance for the transparency and interpretability of FairML. To fill this gap, we investigate a novel research problem: discovering samples that reflect biases/prejudices from the training data. Grounding on the existing fairness notions, we lay out a sample bias criterion and propose practical algorithms for measuring and countering sample bias. The derived bias score provides intuitive sample-level attribution and explanation of historical bias in data. On this basis, we further design two FairML strategies via sample-bias-informed minimal data editing. They can mitigate both group and individual unfairness at the cost of minimal or zero predictive utility loss. Extensive experiments and analyses on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods in explaining and mitigating unfairness. Code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, defense, attack, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are well-known for their vulnerability to adversarial attacks, posing significant security concerns. In response to these threats, various defense methods have emerged to bolster the model's robustness. However, most existing methods either focus on learning from adversarial perturbations, leading to overfitting to the adversarial examples, or aim to eliminate such perturbations during inference, inevitably increasing computational burdens. Conversely, clean training, which strengthens the model's robustness by relying solely on clean examples, can address the aforementioned issues. In this paper, we align with this methodological stream and enhance its generalizability to unknown adversarial examples. This enhancement is achieved by scrutinizing the behavior of latent features within the network. Recognizing that a correct prediction relies on the correctness of the latent feature's pattern, we introduce a novel and effective Feature Pattern Consistency Constraint (FPCC) method to reinforce the latent feature's capacity to maintain the correct feature pattern. Specifically, we propose Spatial-wise Feature Modification and Channel-wise Feature Selection to enhance latent features. Subsequently, we employ the Pattern Consistency Loss to constrain the similarity between the feature pattern of the latent features and the correct feature pattern. Our experiments demonstrate that the FPCC method empowers latent features to uphold correct feature patterns even in the face of adversarial examples, resulting in inherent adversarial robustness surpassing state-of-the-art models.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This project intends to study the image representation based on attention mechanism and multimodal data. By adding multiple pattern layers to the attribute model, the semantic and hidden layers of image content are integrated. The word vector is quantified by the Word2Vec method and then evaluated by a word embedding convolutional neural network. The published experimental results of the two groups were tested. The experimental results show that this method can convert discrete features into continuous characters, thus reducing the complexity of feature preprocessing. Word2Vec and natural language processing technology are integrated to achieve the goal of direct evaluation of missing image features. The robustness of the image feature evaluation model is improved by using the excellent feature analysis characteristics of a convolutional neural network. This project intends to improve the existing image feature identification methods and eliminate the subjective influence in the evaluation process. The findings from the simulation indicate that the novel approach has developed is viable, effectively augmenting the features within the produced representations.</li>

As a result, the selection of concepts used in the model is of utmost significance. This study proposes \underline{\textbf{C}}onceptual \underline{\textbf{L}}earning via \underline{\textbf{E}}mbedding \underline{\textbf{A}}pproximations for \underline{\textbf{R}}einforcing Interpretability and Transparency, abbreviated as CLEAR, a framework for constructing a CBM for image classification. Using score matching and Langevin sampling, we approximate the embedding of concepts within the latent space of a vision-language model (VLM) by learning the scores associated with the joint distribution of images and concepts. A concept selection process is then employed to optimize the similarity between the learned embeddings and the predefined ones. The derived bottleneck offers insights into the CBM's decision-making process, enabling more comprehensive interpretations. Our approach was evaluated through extensive experiments and achieved state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks. The code for our experiments is available at this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While substantial advancements have been made in developing large language models (LLMs), achieving control over their behavior can be difficult. Direct preference optimization (DPO) assumes the existence of a latent reward function to evaluate the responses of LLMs. This assumption indicates a strict preference ordering of different responses to the same input. However, there always exist contradictions of preference in LLMs according to our experimental observations. In this paper, we construct a graph structure of the preference relationship among different responses with self-annotation to find contradictions in the preference order. We propose ContraSolver, an algorithm that traverses all edges on the preference graph to identify those that might cause contradictions. ContraSolver initializes the graph with a maximum spanning tree and identifies contradictory edges, prioritizing the resolution of low-confidence preferences while preserving high-confidence ones. Experimental results on four different generation tasks show that the performance of different LLMs can be largely improved through our completely unsupervised self-alignment. Furthermore, by analyzing the preference graphs of LLMs with and without self-alignment by ContraSolver, we quantify the reduction in contradictions, suggesting that resolving preference contradictions is crucial for achieving better alignment performance.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present an approach to build Large Language Model (LLM) based slot-filling system to perform Dialogue State Tracking in conversational assistants serving across a wide variety of industry-grade applications. Key requirements of this system include: 1) usage of smaller-sized models to meet low latency requirements and to enable convenient and cost-effective cloud and customer premise deployments, and 2) zero-shot capabilities to serve across a wide variety of domains, slot types and conversational scenarios. We adopt a fine-tuning approach where a pre-trained LLM is fine-tuned into a slot-filling model using task specific data. The fine-tuning data is prepared carefully to cover a wide variety of slot-filling task scenarios that the model is expected to face across various domains. We give details of the data preparation and model building process. We also give a detailed analysis of the results of our experimental evaluations. Results show that our prescribed approach for slot-filling model building has resulted in 6.9% relative improvement of F1 metric over the best baseline on a realistic benchmark, while at the same time reducing the latency by 57%. More over, the data we prepared has helped improve F1 on an average by 4.2% relative across various slot-types.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Video editing is an emerging task, in which most current methods adopt the pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model to edit the source video in a zero-shot manner. Despite extensive efforts, maintaining the temporal consistency of edited videos remains challenging due to the lack of temporal constraints in the regular T2I diffusion model. To address this issue, we propose COrrespondence-guided Video Editing (COVE), leveraging the inherent diffusion feature correspondence to achieve high-quality and consistent video editing. Specifically, we propose an efficient sliding-window-based strategy to calculate the similarity among tokens in the diffusion features of source videos, identifying the tokens with high correspondence across frames. During the inversion and denoising process, we sample the tokens in noisy latent based on the correspondence and then perform self-attention within them. To save GPU memory usage and accelerate the editing process, we further introduce the temporal-dimensional token merging strategy, which can effectively reduce redundancy. COVE can be seamlessly integrated into the pre-trained T2I diffusion model without the need for extra training or optimization. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that COVE achieves the start-of-the-art performance in various video editing scenarios, outperforming existing methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Modern vision transformers leverage visually inspired local interaction between pixels through attention computed within window or grid regions, in contrast to the global attention employed in the original ViT. Regional attention restricts pixel interactions within specific regions, while sparse attention disperses them across sparse grids. These differing approaches pose a challenge between maintaining hierarchical relationships vs. capturing a global context. In this study, drawing inspiration from atrous convolution, we propose Atrous Attention, a blend of regional and sparse attention that dynamically integrates both local and global information while preserving hierarchical structures. Based on this, we introduce a versatile, hybrid vision transformer backbone called ACC-ViT, tailored for standard vision tasks. Our compact model achieves approximately 84% accuracy on ImageNet-1K with fewer than 28.5 million parameters, outperforming the state-of-the-art MaxViT by 0.42% while requiring 8.4% fewer parameters.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Data augmentation methods have been a promising direction to improve the performance of small models for low-resource dialogue state tracking. However, traditional methods rely on pre-defined user goals and neglect the importance of data complexity in this task. In this paper, we propose EDZ-DA, an Easy-to-Difficult Zero-shot Data Augmentation framework for low-resource dialogue state tracking that utilizes large language models to automatically catch the relationships of different domains and then generate the dialogue data. We also complicate the dialogues based on the domain relation to enhance the model's capability for co-reference slot tracking. Furthermore, we permute slot values to mitigate the influence of output orders and the problem of incomplete value generation. Experimental results illustrate the superiority of our proposed method compared to previous strong data augmentation baselines on MultiWOZ.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>One of the predominant methods for training world models is autoregressive prediction in the output space of the next element of a sequence. In Natural Language Processing (NLP), this takes the form of Large Language Models (LLMs) predicting the next token; in Computer Vision (CV), this takes the form of autoregressive models predicting the next frame/token/pixel. However, this approach differs from human cognition in several respects. First, human predictions about the future actively influence internal cognitive processes. Second, humans naturally evaluate the plausibility of predictions regarding future states. Based on this capability, and third, by assessing when predictions are sufficient, humans allocate a dynamic amount of time to make a prediction. This adaptive process is analogous to System 2 thinking in psychology. All these capabilities are fundamental to the success of humans at high-level reasoning and planning. Therefore, to address the limitations of traditional autoregressive models lacking these human-like capabilities, we introduce Energy-Based World Models (EBWM). EBWM involves training an Energy-Based Model (EBM) to predict the compatibility of a given context and a predicted future state. In doing so, EBWM enables models to achieve all three facets of human cognition described. Moreover, we developed a variant of the traditional autoregressive transformer tailored for Energy-Based models, termed the Energy-Based Transformer (EBT). Our results demonstrate that EBWM scales better with data and GPU Hours than traditional autoregressive transformers in CV, and that EBWM offers promising early scaling in NLP. Consequently, this approach offers an exciting path toward training future models capable of System 2 thinking and intelligently searching across state spaces.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Fine-tuning is a crucial process for adapting large language models (LLMs) to diverse applications. In certain scenarios, such as multi-tenant serving, deploying multiple LLMs becomes necessary to meet complex demands. Recent studies suggest decomposing a fine-tuned LLM into a base model and corresponding delta weights, which are then compressed using low-rank or low-bit approaches to reduce costs. In this work, we observe that existing low-rank and low-bit compression methods can significantly harm the model performance for task-specific fine-tuned LLMs (e.g., WizardMath for math problems). Motivated by the long-tail distribution of singular values in the delta weights, we propose a delta quantization approach using mixed-precision. This method employs higher-bit representation for singular vectors corresponding to larger singular values. We evaluate our approach on various fine-tuned LLMs, including math LLMs, code LLMs, chat LLMs, and even VLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach performs comparably to full fine-tuned LLMs, surpassing both low-rank and low-bit baselines by a considerable margin. Additionally, we show that our method is compatible with various backbone LLMs, such as Llama-2, Llama-3, and Mistral, highlighting its generalizability.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While large transformer-based models have exhibited remarkable performance in speaker-independent speech recognition, their large size and computational requirements make them expensive or impractical to use in resource-constrained settings. In this work, we propose a low-rank adaptive compression technique called AdaPTwin that jointly compresses product-dependent pairs of weight matrices in the transformer attention layer. Our approach can prioritize the compressed model's performance on a specific speaker while maintaining generalizability to new speakers and acoustic conditions. Notably, our technique requires only 8 hours of speech data for fine-tuning, which can be accomplished in under 20 minutes, making it highly cost-effective compared to other compression methods. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by compressing the Whisper and Distil-Whisper models by up to 45% while incurring less than a 2% increase in word error rate.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In differentially private (DP) machine learning, the privacy guarantees of DP mechanisms are often reported and compared on the basis of a single $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-pair. This practice overlooks that DP guarantees can vary substantially \emph{even between mechanisms sharing a given $(\varepsilon, \delta)$}, and potentially introduces privacy vulnerabilities which can remain undetected. This motivates the need for robust, rigorous methods for comparing DP guarantees in such cases. Here, we introduce the $\Delta$-divergence between mechanisms which quantifies the worst-case excess privacy vulnerability of choosing one mechanism over another in terms of $(\varepsilon, \delta)$, $f$-DP and in terms of a newly presented Bayesian interpretation. Moreover, as a generalisation of the Blackwell theorem, it is endowed with strong decision-theoretic foundations. Through application examples, we show that our techniques can facilitate informed decision-making and reveal gaps in the current understanding of privacy risks, as current practices in DP-SGD often result in choosing mechanisms with high excess privacy vulnerabilities.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the launch of ChatGPT, large language models (LLMs) have attracted global attention. In the realm of article writing, LLMs have witnessed extensive utilization, giving rise to concerns related to intellectual property protection, personal privacy, and academic integrity. In response, AI-text detection has emerged to distinguish between human and machine-generated content. However, recent research indicates that these detection systems often lack robustness and struggle to effectively differentiate perturbed texts. Currently, there is a lack of systematic evaluations regarding detection performance in real-world applications, and a comprehensive examination of perturbation techniques and detector robustness is also absent. To bridge this gap, our work simulates real-world scenarios in both informal and professional writing, exploring the out-of-the-box performance of current detectors. Additionally, we have constructed 12 black-box text perturbation methods to assess the robustness of current detection models across various perturbation granularities. Furthermore, through adversarial learning experiments, we investigate the impact of perturbation data augmentation on the robustness of AI-text detectors.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Self-supervised monocular depth estimation aims to infer depth information without relying on labeled data. However, the lack of labeled information poses a significant challenge to the model's representation, limiting its ability to capture the intricate details of the scene accurately. Prior information can potentially mitigate this issue, enhancing the model's understanding of scene structure and texture. Nevertheless, solely relying on a single type of prior information often falls short when dealing with complex scenes, necessitating improvements in generalization performance. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel self-supervised monocular depth estimation model that leverages multiple priors to bolster representation capabilities across spatial, context, and semantic dimensions. Specifically, we employ a hybrid transformer and a lightweight pose network to obtain long-range spatial priors in the spatial dimension. Then, the context prior attention is designed to improve generalization, particularly in complex structures or untextured areas. In addition, semantic priors are introduced by leveraging semantic boundary loss, and semantic prior attention is supplemented, further refining the semantic features extracted by the decoder. Experiments on three diverse datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. It integrates multiple priors to comprehensively enhance the representation ability, improving the accuracy and reliability of depth estimation. Codes are available at: \url{this https URL}</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The progression of deep learning and the widespread adoption of sensors have facilitated automatic multi-view fusion (MVF) about the cardiovascular system (CVS) signals. However, prevalent MVF model architecture often amalgamates CVS signals from the same temporal step but different views into a unified representation, disregarding the asynchronous nature of cardiovascular events and the inherent heterogeneity across views, leading to catastrophic view confusion. Efficient training strategies specifically tailored for MVF models to attain comprehensive representations need simultaneous consideration. Crucially, real-world data frequently arrives with incomplete views, an aspect rarely noticed by researchers. Thus, the View-Centric Transformer (VCT) and Multitask Masked Autoencoder (M2AE) are specifically designed to emphasize the centrality of each view and harness unlabeled data to achieve superior fused representations. Additionally, we systematically define the missing-view problem for the first time and introduce prompt techniques to aid pretrained MVF models in flexibly adapting to various missing-view scenarios. Rigorous experiments involving atrial fibrillation detection, blood pressure estimation, and sleep staging-typical health monitoring tasks-demonstrate the remarkable advantage of our method in MVF compared to prevailing methodologies. Notably, the prompt technique requires finetuning less than 3% of the entire model's data, substantially fortifying the model's resilience to view missing while circumventing the need for complete retraining. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches, highlighting their potential for practical applications in cardiovascular health monitoring. Codes and models are released at URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present Piva (Preserving Identity with Variational Score Distillation), a novel optimization-based method for editing images and 3D models based on diffusion models. Specifically, our approach is inspired by the recently proposed method for 2D image editing - Delta Denoising Score (DDS). We pinpoint the limitations in DDS for 2D and 3D editing, which causes detail loss and over-saturation. To address this, we propose an additional score distillation term that enforces identity preservation. This results in a more stable editing process, gradually optimizing NeRF models to match target prompts while retaining crucial input characteristics. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in zero-shot image and neural field editing. Our method successfully alters visual attributes, adds both subtle and substantial structural elements, translates shapes, and achieves competitive results on standard 2D and 3D editing benchmarks. Additionally, our method imposes no constraints like masking or pre-training, making it compatible with a wide range of pre-trained diffusion models. This allows for versatile editing without needing neural field-to-mesh conversion, offering a more user-friendly experience.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Electronic healthcare records are vital for patient safety as they document conditions, plans, and procedures in both free text and medical codes. Language models have significantly enhanced the processing of such records, streamlining workflows and reducing manual data entry, thereby saving healthcare providers significant resources. However, the black-box nature of these models often leaves healthcare professionals hesitant to trust them. State-of-the-art explainability methods increase model transparency but rely on human-annotated evidence spans, which are costly. In this study, we propose an approach to produce plausible and faithful explanations without needing such annotations. We demonstrate on the automated medical coding task that adversarial robustness training improves explanation plausibility and introduce AttInGrad, a new explanation method superior to previous ones. By combining both contributions in a fully unsupervised setup, we produce explanations of comparable quality, or better, to that of a supervised approach. We release our code and model weights.</li>

Episodes like the January 6 United States Capitol attack and the Rohingya genocide exemplify how this phenomenon has been weaponized. While considerable attention has been paid to its impact on societal discourse and minority persecution, there remains a gap in analyzing its role as a malicious hybrid tool targeting critical infrastructures. This article addresses this gap by presenting three case studies: a hypothetical scenario involving the electric grid, an attack on traffic management, and XZ Utils backdoor. Additionally, the study undertakes a criminological analysis to comprehend the criminal profiles driving such attacks, while also assessing their implications from a human rights perspective.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The latest breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs), eg., ChatDev, have catalyzed profound transformations, particularly through multi-agent collaboration for software development. LLM agents can collaborate in teams like humans, and follow the waterfall model to sequentially work on requirements analysis, development, review, testing, and other phases to perform autonomous software generation. However, for an agent team, each phase in a single development process yields only one possible outcome. This results in the completion of only one development chain, thereby losing the opportunity to explore multiple potential decision paths within the solution space. Consequently, this may lead to obtaining suboptimal results. To address this challenge, we introduce Cross-Team Collaboration (CTC), a scalable multi-team framework that enables orchestrated teams to jointly propose various decisions and communicate with their insights in a cross-team collaboration environment for superior content generation. Experimental results in software development reveal a notable increase in quality compared to state-of-the-art baselines, underscoring the efficacy of our framework. The significant improvements in story generation demonstrate the promising generalization ability of our framework across various domains. We anticipate that our work will guide LLM agents towards a cross-team paradigm and contribute to their significant growth in but not limited to software development.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Graph Transformers (GTs) have recently emerged as popular alternatives to traditional message-passing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), due to their theoretically superior expressiveness and impressive performance reported on standard node classification benchmarks, often significantly outperforming GNNs. In this paper, we conduct a thorough empirical analysis to reevaluate the performance of three classic GNN models (GCN, GAT, and GraphSAGE) against GTs. Our findings suggest that the previously reported superiority of GTs may have been overstated due to suboptimal hyperparameter configurations in GNNs. Remarkably, with slight hyperparameter tuning, these classic GNN models achieve state-of-the-art performance, matching or even exceeding that of recent GTs across 17 out of the 18 diverse datasets examined. Additionally, we conduct detailed ablation studies to investigate the influence of various GNN configurations, such as normalization, dropout, residual connections, network depth, and jumping knowledge mode, on node classification performance. Our study aims to promote a higher standard of empirical rigor in the field of graph machine learning, encouraging more accurate comparisons and evaluations of model capabilities.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, security, protect, attack, biometric</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Despite being more secure and strongly promoted, two-factor (2FA) or multi-factor (MFA) schemes either fail to protect against recent phishing threats such as real-time MITM, controls/relay MITM, malicious browser extension-based phishing attacks, and/or need the users to purchase and carry other hardware for additional account protection. Leveraging the unprecedented popularity of NFC and BLE-enabled smartphones, we explore a new horizon for designing an MFA scheme. This paper introduces an advanced authentication method for user verification that utilizes the user's real-time facial biometric identity, which serves as an inherent factor, together with BLE- NFC-enabled mobile devices, which operate as an ownership factor. We have implemented a prototype authentication system on a BLE-NFC-enabled Android device, and initial threat modeling suggests that it is safe against known phishing attacks. The scheme has been compared with other popular schemes using the Bonneau et al. assessment framework in terms of usability, deployability, and security.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In recent years, insider threats and attacks have been increasing in terms of frequency and cost to the corporate business. The utilization of end-to-end encrypted instant messaging applications (WhatsApp, Telegram, VPN) by malicious insiders raised data breach incidents exponentially. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) investigated reports on such data leak incidents and reported about twelve companies where earnings data and financial information were leaked using WhatsApp messages. Recent surveys indicate that 60% of data breaches are primarily caused by malicious insider threats. Especially, in the case of the defense environment, information leaks by insiders will jeopardize the countrys national security. Sniffing of network and host-based activities will not work in an insider threat detection environment due to end-to-end encryption. Memory forensics allows access to the messages sent or received over an end-to-end encrypted environment but with a total compromise of the users privacy. In this research, we present a novel solution to detect data leakages by insiders in an organization. Our approach captures the RAM of the insiders device and analyses it for sensitive information leaks from a host system while maintaining the users privacy. Sensitive data leaks are identified with context using a deep learning model. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed idea have been demonstrated with the help of a military use case. The proposed architecture can however be used across various use cases with minor modifications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Topic modeling has been a widely used tool for unsupervised text analysis. However, comprehensive evaluations of a topic model remain challenging. Existing evaluation methods are either less comparable across different models (e.g., perplexity) or focus on only one specific aspect of a model (e.g., topic quality or document representation quality) at a time, which is insufficient to reflect the overall model performance. In this paper, we propose WALM (Words Agreement with Language Model), a new evaluation method for topic modeling that comprehensively considers the semantic quality of document representations and topics in a joint manner, leveraging the power of large language models (LLMs). With extensive experiments involving different types of topic models, WALM is shown to align with human judgment and can serve as a complementary evaluation method to the existing ones, bringing a new perspective to topic modeling. Our software package will be available at this https URL, which can be integrated with many widely used topic models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The Transformer model has shown leading performance in time series forecasting. Nevertheless, in some complex scenarios, it tends to learn low-frequency features in the data and overlook high-frequency features, showing a frequency bias. This bias prevents the model from accurately capturing important high-frequency data features. In this paper, we undertook empirical analyses to understand this bias and discovered that frequency bias results from the model disproportionately focusing on frequency features with higher energy. Based on our analysis, we formulate this bias and propose Fredformer, a Transformer-based framework designed to mitigate frequency bias by learning features equally across different frequency bands. This approach prevents the model from overlooking lower amplitude features important for accurate forecasting. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our proposed approach, which can outperform other baselines in different real-world time-series datasets. Furthermore, we introduce a lightweight variant of the Fredformer with an attention matrix approximation, which achieves comparable performance but with much fewer parameters and lower computation costs.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>State of the art large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on a variety of benchmark tasks and are increasingly used as components in larger applications, where LLM-based predictions serve as proxies for human judgements or decision. This raises questions about the human-likeness of LLM-derived information, alignment with human intuition, and whether LLMs could possibly be considered (parts of) explanatory models of (aspects of) human cognition or language use. To shed more light on these issues, we here investigate the human-likeness of LLMs' predictions for multiple-choice decision tasks from the perspective of Bayesian statistical modeling. Using human data from a forced-choice experiment on pragmatic language use, we find that LLMs do not capture the variance in the human data at the item-level. We suggest different ways of deriving full distributional predictions from LLMs for aggregate, condition-level data, and find that some, but not all ways of obtaining condition-level predictions yield adequate fits to human data. These results suggests that assessment of LLM performance depends strongly on seemingly subtle choices in methodology, and that LLMs are at best predictors of human behavior at the aggregate, condition-level, for which they are, however, not designed to, or usually used to, make predictions in the first place.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>There is a recent boom in the development of AI solutions to facilitate and enhance diagnostic procedures for established clinical tools. To assess the integrity of the developing nervous system, the Prechtl general movement assessment (GMA) is recognized for its clinical value in the diagnosis of neurological impairments in early infancy. GMA has been increasingly augmented through machine learning approaches intending to scale-up its application, circumvent costs in the training of human assessors and further standardize classification of spontaneous motor patterns. Available deep learning tools, all of which are based on single sensor modalities, are however still considerably inferior to that of well-trained human assessors. These approaches are hardly comparable as all models are designed, trained and evaluated on proprietary/ silo-data sets. We propose a sensor fusion approach for assessing fidgety movements (FMs) comparing three different sensor modalities (pressure, inertial, and visual sensors). Various combinations and two sensor fusion approaches (late and early fusion) for infant movement classification were tested to evaluate whether a multi-sensor system outperforms single modality assessments. The performance of the three-sensor fusion (classification accuracy of 94.5\%) was significantly higher than that of any single modality evaluated, suggesting the sensor fusion approach is a promising avenue for automated classification of infant motor patterns. The development of a robust sensor fusion system may significantly enhance AI-based early recognition of neurofunctions, ultimately facilitating early implementation of automated detection of neurodevelopmental conditions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Fused Magnesium Furnace (FMF) is a crucial industrial equipment in the production of magnesia, and anomaly detection plays a pivotal role in ensuring its efficient, stable, and secure operation. Existing anomaly detection methods primarily focus on analyzing dominant anomalies using the process variables (such as arc current) or constructing neural networks based on abnormal visual features, while overlooking the intrinsic correlation of cross-modal information. This paper proposes a cross-modal Transformer (dubbed FmFormer), designed to facilitate anomaly detection in fused magnesium smelting processes by exploring the correlation between visual features (video) and process variables (current). Our approach introduces a novel tokenization paradigm to effectively bridge the substantial dimensionality gap between the 3D video modality and the 1D current modality in a multiscale manner, enabling a hierarchical reconstruction of pixel-level anomaly detection. Subsequently, the FmFormer leverages self-attention to learn internal features within each modality and bidirectional cross-attention to capture correlations across modalities. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we also present a pioneering cross-modal benchmark of the fused magnesium smelting process, featuring synchronously acquired video and current data for over 2.2 million samples. Leveraging cross-modal learning, the proposed FmFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance in detecting anomalies, particularly under extreme interferences such as current fluctuations and visual occlusion caused by heavy water mist. The presented methodology and benchmark may be applicable to other industrial applications with some amendments. The benchmark will be released at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Digital watermarking techniques are crucial for copyright protection and source identification of images, especially in the era of generative AI models. However, many existing watermarking methods, particularly content-agnostic approaches that embed fixed patterns regardless of image content, are vulnerable to steganalysis attacks that can extract and remove the watermark with minimal perceptual distortion. In this work, we categorize watermarking algorithms into content-adaptive and content-agnostic ones, and demonstrate how averaging a collection of watermarked images could reveal the underlying watermark pattern. We then leverage this extracted pattern for effective watermark removal under both graybox and blackbox settings, even when the collection contains multiple watermark patterns. For some algorithms like Tree-Ring watermarks, the extracted pattern can also forge convincing watermarks on clean images. Our quantitative and qualitative evaluations across twelve watermarking methods highlight the threat posed by steganalysis to content-agnostic watermarks and the importance of designing watermarking techniques resilient to such analytical attacks. We propose security guidelines calling for using content-adaptive watermarking strategies and performing security evaluation against steganalysis. We also suggest multi-key assignments as potential mitigations against steganalysis vulnerabilities.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The utilization of the experience replay mechanism enables agents to effectively leverage their experiences on several occasions. In previous studies, the sampling probability of the transitions was modified based on their relative significance. The process of reassigning sample probabilities for every transition in the replay buffer after each iteration is considered extremely inefficient. Hence, in order to enhance computing efficiency, experience replay prioritization algorithms reassess the importance of a transition as it is sampled. However, the relative importance of the transitions undergoes dynamic adjustments when the agent's policy and value function are iteratively updated. Furthermore, experience replay is a mechanism that retains the transitions generated by the agent's past policies, which could potentially diverge significantly from the agent's most recent policy. An increased deviation from the agent's most recent policy results in a greater frequency of off-policy updates, which has a negative impact on the agent's performance. In this paper, we develop a novel algorithm, Corrected Uniform Experience Replay (CUER), which stochastically samples the stored experience while considering the fairness among all other experiences without ignoring the dynamic nature of the transition importance by making sampled state distribution more on-policy. CUER provides promising improvements for off-policy continuous control algorithms in terms of sample efficiency, final performance, and stability of the policy during the training.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Graph pooling has gained attention for its ability to obtain effective node and graph representations for various downstream tasks. Despite the recent surge in graph pooling approaches, there is a lack of standardized experimental settings and fair benchmarks to evaluate their performance. To address this issue, we have constructed a comprehensive benchmark that includes 15 graph pooling methods and 21 different graph datasets. This benchmark systematically assesses the performance of graph pooling methods in three dimensions, i.e., effectiveness, robustness, and generalizability. We first evaluate the performance of these graph pooling approaches across different tasks including graph classification, graph regression and node classification. Then, we investigate their performance under potential noise attacks and out-of-distribution shifts in real-world scenarios. We also involve detailed efficiency analysis and parameter analysis. Extensive experiments validate the strong capability and applicability of graph pooling approaches in various scenarios, which can provide valuable insights and guidance for deep geometric learning research.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Facial expressions, vital in non-verbal human communication, have found applications in various computer vision fields like virtual reality, gaming, and emotional AI assistants. Despite advancements, many facial expression generation models encounter challenges such as low resolution (e.g., 32x32 or 64x64 pixels), poor quality, and the absence of background details. In this paper, we introduce FacEnhance, a novel diffusion-based approach addressing constraints in existing low-resolution facial expression generation models. FacEnhance enhances low-resolution facial expression videos (64x64 pixels) to higher resolutions (192x192 pixels), incorporating background details and improving overall quality. Leveraging conditional denoising within a diffusion framework, guided by a background-free low-resolution video and a single neutral expression high-resolution image, FacEnhance generates a video incorporating the facial expression from the low-resolution video performed by the individual with background from the neutral image. By complementing lightweight low-resolution models, FacEnhance strikes a balance between computational efficiency and desirable image resolution and quality. Extensive experiments on the MUG facial expression database demonstrate the efficacy of FacEnhance in enhancing low-resolution model outputs to state-of-the-art quality while preserving content and identity consistency. FacEnhance represents significant progress towards resource-efficient, high-fidelity facial expression generation, Renewing outdated low-resolution methods to up-to-date standards.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The typical process for developing LLMs involves pre-training a general foundation model on massive data, followed by fine-tuning on task-specific data to create specialized experts. Serving these experts poses challenges, as loading all experts onto devices is impractical, and frequent switching between experts in response to user requests incurs substantial I/O costs, increasing latency and expenses. Previous approaches decompose expert weights into pre-trained model weights and residual delta weights, then quantize the delta weights to reduce model size. However, these methods often lead to significant quantization errors at extremely low bitwidths and assume the appropriate model for a user request is known in advance, which is not practical. To address these issues, we introduce ME-Switch, a memory-efficient expert switching framework for LLM serving. ME-Switch uses mixed-precision quantization, selectively quantizing non-salient input channels of delta weights to extremely low bits while keeping salient ones intact, significantly reducing storage demands while maintaining performance. Additionally, we develop a routing method that efficiently directs user queries to the most suitable expert by transforming the model selection problem into a domain classification problem. Extensive experiments show ME-Switch's promising memory efficiency and routing performance. For example, when serving three models from the Mistral-7B family, ME-Switch reduces model size by 1.74x while maintaining nearly lossless performance on instruction, mathematical reasoning, and code generation tasks. Furthermore, ME-Switch can efficiently serve 16 models from the Mistral-7B family on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Crosswords are a form of word puzzle that require a solver to demonstrate a high degree of proficiency in natural language understanding, wordplay, reasoning, and world knowledge, along with adherence to character and length constraints. In this paper we tackle the challenge of solving crosswords with Large Language Models (LLMs). We demonstrate that the current generation of state-of-the art (SoTA) language models show significant competence at deciphering cryptic crossword clues, and outperform previously reported SoTA results by a factor of 2-3 in relevant benchmarks. We also develop a search algorithm that builds off this performance to tackle the problem of solving full crossword grids with LLMs for the very first time, achieving an accuracy of 93\% on New York Times crossword puzzles. Contrary to previous work in this area which concluded that LLMs lag human expert performance significantly, our research suggests this gap is a lot narrower.</li>

However, the trainable model parameters optimized in an unguided subspace might have interference with the well-learned subspace of the pretrained weight matrix. In this paper, we propose MiLoRA, a simple yet effective LLM finetuning approach that only updates the minor singular components of the weight matrix while keeping the principle singular components frozen. It is observed that the minor matrix corresponds to the noisy or long-tail information, while the principle matrix contains important knowledge. The MiLoRA initializes the low-rank matrices within a subspace that is orthogonal to the principle matrix, thus the pretrained knowledge is expected to be well preserved. During finetuning, MiLoRA makes the most use of the less-optimized subspace for learning the finetuning dataset. Extensive experiments on commonsense reasoning, math reasoning and instruction following benchmarks present the superior performance of our method.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>data-free, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Continual learning is a challenging problem in machine learning, especially for image classification tasks with imbalanced datasets. It becomes even more challenging when it involves learning new classes incrementally. One method for incremental class learning, addressing dataset imbalance, is rehearsal using previously stored data. In rehearsal-based methods, access to previous data is required for either training the classifier or the generator, but it may not be feasible due to storage, legal, or data access constraints. Although there are many rehearsal-free alternatives for class incremental learning, such as parameter or loss regularization, knowledge distillation, and dynamic architectures, they do not consistently achieve good results, especially on imbalanced data. This paper proposes a new approach called Data-Free Generative Replay (DFGR) for class incremental learning, where the generator is trained without access to real data. In addition, DFGR also addresses dataset imbalance in continual learning of an image classifier. Instead of using training data, DFGR trains a generator using mean and variance statistics of batch-norm and feature maps derived from a pre-trained classification model. The results of our experiments demonstrate that DFGR performs significantly better than other data-free methods and reveal the performance impact of specific parameter settings. DFGR achieves up to 88.5% and 46.6% accuracy on MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets, respectively. Our code is available at this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has significantly enhanced text generation capabilities across various industries. However, these models' ability to generate human-like text poses substantial challenges in discerning between human and AI authorship. Despite the effectiveness of existing AI-generated text detectors, their development is hindered by the lack of comprehensive, publicly available benchmarks. Current benchmarks are limited to specific scenarios, such as question answering and text polishing, and predominantly focus on English texts, failing to capture the diverse applications and linguistic nuances of LLMs. To address these limitations, this paper constructs a comprehensive bilingual benchmark in both Chinese and English to evaluate mainstream AI-generated text detectors. We categorize LLM text generation into five distinct operations: Create, Update, Delete, Rewrite, and Translate (CUDRT), encompassing all current LLMs activities. We also establish a robust benchmark evaluation framework to support scalable and reproducible experiments. For each CUDRT category, we have developed extensive datasets to thoroughly assess detector performance. By employing the latest mainstream LLMs specific to each language, our datasets provide a thorough evaluation environment. Extensive experimental results offer critical insights for optimizing AI-generated text detectors and suggest future research directions to improve detection accuracy and generalizability across various scenarios.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Effectively learning from sequential data is a longstanding goal of Artificial Intelligence, especially in the case of long sequences. From the dawn of Machine Learning, several researchers engaged in the search of algorithms and architectures capable of processing sequences of patterns, retaining information about the past inputs while still leveraging the upcoming data, without losing precious long-term dependencies and correlations. While such an ultimate goal is inspired by the human hallmark of continuous real-time processing of sensory information, several solutions simplified the learning paradigm by artificially limiting the processed context or dealing with sequences of limited length, given in advance. These solutions were further emphasized by the large ubiquity of Transformers, that have initially shaded the role of Recurrent Neural Nets. However, recurrent networks are facing a strong recent revival due to the growing popularity of (deep) State-Space models and novel instances of large-context Transformers, which are both based on recurrent computations to go beyond several limits of currently ubiquitous technologies. In fact, the fast development of Large Language Models enhanced the interest in efficient solutions to process data over time. This survey provides an in-depth summary of the latest approaches that are based on recurrent models for sequential data processing. A complete taxonomy over the latest trends in architectural and algorithmic solutions is reported and discussed, guiding researchers in this appealing research field. The emerging picture suggests that there is room for thinking of novel routes, constituted by learning algorithms which depart from the standard Backpropagation Through Time, towards a more realistic scenario where patterns are effectively processed online, leveraging local-forward computations, opening to further research on this topic.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Forming and using symbol-like structured representations for reasoning has been considered essential for generalising over novel inputs. The primary tool that allows generalisation outside training data distribution is the ability to abstract away irrelevant information into a compact form relevant to the task. An extreme form of such abstract representations is symbols. Humans make use of symbols to bind information while abstracting away irrelevant parts to utilise the information consistently and meaningfully. This work estimates the state of such structured representations in vision encoders. Specifically, we evaluate image encoders in large vision-language pre-trained models to address the question of which desirable properties their representations lack by applying the criteria of symbolic structured reasoning described for LLMs to the image models. We test the representation space of image encoders like VIT, BLIP, CLIP, and FLAVA to characterise the distribution of the object representations in these models. In particular, we create decoding tasks using multi-object scenes from the COCO dataset, relating the token space to its input content for various objects in the scene. We use these tasks to characterise the network's token and layer-wise information modelling. Our analysis highlights that the CLS token, used for the downstream task, only focuses on a few objects necessary for the trained downstream task. Still, other individual objects are well-modelled separately by the tokens in the network originating from those objects. We further observed a widespread distribution of scene information. This demonstrates that information is far more entangled in tokens than optimal for representing objects similar to symbols. Given these symbolic properties, we show the network dynamics that cause failure modes of these models on basic downstream tasks in a multi-object scene.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is an emerging field with great promise for real-world applications. Unfortunately, the current state of research in offline MARL is plagued by inconsistencies in baselines and evaluation protocols, which ultimately makes it difficult to accurately assess progress, trust newly proposed innovations, and allow researchers to easily build upon prior work. In this paper, we firstly identify significant shortcomings in existing methodologies for measuring the performance of novel algorithms through a representative study of published offline MARL work. Secondly, by directly comparing to this prior work, we demonstrate that simple, well-implemented baselines can achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results across a wide range of tasks. Specifically, we show that on 35 out of 47 datasets used in prior work (almost 75% of cases), we match or surpass the performance of the current purported SOTA. Strikingly, our baselines often substantially outperform these more sophisticated algorithms. Finally, we correct for the shortcomings highlighted from this prior work by introducing a straightforward standardised methodology for evaluation and by providing our baseline implementations with statistically robust results across several scenarios, useful for comparisons in future work. Our proposal includes simple and sensible steps that are easy to adopt, which in combination with solid baselines and comparative results, could substantially improve the overall rigour of empirical science in offline MARL moving forward.</li>

Effects of predictor features in black-box supervised learning are an essential diagnostic tool for model debugging and scientific discovery in applied sciences. However, how vulnerable they are to data and model perturbations remains an open research question. We introduce several theoretical bounds for evaluating the robustness of partial dependence plots and accumulated local effects. Our experimental results with synthetic and real-world datasets quantify the gap between the best and worst-case scenarios of (mis)interpreting machine learning predictions globally.</li>

This paper introduces EquiPrompt, a novel method employing Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning to reduce biases in text-to-image generative models. EquiPrompt uses iterative bootstrapping and bias-aware exemplar selection to balance creativity and ethical responsibility. It integrates iterative reasoning refinement with controlled evaluation techniques, addressing zero-shot CoT issues in sensitive contexts. Experiments on several generation tasks show EquiPrompt effectively lowers bias while maintaining generative quality, advancing ethical AI and socially responsible creative processes.Code will be publically available.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Given the existence of various forward and inverse problems in combustion studies and applications that necessitate distinct methods for resolution, a framework to solve them in a unified way is critically needed. A promising approach is the integration of machine learning methods with governing equations of combustion systems, which exhibits superior generality and few-shot learning ability compared to purely data-driven methods. In this work, the FlamePINN-1D framework is proposed to solve the forward and inverse problems of 1D laminar flames based on physics-informed neural networks. Three cases with increasing complexity have been tested: Case 1 are freely-propagating premixed (FPP) flames with simplified physical models, while Case 2 and Case 3 are FPP and counterflow premixed (CFP) flames with detailed models, respectively. For forward problems, FlamePINN-1D aims to solve the flame fields and infer the unknown eigenvalues (such as laminar flame speeds) under the constraints of governing equations and boundary conditions. For inverse problems, FlamePINN-1D aims to reconstruct the continuous fields and infer the unknown parameters (such as transport and chemical kinetics parameters) from noisy sparse observations of the flame. Our results strongly validate these capabilities of FlamePINN-1D across various flames and working conditions. Compared to traditional methods, FlamePINN-1D is differentiable and mesh-free, exhibits no discretization errors, and is easier to implement for inverse problems. The inverse problem results also indicate the possibility of optimizing chemical mechanisms from measurements of laboratory 1D flames. Furthermore, some proposed strategies, such as hard constraints and thin-layer normalization, are proven to be essential for the robust learning of FlamePINN-1D.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Temporal reasoning is fundamental for large language models (LLMs) to comprehend the world. Current temporal reasoning datasets are limited to questions about single or isolated events, falling short in mirroring the realistic temporal characteristics involving concurrent nature and intricate temporal interconnections. In this paper, we introduce CoTempQA, a comprehensive co-temporal Question Answering (QA) benchmark containing four co-temporal scenarios (Equal, Overlap, During, Mix) with 4,748 samples for evaluating the co-temporal comprehension and reasoning abilities of LLMs. Our extensive experiments reveal a significant gap between the performance of current LLMs and human-level reasoning on CoTempQA tasks. Even when enhanced with Chain of Thought (CoT) methodologies, models consistently struggle with our task. In our preliminary exploration, we discovered that mathematical reasoning plays a significant role in handling co-temporal events and proposed a strategy to boost LLMs' co-temporal reasoning from a mathematical perspective. We hope that our CoTempQA datasets will encourage further advancements in improving the co-temporal reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Our code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present the findings of the first NeurIPS competition on unlearning, which sought to stimulate the development of novel algorithms and initiate discussions on formal and robust evaluation methodologies. The competition was highly successful: nearly 1,200 teams from across the world participated, and a wealth of novel, imaginative solutions with different characteristics were contributed. In this paper, we analyze top solutions and delve into discussions on benchmarking unlearning, which itself is a research problem. The evaluation methodology we developed for the competition measures forgetting quality according to a formal notion of unlearning, while incorporating model utility for a holistic evaluation. We analyze the effectiveness of different instantiations of this evaluation framework vis-a-vis the associated compute cost, and discuss implications for standardizing evaluation. We find that the ranking of leading methods remains stable under several variations of this framework, pointing to avenues for reducing the cost of evaluation. Overall, our findings indicate progress in unlearning, with top-performing competition entries surpassing existing algorithms under our evaluation framework. We analyze trade-offs made by different algorithms and strengths or weaknesses in terms of generalizability to new datasets, paving the way for advancing both benchmarking and algorithm development in this important area.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) can learn optimal policies from pre-collected offline datasets without interacting with the environment, but the sampled actions of the agent cannot often cover the action distribution under a given state, resulting in the extrapolation error issue. Recent works address this issue by employing generative adversarial networks (GANs). However, these methods often suffer from insufficient constraints on policy exploration and inaccurate representation of behavior policies. Moreover, the generator in GANs fails in fooling the discriminator while maximizing the expected returns of a policy. Inspired by the diffusion, a generative model with powerful feature expressiveness, we propose a new offline RL method named Diffusion Policies with Generative Adversarial Networks (DiffPoGAN). In this approach, the diffusion serves as the policy generator to generate diverse distributions of actions, and a regularization method based on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is developed to generate data that approximate the distribution of behavior policies. Besides, we introduce an additional regularization term based on the discriminator output to effectively constrain policy exploration for policy improvement. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on the datasets for deep data-driven reinforcement learning (D4RL), and experimental results show that DiffPoGAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in offline RL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The burgeoning utilization of Large Language Models (LLMs) in scientific research necessitates advanced benchmarks capable of evaluating their understanding and application of scientific knowledge comprehensively. To address this need, we introduce the SciKnowEval benchmark, a novel framework that systematically evaluates LLMs across five progressive levels of scientific knowledge: studying extensively, inquiring earnestly, thinking profoundly, discerning clearly, and practicing assiduously. These levels aim to assess the breadth and depth of scientific knowledge in LLMs, including knowledge coverage, inquiry and exploration capabilities, reflection and reasoning abilities, ethic and safety considerations, as well as practice proficiency. Specifically, we take biology and chemistry as the two instances of SciKnowEval and construct a dataset encompassing 50K multi-level scientific problems and solutions. By leveraging this dataset, we benchmark 20 leading open-source and proprietary LLMs using zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies. The results reveal that despite achieving state-of-the-art performance, the proprietary LLMs still have considerable room for improvement, particularly in addressing scientific computations and applications. We anticipate that SciKnowEval will establish a comprehensive standard for benchmarking LLMs in science research and discovery, and promote the development of LLMs that integrate scientific knowledge with strong safety awareness.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper describes our submission to the MEDIQA-CORR 2024 shared task for automatically detecting and correcting medical errors in clinical notes. We report results for three methods of few-shot In-Context Learning (ICL) augmented with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and reason prompts using a large language model (LLM). In the first method, we manually analyse a subset of train and validation dataset to infer three CoT prompts by examining error types in the clinical notes. In the second method, we utilise the training dataset to prompt the LLM to deduce reasons about their correctness or incorrectness. The constructed CoTs and reasons are then augmented with ICL examples to solve the tasks of error detection, span identification, and error correction. Finally, we combine the two methods using a rule-based ensemble method. Across the three sub-tasks, our ensemble method achieves a ranking of 3rd for both sub-task 1 and 2, while securing 7th place in sub-task 3 among all submissions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Despite the recent advancements in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), understanding inter-object relations, i.e., interactions or associations between distinct objects, remains a major challenge for such models. This issue significantly hinders their advanced reasoning capabilities and is primarily due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality, and diverse multi-modal data essential for training and evaluating MLLMs. In this paper, we provide a taxonomy of inter-object relations and introduce Multi-Modal Relation Understanding (MMRel), a comprehensive dataset designed to bridge this gap by providing large-scale, high-quality and diverse data for studying inter-object relations with MLLMs. MMRel features three distinctive attributes: (i) It includes over 15K question-answer pairs, which are sourced from three distinct domains, ensuring large scale and high diversity; (ii) It contains a subset featuring highly unusual relations, on which MLLMs often fail due to hallucinations, thus are very challenging; (iii) It provides manually verified high-quality labels for inter-object relations. Thanks to these features, MMRel is ideal for evaluating MLLMs on relation understanding, as well as being used to fine-tune MLLMs to enhance relation understanding and even benefit overall performance in various vision-language tasks. Extensive experiments on various popular MLLMs validate the effectiveness of MMRel. Both MMRel dataset and the complete labeling scripts have been made publicly available.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>protect, extraction, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The growing impact of climate change on coastal areas, particularly active but fragile regions, necessitates collaboration among diverse stakeholders and disciplines to formulate effective environmental protection policies. We introduce a novel specialized corpus comprising 2,491 sentences from 410 scientific abstracts concerning coastal areas, for the Automatic Term Extraction (ATE) and Classification (ATC) tasks. Inspired by the ARDI framework, focused on the identification of Actors, Resources, Dynamics and Interactions, we automatically extract domain terms and their distinct roles in the functioning of coastal systems by leveraging monolingual and multilingual transformer models. The evaluation demonstrates consistent results, achieving an F1 score of approximately 80\% for automated term extraction and F1 of 70\% for extracting terms and their labels. These findings are promising and signify an initial step towards the development of a specialized Knowledge Base dedicated to coastal areas.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>One-class learning (OCL) comprises a set of techniques applied when real-world problems have a single class of interest. The usual procedure for OCL is learning a hypersphere that comprises instances of this class and, ideally, repels unseen instances from any other classes. Besides, several OCL algorithms for graphs have been proposed since graph representation learning has succeeded in various fields. These methods may use a two-step strategy, initially representing the graph and, in a second step, classifying its nodes. On the other hand, end-to-end methods learn the node representations while classifying the nodes in one learning process. We highlight three main gaps in the literature on OCL for graphs: (i) non-customized representations for OCL; (ii) the lack of constraints on hypersphere parameters learning; and (iii) the methods' lack of interpretability and visualization. We propose One-cLass Graph Autoencoder (OLGA). OLGA is end-to-end and learns the representations for the graph nodes while encapsulating the interest instances by combining two loss functions. We propose a new hypersphere loss function to encapsulate the interest instances. OLGA combines this new hypersphere loss with the graph autoencoder reconstruction loss to improve model learning. OLGA achieved state-of-the-art results and outperformed six other methods with a statistically significant difference from five methods. Moreover, OLGA learns low-dimensional representations maintaining the classification performance with an interpretable model representation learning and results.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The recent development of chain-of-thought (CoT) decoding has enabled large language models (LLMs) to generate explicit logical reasoning paths for complex problem-solving. However, research indicates that these paths are not always deliberate and optimal. The tree-of-thought (ToT) method employs tree-searching to extensively explore the reasoning space and find better reasoning paths that CoT decoding might overlook. This deliberation, however, comes at the cost of significantly increased inference complexity. In this work, we demonstrate that fine-tuning LLMs leveraging the search tree constructed by ToT allows CoT to achieve similar or better performance, thereby avoiding the substantial inference burden. This is achieved through Chain of Preference Optimization (CPO), where LLMs are fine-tuned to align each step of the CoT reasoning paths with those of ToT using the inherent preference information in the tree-search process. Extensive experimental results show that CPO significantly improves LLM performance in solving a variety of complex problems, including question answering, fact verification, and arithmetic reasoning, demonstrating its effectiveness.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional proficiency across a broad spectrum of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, including Machine Translation. However, previous methods predominantly relied on iterative processes such as instruction fine-tuning or continual pre-training, leaving unexplored the challenges of training LLMs solely on parallel data. In this work, we introduce PLUME (Parallel Language Model), a collection of three 2B LLMs featuring varying vocabulary sizes (32k, 128k, and 256k) trained exclusively on Catalan-centric parallel examples. These models perform comparably to previous encoder-decoder architectures on 16 supervised translation directions and 56 zero-shot ones. Utilizing this set of models, we conduct a thorough investigation into the translation capabilities of LLMs, probing their performance, the impact of the different elements of the prompt, and their cross-lingual representation space.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, privacy, attack, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated Learning (FL) enables model training across decentralized devices by communicating solely local model updates to an aggregation server. Although such limited data sharing makes FL more secure than centralized approached, FL remains vulnerable to inference attacks during model update transmissions. Existing secure aggregation approaches rely on differential privacy or cryptographic schemes like Functional Encryption (FE) to safeguard individual client data. However, such strategies can reduce performance or introduce unacceptable computational and communication overheads on clients running on edge devices with limited resources. In this work, we present EncCluster, a novel method that integrates model compression through weight clustering with recent decentralized FE and privacy-enhancing data encoding using probabilistic filters to deliver strong privacy guarantees in FL without affecting model performance or adding unnecessary burdens to clients. We performed a comprehensive evaluation, spanning various datasets and architectures, to demonstrate EncCluster's scalability across encryption levels. Our findings reveal that EncCluster significantly reduces communication costs - below even conventional FedAvg - and accelerates encryption by more than four times over all baselines; at the same time, it maintains high model accuracy and enhanced privacy assurances.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, revolutionizing the integration of AI in daily life applications. However, they are prone to hallucinations, generating claims that contradict established facts, deviating from prompts, and producing inconsistent responses when the same prompt is presented multiple times. Addressing these issues is challenging due to the lack of comprehensive and easily assessable benchmark datasets. Most existing datasets are small and rely on multiple-choice questions, which are inadequate for evaluating the generative prowess of LLMs. To measure hallucination in LLMs, this paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark dataset comprising over 75,000 prompts across eight domains. These prompts are designed to elicit definitive, concise, and informative answers. The dataset is divided into two segments: one publicly available for testing and assessing LLM performance and a hidden segment for benchmarking various LLMs. In our experiments, we tested six LLMs-GPT-3.5, LLama 2, LLama 3, Gemini, Mixtral, and Zephyr-revealing that overall factual hallucination ranges from 59% to 82% on the public dataset and 57% to 76% in the hidden benchmark. Prompt misalignment hallucination ranges from 6% to 95% in the public dataset and 17% to 94% in the hidden counterpart. Average consistency ranges from 21% to 61% and 22% to 63%, respectively. Domain-wise analysis shows that LLM performance significantly deteriorates when asked for specific numeric information while performing moderately with person, location, and date queries. Our dataset demonstrates its efficacy and serves as a comprehensive benchmark for LLM performance evaluation.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advancements in image generation have enabled the creation of high-quality images from text conditions. However, when facing multi-modal conditions, such as text combined with reference appearances, existing methods struggle to balance multiple conditions effectively, typically showing a preference for one modality over others. To address this challenge, we introduce EMMA, a novel image generation model accepting multi-modal prompts built upon the state-of-the-art text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model, ELLA. EMMA seamlessly incorporates additional modalities alongside text to guide image generation through an innovative Multi-modal Feature Connector design, which effectively integrates textual and supplementary modal information using a special attention mechanism. By freezing all parameters in the original T2I diffusion model and only adjusting some additional layers, we reveal an interesting finding that the pre-trained T2I diffusion model can secretly accept multi-modal prompts. This interesting property facilitates easy adaptation to different existing frameworks, making EMMA a flexible and effective tool for producing personalized and context-aware images and even videos. Additionally, we introduce a strategy to assemble learned EMMA modules to produce images conditioned on multiple modalities simultaneously, eliminating the need for additional training with mixed multi-modal prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of EMMA in maintaining high fidelity and detail in generated images, showcasing its potential as a robust solution for advanced multi-modal conditional image generation tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, explainability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Fine-grained domain generalization (FGDG) is a more challenging task due to its small inter-class variations and relatively large intra-class disparities. When domain distribution changes, the fragility of subtle features leads to a pronounced deterioration in model performance.Nevertheless, humans inherently demonstrate the capacity for generalizing to out-of-distribution data, leveraging structured multi-granularity knowledge that emerges from discerning both the commonality and specificity within categories.Likewise, we propose a Feature Structuralized Domain Generalization (FSDG) model, wherein features experience structuralization into common, specific, and confounding segments, harmoniously aligned with their relevant semantic concepts, to elevate performance in FGDG. Specifically, feature structuralization (FS) is achieved through a decorrelation function on disentangled segments, constraints on common feature consistency, specific feature distinctiveness, and a prediction calibration operation across granularities. By imposing these stipulations, FSDG is prompted to disentangle and align features based on multi-granularity knowledge, facilitating robust subtle distinctions among categories. Extensive experimentation on three benchmarks consistently validates the superiority of FSDG over state-of-the-art counterparts, with an average improvement of 6.1% in terms of FGDG performance. Beyond that, the explainability analysis and experiments on various mainstream model architectures confirm the validity of FS.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) have showcased remarkable reasoning capabilities, yet they remain susceptible to errors, particularly in temporal reasoning tasks involving complex temporal logic. Existing research has explored LLM performance on temporal reasoning using diverse datasets and benchmarks. However, these studies often rely on real-world data that LLMs may have encountered during pre-training or employ anonymization techniques that can inadvertently introduce factual inconsistencies. In this work, we address these limitations by introducing novel synthetic datasets specifically designed to assess LLM temporal reasoning abilities in various scenarios. The diversity of question types across these datasets enables systematic investigation into the impact of the problem structure, size, question type, fact order, and other factors on LLM performance. Our findings provide valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of current LLMs in temporal reasoning tasks.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, protect, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Adversarial attacks by malicious actors on machine learning systems, such as introducing poison triggers into training datasets, pose significant risks. The challenge in resolving such an attack arises in practice when only a subset of the poisoned data can be identified. This necessitates the development of methods to remove, i.e. unlearn, poison triggers from already trained models with only a subset of the poison data available. The requirements for this task significantly deviate from privacy-focused unlearning where all of the data to be forgotten by the model is known. Previous work has shown that the undiscovered poisoned samples lead to a failure of established unlearning methods, with only one method, Selective Synaptic Dampening (SSD), showing limited success. Even full retraining, after the removal of the identified poison, cannot address this challenge as the undiscovered poison samples lead to a reintroduction of the poison trigger in the model. Our work addresses two key challenges to advance the state of the art in poison unlearning. First, we introduce a novel outlier-resistant method, based on SSD, that significantly improves model protection and unlearning performance. Second, we introduce Poison Trigger Neutralisation (PTN) search, a fast, parallelisable, hyperparameter search that utilises the characteristic "unlearning versus model protection" trade-off to find suitable hyperparameters in settings where the forget set size is unknown and the retain set is contaminated. We benchmark our contributions using ResNet-9 on CIFAR10 and WideResNet-28x10 on CIFAR100. Experimental results show that our method heals 93.72% of poison compared to SSD with 83.41% and full retraining with 40.68%. We achieve this while also lowering the average model accuracy drop caused by unlearning from 5.68% (SSD) to 1.41% (ours).</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The compelling goal of eradicating undesirable data behaviors, while preserving usual model functioning, underscores the significance of machine unlearning within the domain of large language models (LLMs). Recent research has begun to approach LLM unlearning via gradient ascent (GA) -- increasing the prediction risk for those training strings targeted to be unlearned, thereby erasing their parameterized responses. Despite their simplicity and efficiency, we suggest that GA-based methods face the propensity towards excessive unlearning, resulting in various undesirable model behaviors, such as catastrophic forgetting, that diminish their practical utility. In this paper, we suggest a set of metrics that can capture multiple facets of real-world utility and propose several controlling methods that can regulate the extent of excessive unlearning. Accordingly, we suggest a general framework to better reflect the practical efficacy of various unlearning methods -- we begin by controlling the unlearning procedures/unlearned models such that no excessive unlearning occurs and follow by the evaluation for unlearning efficacy. Our experimental analysis on established benchmarks revealed that GA-based methods are far from perfect in practice, as strong unlearning is at the high cost of hindering the model utility. We conclude that there is still a long way towards practical and effective LLM unlearning, and more efforts are required in this field.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Network intrusion detection is one of the most important issues in the field of cyber security, and various machine learning techniques have been applied to build intrusion detection systems. However, since the number of features to describe the network connections is often large, where some features are redundant or noisy, feature selection is necessary in such scenarios, which can both improve the efficiency and accuracy. Recently, some researchers focus on using multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) to select features. But usually, they only consider the number of features and classification accuracy as the objectives, resulting in unsatisfactory performance on a critical metric, detection rate. This will lead to the missing of many real attacks and bring huge losses to the network system. In this paper, we propose DR-MOFS to model the feature selection problem in network intrusion detection as a three-objective optimization problem, where the number of features, accuracy and detection rate are optimized simultaneously, and use MOEAs to solve it. Experiments on two popular network intrusion detection datasets NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15 show that in most cases the proposed method can outperform previous methods, i.e., lead to fewer features, higher accuracy and detection rate.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the rapid development of AI-generated content (AIGC) technology, the production of realistic fake facial images and videos that deceive human visual perception has become possible. Consequently, various face forgery detection techniques have been proposed to identify such fake facial content. However, evaluating the effectiveness and generalizability of these detection techniques remains a significant challenge. To address this, we have constructed a large-scale evaluation benchmark called DeepFaceGen, aimed at quantitatively assessing the effectiveness of face forgery detection and facilitating the iterative development of forgery detection technology. DeepFaceGen consists of 776,990 real face image/video samples and 773,812 face forgery image/video samples, generated using 34 mainstream face generation techniques. During the construction process, we carefully consider important factors such as content diversity, fairness across ethnicities, and availability of comprehensive labels, in order to ensure the versatility and convenience of DeepFaceGen. Subsequently, DeepFaceGen is employed in this study to evaluate and analyze the performance of 13 mainstream face forgery detection techniques from various perspectives. Through extensive experimental analysis, we derive significant findings and propose potential directions for future research.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has catalyzed the deployment of LLM-powered agents across numerous applications, raising new concerns regarding their safety and trustworthiness. Existing methods for enhancing the safety of LLMs are not directly transferable to LLM-powered agents due to their diverse objectives and output modalities. In this paper, we propose GuardAgent, the first LLM agent as a guardrail to other LLM agents. Specifically, GuardAgent oversees a target LLM agent by checking whether its inputs/outputs satisfy a set of given guard requests defined by the users. GuardAgent comprises two steps: 1) creating a task plan by analyzing the provided guard requests, and 2) generating guardrail code based on the task plan and executing the code by calling APIs or using external engines. In both steps, an LLM is utilized as the core reasoning component, supplemented by in-context demonstrations retrieved from a memory module. Such knowledge-enabled reasoning allows GuardAgent to understand various textual guard requests and accurately "translate" them into executable code that provides reliable guardrails. Furthermore, GuardAgent is equipped with an extendable toolbox containing functions and APIs and requires no additional LLM training, which underscores its generalization capabilities and low operational overhead. Additionally, we propose two novel benchmarks: an EICU-AC benchmark for assessing privacy-related access control for healthcare agents and a Mind2Web-SC benchmark for safety evaluation for web agents. We show the effectiveness of GuardAgent on these two benchmarks with 98.7% and 90.0% accuracy in moderating invalid inputs and outputs for the two types of agents, respectively. We also show that GuardAgent is able to define novel functions in adaption to emergent LLM agents and guard requests, which underscores its strong generalization capabilities.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Object-centric learning (OCL) extracts the representation of objects with slots, offering an exceptional blend of flexibility and interpretability for abstracting low-level perceptual features. A widely adopted method within OCL is slot attention, which utilizes attention mechanisms to iteratively refine slot representations. However, a major drawback of most object-centric models, including slot attention, is their reliance on predefining the number of slots. This not only necessitates prior knowledge of the dataset but also overlooks the inherent variability in the number of objects present in each instance. To overcome this fundamental limitation, we present a novel complexity-aware object auto-encoder framework. Within this framework, we introduce an adaptive slot attention (AdaSlot) mechanism that dynamically determines the optimal number of slots based on the content of the data. This is achieved by proposing a discrete slot sampling module that is responsible for selecting an appropriate number of slots from a candidate list. Furthermore, we introduce a masked slot decoder that suppresses unselected slots during the decoding process. Our framework, tested extensively on object discovery tasks with various datasets, shows performance matching or exceeding top fixed-slot models. Moreover, our analysis substantiates that our method exhibits the capability to dynamically adapt the slot number according to each instance's complexity, offering the potential for further exploration in slot attention research.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Content generation conditioning on users's readability is an important application for personalization. In an era of large language models (LLMs), readability-controlled text generation based on LLMs has become increasingly important. This paper introduces a novel methodology called "Readability-Controlled Instruction Learning (ReadCtrl)," which aims to instruction-tune LLMs to tailor users' readability levels. Unlike the traditional methods, which primarily focused on categorical readability adjustments typically classified as high, medium, and low or expert and layperson levels with limited success, ReadCtrl introduces a dynamic framework that enables LLMs to generate content at various (near continuous level) complexity levels, thereby enhancing their versatility across different applications. Our results show that the ReadCtrl-Mistral-7B models significantly outperformed strong baseline models such as GPT-4 and Claude-3, with a win rate of 52.1%:35.7% against GPT-4 in human evaluations. Furthermore, Read-Ctrl has shown significant improvements in automatic evaluations, as evidenced by better readability metrics (e.g., FOG, FKGL) and generation quality metrics (e.g., BLEU, SARI, SummaC-Factuality, UniEval-Consistency and Coherence). These results underscore Read-Ctrl's effectiveness and tenacity in producing high-quality, contextually appropriate outputs that closely align with targeted readability levels, marking a significant advancement in personalized content generation using LLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce a new wildlife re-identification dataset WildlifeReID-10k with more than 214k images of 10k individual animals. It is a collection of 30 existing wildlife re-identification datasets with additional processing steps. WildlifeReID-10k contains animals as diverse as marine turtles, primates, birds, African herbivores, marine mammals and domestic animals. Due to the ubiquity of similar images in datasets, we argue that the standard (random) splits into training and testing sets are inadequate for wildlife re-identification and propose a new similarity-aware split based on the similarity of extracted features. To promote fair method comparison, we include similarity-aware splits both for closed-set and open-set settings, use MegaDescriptor - a foundational model for wildlife re-identification - for baseline performance and host a leaderboard with the best results. We publicly publish the dataset and the codes used to create it in the wildlife-datasets library, making WildlifeReID-10k both highly curated and easy to use.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Post-training quantization (PTQ) efficiently compresses vision models, but unfortunately, it accompanies a certain degree of accuracy degradation. Reconstruction methods aim to enhance model performance by narrowing the gap between the quantized model and the full-precision model, often yielding promising results. However, efforts to significantly improve the performance of PTQ through reconstruction in the Vision Transformer (ViT) have shown limited efficacy. In this paper, we conduct a thorough analysis of the reasons for this limited effectiveness and propose MGRQ (Mixed Granularity Reconstruction Quantization) as a solution to address this issue. Unlike previous reconstruction schemes, MGRQ introduces a mixed granularity reconstruction approach. Specifically, MGRQ enhances the performance of PTQ by introducing Extra-Block Global Supervision and Intra-Block Local Supervision, building upon Optimized Block-wise Reconstruction. Extra-Block Global Supervision considers the relationship between block outputs and the model's output, aiding block-wise reconstruction through global supervision. Meanwhile, Intra-Block Local Supervision reduces generalization errors by aligning the distribution of outputs at each layer within a block. Subsequently, MGRQ is further optimized for reconstruction through Mixed Granularity Loss Fusion. Extensive experiments conducted on various ViT models illustrate the effectiveness of MGRQ. Notably, MGRQ demonstrates robust performance in low-bit quantization, thereby enhancing the practicality of the quantized model.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are becoming increasingly vulnerable to adversarial attacks as various novel attack strategies are being proposed against these models. While existing defenses excel in unimodal contexts, they currently fall short in safeguarding VLMs against adversarial threats. To mitigate this vulnerability, we propose a novel, yet elegantly simple approach for detecting adversarial samples in VLMs. Our method leverages Text-to-Image (T2I) models to generate images based on captions produced by target VLMs. Subsequently, we calculate the similarities of the embeddings of both input and generated images in the feature space to identify adversarial samples. Empirical evaluations conducted on different datasets validate the efficacy of our approach, outperforming baseline methods adapted from image classification domains. Furthermore, we extend our methodology to classification tasks, showcasing its adaptability and model-agnostic nature. Theoretical analyses and empirical findings also show the resilience of our approach against adaptive attacks, positioning it as an excellent defense mechanism for real-world deployment against adversarial threats.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper introduces a deep transformer network for estimating the relative 6D pose of a Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) with respect to a ship using monocular images. A synthetic dataset of ship images is created and annotated with 2D keypoints of multiple ship parts. A Transformer Neural Network model is trained to detect these keypoints and estimate the 6D pose of each part. The estimates are integrated using Bayesian fusion. The model is tested on synthetic data and in-situ flight experiments, demonstrating robustness and accuracy in various lighting conditions. The position estimation error is approximately 0.8\% and 1.0\% of the distance to the ship for the synthetic data and the flight experiments, respectively. The method has potential applications for ship-based autonomous UAV landing and navigation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multilingual large language models (LLMs) have greatly increased the ceiling of performance on non-English tasks. However the mechanisms behind multilingualism in these LLMs are poorly understood. Of particular interest is the degree to which internal representations are shared between languages. Recent work on neuron analysis of LLMs has focused on the monolingual case, and the limited work on the multilingual case has not considered the interaction between tasks and linguistic representations. In our work, we investigate how neuron activation is shared across languages by categorizing neurons into four distinct groups according to their responses across different languages for a particular input: all-shared, partial-shared, specific, and non-activated. This categorization is combined with a study of neuron attribution, i.e. the importance of a neuron w.r.t an output. Our analysis reveals the following insights: (i) the linguistic sharing patterns are strongly affected by the type of task, but neuron behaviour changes across different inputs even for the same task; (ii) all-shared neurons play a key role in generating correct responses; (iii) boosting multilingual alignment by increasing all-shared neurons can enhance accuracy on multilingual tasks.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The Open Whisper-style Speech Model (OWSM) series was introduced to achieve full transparency in building advanced speech-to-text (S2T) foundation models. To this end, OWSM models are trained on 25 public speech datasets, which are heterogeneous in multiple ways. In this study, we advance the OWSM series by introducing OWSM v3.2, which improves on prior models by investigating and addressing the impacts of this data heterogeneity. Our study begins with a detailed analysis of each dataset, from which we derive two key strategies: data filtering with proxy task to enhance data quality, and the incorporation of punctuation and true-casing using an open large language model (LLM). With all other configurations staying the same, OWSM v3.2 improves performance over the OWSM v3.1 baseline while using 15% less training data.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Extreme Multi-label Learning (XMC) is a task that allocates the most relevant labels for an instance from a predefined label set. Extreme Zero-shot XMC (EZ-XMC) is a special setting of XMC wherein no supervision is provided; only the instances (raw text of the document) and the predetermined label set are given. The scenario is designed to address cold-start problems in categorization and recommendation. Traditional state-of-the-art methods extract pseudo labels from the document title or segments. These labels from the document are used to train a zero-shot bi-encoder model. The main issue with these generated labels is their misalignment with the tagging task. In this work, we propose a framework to train a small bi-encoder model via the feedback from the large language model (LLM), the bi-encoder model encodes the document and labels into embeddings for retrieval. Our approach leverages the zero-shot ability of LLM to assess the correlation between labels and the document instead of using the low-quality labels extracted from the document itself. Our method also guarantees fast inference without the involvement of LLM. The performance of our approach outperforms the SOTA methods on various datasets while retaining a similar training time for large datasets.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Conversational Large Language Models are trained to refuse to answer harmful questions. However, emergent jailbreaking techniques can still elicit unsafe outputs, presenting an ongoing challenge for model alignment. To better understand how different jailbreak types circumvent safeguards, this paper analyses model activations on different jailbreak inputs. We find that it is possible to extract a jailbreak vector from a single class of jailbreaks that works to mitigate jailbreak effectiveness from other classes. This may indicate that different kinds of effective jailbreaks operate via similar internal mechanisms. We investigate a potential common mechanism of harmfulness feature suppression, and provide evidence for its existence by looking at the harmfulness vector component. These findings offer actionable insights for developing more robust jailbreak countermeasures and lay the groundwork for a deeper, mechanistic understanding of jailbreak dynamics in language models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We address the problem of multi-object 3D pose control in image diffusion models. Instead of conditioning on a sequence of text tokens, we propose to use a set of per-object representations, Neural Assets, to control the 3D pose of individual objects in a scene. Neural Assets are obtained by pooling visual representations of objects from a reference image, such as a frame in a video, and are trained to reconstruct the respective objects in a different image, e.g., a later frame in the video. Importantly, we encode object visuals from the reference image while conditioning on object poses from the target frame. This enables learning disentangled appearance and pose features. Combining visual and 3D pose representations in a sequence-of-tokens format allows us to keep the text-to-image architecture of existing models, with Neural Assets in place of text tokens. By fine-tuning a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model with this information, our approach enables fine-grained 3D pose and placement control of individual objects in a scene. We further demonstrate that Neural Assets can be transferred and recomposed across different scenes. Our model achieves state-of-the-art multi-object editing results on both synthetic 3D scene datasets, as well as two real-world video datasets (Objectron, Waymo Open).</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce StableMaterials, a novel approach for generating photorealistic physical-based rendering (PBR) materials that integrate semi-supervised learning with Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs). Our method employs adversarial training to distill knowledge from existing large-scale image generation models, minimizing the reliance on annotated data and enhancing the diversity in generation. This distillation approach aligns the distribution of the generated materials with that of image textures from an SDXL model, enabling the generation of novel materials that are not present in the initial training dataset. Furthermore, we employ a diffusion-based refiner model to improve the visual quality of the samples and achieve high-resolution generation. Finally, we distill a latent consistency model for fast generation in just four steps and propose a new tileability technique that removes visual artifacts typically associated with fewer diffusion steps. We detail the architecture and training process of StableMaterials, the integration of semi-supervised training within existing LDM frameworks and show the advantages of our approach. Comparative evaluations with state-of-the-art methods show the effectiveness of StableMaterials, highlighting its potential applications in computer graphics and beyond.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Self-Supervised learning (SSL) with Joint-Embedding Architectures (JEA) has led to outstanding performances. All instantiations of this paradigm were trained using strong and well-established hand-crafted data augmentations, leading to the general belief that they are required for the proper training and performance of such models. On the other hand, generative reconstruction-based models such as BEIT and MAE or Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures such as I-JEPA have shown strong performance without using data augmentations except masking. In this work, we challenge the importance of invariance and data-augmentation in JEAs at scale. By running a case-study on a recent SSL foundation model - DINOv2 - we show that strong image representations can be obtained with JEAs and only cropping without resizing provided the training data is large enough, reaching state-of-the-art results and using the least amount of augmentation in the literature. Through this study, we also discuss the impact of compute constraints on the outcomes of experimental deep learning research, showing that they can lead to very different conclusions.</li>

We introduce Multi-Layer Key-Value (MLKV) sharing, a novel approach extending KV sharing across transformer layers to reduce memory usage beyond what was possible with Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA). Evaluations on various NLP benchmarks and inference metrics using uptrained Pythia-160M variants demonstrate that MLKV significantly reduces memory usage with minimal performance loss, reducing KV cache size down to a factor of 6x compared to MQA. These results highlight MLKV's potential for efficient deployment of transformer models at scale. We provide code at this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In subject-driven text-to-image generation, recent works have achieved superior performance by training the model on synthetic datasets containing numerous image pairs. Trained on these datasets, generative models can produce text-aligned images for specific subject from arbitrary testing image in a zero-shot manner. They even outperform methods which require additional fine-tuning on testing images. However, the cost of creating such datasets is prohibitive for most researchers. To generate a single training pair, current methods fine-tune a pre-trained text-to-image model on the subject image to capture fine-grained details, then use the fine-tuned model to create images for the same subject based on creative text prompts. Consequently, constructing a large-scale dataset with millions of subjects can require hundreds of thousands of GPU hours. To tackle this problem, we propose Toffee, an efficient method to construct datasets for subject-driven editing and generation. Specifically, our dataset construction does not need any subject-level fine-tuning. After pre-training two generative models, we are able to generate infinite number of high-quality samples. We construct the first large-scale dataset for subject-driven image editing and generation, which contains 5 million image pairs, text prompts, and masks. Our dataset is 5 times the size of previous largest dataset, yet our cost is tens of thousands of GPU hours lower. To test the proposed dataset, we also propose a model which is capable of both subject-driven image editing and generation.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>OBJECTIVE: Ensuring that machine learning (ML) algorithms are safe and effective within all patient groups, and do not disadvantage particular patients, is essential to clinical decision making and preventing the reinforcement of existing healthcare inequities. The objective of this tutorial is to introduce the medical informatics community to the common notions of fairness within ML, focusing on clinical applications and implementation in practice. TARGET AUDIENCE: As gaps in fairness arise in a variety of healthcare applications, this tutorial is designed to provide an understanding of fairness, without assuming prior knowledge, to researchers and clinicians who make use of modern clinical data. SCOPE: We describe the fundamental concepts and methods used to define fairness in ML, including an overview of why models in healthcare may be unfair, a summary and comparison of the metrics used to quantify fairness, and a discussion of some ongoing research. We illustrate some of the fairness methods introduced through a case study of mortality prediction in a publicly available electronic health record dataset. Finally, we provide a user-friendly R package for comprehensive group fairness evaluation, enabling researchers and clinicians to assess fairness in their own ML work.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Transformers have revolutionized machine learning with their simple yet effective architecture. Pre-training Transformers on massive text datasets from the Internet has led to unmatched generalization for natural language understanding (NLU) tasks. However, such language models remain fragile when tasked with algorithmic forms of reasoning, where computations must be precise and robust. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach that combines the Transformer's language understanding with the robustness of graph neural network (GNN)-based neural algorithmic reasoners (NARs). Such NARs proved effective as generic solvers for algorithmic tasks, when specified in graph form. To make their embeddings accessible to a Transformer, we propose a hybrid architecture with a two-phase training procedure, allowing the tokens in the language model to cross-attend to the node embeddings from the NAR. We evaluate our resulting TransNAR model on CLRS-Text, the text-based version of the CLRS-30 benchmark, and demonstrate significant gains over Transformer-only models for algorithmic reasoning, both in and out of distribution.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>defense, attack, fair, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Jailbreak attacks aim to induce Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate harmful responses for forbidden instructions, presenting severe misuse threats to LLMs. Up to now, research into jailbreak attacks and defenses is emerging, however, there is (surprisingly) no consensus on how to evaluate whether a jailbreak attempt is successful. In other words, the methods to assess the harmfulness of an LLM's response are varied, such as manual annotation or prompting GPT-4 in specific ways. Each approach has its own set of strengths and weaknesses, impacting their alignment with human values, as well as the time and financial cost. This diversity in evaluation presents challenges for researchers in choosing suitable evaluation methods and conducting fair comparisons across different jailbreak attacks and defenses. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of jailbreak evaluation methodologies, drawing from nearly ninety jailbreak research released between May 2023 and April 2024. Our study introduces a systematic taxonomy of jailbreak evaluators, offering in-depth insights into their strengths and weaknesses, along with the current status of their adaptation. Moreover, to facilitate subsequent research, we propose JailbreakEval, a user-friendly toolkit focusing on the evaluation of jailbreak attempts. It includes various well-known evaluators out-of-the-box, so that users can obtain evaluation results with only a single command. JailbreakEval also allows users to customize their own evaluation workflow in a unified framework with the ease of development and comparison. In summary, we regard JailbreakEval to be a catalyst that simplifies the evaluation process in jailbreak research and fosters an inclusive standard for jailbreak evaluation within the community.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in executing complex tasks in a zero-shot manner, they are susceptible to jailbreak attacks and can be manipulated to produce harmful outputs. Recently, a growing body of research has categorized jailbreak attacks into token-level and prompt-level attacks. However, previous work primarily overlooks the diverse key factors of jailbreak attacks, with most studies concentrating on LLM vulnerabilities and lacking exploration of defense-enhanced LLMs. To address these issues, we evaluate the impact of various attack settings on LLM performance and provide a baseline benchmark for jailbreak attacks, encouraging the adoption of a standardized evaluation framework. Specifically, we evaluate the eight key factors of implementing jailbreak attacks on LLMs from both target-level and attack-level perspectives. We further conduct seven representative jailbreak attacks on six defense methods across two widely used datasets, encompassing approximately 320 experiments with about 50,000 GPU hours on A800-80G. Our experimental results highlight the need for standardized benchmarking to evaluate these attacks on defense-enhanced LLMs. Our code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) risk inadvertently memorizing and divulging sensitive or personally identifiable information (PII) seen in training data, causing privacy concerns. Current approaches to address this issue involve costly dataset scrubbing, or model filtering through unlearning and model editing, which can be bypassed through extraction attacks. We propose REVS, a novel model editing method for unlearning sensitive information from LLMs. REVS identifies and modifies a small subset of neurons relevant for each piece of sensitive information. By projecting these neurons to the vocabulary space (unembedding), we pinpoint the components driving its generation. We then compute a model edit based on the pseudo-inverse of the unembedding matrix, and apply it to de-promote generation of the targeted sensitive data. To adequately evaluate our method on truly sensitive information, we curate two datasets: an email dataset inherently memorized by GPT-J, and a synthetic social security number dataset that we tune the model to memorize. Compared to other state-of-the-art model editing methods, REVS demonstrates superior performance in both eliminating sensitive information and robustness to extraction attacks, while retaining integrity of the underlying model.

          Is Value Learning Really the Main Bottleneck in Offline RL?(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While imitation learning requires access to high-quality data, offline reinforcement learning (RL) should, in principle, perform similarly or better with substantially lower data quality by using a value function. However, current results indicate that offline RL often performs worse than imitation learning, and it is often unclear what holds back the performance of offline RL. Motivated by this observation, we aim to understand the bottlenecks in current offline RL algorithms. While poor performance of offline RL is typically attributed to an imperfect value function, we ask: is the main bottleneck of offline RL indeed in learning the value function, or something else? To answer this question, we perform a systematic empirical study of (1) value learning, (2) policy extraction, and (3) policy generalization in offline RL problems, analyzing how these components affect performance. We make two surprising observations. First, we find that the choice of a policy extraction algorithm significantly affects the performance and scalability of offline RL, often more so than the value learning objective. For instance, we show that common value-weighted behavioral cloning objectives (e.g., AWR) do not fully leverage the learned value function, and switching to behavior-constrained policy gradient objectives (e.g., DDPG+BC) often leads to substantial improvements in performance and scalability. Second, we find that a big barrier to improving offline RL performance is often imperfect policy generalization on test-time states out of the support of the training data, rather than policy learning on in-distribution states. We then show that the use of suboptimal but high-coverage data or test-time policy training techniques can address this generalization issue in practice. Specifically, we propose two simple test-time policy improvement methods and show that these methods lead to better performance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Entity matching is the task of linking records from different sources that refer to the same real-world entity. Past work has primarily treated entity linking as a standard supervised learning problem. However, supervised entity matching models often do not generalize well to new data, and collecting exhaustive labeled training data is often cost prohibitive. Further, recent efforts have adopted LLMs for this task in few/zero-shot settings, exploiting their general knowledge. But LLMs are prohibitively expensive for performing inference at scale for real-world entity matching tasks. As an efficient alternative, we re-cast entity matching as a conditional generation task as opposed to binary classification. This enables us to "distill" LLM reasoning into smaller entity matching models via natural language explanations. This approach achieves strong performance, especially on out-of-domain generalization tests (10.85% F-1) where standalone generative methods struggle. We perform ablations that highlight the importance of explanations, both for performance and model robustness.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The integration of pre-trained text-based large language models (LLM) with speech input has enabled instruction-following capabilities for diverse speech tasks. This integration requires the use of a speech encoder, a speech adapter, and an LLM, trained on diverse tasks. We propose the use of discrete speech units (DSU), rather than continuous-valued speech encoder outputs, that are converted to the LLM token embedding space using the speech adapter. We generate DSU using a self-supervised speech encoder followed by k-means clustering. The proposed model shows robust performance on speech inputs from seen/unseen domains and instruction-following capability in spoken question answering. We also explore various types of DSU extracted from different layers of the self-supervised speech encoder, as well as Mel frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC). Our findings suggest that the ASR task and datasets are not crucial in instruction-tuning for spoken question answering tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this study, we present ScoreFormer, a novel graph transformer model designed to accurately predict molecular docking scores, thereby optimizing high-throughput virtual screening (HTVS) in drug discovery. The architecture integrates Principal Neighborhood Aggregation (PNA) and Learnable Random Walk Positional Encodings (LRWPE), enhancing the model's ability to understand complex molecular structures and their relationship with their respective docking scores. This approach significantly surpasses traditional HTVS methods and recent Graph Neural Network (GNN) models in both recovery and efficiency due to a wider coverage of the chemical space and enhanced performance. Our results demonstrate that ScoreFormer achieves competitive performance in docking score prediction and offers a substantial 1.65-fold reduction in inference time compared to existing models. We evaluated ScoreFormer across multiple datasets under various conditions, confirming its robustness and reliability in identifying potential drug candidates rapidly.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Transformer architectures have been widely adopted in foundation models. Due to their high inference costs, there is renewed interest in exploring the potential of efficient recurrent architectures (RNNs). In this paper, we analyze the differences in the representational capabilities of Transformers and RNNs across several tasks of practical relevance, including index lookup, nearest neighbor, recognizing bounded Dyck languages, and string equality. For the tasks considered, our results show separations based on the size of the model required for different architectures. For example, we show that a one-layer Transformer of logarithmic width can perform index lookup, whereas an RNN requires a hidden state of linear size. Conversely, while constant-size RNNs can recognize bounded Dyck languages, we show that one-layer Transformers require a linear size for this task. Furthermore, we show that two-layer Transformers of logarithmic size can perform decision tasks such as string equality or disjointness, whereas both one-layer Transformers and recurrent models require linear size for these tasks. We also show that a log-size two-layer Transformer can implement the nearest neighbor algorithm in its forward pass; on the other hand recurrent models require linear size. Our constructions are based on the existence of $N$ nearly orthogonal vectors in $O(\log N)$ dimensional space and our lower bounds are based on reductions from communication complexity problems. We supplement our theoretical results with experiments that highlight the differences in the performance of these architectures on practical-size sequences.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models have demonstrated effectiveness in generating natural images and have been extended to generate diverse data types, including graphs. This new generation of diffusion-based graph generative models has demonstrated significant performance improvements over methods that rely on variational autoencoders or generative adversarial networks. It's important to recognize, however, that most of these models employ Gaussian or categorical diffusion processes, which can struggle with sparse and long-tailed data distributions. In our work, we introduce Graph Beta Diffusion (GBD), a diffusion-based generative model particularly adept at capturing diverse graph structures. GBD utilizes a beta diffusion process, tailored for the sparse and range-bounded characteristics of graph adjacency matrices. Furthermore, we have developed a modulation technique that enhances the realism of the generated graphs by stabilizing the generation of critical graph structures, while preserving flexibility elsewhere. The outstanding performance of GBD across three general graph benchmarks and two biochemical graph benchmarks highlights its capability to effectively capture the complexities of real-world graph data.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Colloquially speaking, image generation models based upon diffusion processes are frequently said to exhibit "hallucinations," samples that could never occur in the training data. But where do such hallucinations come from? In this paper, we study a particular failure mode in diffusion models, which we term mode interpolation. Specifically, we find that diffusion models smoothly "interpolate" between nearby data modes in the training set, to generate samples that are completely outside the support of the original training distribution; this phenomenon leads diffusion models to generate artifacts that never existed in real data (i.e., hallucinations). We systematically study the reasons for, and the manifestation of this phenomenon. Through experiments on 1D and 2D Gaussians, we show how a discontinuous loss landscape in the diffusion model's decoder leads to a region where any smooth approximation will cause such hallucinations. Through experiments on artificial datasets with various shapes, we show how hallucination leads to the generation of combinations of shapes that never existed. Finally, we show that diffusion models in fact know when they go out of support and hallucinate. This is captured by the high variance in the trajectory of the generated sample towards the final few backward sampling process. Using a simple metric to capture this variance, we can remove over 95% of hallucinations at generation time while retaining 96% of in-support samples. We conclude our exploration by showing the implications of such hallucination (and its removal) on the collapse (and stabilization) of recursive training on synthetic data with experiments on MNIST and 2D Gaussians dataset.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Video understanding is a crucial next step for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). To probe specific aspects of video understanding ability, existing video benchmarks typically require careful video selection based on the target capability, along with laborious annotation of query-response pairs to match the specific video content. This process is both challenging and resource-intensive. In this paper, we propose VideoNIAH (Video Needle In A Haystack), a benchmark construction framework through synthetic video generation. VideoNIAH decouples test video content from their query-responses by inserting unrelated image/text 'needles' into original videos. It generates annotations solely from these needles, ensuring diversity in video sources and a variety of query-responses. Additionally, by inserting multiple needles, VideoNIAH rigorously evaluates the temporal understanding capabilities of models. We utilized VideoNIAH to compile a video benchmark VNBench, including tasks such as retrieval, ordering, and counting. VNBench can efficiently evaluate the fine-grained understanding ability and spatio-temporal modeling ability of a video model, while also supporting the long-context evaluation. Additionally, we evaluated recent video-centric multimodal large language models (MLLMs), both open-source and proprietary, providing a comprehensive analysis. We found that although proprietary models have significant advantages over open-source models, all existing video models still perform poorly on long-distance dependency tasks. VideoNIAH is a simple yet highly scalable benchmark construction framework, and we believe it will inspire future video benchmark works. The code and data are available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Advanced image editing techniques, particularly inpainting, are essential for seamlessly removing unwanted elements while preserving visual integrity. Traditional GAN-based methods have achieved notable success, but recent advancements in diffusion models have produced superior results due to their training on large-scale datasets, enabling the generation of remarkably realistic inpainted images. Despite their strengths, diffusion models often struggle with object removal tasks without explicit guidance, leading to unintended hallucinations of the removed object. To address this issue, we introduce CLIPAway, a novel approach leveraging CLIP embeddings to focus on background regions while excluding foreground elements. CLIPAway enhances inpainting accuracy and quality by identifying embeddings that prioritize the background, thus achieving seamless object removal. Unlike other methods that rely on specialized training datasets or costly manual annotations, CLIPAway provides a flexible, plug-and-play solution compatible with various diffusion-based inpainting techniques.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Learning 3D head priors from large 2D image collections is an important step towards high-quality 3D-aware human modeling. A core requirement is an efficient architecture that scales well to large-scale datasets and large image resolutions. Unfortunately, existing 3D GANs struggle to scale to generate samples at high resolutions due to their relatively slow train and render speeds, and typically have to rely on 2D superresolution networks at the expense of global 3D consistency. To address these challenges, we propose Generative Gaussian Heads (GGHead), which adopts the recent 3D Gaussian Splatting representation within a 3D GAN framework. To generate a 3D representation, we employ a powerful 2D CNN generator to predict Gaussian attributes in the UV space of a template head mesh. This way, GGHead exploits the regularity of the template's UV layout, substantially facilitating the challenging task of predicting an unstructured set of 3D Gaussians. We further improve the geometric fidelity of the generated 3D representations with a novel total variation loss on rendered UV coordinates. Intuitively, this regularization encourages that neighboring rendered pixels should stem from neighboring Gaussians in the template's UV space. Taken together, our pipeline can efficiently generate 3D heads trained only from single-view 2D image observations. Our proposed framework matches the quality of existing 3D head GANs on FFHQ while being both substantially faster and fully 3D consistent. As a result, we demonstrate real-time generation and rendering of high-quality 3D-consistent heads at $1024^2$ resolution for the first time.</li>

          SimGen: Simulator-conditioned Driving Scene Generation(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Controllable synthetic data generation can substantially lower the annotation cost of training data in autonomous driving research and development. Prior works use diffusion models to generate driving images conditioned on the 3D object layout. However, those models are trained on small-scale datasets like nuScenes, which lack appearance and layout diversity. Moreover, the trained models can only generate images based on the real-world layout data from the validation set of the same dataset, where overfitting might happen. In this work, we introduce a simulator-conditioned scene generation framework called SimGen that can learn to generate diverse driving scenes by mixing data from the simulator and the real world. It uses a novel cascade diffusion pipeline to address challenging sim-to-real gaps and multi-condition conflicts. A driving video dataset DIVA is collected to enhance the generative diversity of SimGen, which contains over 147.5 hours of real-world driving videos from 73 locations worldwide and simulated driving data from the MetaDrive simulator. SimGen achieves superior generation quality and diversity while preserving controllability based on the text prompt and the layout pulled from a simulator. We further demonstrate the improvements brought by SimGen for synthetic data augmentation on the BEV detection and segmentation task and showcase its capability in safety-critical data generation. Code, data, and models will be made available.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Machine learning models often incorporate vast amounts of data, raising significant privacy concerns. Machine unlearning, the ability to remove the influence of specific data points from a trained model, addresses these concerns. This paper explores practical methods for implementing machine unlearning, focusing on a first-epoch gradient-ascent approach. Key findings include: 1. Single vs. Multi-Epoch Unlearning: First-epoch gradient unlearning is more effective than multi-epoch gradients. 2. Layer-Based Unlearning: The embedding layer in GPT-2 is crucial for effective unlearning. Gradients from the output layers (11 and 12) have no impact. Efficient unlearning can be achieved using only the embedding layer, halving space complexity. 3. Influence Functions & Scoring: Techniques like Hessian Vector Product and the dot product of activations and tensors are used for quantifying unlearning. 4. Gradient Ascent Considerations: Calibration is necessary to avoid overexposing the model to specific data points during unlearning, which could prematurely terminate the process. 5. Fuzzy Matching vs. Iterative Unlearning: Fuzzy matching techniques shift the model to a new optimum, while iterative unlearning provides a more complete modality. Our empirical evaluation confirms that first-epoch gradient ascent for machine unlearning is more effective than whole-model gradient ascent. These results highlight the potential of machine unlearning for enhancing data privacy and compliance with regulations such as GDPR and CCPA. The study underscores the importance of formal methods to comprehensively evaluate the unlearning process.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present WonderWorld, a novel framework for \emph{interactive} 3D scene extrapolation that enables users to explore and shape virtual environments based on a single input image and user-specified text. While significant improvements have been made to the visual quality of scene generation, existing methods are run offline, taking tens of minutes to hours to generate a scene. By leveraging Fast Gaussian Surfels and a guided diffusion-based depth estimation method, WonderWorld generates geometrically consistent extrapolation while significantly reducing computational time. Our framework generates connected and diverse 3D scenes in less than 10 seconds on a single A6000 GPU, enabling real-time user interaction and exploration. We demonstrate the potential of WonderWorld for applications in virtual reality, gaming, and creative design, where users can quickly generate and navigate immersive, potentially infinite virtual worlds from a single image. Our approach represents a significant advancement in interactive 3D scene generation, opening up new possibilities for user-driven content creation and exploration in virtual environments. We will release full code and software for reproducibility. Project website: this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Long-form videos that span across wide temporal intervals are highly information redundant and contain multiple distinct events or entities that are often loosely-related. Therefore, when performing long-form video question answering (LVQA),all information necessary to generate a correct response can often be contained within a small subset of frames. Recent literature explore the use of large language models (LLMs) in LVQA benchmarks, achieving exceptional performance, while relying on vision language models (VLMs) to convert all visual content within videos into natural language. Such VLMs often independently caption a large number of frames uniformly sampled from long videos, which is not efficient and can mostly be redundant. Questioning these decision choices, we explore optimal strategies for key-frame selection and sequence-aware captioning, that can significantly reduce these redundancies. We propose two novel approaches that improve each of aspects, namely Hierarchical Keyframe Selector and Sequential Visual LLM. Our resulting framework termed LVNet achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark LVQA datasets. Our code will be released publicly.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Modern vision models are trained on very large noisy datasets. While these models acquire strong capabilities, they may not follow the user's intent to output the desired results in certain aspects, e.g., visual aesthetic, preferred style, and responsibility. In this paper, we target the realm of visual aesthetics and aim to align vision models with human aesthetic standards in a retrieval system. Advanced retrieval systems usually adopt a cascade of aesthetic models as re-rankers or filters, which are limited to low-level features like saturation and perform poorly when stylistic, cultural or knowledge contexts are involved. We find that utilizing the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) to rephrase the search query and extend the aesthetic expectations can make up for this shortcoming. Based on the above findings, we propose a preference-based reinforcement learning method that fine-tunes the vision models to distill the knowledge from both LLMs reasoning and the aesthetic models to better align the vision models with human aesthetics. Meanwhile, with rare benchmarks designed for evaluating retrieval systems, we leverage large multi-modality model (LMM) to evaluate the aesthetic performance with their strong abilities. As aesthetic assessment is one of the most subjective tasks, to validate the robustness of LMM, we further propose a novel dataset named HPIR to benchmark the alignment with human aesthetics. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the aesthetic behaviors of the vision models, under several metrics. We believe the proposed algorithm can be a general practice for aligning vision models with human values.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent improvements in generative AI made synthesizing fake images easy; as they can be used to cause harm, it is crucial to develop accurate techniques to identify them. This paper introduces "Locally Aware Deepfake Detection Algorithm" (LaDeDa), that accepts a single 9x9 image patch and outputs its deepfake score. The image deepfake score is the pooled score of its patches. With merely patch-level information, LaDeDa significantly improves over the state-of-the-art, achieving around 99% mAP on current benchmarks. Owing to the patch-level structure of LaDeDa, we hypothesize that the generation artifacts can be detected by a simple model. We therefore distill LaDeDa into Tiny-LaDeDa, a highly efficient model consisting of only 4 convolutional layers. Remarkably, Tiny-LaDeDa has 375x fewer FLOPs and is 10,000x more parameter-efficient than LaDeDa, allowing it to run efficiently on edge devices with a minor decrease in accuracy. These almost-perfect scores raise the question: is the task of deepfake detection close to being solved? Perhaps surprisingly, our investigation reveals that current training protocols prevent methods from generalizing to real-world deepfakes extracted from social media. To address this issue, we introduce WildRF, a new deepfake detection dataset curated from several popular social networks. Our method achieves the top performance of 93.7% mAP on WildRF, however the large gap from perfect accuracy shows that reliable real-world deepfake detection is still unsolved.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, transformer, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Tokenizer, serving as a translator to map the intricate visual data into a compact latent space, lies at the core of visual generative models. Based on the finding that existing tokenizers are tailored to image or video inputs, this paper presents OmniTokenizer, a transformer-based tokenizer for joint image and video tokenization. OmniTokenizer is designed with a spatial-temporal decoupled architecture, which integrates window and causal attention for spatial and temporal modeling. To exploit the complementary nature of image and video data, we further propose a progressive training strategy, where OmniTokenizer is first trained on image data on a fixed resolution to develop the spatial encoding capacity and then jointly trained on image and video data on multiple resolutions to learn the temporal dynamics. OmniTokenizer, for the first time, handles both image and video inputs within a unified framework and proves the possibility of realizing their synergy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniTokenizer achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) reconstruction performance on various image and video datasets, e.g., 1.11 reconstruction FID on ImageNet and 42 reconstruction FVD on UCF-101, beating the previous SOTA methods by 13% and 26%, respectively. Additionally, we also show that when integrated with OmniTokenizer, both language model-based approaches and diffusion models can realize advanced visual synthesis performance, underscoring the superiority and versatility of our method.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper proposes Instruct 4D-to-4D that achieves 4D awareness and spatial-temporal consistency for 2D diffusion models to generate high-quality instruction-guided dynamic scene editing results. Traditional applications of 2D diffusion models in dynamic scene editing often result in inconsistency, primarily due to their inherent frame-by-frame editing methodology. Addressing the complexities of extending instruction-guided editing to 4D, our key insight is to treat a 4D scene as a pseudo-3D scene, decoupled into two sub-problems: achieving temporal consistency in video editing and applying these edits to the pseudo-3D scene. Following this, we first enhance the Instruct-Pix2Pix (IP2P) model with an anchor-aware attention module for batch processing and consistent editing. Additionally, we integrate optical flow-guided appearance propagation in a sliding window fashion for more precise frame-to-frame editing and incorporate depth-based projection to manage the extensive data of pseudo-3D scenes, followed by iterative editing to achieve convergence. We extensively evaluate our approach in various scenes and editing instructions, and demonstrate that it achieves spatially and temporally consistent editing results, with significantly enhanced detail and sharpness over the prior art. Notably, Instruct 4D-to-4D is general and applicable to both monocular and challenging multi-camera scenes. Code and more results are available at this http URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Humans draw to facilitate reasoning: we draw auxiliary lines when solving geometry problems; we mark and circle when reasoning on maps; we use sketches to amplify our ideas and relieve our limited-capacity working memory. However, such actions are missing in current multimodal language models (LMs). Current chain-of-thought and tool-use paradigms only use text as intermediate reasoning steps. In this work, we introduce Sketchpad, a framework that gives multimodal LMs a visual sketchpad and tools to draw on the sketchpad. The LM conducts planning and reasoning according to the visual artifacts it has drawn. Different from prior work, which uses text-to-image models to enable LMs to draw, Sketchpad enables LMs to draw with lines, boxes, marks, etc., which is closer to human sketching and better facilitates reasoning. Sketchpad can also use specialist vision models during the sketching process (e.g., draw bounding boxes with object detection models, draw masks with segmentation models), to further enhance visual perception and reasoning. We experiment with a wide range of math tasks (including geometry, functions, graphs, and chess) and complex visual reasoning tasks. Sketchpad substantially improves performance on all tasks over strong base models with no sketching, yielding an average gain of 12.7% on math tasks, and 8.6% on vision tasks. GPT-4o with Sketchpad sets a new state of the art on all tasks, including V*Bench (80.3%), BLINK spatial reasoning (83.9%), and visual correspondence (80.8%).

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper proposes ConsistDreamer - a novel framework that lifts 2D diffusion models with 3D awareness and 3D consistency, thus enabling high-fidelity instruction-guided scene editing. To overcome the fundamental limitation of missing 3D consistency in 2D diffusion models, our key insight is to introduce three synergetic strategies that augment the input of the 2D diffusion model to become 3D-aware and to explicitly enforce 3D consistency during the training process. Specifically, we design surrounding views as context-rich input for the 2D diffusion model, and generate 3D-consistent, structured noise instead of image-independent noise. Moreover, we introduce self-supervised consistency-enforcing training within the per-scene editing procedure. Extensive evaluation shows that our ConsistDreamer achieves state-of-the-art performance for instruction-guided scene editing across various scenes and editing instructions, particularly in complicated large-scale indoor scenes from ScanNet++, with significantly improved sharpness and fine-grained textures. Notably, ConsistDreamer stands as the first work capable of successfully editing complex (e.g., plaid/checkered) patterns. Our project page is at this http URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>It is common in deep learning to warm up the learning rate $\eta$, often by a linear schedule between $\eta_{\text{init}} = 0$ and a predetermined target $\eta_{\text{trgt}}$. In this paper, we show through systematic experiments using SGD and Adam that the overwhelming benefit of warmup arises from allowing the network to tolerate larger $\eta_{\text{trgt}}$ by forcing the network to more well-conditioned areas of the loss landscape. The ability to handle larger $\eta_{\text{trgt}}$ makes hyperparameter tuning more robust while improving the final performance. We uncover different regimes of operation during the warmup period, depending on whether training starts off in a progressive sharpening or sharpness reduction phase, which in turn depends on the initialization and parameterization. Using these insights, we show how $\eta_{\text{init}}$ can be properly chosen by utilizing the loss catapult mechanism, which saves on the number of warmup steps, in some cases completely eliminating the need for warmup. We also suggest an initialization for the variance in Adam which provides benefits similar to warmup.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Current multimodal and multitask foundation models like 4M or UnifiedIO show promising results, but in practice their out-of-the-box abilities to accept diverse inputs and perform diverse tasks are limited by the (usually rather small) number of modalities and tasks they are trained on. In this paper, we expand upon the capabilities of them by training a single model on tens of highly diverse modalities and by performing co-training on large-scale multimodal datasets and text corpora. This includes training on several semantic and geometric modalities, feature maps from recent state of the art models like DINOv2 and ImageBind, pseudo labels of specialist models like SAM and 4DHumans, and a range of new modalities that allow for novel ways to interact with the model and steer the generation, for example image metadata or color palettes. A crucial step in this process is performing discrete tokenization on various modalities, whether they are image-like, neural network feature maps, vectors, structured data like instance segmentation or human poses, or data that can be represented as text. Through this, we expand on the out-of-the-box capabilities of multimodal models and specifically show the possibility of training one model to solve at least 3x more tasks/modalities than existing ones and doing so without a loss in performance. This enables more fine-grained and controllable multimodal generation capabilities and allows us to study the distillation of models trained on diverse data and objectives into a unified model. We successfully scale the training to a three billion parameter model using tens of modalities and different datasets. The resulting models and training code are open sourced at this http URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vision State Space Models (VSSMs), a novel architecture that combines the strengths of recurrent neural networks and latent variable models, have demonstrated remarkable performance in visual perception tasks by efficiently capturing long-range dependencies and modeling complex visual dynamics. However, their robustness under natural and adversarial perturbations remains a critical concern. In this work, we present a comprehensive evaluation of VSSMs' robustness under various perturbation scenarios, including occlusions, image structure, common corruptions, and adversarial attacks, and compare their performance to well-established architectures such as transformers and Convolutional Neural Networks. Furthermore, we investigate the resilience of VSSMs to object-background compositional changes on sophisticated benchmarks designed to test model performance in complex visual scenes. We also assess their robustness on object detection and segmentation tasks using corrupted datasets that mimic real-world scenarios. To gain a deeper understanding of VSSMs' adversarial robustness, we conduct a frequency analysis of adversarial attacks, evaluating their performance against low-frequency and high-frequency perturbations. Our findings highlight the strengths and limitations of VSSMs in handling complex visual corruptions, offering valuable insights for future research and improvements in this promising field.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce MuirBench, a comprehensive benchmark that focuses on robust multi-image understanding capabilities of multimodal LLMs. MuirBench consists of 12 diverse multi-image tasks (e.g., scene understanding, ordering) that involve 10 categories of multi-image relations (e.g., multiview, temporal relations). Comprising 11,264 images and 2,600 multiple-choice questions, MuirBench is created in a pairwise manner, where each standard instance is paired with an unanswerable variant that has minimal semantic differences, in order for a reliable assessment. Evaluated upon 20 recent multi-modal LLMs, our results reveal that even the best-performing models like GPT-4o and Gemini Pro find it challenging to solve MuirBench, achieving 68.0% and 49.3% in accuracy. Open-source multimodal LLMs trained on single images can hardly generalize to multi-image questions, hovering below 33.3% in accuracy. These results highlight the importance of MuirBench in encouraging the community to develop multimodal LLMs that can look beyond a single image, suggesting potential pathways for future improvements.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose to build omni-modal intelligence, which is capable of understanding any modality and learning universal representations. In specific, we propose a scalable pretraining paradigm, named Multimodal Context (MiCo), which can scale up the numbers of modalities and amount of data, together with the model parameters, in the pretraining process. With MiCo, the pretrained models show significant emergent abilities in multimodal learning, which are evaluated on the following tasks: i) single-modality perception benchmarks of 10 different modalities, ii) 25 cross-modality understanding tasks of retrieval, question-answering, captioning, and iii) 18 multimodal large language model benchmarks. Our models establish 37 new records for state-of-the-art performance. We hope that our research could contribute to the development of omni-modal intelligence.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We investigate the space of weights spanned by a large collection of customized diffusion models. We populate this space by creating a dataset of over 60,000 models, each of which is a base model fine-tuned to insert a different person's visual identity. We model the underlying manifold of these weights as a subspace, which we term weights2weights. We demonstrate three immediate applications of this space -- sampling, editing, and inversion. First, as each point in the space corresponds to an identity, sampling a set of weights from it results in a model encoding a novel identity. Next, we find linear directions in this space corresponding to semantic edits of the identity (e.g., adding a beard). These edits persist in appearance across generated samples. Finally, we show that inverting a single image into this space reconstructs a realistic identity, even if the input image is out of distribution (e.g., a painting). Our results indicate that the weight space of fine-tuned diffusion models behaves as an interpretable latent space of identities.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This work presents Depth Anything V2. Without pursuing fancy techniques, we aim to reveal crucial findings to pave the way towards building a powerful monocular depth estimation model. Notably, compared with V1, this version produces much finer and more robust depth predictions through three key practices: 1) replacing all labeled real images with synthetic images, 2) scaling up the capacity of our teacher model, and 3) teaching student models via the bridge of large-scale pseudo-labeled real images. Compared with the latest models built on Stable Diffusion, our models are significantly more efficient (more than 10x faster) and more accurate. We offer models of different scales (ranging from 25M to 1.3B params) to support extensive scenarios. Benefiting from their strong generalization capability, we fine-tune them with metric depth labels to obtain our metric depth models. In addition to our models, considering the limited diversity and frequent noise in current test sets, we construct a versatile evaluation benchmark with precise annotations and diverse scenes to facilitate future research.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This work does not introduce a new method. Instead, we present an interesting finding that questions the necessity of the inductive bias -- locality in modern computer vision architectures. Concretely, we find that vanilla Transformers can operate by directly treating each individual pixel as a token and achieve highly performant results. This is substantially different from the popular design in Vision Transformer, which maintains the inductive bias from ConvNets towards local neighborhoods (e.g. by treating each 16x16 patch as a token). We mainly showcase the effectiveness of pixels-as-tokens across three well-studied tasks in computer vision: supervised learning for object classification, self-supervised learning via masked autoencoding, and image generation with diffusion models. Although directly operating on individual pixels is less computationally practical, we believe the community must be aware of this surprising piece of knowledge when devising the next generation of neural architectures for computer vision.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper presents innovative enhancements to diffusion models by integrating a novel multi-resolution network and time-dependent layer normalization. Diffusion models have gained prominence for their effectiveness in high-fidelity image generation. While conventional approaches rely on convolutional U-Net architectures, recent Transformer-based designs have demonstrated superior performance and scalability. However, Transformer architectures, which tokenize input data (via "patchification"), face a trade-off between visual fidelity and computational complexity due to the quadratic nature of self-attention operations concerning token length. While larger patch sizes enable attention computation efficiency, they struggle to capture fine-grained visual details, leading to image distortions. To address this challenge, we propose augmenting the Diffusion model with the Multi-Resolution network (DiMR), a framework that refines features across multiple resolutions, progressively enhancing detail from low to high resolution. Additionally, we introduce Time-Dependent Layer Normalization (TD-LN), a parameter-efficient approach that incorporates time-dependent parameters into layer normalization to inject time information and achieve superior performance. Our method's efficacy is demonstrated on the class-conditional ImageNet generation benchmark, where DiMR-XL variants outperform prior diffusion models, setting new state-of-the-art FID scores of 1.70 on ImageNet 256 x 256 and 2.89 on ImageNet 512 x 512.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Score distillation sampling (SDS) has proven to be an important tool, enabling the use of large-scale diffusion priors for tasks operating in data-poor domains. Unfortunately, SDS has a number of characteristic artifacts that limit its usefulness in general-purpose applications. In this paper, we make progress toward understanding the behavior of SDS and its variants by viewing them as solving an optimal-cost transport path from a source distribution to a target distribution. Under this new interpretation, these methods seek to transport corrupted images (source) to the natural image distribution (target). We argue that current methods' characteristic artifacts are caused by (1) linear approximation of the optimal path and (2) poor estimates of the source distribution. We show that calibrating the text conditioning of the source distribution can produce high-quality generation and translation results with little extra overhead. Our method can be easily applied across many domains, matching or beating the performance of specialized methods. We demonstrate its utility in text-to-2D, text-based NeRF optimization, translating paintings to real images, optical illusion generation, and 3D sketch-to-real. We compare our method to existing approaches for score distillation sampling and show that it can produce high-frequency details with realistic colors.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Building on the advances of language models, Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have contributed significant improvements in video understanding. While the current video LMMs utilize advanced Large Language Models (LLMs), they rely on either image or video encoders to process visual inputs, each of which has its own limitations. Image encoders excel at capturing rich spatial details from frame sequences but lack explicit temporal context, which can be important in videos with intricate action sequences. On the other hand, video encoders provide temporal context but are often limited by computational constraints that lead to processing only sparse frames at lower resolutions, resulting in reduced contextual and spatial understanding. To this end, we introduce VideoGPT+, which combines the complementary benefits of the image encoder (for detailed spatial understanding) and the video encoder (for global temporal context modeling). The model processes videos by dividing them into smaller segments and applies an adaptive pooling strategy on features extracted by both image and video encoders. Our architecture showcases improved performance across multiple video benchmarks, including VCGBench, MVBench and Zero-shot question-answering. Further, we develop 112K video-instruction set using a novel semi-automatic annotation pipeline which further improves the model performance. Additionally, to comprehensively evaluate video LMMs, we present VCGBench-Diverse, covering 18 broad video categories such as lifestyle, sports, science, gaming, and surveillance videos. This benchmark with 4,354 question-answer pairs evaluates the generalization of existing LMMs on dense video captioning, spatial and temporal understanding, and complex reasoning, ensuring comprehensive assessment across diverse video types and dynamics.
