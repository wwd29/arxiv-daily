<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled the development of text-to-SQL models that allow clinicians to query structured data stored in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) using natural language. However, deploying these models for EHR question answering (QA) systems in safety-critical clinical environments remains challenging: incorrect SQL queries-whether caused by model errors or problematic user inputs-can undermine clinical decision-making and jeopardize patient care. While prior work has mainly focused on improving SQL generation accuracy or filtering questions before execution, there is a lack of a unified benchmark for evaluating independent post-hoc verification mechanisms (i.e., a component that inspects and validates the generated SQL before execution), which is crucial for safe deployment. To fill this gap, we introduce SCARE, a benchmark for evaluating methods that function as a post-hoc safety layer in EHR QA systems. SCARE evaluates the joint task of (1) classifying question answerability (i.e., determining whether a question is answerable, ambiguous, or unanswerable) and (2) verifying or correcting candidate SQL queries. The benchmark comprises 4,200 triples of questions, candidate SQL queries, and expected model outputs, grounded in the MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV, and eICU databases. It covers a diverse set of questions and corresponding candidate SQL queries generated by seven different text-to-SQL models, ensuring a realistic and challenging evaluation. Using SCARE, we benchmark a range of approaches-from two-stage methods to agentic frameworks. Our experiments reveal a critical trade-off between question classification and SQL error correction, highlighting key challenges and outlining directions for future research.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in processing long contexts, enabling them to tackle tasks involving long textual inputs such as multi-turn conversations, legal documents, or retrieved documents in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. However, despite their ability to handle long sequences, the resulting decoding latency and memory overhead remain substantial, posing challenges for real-world deployment. Recent advances in KV Cache reuse have shown potential to mitigate these costs, but still suffer from notable performance degradation. To address this issue, we conduct an in-depth investigation of recomputation-based reuse methods and observe that the recomputed tokens often fail to align with the context segments most relevant to the question. This misalignment hinders proper updates to the critical contextual representations. Therefore, we propose the $\textbf{A}$ttention-$\textbf{A}$ware $\textbf{A}$ccurate KV Cache Fusion algorithm ($A^3$), which precomputes and selectively fuses the KV Cache of text chunks based on their relevance to the question, achieving accurate integration with minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks and LLMs demonstrate that $A^3$ achieves the best task performance compared to four baselines while reducing the time-to-first-token (TTFT) by 2$\times$.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to precisely follow complex and fine-grained lexical instructions is a cornerstone of their utility and controllability. However, evaluating this capability remains a significant challenge. Current methods either rely on subjective and costly human evaluation or on automated LLM-as-a-judge systems, which suffer from inherent biases and unreliability. Existing programmatic benchmarks, while objective, often lack the expressiveness to test intricate, compositional constraints at a granular level. To address these limitations, we introduce LexInstructEval, a new benchmark and evaluation framework for fine-grained lexical instruction following. Our framework is built upon a formal, rule-based grammar that deconstructs complex instructions into a canonical <Procedure, Relation, Value> triplet. This grammar enables the systematic generation of a diverse dataset through a multi-stage, human-in-the-loop pipeline and facilitates objective verification via a transparent, programmatic engine. We release our dataset and open-source evaluation tools to facilitate further research into the controllability and reliability of LLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to plan, reason, and execute tasks across diverse scenarios. In use cases like repeatable workflows and agentic settings, prompts are often reused with minor variations while having a similar structure for recurring tasks. This opens up opportunities for caching. However, exact prompt matching fails on such structurally similar prompts, while semantic caching may produce incorrect responses by ignoring critical differences. To address this, we introduce \ourmethod{}, a generative cache that produces variation-aware responses for structurally similar prompts. \ourmethod{} identifies reusable response patterns across similar prompt structures and synthesizes customized outputs for new requests. We show that \ourmethod{} achieves 83\% cache hit rate, while having minimal incorrect hits on datasets without prompt repetition. In agentic workflows, it improves cache hit rate by $\sim$20\% and reduces end-to-end execution latency by $\sim$34\% compared to standard prompt matching.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) is vulnerable to real-world data corruption, with even robust algorithms failing under challenging observation and mixture corruptions. We posit this failure stems from data corruption creating sharp minima in the loss landscape, leading to poor generalization. To address this, we are the first to apply Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) as a general-purpose, plug-and-play optimizer for offline RL. SAM seeks flatter minima, guiding models to more robust parameter regions. We integrate SAM into strong baselines for data corruption: IQL, a top-performing offline RL algorithm in this setting, and RIQL, an algorithm designed specifically for data-corruption robustness. We evaluate them on D4RL benchmarks with both random and adversarial corruption. Our SAM-enhanced methods consistently and significantly outperform the original baselines. Visualizations of the reward surface confirm that SAM finds smoother solutions, providing strong evidence for its effectiveness in improving the robustness of offline RL agents.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>When large language models (LLMs) are aligned to a specific online community, do they exhibit generalizable behavioral patterns that mirror that community's attitudes and responses to new uncertainty, or are they simply recalling patterns from training data? We introduce a framework to test epistemic stance transfer: targeted deletion of event knowledge, validated with multiple probes, followed by evaluation of whether models still reproduce the community's organic response patterns under ignorance. Using Russian--Ukrainian military discourse and U.S. partisan Twitter data, we find that even after aggressive fact removal, aligned LLMs maintain stable, community-specific behavioral patterns for handling uncertainty. These results provide evidence that alignment encodes structured, generalizable behaviors beyond surface mimicry. Our framework offers a systematic way to detect behavioral biases that persist under ignorance, advancing efforts toward safer and more transparent LLM deployments.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Sequence models for binary analysis are bottlenecked by byte-level tokenization: raw bytes waste precious context window capacity for transformers and other neural network architectures, and many existing text-oriented tokenizers fail on arbitrary 0x00--0xFF sequences. To address this issue, we introduce the Binary BPE tokenizer family, a set of cross-platform Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizers for executables trained on a large corpus of binaries spanning multiple platforms, architectures, and operating systems, including Linux, Windows, macOS, Android, and malware sources. We release trained tokenizers with vocabularies of 4K, 8K, 16K, 32K, and 64K tokens, enabling both systematic scaling studies and practical deployment from resource-constrained edge devices to high-throughput datacenters. These tokenizers discover interpretable patterns (ELF/PE headers, instruction sequences, cross-platform strings) while yielding multi-byte compression per token. On representative uncompressed executables (e.g., ELF/PE/Mach-O rather than compressed APKs), the Binary BPE tokenizers typically allow for roughly 2-3x more binary content per fixed-length transformer context window than raw bytes, enabling more efficient research and practical deployment for content identification, malware detection, reverse engineering, and optimization. We release the trained Binary BPE tokenizers on HuggingFace, providing a drop-in, open-source foundation for binary-focused language models and context-efficient agentic tools.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We study a deliberately simple, fully non-linguistic model of text: a sequence of independent draws from a finite alphabet of letters plus a single space symbol. A word is defined as a maximal block of non-space symbols. Within this symbol-level framework, which assumes no morphology, syntax, or semantics, we derive several structural results. First, word lengths follow a geometric distribution governed solely by the probability of the space symbol. Second, the expected number of words of a given length, and the expected number of distinct words of that length, admit closed-form expressions based on a coupon-collector argument. This yields a critical word length k* at which word types transition from appearing many times on average to appearing at most once. Third, combining the exponential growth of the number of possible strings of length k with the exponential decay of the probability of each string, we obtain a Zipf-type rank-frequency law p(r) proportional to r^{-alpha}, with an exponent determined explicitly by the alphabet size and the space probability. Our contribution is twofold. Mathematically, we give a unified derivation linking word lengths, vocabulary growth, critical length, and rank-frequency structure in a single explicit model. Conceptually, we argue that this provides a structurally grounded null model for both natural-language word statistics and token statistics in large language models. The results show that Zipf-like patterns can arise purely from combinatorics and segmentation, without optimization principles or linguistic organization, and help clarify which phenomena require deeper explanation beyond random-text structure.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the rapid development of deep learning, large language models have shown strong capabilities in complex reasoning tasks such as mathematical equation solving. However, their substantial computational and storage costs hinder practical deployment. This paper proposes a lightweight optimization method that integrates dynamic attention head pruning with knowledge distillation. The approach dynamically evaluates the importance of each attention head in the multi-head attention mechanism using a combination of weight norms and entropy, and prunes redundant heads in real time to reduce computational overhead. To mitigate performance degradation, knowledge distillation transfers information from the original model to the pruned student, enabling the smaller model to preserve reasoning ability. Experiments conducted on both Math23k and ASDiv-A verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. For example, on Math23k with a 30% pruning ratio, parameters are reduced by 18.7%, inference speed is improved by 27.5%, FLOPs are reduced by 19.3%, and accuracy drops only 0.7% (from 84.4% to 83.7%). These results demonstrate that the method achieves substantial efficiency gains while maintaining strong reasoning performance, providing a practical solution for efficient deployment of large language models in mathematical reasoning tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), aligning them with human values for safety and ethics has become a critical challenge. This problem is especially challenging when multiple, potentially conflicting human values must be considered and balanced. Although several variants of existing alignment methods (such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)) have been proposed to address multi-value alignment, they suffer from notable limitations: 1) they are often unstable and inefficient in multi-value optimization; and 2) they fail to effectively handle value conflicts. As a result, these approaches typically struggle to achieve optimal trade-offs when aligning multiple values. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework called Multi-Value Alignment (MVA). It mitigates alignment degradation caused by parameter interference among diverse human values by minimizing their mutual information. Furthermore, we propose a value extrapolation strategy to efficiently explore the Pareto frontier, thereby constructing a set of LLMs with diverse value preferences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVA consistently outperforms existing baselines in aligning LLMs with multiple human values.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Anomaly detection on attributed graphs plays an essential role in applications such as fraud detection, intrusion monitoring, and misinformation analysis. However, text-attributed graphs (TAGs), in which node information is expressed in natural language, remain underexplored, largely due to the absence of standardized benchmark datasets. In this work, we introduce TAG-AD, a comprehensive benchmark for anomaly node detection on TAGs. TAG-AD leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate realistic anomalous node texts directly in the raw text space, producing anomalies that are semantically coherent yet contextually inconsistent and thus more reflective of real-world irregularities. In addition, TAG-AD incorporates multiple other anomaly types, enabling thorough and reproducible evaluation of graph anomaly detection (GAD) methods. With these datasets, we further benchmark existing unsupervised GNN-based GAD methods as well as zero-shot LLMs for GAD. As part of our zero-shot detection setup, we propose a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-assisted, LLM-based zero-shot anomaly detection framework. The framework mitigates reliance on brittle, hand-crafted prompts by constructing a global anomaly knowledge base and distilling it into reusable analysis frameworks. Our experimental results reveal a clear division of strengths: LLMs are particularly effective at detecting contextual anomalies, whereas GNN-based methods remain superior for structural anomaly detection. Moreover, RAG-assisted prompting achieves performance comparable to human-designed prompts while eliminating manual prompt engineering, underscoring the practical value of our RAG-assisted zero-shot LLM anomaly detection framework.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, explainability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Synthetic tabular data, which are widely used in domains such as healthcare, enterprise operations, and customer analytics, are increasingly evaluated to ensure that they preserve both privacy and utility. While existing evaluation practices typically focus on distributional similarity (e.g., the Kullback-Leibler divergence) or predictive performance (e.g., Train-on-Synthetic-Test-on-Real (TSTR) accuracy), these approaches fail to assess semantic fidelity, that is, whether models trained on synthetic data follow reasoning patterns consistent with those trained on real data. To address this gap, we introduce the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) Distance, a novel explainability-aware metric that is defined as the cosine distance between the global SHAP attribution vectors derived from classifiers trained on real versus synthetic datasets. By analyzing datasets that span clinical health records with physiological features, enterprise invoice transactions with heterogeneous scales, and telecom churn logs with mixed categorical-numerical attributes, we demonstrate that the SHAP Distance reliably identifies semantic discrepancies that are overlooked by standard statistical and predictive measures. In particular, our results show that the SHAP Distance captures feature importance shifts and underrepresented tail effects that the Kullback-Leibler divergence and Train-on-Synthetic-Test-on-Real accuracy fail to detect. This study positions the SHAP Distance as a practical and discriminative tool for auditing the semantic fidelity of synthetic tabular data, and offers practical guidelines for integrating attribution-based evaluation into future benchmarking pipelines.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in production environments requires efficient inference serving systems that balance throughput, latency, and resource utilization. This paper presents a comprehensive empirical evaluation of two prominent open-source LLM serving frameworks: vLLM and HuggingFace Text Generation Inference (TGI). We benchmark these systems across multiple dimensions including throughput performance, end-to-end latency, GPU memory utilization, and scalability characteristics using LLaMA-2 models ranging from 7B to 70B parameters. Our experiments reveal that vLLM achieves up to 24x higher throughput than TGI under high-concurrency workloads through its novel PagedAttention mechanism, while TGI demonstrates lower tail latencies for interactive single-user scenarios. We provide detailed performance profiles for different deployment scenarios and offer practical recommendations for system selection based on workload characteristics. Our findings indicate that the choice between these frameworks should be guided by specific use-case requirements: vLLM excels in high-throughput batch processing scenarios, while TGI is better suited for latency-sensitive interactive applications with moderate concurrency.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Broadcast and media organizations increasingly rely on artificial intelligence to automate the labor-intensive processes of content indexing, tagging, and metadata generation. However, existing AI systems typically operate on a single modality-such as video, audio, or text-limiting their understanding of complex, cross-modal relationships in broadcast material. In this work, we propose a Multimodal Autoencoder (MMAE) that learns unified representations across text, audio, and visual data, enabling end-to-end automation of metadata extraction and semantic clustering. The model is trained on the recently introduced LUMA dataset, a fully aligned benchmark of multimodal triplets representative of real-world media content. By minimizing joint reconstruction losses across modalities, the MMAE discovers modality-invariant semantic structures without relying on large paired or contrastive datasets. We demonstrate significant improvements in clustering and alignment metrics (Silhouette, ARI, NMI) compared to linear baselines, indicating that reconstruction-based multimodal embeddings can serve as a foundation for scalable metadata generation and cross-modal retrieval in broadcast archives. These results highlight the potential of reconstruction-driven multimodal learning to enhance automation, searchability, and content management efficiency in modern broadcast workflows.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Wildfire risk prediction remains a critical yet challenging task due to the complex interactions among fuel conditions, meteorology, topography, and human activity. Despite growing interest in data-driven approaches, publicly available benchmark datasets that support long-term temporal modeling, large-scale spatial coverage, and multimodal drivers remain scarce. To address this gap, we present a 25-year, daily-resolution wildfire dataset covering 240 million hectares across British Columbia and surrounding regions. The dataset includes 38 covariates, encompassing active fire detections, weather variables, fuel conditions, terrain features, and anthropogenic factors. Using this benchmark, we evaluate a diverse set of time-series forecasting models, including CNN-based, linear-based, Transformer-based, and Mamba-based architectures. We also investigate effectiveness of position embedding and the relative importance of different fire-driving factors. The dataset and the corresponding code can be found at this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Algorithms developed under stationary Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) often face challenges in non-stationary environments, and infinite-horizon formulations may not directly apply to finite-horizon tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce the Non-stationary and Varying-discounting MDP (NVMDP) framework, which naturally accommodates non-stationarity and allows discount rates to vary with time and transitions. Infinite-horizon, stationary MDPs emerge as special cases of NVMDPs for identifying an optimal policy, and finite-horizon MDPs are also subsumed within the NVMDP formulations. Moreover, NVMDPs provide a flexible mechanism to shape optimal policies, without altering the state space, action space, or the reward structure. We establish the theoretical foundations of NVMDPs, including assumptions, state- and action-value formulation and recursion, matrix representation, optimality conditions, and policy improvement under finite state and action spaces. Building on these results, we adapt dynamic programming and generalized Q-learning algorithms to NVMDPs, along with formal convergence proofs. For problems requiring function approximation, we extend the Policy Gradient Theorem and the policy improvement bound in Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO), offering proofs in both scalar and matrix forms. Empirical evaluations in a non-stationary gridworld environment demonstrate that NVMDP-based algorithms successfully recover optimal trajectories under multiple reward and discounting schemes, whereas original Q-learning fails. These results collectively show that NVMDPs provide a theoretically sound and practically effective framework for reinforcement learning, requiring only minor algorithmic modifications while enabling robust handling of non-stationarity and explicit optimal policy shaping.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Training Large Language Models (LLMs) typically involves a two-stage pipeline at the output layer: hidden states are projected into vocabulary logits via a linear transformation (lm_head), followed by cross-entropy loss computation against target tokens. While conceptually simple, this design incurs substantial overhead. The intermediate logits tensor, with dimensions proportional to batch size, sequence length, and vocabulary size, must be fully materialized in GPU memory, even though only one target token per position is ultimately used. This leads to significant memory footprint and bandwidth comsumption, limiting scalability and slowing training throughput. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to integrates the output projection and loss prediction into a single operation. By directly computing the loss from hidden states and target tokens, our approach bypasses explicit logits materialization. This design reduces memory usage and alleviates bandwidth pressure. Experiments on LLM training demonstrate that our method achieves substantial memory savings and measurable speedups compared to the standard two-stage pipeline, enabling large batch sizes and longer sequences without sacrificing accuracy. Our work highlights the benefits of rethinking the boundary between projection and prediction, offering a practical systems optimization for efficient LLM training.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Graph Transformer shows remarkable potential in brain network analysis due to its ability to model graph structures and complex node relationships. Most existing methods typically model the brain as a flat network, ignoring its modular structure, and their attention mechanisms treat all brain region connections equally, ignoring distance-related node connection patterns. However, brain information processing is a hierarchical process that involves local and long-range interactions between brain regions, interactions between regions and sub-functional modules, and interactions among functional modules themselves. This hierarchical interaction mechanism enables the brain to efficiently integrate local computations and global information flow, supporting the execution of complex cognitive functions. To address this issue, we propose BrainHGT, a hierarchical Graph Transformer that simulates the brain's natural information processing from local regions to global communities. Specifically, we design a novel long-short range attention encoder that utilizes parallel pathways to handle dense local interactions and sparse long-range connections, thereby effectively alleviating the over-globalizing issue. To further capture the brain's modular architecture, we designe a prior-guided clustering module that utilizes a cross-attention mechanism to group brain regions into functional communities and leverage neuroanatomical prior to guide the clustering process, thereby improving the biological plausibility and interpretability. Experimental results indicate that our proposed method significantly improves performance of disease identification, and can reliably capture the sub-functional modules of the brain, demonstrating its interpretability.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Understanding brain function represents a fundamental goal in neuroscience, with critical implications for therapeutic interventions and neural engineering applications. Computational modeling provides a quantitative framework for accelerating this understanding, but faces a fundamental trade-off between computational efficiency and high-fidelity modeling. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel Energy-based Autoregressive Generation (EAG) framework that employs an energy-based transformer learning temporal dynamics in latent space through strictly proper scoring rules, enabling efficient generation with realistic population and single-neuron spiking statistics. Evaluation on synthetic Lorenz datasets and two Neural Latents Benchmark datasets (MC_Maze and Area2_bump) demonstrates that EAG achieves state-of-the-art generation quality with substantial computational efficiency improvements, particularly over diffusion-based methods. Beyond optimal performance, conditional generation applications show two capabilities: generalizing to unseen behavioral contexts and improving motor brain-computer interface decoding accuracy using synthetic neural data. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of energy-based modeling for neural population dynamics with applications in neuroscience research and neural engineering.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, extraction, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for data extraction from documents is essential to intelligent informatics, such as digitizing medical records and recognizing road signs. Multi-modal Large Language Models (LLMs) can solve this task and have shown remarkable performance. Recently, it has been noticed that the accuracy of data extraction by multi-modal LLMs can be affected when in-plane rotations are present in the documents. However, real-world document images are usually not only in-plane rotated but also perspectively distorted. This study investigates the impacts of such perturbations on the data extraction accuracy for the state-of-the-art model, Gemini-1.5-pro. Because perspective distortions have a high degree of freedom, designing experiments in the same manner as single-parametric rotations is difficult. We observed typical distortions of document images and showed that most of them approximately follow an isosceles-trapezoidal transformation, which allows us to evaluate distortions with a small number of parameters. We were able to reduce the number of independent parameters from eight to two, i.e. rotation angle and distortion ratio. Then, specific entities were extracted from synthetically generated sample documents with varying these parameters. As the performance of LLMs, we evaluated not only a character-recognition accuracy but also a structure-recognition accuracy. Whereas the former represents the classical indicators for optical character recognition, the latter is related to the correctness of reading order. In particular, the structure-recognition accuracy was found to be significantly degraded by document distortion. In addition, we found that this accuracy can be improved by a simple rotational correction. This insight will contribute to the practical use of multi-modal LLMs for OCR tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Accurate 3D ground truth estimation is critical for applications such as autonomous navigation, surveillance, and robotics. This paper introduces a novel method that uses an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) to fuse 2D bounding box or pose keypoint ground truth annotations from multiple calibrated cameras into accurate 3D ground truth. By leveraging human-annotated ground-truth 2D, our proposed method, a multi-camera single-object tracking algorithm, transforms 2D image coordinates into robust 3D world coordinates through homography-based projection and UKF-based fusion. Our proposed algorithm processes multi-view data to estimate object positions and shapes while effectively handling challenges such as occlusion. We evaluate our method on the CMC, Wildtrack, and Panoptic datasets, demonstrating high accuracy in 3D localization compared to the available 3D ground truth. Unlike existing approaches that provide only ground-plane information, our method also outputs the full 3D shape of each object. Additionally, the algorithm offers a scalable and fully automatic solution for multi-camera systems using only 2D image annotations.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) has become a cornerstone technology in clinical microbiology, enabling rapid and accurate microbial identification. However, the development of data-driven diagnostic models remains limited by the lack of sufficiently large, balanced, and standardized spectral datasets. This study investigates the use of deep generative models to synthesize realistic MALDI-TOF MS spectra, aiming to overcome data scarcity and support the development of robust machine learning tools in microbiology. We adapt and evaluate three generative models, Variational Autoencoders (MALDIVAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (MALDIGANs), and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (MALDIffusion), for the conditional generation of microbial spectra guided by species labels. Generation is conditioned on species labels, and spectral fidelity and diversity are assessed using diverse metrics. Our experiments show that synthetic data generated by MALDIVAE, MALDIGAN, and MALDIffusion are statistically and diagnostically comparable to real measurements, enabling classifiers trained exclusively on synthetic samples to reach performance levels similar to those trained on real data. While all models faithfully reproduce the peak structure and variability of MALDI-TOF spectra, MALDIffusion obtains this fidelity at a substantially higher computational cost, and MALDIGAN shows competitive but slightly less stable behaviour. In contrast, MALDIVAE offers the most favorable balance between realism, stability, and efficiency. Furthermore, augmenting minority species with synthetic spectra markedly improves classification accuracy, effectively mitigating class imbalance and domain mismatch without compromising the authenticity of the generated data.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Due to the high cost of annotation or the rarity of some diseases, medical image segmentation is often limited by data scarcity and the resulting overfitting problem. Self-supervised learning and semi-supervised learning can mitigate the data scarcity challenge to some extent. However, both of these paradigms are complex and require either hand-crafted pretexts or well-defined pseudo-labels. In contrast, data augmentation represents a relatively simple and straightforward approach to addressing data scarcity issues. It has led to significant improvements in image recognition tasks. However, the effectiveness of local image editing augmentation techniques in the context of segmentation has been less explored. We propose HSMix, a novel approach to local image editing data augmentation involving hard and soft mixing for medical semantic segmentation. In our approach, a hard-augmented image is created by combining homogeneous regions (superpixels) from two source images. A soft mixing method further adjusts the brightness of these composed regions with brightness mixing based on locally aggregated pixel-wise saliency coefficients. The ground-truth segmentation masks of the two source images undergo the same mixing operations to generate the associated masks for the augmented images. Our method fully exploits both the prior contour and saliency information, thus preserving local semantic information in the augmented images while enriching the augmentation space with more diversity. Our method is a plug-and-play solution that is model agnostic and applicable to a range of medical imaging modalities. Extensive experimental evidence has demonstrated its effectiveness in a variety of medical segmentation tasks. The source code is available in this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Integrating multiple personalized concepts into a single image has recently become a significant area of focus within Text-to-Image (T2I) generation. However, existing methods often underperform on complex multi-object scenes due to unintended alterations in both personalized and non-personalized regions. This not only fails to preserve the intended prompt structure but also disrupts interactions among regions, leading to semantic inconsistencies. To address this limitation, we introduce plug-and-play multi-concept adaptive blending for high-fidelity text-to-image synthesis (PnP-MIX), an innovative, tuning-free approach designed to seamlessly embed multiple personalized concepts into a single generated image. Our method leverages guided appearance attention to faithfully reflect the intended appearance of each personalized concept. To further enhance compositional fidelity, we present a mask-guided noise mixing strategy that preserves the integrity of non-personalized regions such as the background or unrelated objects while enabling the precise integration of personalized objects. Finally, to mitigate concept leakage, i.e., the inadvertent leakage of personalized concept features into other regions, we propose background dilution++, a novel strategy that effectively reduces such leakage and promotes accurate localization of features within personalized regions. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that PnP-MIX consistently surpasses existing methodologies in both single- and multi-concept personalization scenarios, underscoring its robustness and superior performance without additional model tuning.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), affecting millions worldwide, exhibits complex pathophysiology manifested through disrupted brain network dynamics. Although graph neural networks that leverage neuroimaging data have shown promise in depression diagnosis, existing approaches are predominantly data-driven and operate largely as black-box models, lacking neurobiological interpretability. Here, we present NH-GCAT (Neurocircuitry-Inspired Hierarchical Graph Causal Attention Networks), a novel framework that bridges neuroscience domain knowledge with deep learning by explicitly and hierarchically modeling depression-specific mechanisms at different spatial scales. Our approach introduces three key technical contributions: (1) at the local brain regional level, we design a residual gated fusion module that integrates temporal blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) dynamics with functional connectivity patterns, specifically engineered to capture local depression-relevant low-frequency neural oscillations; (2) at the multi-regional circuit level, we propose a hierarchical circuit encoding scheme that aggregates regional node representations following established depression neurocircuitry organization, and (3) at the multi-circuit network level, we develop a variational latent causal attention mechanism that leverages a continuous probabilistic latent space to infer directed information flow among critical circuits, characterizing disease-altered whole-brain inter-circuit interactions. Rigorous leave-one-site-out cross-validation on the REST-meta-MDD dataset demonstrates NH-GCAT's state-of-the-art performance in depression classification, achieving a sample-size weighted-average accuracy of 73.3\% and an AUROC of 76.4\%, while simultaneously providing neurobiologically meaningful explanations.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Personalizing digital applications for health behavior change is a promising route to making them more engaging and effective. This especially holds for approaches that adapt to users and their specific states (e.g., motivation, knowledge, wants) over time. However, developing such approaches requires making many design choices, whose effectiveness is difficult to predict from literature and costly to evaluate in practice. In this work, we explore whether large language models (LLMs) can be used out-of-the-box to generate samples of user interactions that provide useful information for training reinforcement learning models for digital behavior change settings. Using real user data from four large behavior change studies as comparison, we show that LLM-generated samples can be useful in the absence of real data. Comparisons to the samples provided by human raters further show that LLM-generated samples reach the performance of human raters. Additional analyses of different prompting strategies including shorter and longer prompt variants, chain-of-thought prompting, and few-shot prompting show that the relative effectiveness of different strategies depends on both the study and the LLM with also relatively large differences between prompt paraphrases alone. We provide recommendations for how LLM-generated samples can be useful in practice.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Traditional Federated Multi-View Clustering assumes uniform views across clients, yet practical deployments reveal heterogeneous view completeness with prevalent incomplete, redundant, or corrupted data. While recent approaches model view heterogeneity, they neglect semantic conflicts from dynamic view combinations, failing to address dual uncertainties: view uncertainty (semantic inconsistency from arbitrary view pairings) and aggregation uncertainty (divergent client updates with imbalanced contributions). To address these, we propose a novel Enhanced Federated Deep Multi-View Clustering framework: first align local semantics, hierarchical contrastive fusion within clients resolves view uncertainty by eliminating semantic conflicts; a view adaptive drift module mitigates aggregation uncertainty through global-local prototype contrast that dynamically corrects parameter deviations; and a balanced aggregation mechanism coordinates client updates. Experimental results demonstrate that EFDMVC achieves superior robustness against heterogeneous uncertain views across multiple benchmark datasets, consistently outperforming all state-of-the-art baselines in comprehensive evaluations.</li>

The core innovation is a cross-matrix Krylov projection method that exploits mathematical similarities between matrices, using a shared subspace built from ``seed" matrices to rapidly solve for subsequent ``target" matrices. Our experiments show that this technique achieves a 15.8\% to 43.7\% time reduction over standard sparse solvers. Additionally, we compare our method against DDPM baselines in denoising tasks, showing a speedup of up to 115$\times$. Furthermore, under a fixed computational budget, our model is able to produce high-quality images while DDPM fails to generate recognizable content, illustrating our approach is a practical method for efficient generation in resource-limited settings.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to grow in size, storing and transmitting them on edge devices becomes increasingly challenging. Traditional methods like quantization and pruning struggle to achieve extreme compression of LLMs without sacrificing accuracy. In this paper, we introduce PocketLLM, a novel approach to compress LLMs in a latent space via meta-networks. A simple encoder network is proposed to project the weights of LLMs into discrete latent vectors, which are then represented using a compact codebook. A lightweight decoder network is employed to map the codebook's representative vectors back to the original weight space. This method allows for significant compression of the large weights in LLMs, consisting solely of a small decoder, a concise codebook, and an index. Extensive experiments show that PocketLLM achieves superior performance even at significantly high compression ratios, e.g., compressing Llama 2-7B by 10x with a negligible drop in accuracy.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>data-free, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Modern artificial intelligence systems depend heavily on large datasets for both training and transferring knowledge between models. Knowledge distillation, transfer learning, and dataset distillation have made such transfers more efficient, yet they remain fundamentally data-driven: a teacher must produce examples, logits, or gradients for a student to learn. In this work, we introduce Model-to-Model Knowledge Transmission (M2KT), a novel paradigm for data-free conceptual transfer between neural networks. M2KT enables models to exchange knowledge packets that encapsulate structured concept embeddings, abstraction graphs, reasoning traces, and provenance metadata. Unlike classical distillation, M2KT operates primarily in concept space rather than example space, and it does not require labeled datasets or teacher-generated outputs during transfer. We formalize the notion of concept manifolds, introduce an inter-model alignment mapping between teacher and student latent spaces, and derive a composite loss that enforces geometric, structural, and reasoning consistency together with explicit safety constraints. We further present algorithmic procedures for teacher-side packet generation and student-side ingestion and verification. Experiments on symbolic reasoning with large language models show that M2KT can achieve approximately 85 to 90 percent of teacher performance while reducing data usage by over 98 percent compared to standard knowledge distillation. This work establishes a theoretical and practical foundation for data-free AI-to-AI knowledge transfer and self-improving model ecosystems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, interpretability, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Mechanistic interpretability aspires to reverse-engineer neural networks into explicit algorithms, while model editing seeks to modify specific behaviours without retraining. Both areas are typically evaluated with informal evidence and ad-hoc experiments, with few explicit guarantees about how far an extracted or edited model can drift from the original on relevant inputs. We introduce BlockCert, a framework for certified blockwise extraction of transformer mechanisms, and outline how a lightweight extension can support certified local edits. Given a pre-trained transformer and a prompt distribution, BlockCert extracts structured surrogate implementations for residual blocks together with machine-checkable certificates that bound approximation error, record coverage metrics, and hash the underlying artifacts. We formalize a simple Lipschitz-based composition theorem in Lean 4 that lifts these local guarantees to a global deviation bound. Empirically, we apply the framework to GPT-2 small, TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat, and Llama-3.2-3B. Across these models we obtain high per-block coverage and small residual errors on the evaluated prompts, and in the TinyLlama setting we show that a fully stitched model matches the baseline perplexity within approximately 6e-5 on stress prompts. Our results suggest that blockwise extraction with explicit certificates is feasible for real transformer language models and offers a practical bridge between mechanistic interpretability and formal reasoning about model behaviour.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Parametric Computer-Aided Design (CAD) is crucial in industrial applications, yet existing approaches often struggle to generate long sequence parametric commands due to complex CAD models' geometric and topological constraints. To address this challenge, we propose MamTiff-CAD, a novel CAD parametric command sequences generation framework that leverages a Transformer-based diffusion model for multi-scale latent representations. Specifically, we design a novel autoencoder that integrates Mamba+ and Transformer, to transfer parameterized CAD sequences into latent representations. The Mamba+ block incorporates a forget gate mechanism to effectively capture long-range dependencies. The non-autoregressive Transformer decoder reconstructs the latent representations. A diffusion model based on multi-scale Transformer is then trained on these latent embeddings to learn the distribution of long sequence commands. In addition, we also construct a dataset that consists of long parametric sequences, which is up to 256 commands for a single CAD model. Experiments demonstrate that MamTiff-CAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on both reconstruction and generation tasks, confirming its effectiveness for long sequence (60-256) CAD model generation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Advances in technology are transforming sustainable cattle farming practices, with electronic feeding systems generating big longitudinal datasets on individual animal feed intake, offering the possibility for autonomous precision livestock systems. However, the literature still lacks a methodology that fully leverages these longitudinal big data to accurately predict feed intake accounting for environmental conditions. To fill this gap, we developed an AI-based framework to accurately predict feed intake of individual animals and pen-level aggregation. Data from 19 experiments (>16.5M samples; 2013-2024) conducted at Nancy M. Cummings Research Extension & Education Center (Carmen, ID) feedlot facility and environmental data from AgriMet Network weather stations were used to develop two novel environmental indices: InComfort-Index, based solely on meteorological variables, showed good predictive capability for thermal comfort but had limited ability to predict feed intake; EASI-Index, a hybrid index integrating environmental variables with feed intake behavior, performed well in predicting feed intake but was less effective for thermal comfort. Together with the environmental indices, machine learning models were trained and the best-performing machine learning model (XGBoost) accuracy was RMSE of 1.38 kg/day for animal-level and only 0.14 kg/(day-animal) at pen-level. This approach provides a robust AI-based framework for predicting feed intake in individual animals and pens, with potential applications in precision management of feedlot cattle, through feed waste reduction, resource optimization, and climate-adaptive livestock management.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Modern cities produce vast streams of heterogeneous data, from infrastructure maps to mobility logs and satellite imagery. However, integrating these sources into coherent spatial models for planning and prediction remains a major challenge. Existing agent-centric methods often rely on direct environmental sensing, limiting scalability and raising privacy concerns. This paper introduces CubeletWorld, a novel framework for representing and analyzing urban environments through a discretized 3D grid of spatial units called cubelets. This abstraction enables privacy-preserving modeling by embedding diverse data signals, such as infrastructure, movement, or environmental indicators, into localized cubelet states. CubeletWorld supports downstream tasks such as planning, navigation, and occupancy prediction without requiring agent-driven sensing. To evaluate this paradigm, we propose the CubeletWorld State Prediction task, which involves predicting the cubelet state using a realistic dataset containing various urban elements like streets and buildings through this discretized representation. We explore a range of modified core models suitable for our setting and analyze challenges posed by increasing spatial granularity, specifically the issue of sparsity in representation and scalability of baselines. In contrast to existing 3D occupancy prediction models, our cubelet-centric approach focuses on inferring state at the spatial unit level, enabling greater generalizability across regions and improved privacy compliance. Our results demonstrate that CubeletWorld offers a flexible and extensible framework for learning from complex urban data, and it opens up new possibilities for scalable simulation and decision support in domains such as socio-demographic modeling, environmental monitoring, and emergency response.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Global routing is a critical stage in electronic design automation (EDA) that enables early estimation and optimization of the routability of modern integrated circuits with respect to congestion, power dissipation, and design complexity. Batching is a primary concern in top-performing global routers, grouping nets into manageable sets to enable parallel processing and efficient resource usage. This process improves memory usage, scalable parallelization on modern hardware, and routing congestion by controlling net interactions within each batch. However, conventional batching methods typically depend on heuristics that are computationally expensive and can lead to suboptimal results (oversized batches with conflicting nets, excessive batch counts degrading parallelization, and longer batch generation times), ultimately limiting scalability and efficiency. To address these limitations, a novel batching algorithm enhanced with Wasserstein generative adversarial networks (WGANs) is introduced in this paper, enabling more effective parallelization by generating fewer higher-quality batches in less time. The proposed algorithm is tested on the latest ISPD'24 contest benchmarks, demonstrating up to 40% runtime reduction with only 0.002% degradation in routing quality as compared to state-of-the-art router.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The recent boom and rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into a wide range of applications warrants a deeper understanding of their security and safety vulnerabilities. This paper presents a comparative analysis of the susceptibility to jailbreak attacks for two leading publicly available LLMs, Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash and OpenAI's GPT-4 (specifically the GPT-4o mini model accessible in the free tier). The research utilized two main bypass strategies: 'self-bypass', where models were prompted to circumvent their own safety protocols, and 'cross-bypass', where one model generated adversarial prompts to exploit vulnerabilities in the other. Four attack methods were employed - direct injection, role-playing, context manipulation, and obfuscation - to generate five distinct categories of unsafe content: hate speech, illegal activities, malicious code, dangerous content, and misinformation. The success of the attack was determined by the generation of disallowed content, with successful jailbreaks assigned a severity score. The findings indicate a disparity in jailbreak susceptibility between 2.5 Flash and GPT-4, suggesting variations in their safety implementations or architectural design. Cross-bypass attacks were particularly effective, indicating that an ample amount of vulnerabilities exist in the underlying transformer architecture. This research contributes a scalable framework for automated AI red-teaming and provides data-driven insights into the current state of LLM safety, underscoring the complex challenge of balancing model capabilities with robust safety mechanisms.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Medical vision-language segmentation models suffer from catastrophic forgetting when adapting to new anatomical structures, requiring complete retraining that limits their clinical deployment. Although continual learning approaches have been studied for various applications, targeted research on continual learning approaches specifically designed for medical vision-language tasks remains underexplored. We propose MedPEFT-CL, a parameter-efficient continual learning framework that addresses both efficient learning of new tasks and preservation of previous knowledge through a dual-phase architecture based on CLIPSeg. Our dual-phase architecture features an adaptive learning phase that employs semantic similarity-based adapter allocation and parameter-efficient fine-tuning for medical tasks through prompt similarity analysis, and a knowledge consolidation phase employing bi-directional Fisher-memory coordination. This creates a reinforcing cycle: consolidation directs replay priorities while new tasks provide challenging samples that improve retention strategies. Our key contributions are: (1) a semantic-driven adapter allocation mechanism that enables efficient learning of new medical tasks, (2) a bi-modal LoRA adaptation that significantly reduces trainable parameters while maintaining cross-modal learning, and (3) bidirectional Fisher-memory coordination that prevents catastrophic forgetting from previous medical tasks. Extensive experiments across diverse medical datasets demonstrate superior forgetting mitigation and performance retention with minimal parameter overhead, making the framework effective for continual learning in medical vision-language scenarios.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>defense, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Language agents are rapidly expanding from single-user assistants to multi-user collaborators in shared workspaces and groups. However, today's language models lack a mechanism for isolating user interactions and concurrent tasks, creating a new attack vector inherent to this new setting: cross-user poisoning (CUP). In a CUP attack, an adversary injects ordinary-looking messages that poison the persistent, shared state, which later triggers the agent to execute unintended, attacker-specified actions on behalf of benign users. We validate CUP on real systems, successfully attacking popular multi-user agents. To study the phenomenon systematically, we present MURMUR, a framework that composes single-user tasks into concurrent, group-based scenarios using an LLM to generate realistic, history-aware user interactions. We observe that CUP attacks succeed at high rates and their effects persist across multiple tasks, thus posing fundamental risks to multi-user LLM deployments. Finally, we introduce a first-step defense with task-based clustering to mitigate this new class of vulnerability</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Trajectory forecasting for autonomous driving must deliver accurate, calibrated multi-modal futures under tight compute and latency constraints. We propose a compact hybrid quantum architecture that aligns quantum inductive bias with road-scene structure by operating in an ego-centric, lane-aligned frame and predicting residual corrections to a kinematic baseline instead of absolute poses. The model combines a transformer-inspired quantum attention encoder (9 qubits), a parameter-lean quantum feedforward stack (64 layers, ${\sim}1200$ trainable angles), and a Fourier-based decoder that uses shallow entanglement and phase superposition to generate 16 trajectory hypotheses in a single pass, with mode confidences derived from the latent spectrum. All circuit parameters are trained with Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA), avoiding backpropagation through non-analytic components. In the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, the model achieves minADE (minimum Average Displacement Error) of \SI{1.94}{m} and minFDE (minimum Final Displacement Error) of \SI{3.56}{m} in the $16$ models predicted over the horizon of \SI{2.0}{s}, consistently outperforming a kinematic baseline with reduced miss rates and strong recall. Ablations confirm that residual learning in the lane frame, truncated Fourier decoding, shallow entanglement, and spectrum-based ranking focus capacity where it matters, yielding stable optimization and reliable multi-modal forecasts from small, shallow quantum circuits on a modern autonomous-driving benchmark.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Referring Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT) extends conventional multi-object tracking (MOT) by introducing natural language references for multi-modal fusion tracking. RMOT benchmarks only describe the object's appearance, relative positions, and initial motion states. This so-called static regulation fails to capture dynamic changes of the object motion, including velocity changes and motion direction shifts. This limitation not only causes a temporal discrepancy between static references and dynamic vision modality but also constrains multi-modal tracking performance. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Vision-Motion-Reference aligned RMOT framework, named VMRMOT. It integrates a motion modality extracted from object dynamics to enhance the alignment between vision modality and language references through multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). Specifically, we introduce motion-aware descriptions derived from object dynamic behaviors and, leveraging the powerful temporal-reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, extract motion features as the motion modality. We further design a Vision-Motion-Reference Alignment (VMRA) module to hierarchically align visual queries with motion and reference cues, enhancing their cross-modal consistency. In addition, a Motion-Guided Prediction Head (MGPH) is developed to explore motion modality to enhance the performance of the prediction head. To the best of our knowledge, VMRMOT is the first approach to employ MLLMs in the RMOT task for vision-reference alignment. Extensive experiments on multiple RMOT benchmarks demonstrate that VMRMOT outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Adversarial attacks introduce small, deliberately crafted perturbations that mislead neural networks, and their transferability from white-box to black-box target models remains a critical research focus. Input transformation-based attacks are a subfield of adversarial attacks that enhance input diversity through input transformations to improve the transferability of adversarial examples. However, existing input transformation-based attacks tend to exhibit limited cross-model transferability. Previous studies have shown that high transferability is associated with diverse attention heatmaps and the preservation of global semantics in transformed inputs. Motivated by this observation, we propose Block Stretch and Shrink (BSS), a method that divides an image into blocks and applies stretch and shrink operations to these blocks, thereby diversifying attention heatmaps in transformed inputs while maintaining their global semantics. Empirical evaluations on a subset of ImageNet demonstrate that BSS outperforms existing input transformation-based attack methods in terms of transferability. Furthermore, we examine the impact of the number scale, defined as the number of transformed inputs, in input transformation-based attacks, and advocate evaluating these methods under a unified number scale to enable fair and comparable assessments.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Transformer-based models have dramatically increased their size and parameter count to tackle increasingly complex tasks. At the same time, there is a growing demand for low-latency inference on resource-constrained devices that achieves high performance. In particular, stream data inference is typically performed over a sliding temporal window, leading to highly redundant computations. The recent Continual Transformers have addressed this issue, but they can only be effectively used in shallow models, which limits their scope and generalization power. In this paper, we propose the Deep Continual Transformer (DeepCoT), a redundancy-free encoder-only model that can be applied over existing deep encoder architectures with minimal changes. In our experiments over audio, video, and text streams, we show that DeepCoTs retain comparative performance to their non-continual baselines while offering a linear computational cost for all Transformer layers, which reduces up to two orders of magnitude in the running time compared to previous efficient models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper examines how large language models (LLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs) represent and compute numerical information in counting tasks. We use controlled experiments with repeated textual and visual items and analyze model behavior through causal mediation and activation patching. To this end, we design a specialized tool, CountScope, for mechanistic interpretability of numerical content. Results show that individual tokens or visual features encode latent positional count information that can be extracted and transferred across contexts. Layerwise analyses reveal a progressive emergence of numerical representations, with lower layers encoding small counts and higher layers representing larger ones. We identify an internal counter mechanism that updates with each item, stored mainly in the final token or region and transferable between contexts. In LVLMs, numerical information also appears in visual embeddings, shifting between background and foreground regions depending on spatial composition. Models rely on structural cues such as separators in text, which act as shortcuts for tracking item counts and influence the accuracy of numerical predictions. Overall, counting emerges as a structured, layerwise process in LLMs and follows the same general pattern in LVLMs, shaped by the properties of the vision encoder.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally, with X-ray Coronary Angiography (XCA) as the gold standard during real-time cardiac interventions. Segmentation of coronary vessels from XCA can facilitate downstream quantitative assessments, such as measurement of the stenosis severity and enhancing clinical decision-making. However, developing generalizable vessel segmentation models for XCA is challenging due to variations in imaging protocols and patient demographics that cause domain shifts. These limitations are exacerbated by the lack of annotated datasets, making Single-source Domain Generalization (SDG) a necessary solution for achieving generalization. Existing SDG methods are largely augmentation-based, which may not guarantee the mitigation of overfitting to augmented or synthetic domains. We propose a novel approach, ``AngioDG", to bridge this gap by channel regularization strategy to promote generalization. Our method identifies the contributions of early feature channels to task-specific metrics for DG, facilitating interpretability, and then reweights channels to calibrate and amplify domain-invariant features while attenuating domain-specific ones. We evaluate AngioDG on 6 x-ray angiography datasets for coronary vessels segmentation, achieving the best out-of-distribution performance among the compared methods, while maintaining consistent in-domain test performance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent work has shown that out-of-order and speculative execution mechanisms used to increase performance in the majority of processors expose the processors to critical attacks. These attacks, called Meltdown and Spectre, exploit the side effects of performance-enhancing features in modern microprocessors to expose secret data through side channels in the microarchitecture. The well known implementations of these attacks exploit cache-based side channels since they are the least noisy channels to exfiltrate data. While some software patches attempted to mitigate these attacks, they are ad-hoc and only try to fix the side effects of the vulnerabilites. They may also impose a performance overhead of up to 30%. In this paper, we present a microarchitecture-based solution for Meltdown and Spectre that addresses the vulnerabilities exploited by the attacks. Our solution prevents flushed instructions from exposing data to the cache. Our approach can also be extended to other memory structures in the microarchitecture thereby preventing variants of the attacks which exploit these memory structures. We further identify two new variant attacks based on exploiting the side effects of speculative and out-of-order execution and show how our solution can be used to prevent these attacks. Evaluation results show that our microarchitectural solution not only restores secure out-of-order and speculative execution, but also has relatively low overhead and does not significantly impact performance for most applications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has proven remarkably effective for eliciting complex reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Yet, its potential in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remains largely untapped, hindered by the absence of large-scale datasets that capture the rich, spatially grounded reasoning intrinsic to visual understanding. Existing visual-CoT resources are typically small, domain-specific, or lack the human-like stepwise structure necessary for compositional visual reasoning. In this paper, we introduce VisReason, a large-scale dataset designed to advance visual Chain-of-Thought reasoning. VisReason comprises 489K annotated examples spanning four diverse domains, each featuring multi-round, human-like rationales that guide MLLMs through interpretable visual reasoning steps. Building upon this, we curate VisReason-Pro, a 165K subset produced with a stronger expert-level GPT annotator, enriched with detailed reasoning traces and 3D spatial grounding via depth-informed annotations. Fine-tuning the state-of-the-art Qwen2.5-VL model on VisReason and VisReason-Pro yields substantial improvements in step-by-step visual reasoning accuracy, interpretability, and cross-benchmark generalization. These results demonstrate that VisReason equips MLLMs with more systematic and generalizable reasoning capabilities. We envision VisReason as a cornerstone for cultivating human-like visual reasoning, paving the way toward the next generation of multimodal intelligence.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Scientific archives now contain hundreds of petabytes of data across genomics, ecology, climate, and molecular biology that could reveal undiscovered patterns if systematically analyzed at scale. Large-scale, weakly-supervised datasets in language and vision have driven the development of foundation models whose internal representations encode structure (patterns, co-occurrences and statistical regularities) beyond their training objectives. Most existing methods extract structure only for pre-specified targets; they excel at confirmation but do not support open-ended discovery of unknown patterns. We ask whether sparse autoencoders (SAEs) can enable open-ended feature discovery from foundation model representations. We evaluate this question in controlled rediscovery studies, where the learned SAE features are tested for alignment with semantic concepts on a standard segmentation benchmark and compared against strong label-free alternatives on concept-alignment metrics. Applied to ecological imagery, the same procedure surfaces fine-grained anatomical structure without access to segmentation or part labels, providing a scientific case study with ground-truth validation. While our experiments focus on vision with an ecology case study, the method is domain-agnostic and applicable to models in other sciences (e.g., proteins, genomics, weather). Our results indicate that sparse decomposition provides a practical instrument for exploring what scientific foundation models have learned, an important prerequisite for moving from confirmation to genuine discovery.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We prove that a denoising diffusion sampler equipped with a sequential bias across the batch dimension is exactly an Euler-Maruyama integrator for overdamped Langevin dynamics. Each reverse denoising step, with its associated spring stiffness, can be interpreted as one step of a stochastic differential equation with an effective time step set jointly by the noise schedule and that stiffness. The learned score then plays the role of the drift, equivalently the gradient of a learned energy, yielding a precise correspondence between diffusion sampling and Langevin time evolution. This equivalence recasts molecular dynamics (MD) in terms of diffusion models. Accuracy is no longer tied to a fixed, extremely small MD time step; instead, it is controlled by two scalable knobs: model capacity, which governs how well the drift is approximated, and the number of denoising steps, which sets the integrator resolution. In practice, this leads to a fully data-driven MD framework that learns forces from uncorrelated equilibrium snapshots, requires no hand-engineered force fields, uses no trajectory data for training, and still preserves the Boltzmann distribution associated with the learned energy. We derive trajectory-level, information-theoretic error bounds that cleanly separate discretization error from score-model error, clarify how temperature enters through the effective spring, and show that the resulting sampler generates molecular trajectories with MD-like temporal correlations, even though the model is trained only on static configurations.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Computational approaches have previously shown various promises and pitfalls when it comes to the reliable identification of media frames. Generative LLMs like GPT and Claude are increasingly being used as content analytical tools, but how effective are they for frame analysis? We address this question by systematically evaluating them against their computational predecessors: bag-of-words models and encoder-only transformers; and traditional manual coding procedures. Our analysis rests on a novel gold standard dataset that we inductively and iteratively developed through the study, investigating six months of news coverage of the US Mpox epidemic of 2022. While we discover some potential applications for generative LLMs, we demonstrate that they were consistently outperformed by manual coders, and in some instances, by smaller language models. Some form of human validation was always necessary to determine appropriate model choice. Additionally, by examining how the suitability of various approaches depended on the nature of different tasks that were part of our frame analytical workflow, we provide insights as to how researchers may leverage the complementarity of these approaches to use them in tandem. We conclude by endorsing a methodologically pluralistic approach and put forth a roadmap for computational frame analysis for researchers going forward.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The growing adoption of photorealistic 3D facial avatars, particularly those utilizing efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting representations, introduces new risks of online identity theft, especially in systems that rely on biometric authentication. While effective adversarial masking methods have been developed for 2D images, a significant gap remains in achieving robust, viewpoint-consistent identity protection for dynamic 3D avatars. To address this, we present AEGIS, the first privacy-preserving identity masking framework for 3D Gaussian Avatars that maintains the subject's perceived characteristics. Our method aims to conceal identity-related facial features while preserving the avatar's perceptual realism and functional integrity. AEGIS applies adversarial perturbations to the Gaussian color coefficients, guided by a pre-trained face verification network, ensuring consistent protection across multiple viewpoints without retraining or modifying the avatar's geometry. AEGIS achieves complete de-identification, reducing face retrieval and verification accuracy to 0%, while maintaining high perceptual quality (SSIM = 0.9555, PSNR = 35.52 dB). It also preserves key facial attributes such as age, race, gender, and emotion, demonstrating strong privacy protection with minimal visual distortion.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Flexible energy resources are increasingly becoming common in smart grids. These resources are typically managed and controlled by aggregators that coordinate many resources to provide flexibility services. However, these aggregators and flexible energy resources are vulnerable, which could allow attackers to remotely control flexible energy resources to launch large-scale attacks on the grid. This paper investigates and evaluates the potential attack strategies that can be used to manipulate flexible energy resources to challenge the effectiveness of traditional grid stability measures and disrupt the first-swing stability of the power grid. Our work shows that although a large amount of power is required, the current flexibility capacities could potentially be sufficient to disrupt the grid on a national level.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Reliable image correspondences form the foundation of vision-based spatial perception, enabling recovery of 3D structure and camera poses. However, unconstrained feature matching across domains such as aerial, indoor, and outdoor scenes remains challenging due to large variations in appearance, scale and viewpoint. Feature matching has been conventionally formulated as a 2D-to-2D problem; however, recent 3D foundation models provides spatial feature matching properties based on two-view geometry. While powerful, we observe that these spatially coherent matches often concentrate on dominant planar regions, e.g., walls or ground surfaces, while being less sensitive to fine-grained geometric details, particularly under large viewpoint changes. To better understand these trade-offs, we first perform linear probe experiments to evaluate the performance of various vision foundation models for image matching. Building on these insights, we introduce SPIDER, a universal feature matching framework that integrates a shared feature extraction backbone with two specialized network heads for estimating both 2D-based and 3D-based correspondences from coarse to fine. Finally, we introduce an image-matching evaluation benchmark that focuses on unconstrained scenarios with large baselines. SPIDER significantly outperforms SoTA methods, demonstrating its strong ability as a universal image-matching method.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Reasoning segmentation seeks pixel-accurate masks for targets referenced by complex, often implicit instructions, requiring context-dependent reasoning over the scene. Recent multimodal language models have advanced instruction following segmentation, yet generalization remains limited. The key bottleneck is the high cost of curating diverse, high-quality pixel annotations paired with rich linguistic supervision leading to brittle performance under distribution shift. Therefore, we present CORA, a semi-supervised reasoning segmentation framework that jointly learns from limited labeled data and a large corpus of unlabeled images. CORA introduces three main components: 1) conditional visual instructions that encode spatial and contextual relationships between objects; 2) a noisy pseudo-label filter based on the consistency of Multimodal LLM's outputs across semantically equivalent queries; and 3) a token-level contrastive alignment between labeled and pseudo-labeled samples to enhance feature consistency. These components enable CORA to perform robust reasoning segmentation with minimal supervision, outperforming existing baselines under constrained annotation settings. CORA achieves state-of-the-art results, requiring as few as 100 labeled images on Cityscapes, a benchmark dataset for urban scene understanding, surpassing the baseline by $+2.3\%$. Similarly, CORA improves performance by $+2.4\%$ with only 180 labeled images on PanNuke, a histopathology dataset.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, interpretability, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Hyperspectral images capture rich spectral information that enables per-pixel material identification; however, spectral mixing often obscures pure material signatures. To address this challenge, we propose the Latent Dirichlet Transformer Variational Autoencoder (LDVAE-T) for hyperspectral unmixing. Our model combines the global context modeling capabilities of transformer architectures with physically meaningful constraints imposed by a Dirichlet prior in the latent space. This prior naturally enforces the sum-to-one and non-negativity conditions essential for abundance estimation, thereby improving the quality of predicted mixing ratios. A key contribution of LDVAE-T is its treatment of materials as bundled endmembers, rather than relying on fixed ground truth spectra. In the proposed method our decoder predicts, for each endmember and each patch, a mean spectrum together with a structured (segmentwise) covariance that captures correlated spectral variability. Reconstructions are formed by mixing these learned bundles with Dirichlet-distributed abundances garnered from a transformer encoder, allowing the model to represent intrinsic material variability while preserving physical interpretability. We evaluate our approach on three benchmark datasets, Samson, Jasper Ridge, and HYDICE Urban and show that LDVAE-T consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in abundance estimation and endmember extraction, as measured by root mean squared error and spectral angle distance, respectively.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, steal</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are critical to defending enterprise and industrial control environments, yet evaluating their effectiveness under realistic conditions remains an open challenge. Existing benchmarks rely on synthetic datasets (e.g., NSL-KDD, CICIDS2017) or scripted replay frameworks, which fail to capture adaptive adversary behavior. Even MITRE ATT&CK Evaluations, while influential, are host-centric and assume malware-driven compromise, thereby under-representing stealthy, multi-stage intrusions across IT and OT domains. We present StealthCup, a novel evaluation methodology that operationalizes IDS benchmarking as an evasion-focused Capture-the-Flag competition. Professional penetration testers engaged in multi-stage attack chains on a realistic IT/OT testbed, with scoring penalizing IDS detections. The event generated structured attacker writeups, validated detections, and PCAPs, host logs, and alerts. Our results reveal that out of 32 exercised attack techniques, 11 were not detected by any IDS configuration. Open-source systems (Wazuh, Suricata) produced high false-positive rates >90%, while commercial tools generated fewer false positives but also missed more attacks. Comparison with the Volt Typhoon APT advisory confirmed strong realism: all 28 applicable techniques were exercised, 19 appeared in writeups, and 9 in forensic traces. These findings demonstrate that StealthCup elicits attacker behavior closely aligned with state-sponsored TTPs, while exposing blind spots across both open-source and commercial IDS. The resulting datasets and methodology provide a reproducible foundation for future stealth-focused IDS evaluation.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid advancement of generative models such as StyleGAN2 and Stable Diffusion poses a growing threat to the authenticity of satellite imagery, which is increasingly vital for reliable analysis and decision-making across scientific and security domains. While deepfake detection has been extensively studied in facial contexts, satellite imagery presents distinct challenges, including terrain-level inconsistencies and structural artifacts. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive comparison between Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) for detecting AI-generated satellite images. Using a curated dataset of over 130,000 labeled RGB images from the DM-AER and FSI datasets, we show that ViTs significantly outperform CNNs in both accuracy (95.11 percent vs. 87.02 percent) and overall robustness, owing to their ability to model long-range dependencies and global semantic structures. We further enhance model transparency using architecture-specific interpretability methods, including Grad-CAM for CNNs and Chefer's attention attribution for ViTs, revealing distinct detection behaviors and validating model trustworthiness. Our results highlight the ViT's superior performance in detecting structural inconsistencies and repetitive textural patterns characteristic of synthetic imagery. Future work will extend this research to multispectral and SAR modalities and integrate frequency-domain analysis to further strengthen detection capabilities and safeguard satellite imagery integrity in high-stakes applications.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Digital computers are power-hungry and largely intolerant of damaged components, making them potentially difficult tools for energy-limited autonomous agents in uncertain environments. Recently developed Contrastive Local Learning Networks (CLLNs) - analog networks of self-adjusting nonlinear resistors - are inherently low-power and robust to physical damage, but were constructed to perform supervised learning. In this work we demonstrate success on two simple RL problems using Q-learning adapted for simulated CLLNs. Doing so makes explicit the components (beyond the network being trained) required to enact various tools in the RL toolbox, some of which (policy function and value function) are more natural in this system than others (replay buffer). We discuss assumptions such as the physical safety that digital hardware requires, CLLNs can forgo, and biological systems cannot rely on, and highlight secondary goals that are important in biology and trainable in CLLNs, but make little sense in digital computers.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) rely on effective multimodal alignment between pre-trained vision encoders and Large Language Models (LLMs) to integrate visual and textual information. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of attention patterns in efficient VLMs, revealing that concatenation-based architectures frequently fail to distinguish between semantically matching and non-matching image-text pairs. This is a key factor for object hallucination in these models. To address this, we introduce Attention-Guided Efficient Vision-Language Models (AGE-VLM), a novel framework that enhances visual grounding through interleaved cross-attention layers to instill vision capabilities in pretrained small language models. This enforces in VLM the ability "look" at the correct image regions by leveraging spatial knowledge distilled from the Segment Anything Model (SAM), significantly reducing hallucination. We validate our approach across different vision-centric benchmarks where our method is better or comparable to prior work on efficient VLMs. Our findings provide valuable insights for future research aimed at achieving enhanced visual and linguistic understanding in VLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multi-label feature selection (FS) reduces the dimensionality of multi-label data by removing irrelevant, noisy, and redundant features, thereby boosting the performance of multi-label learning models. However, existing methods typically require centralized data, which makes them unsuitable for distributed and federated environments where each device/client holds its own local dataset. Additionally, federated methods often assume that clients have labeled data, which is unrealistic in cases where clients lack the expertise or resources to label task-specific data. To address these challenges, we propose a Semi-Supervised Federated Multi-Label Feature Selection method, called SSFMLFS, where clients hold only unlabeled data, while the server has limited labeled data. SSFMLFS adapts fuzzy information theory to a federated setting, where clients compute fuzzy similarity matrices and transmit them to the server, which then calculates feature redundancy and feature-label relevancy degrees. A feature graph is constructed by modeling features as vertices, assigning relevancy and redundancy degrees as vertex weights and edge weights, respectively. PageRank is then applied to rank the features by importance. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets from various domains, including biology, images, music, and text, demonstrate that SSFMLFS outperforms other federated and centralized supervised and semi-supervised approaches in terms of three different evaluation metrics in non-IID data distribution setting.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Security bugs in the Linux kernel emerge endlessly and have attracted much attention. However, fixing security bugs in the Linux kernel could be incomplete due to human mistakes. Specifically, an incomplete fix fails to repair all the original security defects in the software, fails to properly repair the original security defects, or introduces new ones. In this paper, we study the fixes of incomplete security bugs in the Linux kernel for the first time, and reveal their characteristics, root causes, as well as detection. We first construct a dataset of incomplete security bug fixes in the Linux kernel and answer the following three questions. What are the characteristics of incomplete security bug fixes in the Linux kernel? What are the root causes behind them? How should they be detected to reduce security risks? We then have the three main insights in the following. (*Due to the notification of arXiv "The Abstract field cannot be longer than 1,920 characters", the appeared Abstract is shortened.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced natural language processing, but their massive parameter counts create substantial computational and memory challenges during deployment. Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate these challenges with minimal overhead. While existing PTQ methods can effectively quantize LLMs, they experience substantial accuracy loss at extremely low bit-widths, primarily due to high-impact parameters that significantly influence quantization performance. Several approaches address these issues by identifying and retaining the high-impact parameters in FP16 format. However, they apply fixed ratios of high-impact parameters across all layers, overlooking layer-wise sensitivity variations. In this paper, we propose a quadratic optimization framework that determines layer-specific ratios of high-impact parameters while considering inter-layer dependencies. We quantize high-impact parameters to moderate bit-widths, which often result in negligible performance degradation in quantized LLMs, while the remaining parameters can be quantized to extremely low bit-widths. Under the same resource-constrained budget, this allows for preserving more high-impact parameters than methods that keep selecting a few in FP16 format. Additionally, the proposed framework allows us to leverage an advanced quantization method that often requires extensive learnable parameters solely for high-impact parameters, while applying a computationally efficient method to the rest. Our approach achieves an effective balance between computational efficiency and model accuracy while maintaining high performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Procedural activities, ranging from routine cooking to complex surgical operations, are highly structured as a set of actions conducted in a specific temporal order. Despite their success on static images and short clips, current self-supervised learning methods often overlook the procedural nature that underpins such activities. We expose the lack of procedural awareness in current SSL methods with a motivating experiment: models pretrained on forward and time-reversed sequences produce highly similar features, confirming that their representations are blind to the underlying procedural order. To address this shortcoming, we propose PL-Stitch, a self-supervised framework that harnesses the inherent temporal order of video frames as a powerful supervisory signal. Our approach integrates two novel probabilistic objectives based on the Plackett-Luce (PL) model. The primary PL objective trains the model to sort sampled frames chronologically, compelling it to learn the global workflow progression. The secondary objective, a spatio-temporal jigsaw loss, complements the learning by capturing fine-grained, cross-frame object correlations. Our approach consistently achieves superior performance across five surgical and cooking benchmarks. Specifically, PL-Stitch yields significant gains in surgical phase recognition (e.g., +11.4 pp k-NN accuracy on Cholec80) and cooking action segmentation (e.g., +5.7 pp linear probing accuracy on Breakfast), demonstrating its effectiveness for procedural video representation learning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multi-view indoor radar perception has drawn attention due to its cost-effectiveness and low privacy risks. Existing methods often rely on {implicit} cross-view radar feature association, such as proposal pairing in RFMask or query-to-feature cross-attention in RETR, which can lead to ambiguous feature matches and degraded detection in complex indoor scenes. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{REXO} (multi-view Radar object dEtection with 3D bounding boX diffusiOn), which lifts the 2D bounding box (BBox) diffusion process of DiffusionDet into the 3D radar space. REXO utilizes these noisy 3D BBoxes to guide an {explicit} cross-view radar feature association, enhancing the cross-view radar-conditioned denoising process. By accounting for prior knowledge that the person is in contact with the ground, REXO reduces the number of diffusion parameters by determining them from this prior. Evaluated on two open indoor radar datasets, our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods by a margin of +4.22 AP on the HIBER dataset and +11.02 AP on the MMVR dataset.</li>

Leveraging our newly introduced PoETa v2 benchmark -- a comprehensive suite of over 40 tasks in Portuguese -- we assess more than 20 models covering a broad spectrum of training scales and computational resources. Our study reveals how computational investment and language-specific adaptation impact performance in Portuguese, while also analyzing performance gaps in comparison to equivalent tasks in English. Through this benchmark and analysis, PoETa v2 lays the groundwork for future research on Portuguese language modeling and evaluation. The benchmark is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models require significant computational resources for deployment, making quantization essential for practical applications. However, the main obstacle to effective quantization lies in systematic outliers in activations and weights, which cause substantial LLM performance degradation, especially at low-bit settings. While existing transformation-based methods like affine and rotation transformations successfully mitigate outliers, they apply the homogeneous transformation setting, i.e., using the same transformation types across all layers, ignoring the heterogeneous distribution characteristics within LLMs. In this paper, we propose an adaptive transformation selection framework that systematically determines optimal transformations on a per-layer basis. To this end, we first formulate transformation selection as a differentiable optimization problem to achieve the accurate transformation type for each layer. However, searching for optimal layer-wise transformations for every model is computationally expensive. To this end, we establish the connection between weight distribution kurtosis and accurate transformation type. Specifically, we propose an outlier-guided layer selection method using robust $z$-score normalization that achieves comparable performance to differentiable search with significantly reduced overhead. Comprehensive experiments on LLaMA family models demonstrate that our adaptive approach consistently outperforms the widely-used fixed transformation settings. For example, our method achieves an improvement of up to 4.58 perplexity points and a 2.11% gain in average six-task zero-shot accuracy under aggressive W3A3K2V2 quantization settings for the LLaMA-3-8B model compared to the current best existing method, FlatQuant, demonstrating the necessity of heterogeneous transformation selection for optimal LLM quantization.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models offer opportunities to simulate multi-party deliberation, but realistic modeling remains limited by a lack of speaker-attributed data. Transcripts produced via automatic speech recognition (ASR) assign anonymous speaker labels (e.g., Speaker_1), preventing models from capturing consistent human behavior. This work introduces a reproducible pipeline to transform public Zoom recordings into speaker-attributed transcripts with metadata like persona profiles and pragmatic action tags (e.g., [propose_motion]). We release three local government deliberation datasets: Appellate Court hearings, School Board meetings, and Municipal Council sessions. Fine-tuning LLMs to model specific participants using this "action-aware" data produces a 67% reduction in perplexity and nearly doubles classifier-based performance metrics for speaker fidelity and realism. Turing-style human evaluations show our simulations are often indistinguishable from real deliberations, providing a practical and scalable method for complex realistic civic simulations.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Off-policy evaluation (OPE) estimates the value of a contextual bandit policy prior to deployment. As such, OPE plays a critical role in ensuring safety in high-stakes domains such as healthcare. However, standard OPE approaches are limited by the size and coverage of the behavior dataset. While previous work has explored using expert-labeled counterfactual annotations to enhance dataset coverage, obtaining such annotations is expensive, limiting the scalability of prior approaches. We propose leveraging large language models (LLMs) to generate counterfactual annotations for OPE in medical domains. Our method uses domain knowledge to guide LLMs in predicting how key clinical features evolve under alternate treatments. These predicted features can then be transformed using known reward functions to create counterfactual annotations. We first evaluate the ability of several LLMs to predict clinical features across two patient subsets in MIMIC-IV, finding that state-of-the-art LLMs achieve comparable performance. Building on this capacity to predict clinical features, we generate LLM-based counterfactual annotations and incorporate them into an OPE estimator. Our empirical results analyze the benefits of counterfactual annotations under varying degrees of shift between the behavior and target policies. We find that in most cases, the LLM-based counterfactual annotations significantly improve OPE estimates up to a point. We provide an entropy-based metric to identify when additional annotations cease to be useful. Our results demonstrate that LLM-based counterfactual annotations offer a scalable approach for addressing coverage limitations in healthcare datasets, enabling safer deployment of decision-making policies in clinical settings.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Clustering algorithms have long been the topic of research, representing the more popular side of unsupervised learning. Since clustering analysis is one of the best ways to find some clarity and structure within raw data, this paper explores a novel approach to \textit{k}-means clustering. Here we present a \textit{k}-means clustering algorithm that takes both the within cluster distance (WCD) and the inter cluster distance (ICD) as the distance metric to cluster the data into \emph{k} clusters pre-determined by the Calinski-Harabasz criterion in order to provide a more robust output for the clustering analysis. The idea with this approach is that by including both the measurement metrics, the convergence of the data into their clusters becomes solidified and more robust. We run the algorithm with some synthetically produced data and also some benchmark data sets obtained from the UCI repository. The results show that the convergence of the data into their respective clusters is more accurate by using both WCD and ICD measurement metrics. The algorithm is also better at clustering the outliers into their true clusters as opposed to the traditional \textit{k} means method. We also address some interesting possible research topics that reveal themselves as we answer the questions we initially set out to address.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Volumetric learning underpins many 3D vision tasks such as completion, reconstruction, and mesh generation, yet training objectives still rely on Chamfer Distance (CD) or Earth Mover's Distance (EMD), which fail to balance recall and precision. We propose Quality-Aware Loss (QAL), a drop-in replacement for CD/EMD that combines a coverage-weighted nearest-neighbor term with an uncovered-ground-truth attraction term, explicitly decoupling recall and precision into tunable components. Across diverse pipelines, QAL achieves consistent coverage gains, improving by an average of +4.3 pts over CD and +2.8 pts over the best alternatives. Though modest in percentage, these improvements reliably recover thin structures and under-represented regions that CD/EMD overlook. Extensive ablations confirm stable performance across hyperparameters and across output resolutions, while full retraining on PCN and ShapeNet demonstrates generalization across datasets and backbones. Moreover, QAL-trained completions yield higher grasp scores under GraspNet evaluation, showing that improved coverage translates directly into more reliable robotic manipulation. QAL thus offers a principled, interpretable, and practical objective for robust 3D vision and safety-critical robotics pipelines</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deterministic inference is increasingly critical for large language model (LLM) applications such as LLM-as-a-judge evaluation, multi-agent systems, and Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, existing LLM serving frameworks exhibit non-deterministic behavior: identical inputs can yield different outputs when system configurations (e.g., tensor parallel (TP) size, batch size) vary, even under greedy decoding. This arises from the non-associativity of floating-point arithmetic and inconsistent reduction orders across GPUs. While prior work has addressed batch-size-related nondeterminism through batch-invariant kernels, determinism across different TP sizes remains an open problem, particularly in RL settings, where the training engine typically uses Fully Sharded Data Parallel (i.e., TP = 1) while the rollout engine relies on multi-GPU TP to maximize the inference throughput, creating a natural mismatch between the two. This precision mismatch problem may lead to suboptimal performance or even collapse for RL training. We identify and analyze the root causes of TP-induced inconsistency and propose Tree-Based Invariant Kernels (TBIK), a set of TP-invariant matrix multiplication and reduction primitives that guarantee bit-wise identical results regardless of TP size. Our key insight is to align intra- and inter-GPU reduction orders through a unified hierarchical binary tree structure. We implement these kernels in Triton and integrate them into vLLM and FSDP. Experiments confirm zero probability divergence and bit-wise reproducibility for deterministic inference across different TP sizes. Also, we achieve bit-wise identical results between vLLM and FSDP in RL training pipelines with different parallel strategy. Code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Foundation models hold promise for specialized medical imaging tasks, though their effectiveness in breast imaging remains underexplored. This study leverages BiomedCLIP as a foundation model to address challenges in model generalization. BiomedCLIP was adapted for automated BI-RADS breast density classification using multi-modality mammographic data (synthesized 2D images, digital mammography, and digital breast tomosynthesis). Using 96,995 images, we compared single-modality (s2D only) and multi-modality training approaches, addressing class imbalance through weighted contrastive learning. Both approaches achieved similar accuracy (multi-modality: 0.74, single-modality: 0.73), with the multi-modality model offering broader applicability across different imaging modalities and higher AUC values consistently above 0.84 across BI-RADS categories. External validation on the RSNA and EMBED datasets showed strong generalization capabilities (AUC range: 0.80-0.93). GradCAM visualizations confirmed consistent and clinically relevant attention patterns, highlighting the models interpretability and robustness. This research underscores the potential of foundation models for breast imaging applications, paving the way for future extensions for diagnostic tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Indoor localization using machine learning has gained traction due to the growing demand for location-based services. However, its long-term reliability is hindered by hardware/software variations across mobile devices, which shift the model's input distribution to create domain shifts. Further, evolving indoor environments can introduce new locations over time, expanding the output space to create class shifts, making static machine learning models ineffective over time. To address these challenges, we propose a novel unified continual learning framework for indoor localization called MOELO that, for the first time, jointly addresses domain-incremental and class-incremental learning scenarios. MOELO enables a lightweight, robust, and adaptive localization solution that can be deployed on resource-limited mobile devices and is capable of continual learning in dynamic, heterogeneous real-world settings. This is made possible by a mixture-of-experts architecture, where experts are incrementally trained per region and selected through an equiangular tight frame based gating mechanism ensuring efficient routing, and low-latency inference, all within a compact model footprint. Experimental evaluations show that MOELO achieves improvements of up to 25.6x in mean localization error, 44.5x in worst-case localization error, and 21.5x lesser forgetting compared to state-of-the-art frameworks across diverse buildings, mobile devices, and learning scenarios.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generating visual instructions in a given context is essential for developing interactive world simulators. While prior works address this problem through either text-guided image manipulation or video prediction, these tasks are typically treated in isolation. This separation reveals a fundamental issue: image manipulation methods overlook how actions unfold over time, while video prediction models often ignore the intended outcomes. To this end, we propose ShowMe, a unified framework that enables both tasks by selectively activating the spatial and temporal components of video diffusion models. In addition, we introduce structure and motion consistency rewards to improve structural fidelity and temporal coherence. Notably, this unification brings dual benefits: the spatial knowledge gained through video pretraining enhances contextual consistency and realism in non-rigid image edits, while the instruction-guided manipulation stage equips the model with stronger goal-oriented reasoning for video prediction. Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms expert models in both instructional image and video generation, highlighting the strength of video diffusion models as a unified action-object state transformer.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce a graded formulation of internal symbolic computation for transformers. The hidden space is endowed with a grading $V=\bigoplus_{g\in G}V_g$, and symbolic operations are realized as typed block maps (morphisms) $\phi_{h\leftarrow g}:V_g\to V_h$ that are activated selectively by a differentiable routing policy. A self-supervised \emph{graded utility functional}, defined as the loss reduction induced by a candidate morphism, governs activation and yields sparse, interpretable behavior. We develop the algebraic and geometric foundations: an internal model category whose objects are homogeneous components and whose morphisms are admissible grade transitions; adjoint pairs encoding typed round trips; and information-geometric interpretations in terms of KL gain, mirror descent with Bregman divergences, and Fisher natural gradients. Methodologically, we specify a utility--aware routing mechanism and objective that remain fully end-to-end differentiable. Analytic case studies and lightweight sanity checks illustrate selective morphic activation on hybrid symbolic-linguistic tasks. The framework unifies symbolic computation, geometry, and self--supervised learning within the \emph{graded transformer} formalism \cite{sh-89,sh-95}, while subsuming prior external-tool paradigms (e.g., Toolformer \cite{toolformer2023}) as a special case via functorial internalization.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this work, we present homomorphic encryption-based vaults (Haults), a permissioned privacy-preserving smart wallet protocol for VM-enabled blockchains that keeps users' balances confidential, as well as the amounts transacted to other parties. To comply with regulations, we include optional compliance features that allow specific entities (the auditors) to retrieve transaction amounts or execute force transfers when necessary. Our solution uses ElGamal over elliptic curves to encrypt balances, combined with zero-knowledge proofs to verify the correctness of transaction amounts and the integrity of the sender's updated balance, among other security checks. We provide a detailed explanation of the protocol, including a security discussion and benchmarks from our proof-of-concept implementation, which yield great results. Beyond in-contract issued tokens, we also provide a thorough explanation on how our solution can be compatible with external ones (e.g., Ether or any ERC20).</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Fine-tuning large-scale text-to-video diffusion models to add new generative controls, such as those over physical camera parameters (e.g., shutter speed or aperture), typically requires vast, high-fidelity datasets that are difficult to acquire. In this work, we propose a data-efficient fine-tuning strategy that learns these controls from sparse, low-quality synthetic data. We show that not only does fine-tuning on such simple data enable the desired controls, it actually yields superior results to models fine-tuned on photorealistic "real" data. Beyond demonstrating these results, we provide a framework that justifies this phenomenon both intuitively and quantitatively.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Transformers can acquire Chain-of-Thought (CoT) capabilities to solve complex reasoning tasks through fine-tuning. Reinforcement learning (RL) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) are two primary approaches to this end, yet their underlying mechanisms and differences remain theoretically unclear. In this work, we examine these aspects specifically for learning $k$-sparse Boolean functions with a one-layer transformer and intermediate supervision that is akin to CoT. In particular, we consider $k$-sparse Boolean functions that can be recursively decomposed into fixed 2-sparse Boolean functions. We analyze the learning dynamics of fine-tuning the transformer via either RL or SFT with CoT to identify sufficient conditions for it to provably learn these functions. We verify that these conditions hold for three basic examples, including $k$-PARITY, $k$-AND, and $k$-OR, thus demonstrating the learnability of both approaches. Notably, we reveal that RL and SFT exhibit distinct learning behaviors: RL learns the whole CoT chain simultaneously, whereas SFT learns the CoT chain step-by-step. Overall, our findings provide theoretical insights into the underlying mechanisms of RL and SFT as well as how they differ in triggering the CoT capabilities of transformers.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent research has established that the impact of context in a vanilla transformer can be represented implicitly by forming a token-dependent, rank-1 patch to its MLP weights. This work extends that foundational theory to the diverse architectures of modern Large Language Models. We first demonstrate a precise, analytical solution for a Gemma-style transformer block, proving that the entire effect of a context can be perfectly mapped to rank-1 patches on its MLP weight matrices and a patch to the RMSNorm scale. We then generalize this result, providing a constructive proof and algorithm for multi-layer models. To unify these findings, we introduce a general framework centered on two core properties: input controllability and output controllability. We prove that a perfect implicit weight patch is possible for any MLP block where the inner function is input-controllable and the outer function is output-controllable. This provides a simpler and more powerful lens for understanding how transformer models transmute prompts into effective weights. This setup generalizes to a wide range of modern LLM architectures including gating, pre-/post-norm, mixture of experts and sequential/parallel transformer blocks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Embodied AI agents exploit reward signal flaws through reward hacking, achieving high proxy scores while failing true objectives. We introduce Mechanistically Interpretable Task Decomposition (MITD), a hierarchical transformer architecture with Planner, Coordinator, and Executor modules that detects and mitigates reward hacking. MITD decomposes tasks into interpretable subtasks while generating diagnostic visualizations including Attention Waterfall Diagrams and Neural Pathway Flow Charts. Experiments on 1,000 HH-RLHF samples reveal that decomposition depths of 12 to 25 steps reduce reward hacking frequency by 34 percent across four failure modes. We present new paradigms showing that mechanistically grounded decomposition offers a more effective way to detect reward hacking than post-hoc behavioral monitoring.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>LLM applications (i.e., LLM apps) leverage the powerful capabilities of LLMs to provide users with customized services, revolutionizing traditional application development. While the increasing prevalence of LLM-powered applications provides users with unprecedented convenience, it also brings forth new security challenges. For such an emerging ecosystem, the security community lacks sufficient understanding of the LLM application ecosystem, especially regarding the capability boundaries of the applications themselves. In this paper, we systematically analyzed the new development paradigm and defined the concept of the LLM app capability space. We also uncovered potential new risks beyond jailbreak that arise from ambiguous capability boundaries in real-world scenarios, namely, capability downgrade and upgrade. To evaluate the impact of these risks, we designed and implemented an LLM app capability evaluation framework, LLMApp-Eval. First, we collected application metadata across 4 platforms and conducted a cross-platform ecosystem analysis. Then, we evaluated the risks for 199 popular applications among 4 platforms and 6 open-source LLMs. We identified that 178 (89.45%) potentially affected applications, which can perform tasks from more than 15 scenarios or be malicious. We even found 17 applications in our study that executed malicious tasks directly, without applying any adversarial rewriting. Furthermore, our experiments also reveal a positive correlation between the quality of prompt design and application robustness. We found that well-designed prompts enhance security, while poorly designed ones can facilitate abuse. We hope our work inspires the community to focus on the real-world risks of LLM applications and foster the development of a more robust LLM application ecosystem.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Most applications of generative AI involve a sequential interaction in which a person inputs a prompt and waits for a response, and where reaction time and adaptivity are not important factors. In contrast, live jamming is a collaborative interaction that requires real-time coordination and adaptation without access to the other player's future moves, while preserving diversity to sustain a creative flow. Reinforcement learning post-training enables effective adaptation through on-policy interaction, yet it often reduces output diversity by exploiting coherence-based rewards. This collapse, known as ``reward hacking'', affects many RL post-training pipelines, but is especially harmful in live jamming, where musical creativity relies on dynamic variation and mutual responsiveness. In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial training method on policy-generated trajectories to mitigate reward hacking in RL post-training for melody-to-chord accompaniment. A co-evolving discriminator separates policy trajectories from the data distribution, while the policy maximizes the discriminator output in addition to coherence rewards to prevent collapse to trivial outputs. We evaluate accompaniment quality and output diversity in simulation with both fixed test melodies and learned melody agents, and we conduct a user study with the model deployed in a real-time interactive system with expert musicians. Quantitative evaluation and user feedback demonstrate improved output diversity, harmonic coherence, adaptation speed and user agency. Our results demonstrate a simple yet effective method to mitigate reward hacking in RL post-training of generative sequence models.</li>

We propose MGA-VQA, a multi-modal framework that integrates token-level encoding, spatial graph reasoning, memory-augmented inference, and question-guided compression. Unlike prior black-box models, MGA-VQA introduces interpretable graph-based decision pathways and structured memory access for enhanced reasoning transparency. Evaluation across six benchmarks (FUNSD, CORD, SROIE, DocVQA, STE-VQA, and RICO) demonstrates superior accuracy and efficiency, with consistent improvements in both answer prediction and spatial localization.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in generative models have produced strong results for static 3D shapes, whereas articulated 3D generation remains challenging due to action-dependent deformations and limited datasets. We introduce ArticFlow, a two-stage flow matching framework that learns a controllable velocity field from noise to target point sets under explicit action control. ArticFlow couples (i) a latent flow that transports noise to a shape-prior code and (ii) a point flow that transports points conditioned on the action and the shape prior, enabling a single model to represent diverse articulated categories and generalize across actions. On MuJoCo Menagerie, ArticFlow functions both as a generative model and as a neural simulator: it predicts action-conditioned kinematics from a compact prior and synthesizes novel morphologies via latent interpolation. Compared with object-specific simulators and an action-conditioned variant of static point-cloud generators, ArticFlow achieves higher kinematic accuracy and better shape quality. Results show that action-conditioned flow matching is a practical route to controllable and high-quality articulated mechanism generation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive performance, but high-resolution visual inputs result in long sequences of visual tokens and substantial inference latency. Reducing redundant visual tokens is critical to ease computational/memory burdens while preserving performance, enabling MLLM deployment in resource-constrained or latency-sensitive scenarios. Current visual token pruning methods mainly rely on attention-based redundancy analysis and are tailored to dense architectures. We propose Fast Multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (FastMMoE), a training-free acceleration framework for mixture-of-experts (MoE) based MLLMs, developed from a routing analysis perspective. FastMMoE combines two complementary strategies: (i) expert activation reduction for visual tokens to minimize unnecessary expert computation; and (ii) routing-aware token pruning that leverages similarity in routing probability distributions to identify and remove highly redundant visual tokens. Experiments on large-scale MoE-MLLMs such as DeepSeek-VL2 and InternVL3.5 demonstrate that FastMMoE can reduce FLOPs by up to 55.0% while retaining approximately 95.5% of the original performance, consistently outperforming dense-model pruning baselines including FastV and SparseVLM across multiple retention rates.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the personalization process of large-scale text-to-image models, overfitting often occurs when learning specific subject from a limited number of images. Existing methods, such as DreamBooth, mitigate this issue through a class-specific prior-preservation loss, which requires increased computational cost during training and limits user control during inference time. To address these limitations, we propose Mask-Integrated Negative Attention Diffusion (MINDiff). MINDiff introduces a novel concept, negative attention, which suppresses the subject's influence in masked irrelevant regions. We achieve this by modifying the cross-attention mechanism during inference. This enables semantic control and improves text alignment by reducing subject dominance in irrelevant regions. Additionally, during the inference time, users can adjust a scale parameter lambda to balance subject fidelity and text alignment. Our qualitative and quantitative experiments on DreamBooth models demonstrate that MINDiff mitigates overfitting more effectively than class-specific prior-preservation loss. As our method operates entirely at inference time and does not alter the model architecture, it can be directly applied to existing DreamBooth models without re-training.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Distributed Fiber Optic Sensing (DFOS) has shown strong potential in perimeter security due to its capability of monitoring vibration events across long distances with fine spatial resolution. However, practical DFOS systems face three critical challenges: (1) signal patterns of the same activity vary drastically under different fiber deployment types (e.g., underground, wall-mounted), causing domain shift; (2) labeled data in new deployment scenarios is often scarce or entirely unavailable, limiting model adaptability; and (3) even within source domains, data scarcity makes it difficult to capture intra-class diversity for robust learning. To address these challenges, we propose a novel meta-learning framework, DUPLE, for cross-deployment DFOS activity identification. First, a dual-domain multi-prototype learner fuses temporal and frequency domain features, enhancing the model's generalization ability under signal distribution shifts. Second, a Statistical Guided Network (SGN) infers domain importance and prototype sensitivity from raw statistical features, providing data-driven prior information for learning in unlabeled or unseen domains. Third, a query-aware prototype aggregation module adaptively selects and combines relevant prototypes, thereby improving classification performance even with limited data. Extensive experiments on cross-deployment DFOS datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baseline approaches in domain generalization settings, enabling robust event recognition across diverse fiber configurations with minimal labeled data.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances factual grounding in large language models (LLMs) by incorporating retrieved evidence, but LLM accuracy declines when long or noisy contexts exceed the model's effective attention span. Existing pre-generation filters rely on heuristics or uncalibrated LLM confidence scores, offering no statistical control over retained evidence. We evaluate and demonstrate context engineering through conformal prediction, a coverage-controlled filtering framework that removes irrelevant content while preserving recall of supporting evidence. Using both embedding- and LLM-based scoring functions, we test this approach on the NeuCLIR and RAGTIME collections. Conformal filtering consistently meets its target coverage, ensuring that a specified fraction of relevant snippets are retained, and reduces retained context by 2-3x relative to unfiltered retrieval. On NeuCLIR, downstream factual accuracy measured by ARGUE F1 improves under strict filtering and remains stable at moderate coverage, indicating that most discarded material is redundant or irrelevant. These results demonstrate that conformal prediction enables reliable, coverage-controlled context reduction in RAG, offering a model-agnostic and principled approach to context engineering.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recently, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has significantly enhanced the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but Vision-Language Models (VLMs) still struggle with multi-step reasoning tasks due to limited multimodal reasoning data. To bridge this gap, researchers have explored methods to transfer CoT reasoning from LLMs to VLMs. However, existing approaches either need high training costs or require architectural alignment. In this paper, we use Linear Artificial Tomography (LAT) to empirically show that LLMs and VLMs share similar low-frequency latent representations of CoT reasoning despite architectural differences. Based on this insight, we propose L2V-CoT, a novel training-free latent intervention approach that transfers CoT reasoning from LLMs to VLMs. L2V-CoT extracts and resamples low-frequency CoT representations from LLMs in the frequency domain, enabling dimension matching and latent injection into VLMs during inference to enhance reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms training-free baselines and even surpasses supervised methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Dataset distillation compresses large-scale datasets into compact, highly informative synthetic data, significantly reducing storage and training costs. However, existing research primarily focuses on balanced datasets and struggles to perform under real-world long-tailed distributions. In this work, we emphasize the critical role of soft labels in long-tailed dataset distillation and uncover the underlying mechanisms contributing to performance degradation. Specifically, we derive an imbalance-aware generalization bound for model trained on distilled dataset. We then identify two primary sources of soft-label bias, which originate from the distillation model and the distilled images, through systematic perturbation of the data imbalance levels. To address this, we propose ADSA, an Adaptive Soft-label Alignment module that calibrates the entangled biases. This lightweight module integrates seamlessly into existing distillation pipelines and consistently improves performance. On ImageNet-1k-LT with EDC and IPC=50, ADSA improves tail-class accuracy by up to 11.8% and raises overall accuracy to 41.4%. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ADSA provides a robust and generalizable solution under limited label budgets and across a range of distillation techniques.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Heterogeneous graphs are widely present in real-world complex networks, where the diversity of node and relation types leads to complex and rich semantics. Efforts for modeling complex relation semantics in heterogeneous graphs are restricted by the limitations of predefined semantic dependencies and the scarcity of supervised signals. The advanced pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm leverages graph structure to provide rich self-supervised signals, but introduces semantic gaps between tasks. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer significant potential to address the semantic issues of relations and tasks in heterogeneous graphs through their strong reasoning capabilities in textual modality, but their incorporation into heterogeneous graphs is largely limited by computational complexity. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an Efficient LLM-Aware (ELLA) framework for heterogeneous graphs, addressing the above issues. To capture complex relation semantics, we propose an LLM-aware Relation Tokenizer that leverages LLM to encode multi-hop, multi-type relations. To reduce computational complexity, we further employ a Hop-level Relation Graph Transformer, which help reduces the complexity of LLM-aware relation reasoning from exponential to linear. To bridge semantic gaps between pre-training and fine-tuning tasks, we introduce the fine-grained task-aware textual Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompts. Extensive experiments on four heterogeneous graphs show that our proposed ELLA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the performance and efficiency. In particular, ELLA scales up to 13b-parameter LLMs and achieves up to a 4x speedup compared with existing LLM-based methods. Our code is publicly available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Face anti-spoofing (FAS) has recently advanced in multimodal fusion, cross-domain generalization, and interpretability. With large language models and reinforcement learning (RL), strategy-based training offers new opportunities to jointly model these aspects. However, multimodal reasoning is more complex than unimodal reasoning, requiring accurate feature representation and cross-modal verification while facing scarce, high-quality annotations, which makes direct application of RL sub-optimal. We identify two key limitations of supervised fine-tuning plus RL (SFT+RL) for multimodal FAS: (1) limited multimodal reasoning paths restrict the use of complementary modalities and shrink the exploration space after SFT, weakening the effect of RL; and (2) mismatched single-task supervision versus diverse reasoning paths causes reasoning confusion, where models may exploit shortcuts by mapping images directly to answers and ignoring the intended reasoning. To address this, we propose PA-FAS, which enhances reasoning paths by constructing high-quality extended reasoning sequences from limited annotations, enriching paths and relaxing exploration constraints. We further introduce an answer-shuffling mechanism during SFT to force comprehensive multimodal analysis instead of using superficial cues, thereby encouraging deeper reasoning and mitigating shortcut learning. PA-FAS significantly improves multimodal reasoning accuracy and cross-domain generalization, and better unifies multimodal fusion, generalization, and interpretability for trustworthy FAS.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Given just a few glimpses of a scene, can you imagine the movie playing out as the camera glides through it? That's the lens we take on \emph{sparse-input novel view synthesis}, not only as filling spatial gaps between widely spaced views, but also as \emph{completing a natural video} unfolding through space. We recast the task as \emph{test-time natural video completion}, using powerful priors from \emph{pretrained video diffusion models} to hallucinate plausible in-between views. Our \emph{zero-shot, generation-guided} framework produces pseudo views at novel camera poses, modulated by an \emph{uncertainty-aware mechanism} for spatial coherence. These synthesized frames densify supervision for \emph{3D Gaussian Splatting} (3D-GS) for scene reconstruction, especially in under-observed regions. An iterative feedback loop lets 3D geometry and 2D view synthesis inform each other, improving both the scene reconstruction and the generated views. The result is coherent, high-fidelity renderings from sparse inputs \emph{without any scene-specific training or fine-tuning}. On LLFF, DTU, DL3DV, and MipNeRF-360, our method significantly outperforms strong 3D-GS baselines under extreme sparsity.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Many deployed learning systems must update models on streaming data under memory constraints. The default strategy, sequential fine-tuning on each new phase, is architecture-agnostic but often suffers catastrophic forgetting when later phases correspond to different sub-populations or tasks. Replay with a finite buffer is a simple alternative, yet its behaviour across generative and predictive objectives is not well understood. We present a unified study of stateful replay for streaming autoencoding, time series forecasting, and classification. We view both sequential fine-tuning and replay as stochastic gradient methods for an ideal joint objective, and use a gradient alignment analysis to show when mixing current and historical samples should reduce forgetting. We then evaluate a single replay mechanism on six streaming scenarios built from Rotated MNIST, ElectricityLoadDiagrams 2011-2014, and Airlines delay data, using matched training budgets and three seeds. On heterogeneous multi task streams, replay reduces average forgetting by a factor of two to three, while on benign time based streams both methods perform similarly. These results position stateful replay as a strong and simple baseline for continual learning in streaming environments.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) excel at chain-of-thought reasoning but face distribution shift at test-time and a lack of verifiable supervision. Recent test-time reinforcement learning (TTRL) methods derive label-free pseudo-rewards from self-consistency voting over sampled trajectories, yet they often collapse: the majority-vote reward prevails, responses shorten, and Pass@1 declines. We trace this to uniform sequence updates in which most tokens are low-entropy followers, while a small high-entropy subset determines the reasoning branches. Thus we propose SPINE, a token-selective test-time reinforcement learning framework that (i) updates only forking tokens, the high-entropy branch points identified from forward-pass statistics, and (ii) applies an entropy-band regularizer at those tokens to sustain exploration when entropy is too low and to suppress noisy supervision when it is too high. SPINE plugs into GRPO-style objectives, optionally with a KL anchor, and requires no labels or reward models. Across ten benchmarks spanning multimodal VQA, general and expert QA, mathematical reasoning, and medical QA, SPINE consistently improves Pass@1 over TTRL while avoiding response-length collapse and yielding more stable training dynamics on both LLM and MLLM backbones. These results indicate that aligning updates with chain-of-thought branch points is a simple and label-free mechanism for stable and effective test-time adaptation in reasoning models.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>V2X prediction can alleviate perception incompleteness caused by limited line of sight through fusing trajectory data from infrastructure and vehicles, which is crucial to traffic safety and efficiency. However, in dense traffic scenarios, frequent identity switching of targets hinders cross-view association and fusion. Meanwhile, multi-source information tends to generate redundant interactions during the encoding stage, and traditional vehicle-centric encoding leads to large amounts of repetitive historical trajectory feature encoding, degrading real-time inference performance. To address these challenges, we propose V2X-RECT, a trajectory prediction framework designed for high-density environments. It enhances data association consistency, reduces redundant interactions, and reuses historical information to enable more efficient and accurate prediction. Specifically, we design a multi-source identity matching and correction module that leverages multi-view spatiotemporal relationships to achieve stable and consistent target association, mitigating the adverse effects of mismatches on trajectory encoding and cross-view feature fusion. Then we introduce traffic signal-guided interaction module, encoding trend of traffic light changes as features and exploiting their role in constraining spatiotemporal passage rights to accurately filter key interacting vehicles, while capturing the dynamic impact of signal changes on interaction patterns. Furthermore, a local spatiotemporal coordinate encoding enables reusable features of historical trajectories and map, supporting parallel decoding and significantly improving inference efficiency. Extensive experimental results across V2X-Seq and V2X-Traj datasets demonstrate that our V2X-RECT achieves significant improvements compared to SOTA methods, while also enhancing robustness and inference efficiency across diverse traffic densities.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and video agent systems have significantly improved general video understanding.

To bridge this gap, we propose SciEducator, the first iterative self-evolving multi-agent system for scientific video comprehension and education. Rooted in the classical Deming Cycle from management science, our design reformulates its Plan-Do-Study-Act philosophy into a self-evolving reasoning and feedback mechanism, which facilitates the interpretation of intricate scientific activities in videos. Moreover, SciEducator can produce multimodal educational content tailored to specific scientific processes, including textual instructions, visual guides, audio narrations, and interactive references. To support evaluation, we construct SciVBench, a benchmark consisting of 500 expert-verified and literature-grounded science QA pairs across five categories, covering physical, chemical, and everyday phenomena. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SciEducator substantially outperforms leading closed-source MLLMs (e.g., Gemini, GPT-4o) and state-of-the-art video agents on the benchmark, establishing a new paradigm for the community.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Processing long videos with multimodal large language models (MLLMs) poses a significant computational challenge, as the model's self-attention mechanism scales quadratically with the number of video tokens, resulting in high computational demand and slow inference speed. Current solutions, such as rule-based sub-sampling, learned frame selector, or memory-based summarization, often introduce their own trade-offs: they compromise accuracy, necessitate additional training, or decrease inference speed. In this paper, we propose Test-Time Temporal Sampling (T3S), a training-free, plug-and-play inference wrapper that enables MLLMs to process long videos both efficiently and effectively. T3S exploits spatiotemporal redundancy by generating multiple short and diverse subsequences of video tokens at inference time, packing them within a single forward pass, and aggregating their predictions. This multi-subsequence formulation broadens visual coverage while reducing the computational cost of self-attention from $O(L^2)$ to $O(\sum_{i=1}^m \alpha_i^2L^2)$, where $\sum_{i=1}^m \alpha_i^2 < 1$. Extensive experiments on long video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that T3S improves accuracy by up to 3.1% and reduces first token delay by $2.04\times$, all with minimal integration effort. Our approach operates entirely at inference time, requires no model modifications or fine-tuning, and is compatible with a wide range of pretrained MLLMs. T3S turns video redundancy into a computational advantage, offering a scalable solution for long-video understanding.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Hallucination in large language models (LLMs) is a fundamental challenge, particularly in open-domain question answering. Prior work attempts to detect hallucination with model-internal signals such as token-level entropy or generation consistency, while the connection between pretraining data exposure and hallucination is underexplored. Existing studies show that LLMs underperform on long-tail knowledge, i.e., the accuracy of the generated answer drops for the ground-truth entities that are rare in pretraining. However, examining whether data coverage itself can serve as a detection signal is overlooked. We propose a complementary question: Does lexical training-data coverage of the question and/or generated answer provide additional signal for hallucination detection? To investigate this, we construct scalable suffix arrays over RedPajama's 1.3-trillion-token pretraining corpus to retrieve $n$-gram statistics for both prompts and model generations. We evaluate their effectiveness for hallucination detection across three QA benchmarks. Our observations show that while occurrence-based features are weak predictors when used alone, they yield modest gains when combined with log-probabilities, particularly on datasets with higher intrinsic model uncertainty. These findings suggest that lexical coverage features provide a complementary signal for hallucination detection. All code and suffix-array infrastructure are provided at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Understanding social interaction in video requires reasoning over a dynamic interplay of verbal and non-verbal cues: who is speaking, to whom, and with what gaze or gestures. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are natural candidates, simply adding visual inputs yields surprisingly inconsistent gains on social tasks. Our quantitative analysis of cross-modal attention inside state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals a core failure mode: in multi-speaker scenes, visual and textual tokens lack speaker-consistent alignment, exhibiting substantially weaker cross-modal attention than in object-centric images. To address this, we propose a multimodal multi-speaker attention alignment method that can be integrated into existing MLLMs. First, we introduce dynamic cross-modal head selection to identify attention heads most responsible for grounding. Then, an adaptive social-aware attention bias, computed from existing attention patterns and speaker locations, is injected into the attention mechanism. This bias reinforces alignment between a speaker's visual representation and their utterances without introducing trainable parameters or architectural changes. We integrate our method into three distinct MLLMs (LLaVA-NeXT-Video, Qwen2.5-VL, and InternVL3) and evaluate on three benchmarks (TVQA+, MMSI, OnlineMMSI). Across four social tasks, results demonstrate that our approach improves the ability of MLLMs and achieves state-of-the-art results. Attention visualizations confirm our method successfully focuses the model on speaker-relevant regions, enabling more robust multi-party social reasoning.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the rapid rise of short-form videos, TikTok has become one of the most influential platforms among children and teenagers, but also a source of harmful content that can affect their perception and behavior. Such content, often subtle or deceptive, challenges traditional moderation methods due to the massive volume and real-time nature of uploads. This paper presents MTikGuard, a real-time multimodal harmful content detection system for TikTok, with three key contributions: (1) an extended TikHarm dataset expanded to 4,723 labeled videos by adding diverse real-world samples, (2) a multimodal classification framework integrating visual, audio, and textual features to achieve state-of-the-art performance with 89.37% accuracy and 89.45% F1-score, and (3) a scalable streaming architecture built on Apache Kafka and Apache Spark for real-time deployment. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining dataset expansion, advanced multimodal fusion, and robust deployment for practical large-scale social media content moderation.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Growing demands for clinical data privacy and storage constraints have spurred advances in Source Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SFUDA). SFUDA addresses the domain shift by adapting models from the source domain to the unseen target domain without accessing source data, even when target-domain labels are unavailable. However, SFUDA faces significant challenges: the absence of source domain data and label supervision in the target domain due to source free and unsupervised settings. To address these issues, we propose HEAL, a novel SFUDA framework that integrates Hierarchical denoising, Edge-guided selection, size-Aware fusion, and Learning-free characteristic. Large-scale cross-modality experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing SFUDA approaches, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Developing a robust visual quality assessment (VQualA) large multi-modal model (LMM) requires achieving versatility, powerfulness, and transferability. However, existing VQualA LMMs typically focus on a single task and rely on full-parameter fine-tuning, which makes them prone to overfitting on specific modalities or task types, thereby limiting their generalization capacity and transferability. To address this, we propose a vision-encoder-centered generative pre-training pipeline and develop the VITAL-Series LMMs. (1) We adopt a machine-executed annotation-scrutiny paradigm, constructing over 4.5M vision-language (VL) pairs-the largest VQualA training dataset to date. (2) We employ a multi-task training workflow that simultaneously enhances the model's quantitative scoring precision and strengthens its capability for quality interpretation across both image and video modalities. (3) Building upon the vision encoder, we realize an efficient model zoo extension: the model zoo exhibits strong zero-shot performance, and each paired decoder requires only a swift warm-up using less than 1/1000 of the pre-training data to achieve performance comparable to the fully trained counterpart. Overall, our work lays a cornerstone for advancing toward the foundation LMM for VQualA.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper introduces a hybrid framework for portfolio optimization that fuses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) forecasting with a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) reinforcement learning strategy. The proposed system leverages the predictive power of deep recurrent networks to capture temporal dependencies, while the PPO agent adaptively refines portfolio allocations in continuous action spaces, allowing the system to anticipate trends while adjusting dynamically to market shifts. Using multi-asset datasets covering U.S. and Indonesian equities, U.S. Treasuries, and major cryptocurrencies from January 2018 to December 2024, the model is evaluated against several baselines, including equal-weight, index-style, and single-model variants (LSTM-only and PPO-only). The framework's performance is benchmarked against equal-weighted, index-based, and single-model approaches (LSTM-only and PPO-only) using annualized return, volatility, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown metrics, each adjusted for transaction costs. The results indicate that the hybrid architecture delivers higher returns and stronger resilience under non-stationary market regimes, suggesting its promise as a robust, AI-driven framework for dynamic portfolio optimization.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large-scale vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have recently achieved remarkable performance in retrieval tasks, yet their potential for Video-based Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification (VVI-ReID) remains largely unexplored. The primary challenges are narrowing the modality gap and leveraging spatiotemporal information in video sequences. To address the above issues, in this paper, we propose a novel cross-modality feature learning framework named X-ReID for VVI-ReID. Specifically, we first propose a Cross-modality Prototype Collaboration (CPC) to align and integrate features from different modalities, guiding the network to reduce the modality discrepancy. Then, a Multi-granularity Information Interaction (MII) is designed, incorporating short-term interactions from adjacent frames, long-term cross-frame information fusion, and cross-modality feature alignment to enhance temporal modeling and further reduce modality gaps. Finally, by integrating multi-granularity information, a robust sequence-level representation is achieved. Extensive experiments on two large-scale VVI-ReID benchmarks (i.e., HITSZ-VCM and BUPTCampus) demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>RGB-Thermal (RGBT) tracking aims to exploit visible and thermal infrared modalities for robust all-weather object tracking. However, existing RGBT trackers struggle to resolve modality discrepancies, which poses great challenges for robust feature representation. This limitation hinders effective cross-modal information propagation and fusion, which significantly reduces the tracking accuracy. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Contextual Aggregation with Deformable Alignment framework called CADTrack for RGBT Tracking. To be specific, we first deploy the Mamba-based Feature Interaction (MFI) that establishes efficient feature interaction via state space models. This interaction module can operate with linear complexity, reducing computational cost and improving feature discrimination. Then, we propose the Contextual Aggregation Module (CAM) that dynamically activates backbone layers through sparse gating based on the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). This module can encode complementary contextual information from cross-layer features. Finally, we propose the Deformable Alignment Module (DAM) to integrate deformable sampling and temporal propagation, mitigating spatial misalignment and localization drift. With the above components, our CADTrack achieves robust and accurate tracking in complex scenarios. Extensive experiments on five RGBT tracking benchmarks verify the effectiveness of our proposed method. The source code is released at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Maintaining economic efficiency and operational reliability in microgrid energy management systems under cyberattack conditions remains challenging. Most approaches assume non-anomalous measurements, make predictions with unquantified uncertainties, and do not mitigate malicious attacks on renewable forecasts for energy management optimization. This paper presents a comprehensive cyber-resilient framework integrating federated Long Short-Term Memory-based photovoltaic forecasting with a novel two-stage cascade false data injection attack detection and energy management system optimization. The approach combines autoencoder reconstruction error with prediction uncertainty quantification to enable attack-resilient energy storage scheduling while preserving data privacy. Extreme false data attack conditions were studied that caused 58% forecast degradation and 16.9\% operational cost increases. The proposed integrated framework reduced false positive detections by 70%, recovered 93.7% of forecasting performance losses, and achieved 5\% operational cost savings, mitigating 34.7% of attack-induced economic losses. Results demonstrate that precision-focused cascade detection with multi-signal fusion outperforms single-signal approaches, validating security-performance synergy for decentralized microgrids.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Exemplar-free class-incremental learning (EFCIL) aims to retain old knowledge acquired in the previous task while learning new classes, without storing the previous images due to storage constraints or privacy concerns. In EFCIL, the plasticity-stability dilemma, learning new tasks versus catastrophic forgetting, is a significant challenge, primarily due to the unavailability of images from earlier tasks. In this paper, we introduce adversarial pseudo-replay (APR), a method that perturbs the images of the new task with adversarial attack, to synthesize the pseudo-replay images online without storing any replay samples. During the new task training, the adversarial attack is conducted on the new task images with augmented old class mean prototypes as targets, and the resulting images are used for knowledge distillation to prevent semantic drift. Moreover, we calibrate the covariance matrices to compensate for the semantic drift after each task, by learning a transfer matrix on the pseudo-replay samples. Our method reconciles stability and plasticity, achieving state-of-the-art on challenging cold-start settings of the standard EFCIL benchmarks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, privacy, attack, robust, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Electric Vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure faces escalating cybersecurity threats that can severely compromise operational efficiency and grid stability. Existing forecasting techniques are limited by the lack of combined robust anomaly mitigation solutions and data privacy preservation. Therefore, this paper addresses these challenges by proposing a novel anomaly-resilient federated learning framework that simultaneously preserves data privacy, detects cyber-attacks, and maintains trustworthy demand prediction accuracy under adversarial conditions. The proposed framework integrates three key innovations: LSTM autoencoder-based distributed anomaly detection deployed at each federated client, interpolation-based anomalous data mitigation to preserve temporal continuity, and federated Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks that enable collaborative learning without centralized data aggregation. The framework is validated on real-world EV charging infrastructure datasets combined with real-world DDoS attack datasets, providing robust validation of the proposed approach under realistic threat scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that the federated approach achieves superior performance compared to centralized models, with 15.2% improvement in R2 accuracy while maintaining data locality. The integrated cyber-attack detection and mitigation system produces trustworthy datasets that enhance prediction reliability, recovering 47.9% of attack-induced performance degradation while maintaining exceptional precision (91.3%) and minimal false positive rates (1.21%). The proposed architecture enables enhanced EV infrastructure planning, privacy-preserving collaborative forecasting, cybersecurity resilience, and rapid recovery from malicious threats across distributed charging networks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generative modeling, yet how to effectively adapt large pretrained models to new tasks remains challenging. We revisit the reconstruction behavior of diffusion models during denoising to unveil the underlying frequency energy mechanism governing this process. Building upon this observation, we propose FeRA, a frequency driven fine tuning framework that aligns parameter updates with the intrinsic frequency energy progression of diffusion. FeRA establishes a comprehensive frequency energy framework for effective diffusion adaptation fine tuning, comprising three synergistic components: (i) a compact frequency energy indicator that characterizes the latent bandwise energy distribution, (ii) a soft frequency router that adaptively fuses multiple frequency specific adapter experts, and (iii) a frequency energy consistency regularization that stabilizes diffusion optimization and ensures coherent adaptation across bands. Routing operates in both training and inference, with inference time routing dynamically determined by the latent frequency energy. It integrates seamlessly with adapter based tuning schemes and generalizes well across diffusion backbones and resolutions. By aligning adaptation with the frequency energy mechanism, FeRA provides a simple, stable, and compatible paradigm for effective and robust diffusion model adaptation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, attack, steal</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) are pre-trained on diverse source domains and adapted to unseen targets, enabling broad generalization for graph machine learning. Despite that GFMs have attracted considerable attention recently, their vulnerability to backdoor attacks remains largely underexplored. A compromised GFM can introduce backdoor behaviors into downstream applications, posing serious security risks. However, launching backdoor attacks against GFMs is non-trivial due to three key challenges. (1) Effectiveness: Attackers lack knowledge of the downstream task during pre-training, complicating the assurance that triggers reliably induce misclassifications into desired classes. (2) Stealthiness: The variability in node features across domains complicates trigger insertion that remains stealthy. (3) Persistence: Downstream fine-tuning may erase backdoor behaviors by updating model parameters. To address these challenges, we propose GFM-BA, a novel Backdoor Attack model against Graph Foundation Models. Specifically, we first design a label-free trigger association module that links the trigger to a set of prototype embeddings, eliminating the need for knowledge about downstream tasks to perform backdoor injection. Then, we introduce a node-adaptive trigger generator, dynamically producing node-specific triggers, reducing the risk of trigger detection while reliably activating the backdoor. Lastly, we develop a persistent backdoor anchoring module that firmly anchors the backdoor to fine-tuning-insensitive parameters, enhancing the persistence of the backdoor under downstream adaptation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, stealthiness, and persistence of GFM-BA.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion Transformers have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in visual synthesis, yet they often struggle with high-level semantic reasoning and long-horizon planning. This limitation frequently leads to visual hallucinations and mis-alignments with user instructions, especially in scenarios involving complex scene understanding, human-object interactions, multi-stage actions, and in-context motion reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose Plan-X, a framework that explicitly enforces high-level semantic planning to instruct video generation process. At its core lies a Semantic Planner, a learnable multimodal language model that reasons over the user's intent from both text prompts and visual context, and autoregressively generates a sequence of text-grounded spatio-temporal semantic tokens. These semantic tokens, complementary to high-level text prompt guidance, serve as structured "semantic sketches" over time for the video diffusion model, which has its strength at synthesizing high-fidelity visual details. Plan-X effectively integrates the strength of language models in multimodal in-context reasoning and planning, together with the strength of diffusion models in photorealistic video synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework substantially reduces visual hallucinations and enables fine-grained, instruction-aligned video generation consistent with multimodal context.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, extraction, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Accurate organ and lesion segmentation is a critical prerequisite for computer-aided diagnosis. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), constrained by their local receptive fields, often struggle to capture complex global anatomical structures. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a novel hybrid architecture, HyM-UNet, designed to synergize the local feature extraction capabilities of CNNs with the efficient global modeling capabilities of Mamba. Specifically, we design a Hierarchical Encoder that utilizes convolutional modules in the shallow stages to preserve high-frequency texture details, while introducing Visual Mamba modules in the deep stages to capture long-range semantic dependencies with linear complexity. To bridge the semantic gap between the encoder and the decoder, we propose a Mamba-Guided Fusion Skip Connection (MGF-Skip). This module leverages deep semantic features as gating signals to dynamically suppress background noise within shallow features, thereby enhancing the perception of ambiguous boundaries. We conduct extensive experiments on public benchmark dataset ISIC 2018. The results demonstrate that HyM-UNet significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of Dice coefficient and IoU, while maintaining lower parameter counts and inference latency. This validates the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method in handling medical segmentation tasks characterized by complex shapes and scale variations.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, attack, membership infer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multi-domain graph pre-training has emerged as a pivotal technique in developing graph foundation models. While it greatly improves the generalization of graph neural networks, its privacy risks under membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to identify whether a specific instance was used in training (member), remain largely unexplored. However, effectively conducting MIAs against multi-domain graph pre-trained models is a significant challenge due to: (i) Enhanced Generalization Capability: Multi-domain pre-training reduces the overfitting characteristics commonly exploited by MIAs. (ii) Unrepresentative Shadow Datasets: Diverse training graphs hinder the obtaining of reliable shadow graphs. (iii) Weakened Membership Signals: Embedding-based outputs offer less informative cues than logits for MIAs. To tackle these challenges, we propose MGP-MIA, a novel framework for Membership Inference Attacks against Multi-domain Graph Pre-trained models. Specifically, we first propose a membership signal amplification mechanism that amplifies the overfitting characteristics of target models via machine unlearning. We then design an incremental shadow model construction mechanism that builds a reliable shadow model with limited shadow graphs via incremental learning. Finally, we introduce a similarity-based inference mechanism that identifies members based on their similarity to positive and negative samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed MGP-MIA and reveal the privacy risks of multi-domain graph pre-training.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present ContagionRL, a Gymnasium-compatible reinforcement learning platform specifically designed for systematic reward engineering in spatial epidemic simulations. Unlike traditional agent-based models that rely on fixed behavioral rules, our platform enables rigorous evaluation of how reward function design affects learned survival strategies across diverse epidemic scenarios. ContagionRL integrates a spatial SIRS+D epidemiological model with configurable environmental parameters, allowing researchers to stress-test reward functions under varying conditions including limited observability, different movement patterns, and heterogeneous population dynamics. We evaluate five distinct reward designs, ranging from sparse survival bonuses to a novel potential field approach, across multiple RL algorithms (PPO, SAC, A2C). Through systematic ablation studies, we identify that directional guidance and explicit adherence incentives are critical components for robust policy learning. Our comprehensive evaluation across varying infection rates, grid sizes, visibility constraints, and movement patterns reveals that reward function choice dramatically impacts agent behavior and survival outcomes. Agents trained with our potential field reward consistently achieve superior performance, learning maximal adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions while developing sophisticated spatial avoidance strategies. The platform's modular design enables systematic exploration of reward-behavior relationships, addressing a knowledge gap in models of this type where reward engineering has received limited attention. ContagionRL is an effective platform for studying adaptive behavioral responses in epidemic contexts and highlight the importance of reward design, information structure, and environmental predictability in learning.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>City-scale 3D generation is of great importance for the development of embodied intelligence and world models. Existing methods, however, face significant challenges regarding quality, fidelity, and scalability in 3D world generation. Thus, we propose RAISECity, a \textbf{R}eality-\textbf{A}ligned \textbf{I}ntelligent \textbf{S}ynthesis \textbf{E}ngine that creates detailed, \textbf{C}ity-scale 3D worlds. We introduce an agentic framework that leverages diverse multimodal foundation tools to acquire real-world knowledge, maintain robust intermediate representations, and construct complex 3D scenes. This agentic design, featuring dynamic data processing, iterative self-reflection and refinement, and the invocation of advanced multimodal tools, minimizes cumulative errors and enhances overall performance. Extensive quantitative experiments and qualitative analyses validate the superior performance of RAISECity in real-world alignment, shape precision, texture fidelity, and aesthetics level, achieving over a 90% win-rate against existing baselines for overall perceptual quality. This combination of 3D quality, reality alignment, scalability, and seamless compatibility with computer graphics pipelines makes RAISECity a promising foundation for applications in immersive media, embodied intelligence, and world models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Differentially private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) has become integral to privacy-preserving machine learning, ensuring robust privacy guarantees in sensitive domains. Despite notable empirical advances leveraging features from non-private, pre-trained models to enhance DP-SGD training, a theoretical understanding of feature dynamics in private learning remains underexplored. This paper presents the first theoretical framework to analyze private training through a feature learning perspective. Building on the multi-patch data structure from prior work, our analysis distinguishes between label-dependent feature signals and label-independent noise, a critical aspect overlooked by existing analyses in the DP community. Employing a two-layer CNN with polynomial ReLU activation, we theoretically characterize both feature signal learning and data noise memorization in private training via noisy gradient descent. Our findings reveal that (1) Effective private signal learning requires a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compared to non-private training, and (2) When data noise memorization occurs in non-private learning, it will also occur in private learning, leading to poor generalization despite small training loss. Our findings highlight the challenges of private learning and prove the benefit of feature enhancement to improve SNR. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets also validate our theoretical findings.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Detecting changes in longitudinal medical imaging using deep learning requires a substantial amount of accurately labeled data. However, labeling these images is notably more costly and time-consuming than labeling other image types, as it requires labeling across various time points, where new lesions can be minor, and subtle changes are easily missed. Deep Active Learning (DAL) has shown promise in minimizing labeling costs by selectively querying the most informative samples, but existing studies have primarily focused on static tasks like classification and segmentation. Consequently, the conventional DAL approach cannot be directly applied to change detection tasks, which involve identifying subtle differences across multiple images. In this study, we propose a novel DAL framework, named Longitudinal Medical Imaging Active Learning (LMI-AL), tailored specifically for longitudinal medical imaging. By pairing and differencing all 2D slices from baseline and follow-up 3D images, LMI-AL iteratively selects the most informative pairs for labeling using DAL, training a deep learning model with minimal manual annotation. Experimental results demonstrate that, with less than 8% of the data labeled, LMI-AL can achieve performance comparable to models trained on fully labeled datasets. We also provide a detailed analysis of the method's performance, as guidance for future research. The code is publicly available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated powerful capabilities in general spatial understanding and reasoning. However, their fine-grained spatial understanding and reasoning capabilities in complex urban scenarios have not received significant attention in the fields of both research and industry. To fill this gap, we focus primarily on road markings as a typical example of fine-grained spatial elements under urban scenarios, given the essential role of the integrated road traffic network they form within cities. Around road markings and urban traffic systems, we propose RoadBench, a systematic benchmark that comprehensively evaluates MLLMs' fine-grained spatial understanding and reasoning capabilities using BEV and FPV image inputs. This benchmark comprises six tasks consisting of 9,121 strictly manually verified test cases. These tasks form a systematic evaluation framework that bridges understanding at local spatial scopes to global reasoning. They not only test MLLMs' capabilities in recognition, joint understanding, and reasoning but also assess their ability to integrate image information with domain knowledge. After evaluating 14 mainstream MLLMs, we confirm that RoadBench is a challenging benchmark for MLLMs while revealing significant shortcomings in existing MLLMs' fine-grained spatial understanding and reasoning capabilities within urban scenarios. In certain tasks, their performance even falls short of simple rule-based or random selection baselines. These findings, along with RoadBench itself, will contribute to the comprehensive advancement of spatial understanding capabilities for MLLMs. The benchmark code, example datasets, and raw evaluation results are available in the supplementary material.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Data streams collected from multiple sources are rarely independent. Values evolve over time and influence one another across sequences. These correlations improve prediction in healthcare, finance, and smart-city control yet violate the record-independence assumption built into most Differential Privacy (DP) mechanisms. To restore rigorous privacy guarantees without sacrificing utility, we introduce Correlated-Sequence Differential Privacy (CSDP), a framework specifically designed for preserving privacy in correlated sequential data. CSDP addresses two linked challenges: quantifying the extra information an attacker gains from joint temporal and cross-sequence links, and adding just enough noise to hide that information while keeping the data useful. We model multivariate streams as a Coupling Markov Chain, yielding the derived loose leakage bound expressed with a few spectral terms and revealing a counterintuitive result: stronger coupling can actually decrease worst-case leakage by dispersing perturbations across sequences. Guided by these bounds, we build the Freshness-Regulated Adaptive Noise (FRAN) mechanism--combining data aging, correlation-aware sensitivity scaling, and Laplace noise--that runs in linear time. Tests on two-sequence datasets show that CSDP improves the privacy-utility trade-off by approximately 50% over existing correlated-DP methods and by two orders of magnitude compared to the standard DP approach.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for downstream tasks often compromises safety alignment, even when using parameter-efficient methods like LoRA. In this work, we uncover a notable property: fine-tuned models preserve the geometric structure of their loss landscapes concerning harmful content, regardless of the fine-tuning method employed. This suggests that safety behaviors are not erased but shifted to less influential regions of the parameter space. Building on this insight, we propose a curvature-aware alignment restoration method that leverages influence functions and second-order optimization to selectively increase loss on harmful inputs while preserving task performance. By navigating the shared geometry between base and fine-tuned models, our method discourages unsafe outputs while preserving task-relevant performance, avoiding full reversion and enabling precise, low-impact updates. Extensive evaluations across multiple model families and adversarial settings show that our approach efficiently reduces harmful responses while maintaining or even improving utility and few-shot learning performance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, security</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The exponential growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem has amplified concerns regarding device reliability, interoperability, and security assurance. Despite the proliferation of IoT security guidelines, a unified and quantitative approach to measuring trust remains absent. This paper introduces SCI-IoT (Secure Certification Index for IoT), a standardized and quantitative framework for trust scoring, evaluation, and certification of IoT devices. The framework employs a six-tier grading model (Grades A-F), enabling device profiling across consumer, industrial, and critical infrastructure domains. Within this model, 30 distinct Trust Tests assess devices across dimensions such as authentication, encryption, data integrity, resilience, and firmware security. Each test is assigned a criticality-based weight (1.0-2.0) and a performance rating (1-4), converted to a normalized percentage and aggregated through a weighted computation to yield the Secure Certification Index (SCI). The SCI determines the device's Trust Verdict, categorized into five SCI levels, and serves as the foundation for optional grade-based certification. The framework also incorporates critical gate conditions, enforcing absolute compliance in high risk parameters to prevent certification of devices with fundamental vulnerabilities. By unifying quantitative trust scoring with structured certification criteria, SCI-IoT provides a transparent, scalable, and reproducible method to benchmark IoT device trustworthiness. The proposed system aims to streamline manufacturer compliance, improve consumer confidence, and facilitate global interoperability in IoT security certification.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion transformers have recently delivered strong text-to-image generation around 1K resolution, but we show that extending them to native 4K across diverse aspect ratios exposes a tightly coupled failure mode spanning positional encoding, VAE compression, and optimization. Tackling any of these factors in isolation leaves substantial quality on the table. We therefore take a data-model co-design view and introduce UltraFlux, a Flux-based DiT trained natively at 4K on MultiAspect-4K-1M, a 1M-image 4K corpus with controlled multi-AR coverage, bilingual captions, and rich VLM/IQA metadata for resolution- and AR-aware sampling. On the model side, UltraFlux couples (i) Resonance 2D RoPE with YaRN for training-window-, frequency-, and AR-aware positional encoding at 4K; (ii) a simple, non-adversarial VAE post-training scheme that improves 4K reconstruction fidelity; (iii) an SNR-Aware Huber Wavelet objective that rebalances gradients across timesteps and frequency bands; and (iv) a Stage-wise Aesthetic Curriculum Learning strategy that concentrates high-aesthetic supervision on high-noise steps governed by the model prior. Together, these components yield a stable, detail-preserving 4K DiT that generalizes across wide, square, and tall ARs. On the Aesthetic-Eval at 4096 benchmark and multi-AR 4K settings, UltraFlux consistently outperforms strong open-source baselines across fidelity, aesthetic, and alignment metrics, and-with a LLM prompt refiner-matches or surpasses the proprietary Seedream 4.0.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>High-quality training data is fundamental to large language model (LLM) performance, yet existing preprocessing pipelines often struggle to effectively remove noise and unstructured content from web-scale corpora. This paper presents Blu-WERP, a novel data preprocessing pipeline designed to optimize the quality of Common Crawl WARC files for LLM training. We demonstrate that Blu-WERP significantly outperforms established baselines including DCLM across multiple model scales and evaluation benchmarks. Our pipeline processes CC WARC dumps, implementing advanced filtering and quality assessment mechanisms. We conducted comprehensive evaluations using models with 150M, 400M, 530M, 750M, and 1B parameters, testing against nine standard benchmarks categorized as World Knowledge & Reasoning, Language Understanding, and Commonsense Reasoning. Results show Blu-WERP consistently achieved superior performance across all model scales. At the 1B parameter scale, Relatively Blu-WERP demonstrates a 4.0% and 9.5% aggregate improvement over DCLM and Fineweb respectively, while achieving quality-per-token efficiency gain. Categorical analysis reveals 2.4% improvement in World Knowledge & Reasoning, 6.2% improvement in Language Understanding, and 4.2% improvement in Commonsense Reasoning. These results establish Blu-WERP as a state-of-the-art preprocessing pipeline that substantially improves LLM training data quality and downstream model performance with reduced computational cost. Our findings contribute to the growing body of research on data-centric AI, demonstrating that preprocessing pipeline design significantly impacts LLM capabilities. The Blu-WERP pipeline represents a practical advancement in data quality optimization, offering researchers and practitioners an effective solution for improving LLM training efficiency and model performance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, robust, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Test-time adaptation (TTA) in federated learning (FL) is crucial for handling unseen data distributions across clients, particularly when faced with domain shifts and skewed class distributions. Class Imbalance (CI) remains a fundamental challenge in FL, where rare but critical classes are often severely underrepresented in individual client datasets. Although prior work has addressed CI during training through reliable aggregation and local class distribution alignment, these methods typically rely on access to labeled data or coordination among clients, and none address class unsupervised adaptation to dynamic domains or distribution shifts at inference time under federated CI constraints. Revealing the failure of state-of-the-art TTA in federated client adaptation in CI scenario, we propose pFedBBN,a personalized federated test-time adaptation framework that employs balanced batch normalization (BBN) during local client adaptation to mitigate prediction bias by treating all classes equally, while also enabling client collaboration guided by BBN similarity, ensuring that clients with similar balanced representations reinforce each other and that adaptation remains aligned with domain-specific characteristics. pFedBBN supports fully unsupervised local adaptation and introduces a class-aware model aggregation strategy that enables personalized inference without compromising privacy. It addresses both distribution shifts and class imbalance through balanced feature normalization and domain-aware collaboration, without requiring any labeled or raw data from clients. Extensive experiments across diverse baselines show that pFedBBN consistently enhances robustness and minority-class performance over state-of-the-art FL and TTA methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Background and Objective: Deep learning models have high computational needs and lack interpretability but are often the first choice for medical image classification tasks. This study addresses whether complex neural networks are essential for the simple binary classification task of malaria. We introduce the Extracted Morphological Feature Engineered (EMFE) pipeline, a transparent, reproducible, and low compute machine learning approach tailored explicitly for simple cell morphology, designed to achieve deep learning performance levels on a simple CPU only setup with the practical aim of real world deployment. Methods: The study used the NIH Malaria Cell Images dataset, with two features extracted from each cell image: the number of non background pixels and the number of holes within the cell. Logistic Regression and Random Forest were compared against ResNet18, DenseNet121, MobileNetV2, and EfficientNet across accuracy, model size, and CPU inference time. An ensemble model was created by combining Logistic Regression and Random Forests to achieve higher accuracy while retaining efficiency. Results: The single variable Logistic Regression model achieved a test accuracy of 94.80 percent with a file size of 1.2 kB and negligible inference latency (2.3 ms). The two stage ensemble improved accuracy to 97.15 percent. In contrast, the deep learning methods require 13.6 MB to 44.7 MB of storage and show significantly higher inference times (68 ms). Conclusion: This study shows that a compact feature engineering approach can produce clinically meaningful classification performance while offering gains in transparency, reproducibility, speed, and deployment feasibility. The proposed pipeline demonstrates that simple interpretable features paired with lightweight models can serve as a practical diagnostic solution for environments with limited computational resources.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in clinical decision support, yet aligning them with the multifaceted reasoning pathways of real-world medicine remains a major challenge. Using more than 8,000 infertility treatment records, we systematically evaluate four alignment strategies: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), and In-Context Learning (ICL) through a dual-layer framework combining automatic benchmarks with blinded doctor-in-the-loop assessments. GRPO achieves the highest algorithmic accuracy across multiple decision layers, confirming the value of reinforcement-based optimization for structured prediction tasks. However, clinicians consistently prefer the SFT model, citing clearer reasoning processes (p = 0.035) and higher therapeutic feasibility (p = 0.019). In blinded pairwise comparisons, SFT attains the highest winning rate (51.2%), outperforming both GRPO (26.2%) and even physicians' original decisions (22.7%). These results reveal an alignment paradox: algorithmic improvements do not necessarily translate into higher clinical trust, and may diverge from human-centered preferences. Our findings highlight the need for alignment strategies that prioritize clinically interpretable and practically feasible reasoning, rather than solely optimizing decision-level accuracy.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Integrating heterogeneous modalities such as histopathology and genomics is central to advancing survival analysis, yet most existing methods prioritize cross-modal alignment through attention-based fusion mechanisms, often at the expense of modality-specific characteristics. This overemphasis on alignment leads to representation collapse and reduced diversity. In this work, we revisit multi-modal survival analysis via the dual lens of alignment and distinctiveness, positing that preserving modality-specific structure is as vital as achieving semantic coherence. In this paper, we introduce Together-Then-Apart (TTA), a unified min-max optimization framework that simultaneously models shared and modality-specific representations. The Together stage minimizes semantic discrepancies by aligning embeddings via shared prototypes, guided by an unbalanced optimal transport objective that adaptively highlights informative tokens. The Apart stage maximizes representational diversity through modality anchors and a contrastive regularizer that preserve unique modality information and prevent feature collapse. Extensive experiments on five TCGA benchmarks show that TTA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Beyond empirical gains, our formulation provides a new theoretical perspective of how alignment and distinctiveness can be jointly achieved in for robust, interpretable, and biologically meaningful multi-modal survival analysis.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Perceptual image super-resolution (SR) methods restore degraded images and produce sharp outputs. In practice, those outputs are usually recompressed for storage and transmission. Ignoring recompression is suboptimal as the downstream codec might add additional artifacts to restored images. However, jointly optimizing SR and recompression is challenging, as the codecs are not differentiable and vary in configuration. In this paper, we present Versatile Recompression-Aware Perceptual Super-Resolution (VRPSR), which makes existing perceptual SR aware of versatile compression. First, we formulate compression as conditional text-to-image generation and utilize a pre-trained diffusion model to build a generalizable codec simulator. Next, we propose a set of training techniques tailored for perceptual SR, including optimizing the simulator using perceptual targets and adopting slightly compressed images as the training target. Empirically, our VRPSR saves more than 10\% bitrate based on Real-ESRGAN and S3Diff under H.264/H.265/H.266 compression. Besides, our VRPSR facilitates joint optimization of the SR and post-processing model after recompression.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper presents an empirical investigation into the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform automated Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC) policy mining. While ABAC provides fine-grained, context-aware access management, the increasing number and complexity of access policies can make their formulation and evaluation rather challenging. To address the task of synthesizing concise yet accurate policies, we evaluate the performance of some of the state-of-the-art LLMs, specifically Google Gemini (Flash and Pro) and OpenAI ChatGPT, as potential policy mining engines. An experimental framework was developed in Python to generate randomized access data parameterized by varying numbers of subjects, objects, and initial policy sets. The baseline policy sets, which govern permission decisions between subjects and objects, serve as the ground truth for comparison. Each LLM-generated policy was evaluated against the baseline policy using standard performance metrics. The results indicate that LLMs can effectively infer compact and valid ABAC policies for small-scale scenarios. However, as the system size increases, characterized by higher numbers of subjects and objects, LLM outputs exhibit declining accuracy and precision, coupled with significant increase in the size of policy generated, which is beyond the optimal size. These findings highlight both the promise and limitations of current LLM architectures for scalable policy mining in access control domains. Future work will explore hybrid approaches that combine prompt optimization with classical rule mining algorithms to improve scalability and interpretability in complex ABAC environments.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, diffusion, transformer, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The proliferation of videos generated by diffusion models has raised increasing concerns about information security, highlighting the urgent need for reliable detection of synthetic media. Existing methods primarily focus on image-level forgery detection, leaving generic video-level forgery detection largely underexplored. To advance video forensics, we propose a consolidated multimodal detection algorithm, named MM-Det++, specifically designed for detecting diffusion-generated videos. Our approach consists of two innovative branches and a Unified Multimodal Learning (UML) module. Specifically, the Spatio-Temporal (ST) branch employs a novel Frame-Centric Vision Transformer (FC-ViT) to aggregate spatio-temporal information for detecting diffusion-generated videos, where the FC-tokens enable the capture of holistic forgery traces from each video frame. In parallel, the Multimodal (MM) branch adopts a learnable reasoning paradigm to acquire Multimodal Forgery Representation (MFR) by harnessing the powerful comprehension and reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which discerns the forgery traces from a flexible semantic perspective. To integrate multimodal representations into a coherent space, a UML module is introduced to consolidate the generalization ability of MM-Det++. In addition, we also establish a large-scale and comprehensive Diffusion Video Forensics (DVF) dataset to advance research in video forgery detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of MM-Det++ and highlight the effectiveness of unified multimodal forgery learning in detecting diffusion-generated videos.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Modern transformer architectures achieve remarkable performance across tasks and domains but remain rigid in how they allocate computation at inference time. Real-world deployment often requires models to adapt to diverse hardware and latency constraints, yet most approaches to dynamic computation focus on a single axis -- such as reducing the number of tokens. We present a novel capability: AdaPerceiver, the first transformer architecture with unified adaptivity across depth, width, and tokens within a single model. We propose an architecture that supports adaptivity along these axes. We couple this with an efficient joint training regime that ensures the model maintains performance across its various configurations. We evaluate AdaPerceiver on image classification, semantic segmentation, and depth estimation tasks. On image classification, AdaPerceiver expands the accuracy-throughput Pareto front. It achieves 85.4% accuracy while yielding 36% higher throughput than FlexiViT-L. On dense prediction, AdaPerceiver matches ViT-H/14 while having $\sim$26x fewer encoder FLOPs (floating-point operations) on semantic segmentation and depth estimation. Finally, we show how AdaPerceiver equipped with a policy can maintain ImageNet1K accuracy ($\pm0.1$ percentage points) while reducing FLOPs by $24-33$%.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, security, attack, robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Securing AI agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) represents one of the most critical challenges in AI security today. Unlike traditional software, AI agents leverage LLMs as their "brain" to autonomously perform actions via connected tools. This capability introduces significant risks that go far beyond those of harmful text presented in a chatbot that was the main application of LLMs. A compromised AI agent can deliberately abuse powerful tools to perform malicious actions, in many cases irreversible, and limited solely by the guardrails on the tools themselves and the LLM ability to enforce them. This paper presents ASTRA, a first-of-its-kind framework designed to evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in supporting the creation of secure agents that enforce custom guardrails defined at the system-prompt level (e.g., "Do not send an email out of the company domain," or "Never extend the robotic arm in more than 2 meters"). Our holistic framework simulates 10 diverse autonomous agents varying between a coding assistant and a delivery drone equipped with 37 unique tools. We test these agents against a suite of novel attacks developed specifically for agentic threats, inspired by the OWASP Top 10 but adapted to challenge the ability of the LLM for policy enforcement during multi-turn planning and execution of strict tool activation. By evaluating 13 open-source, tool-calling LLMs, we uncovered surprising and significant differences in their ability to remain secure and keep operating within their boundaries. The purpose of this work is to provide the community with a robust and unified methodology to build and validate better LLMs, ultimately pushing for more secure and reliable agentic AI systems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection (ZSAD) aims to identify and localize anomalous regions in images of unseen object classes. While recent methods based on vision-language models like CLIP show promise, their performance is constrained by existing prompt engineering strategies. Current approaches, whether relying on single fixed, learnable, or dense dynamic prompts, suffer from a representational bottleneck and are prone to overfitting on auxiliary data, failing to generalize to the complexity and diversity of unseen anomalies. To overcome these limitations, we propose $\mathtt{PromptMoE}$. Our core insight is that robust ZSAD requires a compositional approach to prompt learning. Instead of learning monolithic prompts, $\mathtt{PromptMoE}$ learns a pool of expert prompts, which serve as a basis set of composable semantic primitives, and a visually-guided Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism to dynamically combine them for each instance. Our framework materializes this concept through a Visually-Guided Mixture of Prompt (VGMoP) that employs an image-gated sparse MoE to aggregate diverse normal and abnormal expert state prompts, generating semantically rich textual representations with strong generalization. Extensive experiments across 15 datasets in industrial and medical domains demonstrate the effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance of $\mathtt{PromptMoE}$.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel on benchmarks, their processing paradigm differs from the human ability to integrate visual information. Unlike humans who naturally bridge details and high-level concepts, models tend to treat these elements in isolation. Prevailing evaluation protocols often decouple low-level perception from high-level reasoning, overlooking their semantic and causal dependencies, which yields non-diagnostic results and obscures performance bottlenecks. We present VCU-Bridge, a framework that operationalizes a human-like hierarchy of visual connotation understanding: multi-level reasoning that advances from foundational perception through semantic bridging to abstract connotation, with an explicit evidence-to-inference trace from concrete cues to abstract conclusions. Building on this framework, we construct HVCU-Bench, a benchmark for hierarchical visual connotation understanding with explicit, level-wise diagnostics. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate a consistent decline in performance as reasoning progresses to higher levels. We further develop a data generation pipeline for instruction tuning guided by Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and show that strengthening low-level capabilities yields measurable gains at higher levels. Interestingly, it not only improves on HVCU-Bench but also brings benefits on general benchmarks (average +2.53%), especially with substantial gains on MMStar (+7.26%), demonstrating the significance of the hierarchical thinking pattern and its effectiveness in enhancing MLLM capabilities.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become indispensable for multimodal reasoning, yet their representations often encode and amplify demographic biases, resulting in biased associations and misaligned predictions in downstream tasks. Such behavior undermines fairness and distorts the intended alignment between vision and language. Recent post-hoc approaches attempt to mitigate bias by replacing the most attribute-correlated embedding coordinates with neutral values. However, our systematic analysis reveals three critical failures of this coordinate-wise approach: feature entanglement, poor cross-dataset generalization, and incomplete bias removal. We find that bias is not localized to a few coordinates but is instead distributed across a few linear subspaces. To address these limitations, we propose $\textbf{S}$ubspace $\textbf{P}$rojection $\textbf{D}$ebiasing ($\textbf{SPD}$), a geometrically principled framework that identifies and removes the entire subspace of linearly decodable bias while reinserting a neutral mean component to preserve semantic fidelity. Extensive experiments across zero-shot classification, text-to-image retrieval, and image generation validate the effectiveness of SPD: our method achieves more robust debiasing with an average improvement of $18.5\%$ across four fairness metrics, while maintaining minimal loss in task performance compared to the best debiasing baseline.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We observe that recent advances in multimodal foundation models have propelled instruction-driven image generation and editing into a genuinely cross-modal, cooperative regime. Nevertheless, state-of-the-art editing pipelines remain costly: beyond training large diffusion/flow models, they require curating massive high-quality triplets of \{instruction, source image, edited image\} to cover diverse user intents. Moreover, the fidelity of visual replacements hinges on how precisely the instruction references the target semantics. We revisit this challenge through the lens of temporal modeling: if video can be regarded as a full temporal process, then image editing can be seen as a degenerate temporal process. This perspective allows us to transfer single-frame evolution priors from video pre-training, enabling a highly data-efficient fine-tuning regime. Empirically, our approach matches the performance of leading open-source baselines while using only about one percent of the supervision demanded by mainstream editing models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Existing methods for label-deficient concealed object segmentation (LDCOS) either rely on consistency constraints or Segment Anything Model (SAM)-based pseudo-labeling. However, their performance remains limited due to the intrinsic concealment of targets and the scarcity of annotations. This study investigates two key questions: (1) Can consistency constraints and SAM-based supervision be jointly integrated to better exploit complementary information and enhance the segmenter? and (2) beyond that, can the segmenter in turn guide SAM through reciprocal supervision, enabling mutual improvement? To answer these questions, we present SCALER, a unified collaborative framework toward LDCOS that jointly optimizes a mean-teacher segmenter and a learnable SAM. SCALER operates in two alternating phases. In \textbf{Phase \uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral1}}, the segmenter is optimized under fixed SAM supervision using entropy-based image-level and uncertainty-based pixel-level weighting to select reliable pseudo-label regions and emphasize harder examples. In \textbf{Phase \uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral2}}, SAM is updated via augmentation invariance and noise resistance losses, leveraging its inherent robustness to perturbations. Experiments demonstrate that SCALER yields consistent performance gains across eight semi- and weakly-supervised COS tasks. The results further suggest that SCALER can serve as a general training paradigm to enhance both lightweight segmenters and large foundation models under label-scarce conditions.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multimodal learning has shown significant superiority on various tasks by integrating multiple modalities. However, the interdependencies among modalities increase the susceptibility of multimodal models to adversarial attacks. Existing methods mainly focus on attacks on specific modalities or indiscriminately attack all modalities. In this paper, we find that these approaches ignore the differences between modalities in their contribution to final robustness, resulting in suboptimal robustness performance. To bridge this gap, we introduce Vulnerability-Aware Robust Multimodal Adversarial Training (VARMAT), a probe-in-training adversarial training method that improves multimodal robustness by identifying the vulnerability of each modality. To be specific, VARMAT first explicitly quantifies the vulnerability of each modality, grounded in a first-order approximation of the attack objective (Probe). Then, we propose a targeted regularization term that penalizes modalities with high vulnerability, guiding robust learning while maintaining task accuracy (Training). We demonstrate the enhanced robustness of our method across multiple multimodal datasets involving diverse modalities. Finally, we achieve {12.73%, 22.21%, 11.19%} robustness improvement on three multimodal datasets, revealing a significant blind spot in multimodal adversarial training.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, interpretability, diffusion, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep unfolding networks (DUNs) combine the interpretability of model-based methods with the learning ability of deep networks, yet remain limited for blind image restoration (BIR). Existing DUNs suffer from: (1) \textbf{Degradation-specific dependency}, as their optimization frameworks are tied to a known degradation model, making them unsuitable for BIR tasks; and (2) \textbf{Over-smoothing bias}, resulting from the direct feeding of gradient descent outputs, dominated by low-frequency content, into the proximal term, suppressing fine textures. To overcome these issues, we propose UnfoldLDM to integrate DUNs with latent diffusion model (LDM) for BIR. In each stage, UnfoldLDM employs a multi-granularity degradation-aware (MGDA) module as the gradient descent step. MGDA models BIR as an unknown degradation estimation problem and estimates both the holistic degradation matrix and its decomposed forms, enabling robust degradation removal. For the proximal step, we design a degradation-resistant LDM (DR-LDM) to extract compact degradation-invariant priors from the MGDA output. Guided by this prior, an over-smoothing correction transformer (OCFormer) explicitly recovers high-frequency components and enhances texture details. This unique combination ensures the final result is degradation-free and visually rich. Experiments show that our UnfoldLDM achieves a leading place on various BIR tasks and benefits downstream tasks. Moreover, our design is compatible with existing DUN-based methods, serving as a plug-and-play framework. Code will be released.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, protect, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the increasing use and adoption of cloud and cloud-native computing, the underlying technologies (i.e., containerization and virtualization) have become foundational. However, strict isolation and maintaining runtime security in these environments has become increasingly challenging. Existing approaches like seccomp and Mandatory Access Control (MAC) frameworks offer some protection up to a limit, but often lack context awareness, syscall argument filtering, and adaptive enforcement, providing the ability to adjust decisions at runtime based on observed application behavior, workload changes, or detected anomalies rather than relying solely on static or predefined this http URL paper introduces eBPF-PATROL (eBPF-Protective Agent for Threat Recognition and Overreach Limitation), an extensible lightweight runtime security agent that uses extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) technology to monitor and enforce policies in containerized and virtualized environments. By intercepting system calls, analyzing execution context, and applying user-defined rules, eBPF-PATROL detects and prevents real-time boundary violations, such as reverse shells, privilege escalation, and container escape attempts. We describe the architecture, implementation, and evaluation of eBPF-PATROL, demonstrating its low overhead (< 2.5 percent) and high detection accuracy across real-world attack scenarios.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Three-dimensional rigid-body transforms, i.e. rotations and translations, are central to modern differentiable machine learning pipelines in robotics, vision, and simulation. However, numerically robust and mathematically correct implementations, particularly on SO(3), are error-prone due to issues such as axis conventions, normalizations, composition consistency and subtle errors that only appear in edge cases. SciPy's this http URL module is a rigorously tested Python implementation. However, it historically only supported NumPy, limiting adoption in GPU-accelerated and autodiff-based workflows. We present a complete overhaul of SciPy's this http URL functionality that makes it compatible with any array library implementing the Python array API, including JAX, PyTorch, and CuPy. The revised implementation preserves the established SciPy interface while enabling GPU/TPU execution, JIT compilation, vectorized batching, and differentiation via native autodiff of the chosen backend. We demonstrate how this foundation supports differentiable scientific computing through two case studies: (i) scalability of 3D transforms and rotations and (ii) a JAX drone simulation that leverages SciPy's Rotation for accurate integration of rotational dynamics. Our contributions have been merged into SciPy main and will ship in the next release, providing a framework-agnostic, production-grade basis for 3D spatial math in differentiable systems and ML.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Indoor localization systems commonly rely on fingerprinting, which requires extensive survey efforts to obtain location-tagged signal data, limiting their real-world deployability. Recent approaches that attempt to reduce this overhead either suffer from low representation ability, mode collapse issues, or require the effort of collecting data at all target locations. We present LocaGen, a novel spatial augmentation framework that significantly reduces fingerprinting overhead by generating high-quality synthetic data at completely unseen locations. LocaGen leverages a conditional diffusion model guided by a novel spatially aware optimization strategy to synthesize realistic fingerprints at unseen locations using only a subset of seen locations. To further improve our diffusion model performance, LocaGen augments seen location data based on domain-specific heuristics and strategically selects the seen and unseen locations using a novel density-based approach that ensures robust coverage. Our extensive evaluation on a real-world WiFi fingerprinting dataset shows that LocaGen maintains the same localization accuracy even with 30% of the locations unseen and achieves up to 28% improvement in accuracy over state-of-the-art augmentation methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Masked diffusion models (MDMs) are a promising alternative to autoregressive models (ARMs), but they suffer from inherently much higher training variance. High variance leads to noisier gradient estimates and unstable optimization, so even equally strong pretrained MDMs and ARMs that are competitive at initialization often diverge after task-specific training, with MDMs falling far behind. There has been no theoretical explanation or systematic solution. We derive the first decomposition of MDM training variance into three sources: (A) masking pattern noise, (B) masking rate noise, and (C) data noise, while ARMs are only affected by (C). This explains the fundamental training gap. Building on this foundation, we design six variance-reduction methods, including two core methods: (1) P-POTS, a Pareto-optimal t sampler that minimizes training variance by sampling harder t values more often with appropriately smaller update steps, and (2) MIRROR, which uses negatively correlated samples to reduce (A). Experiments show that compared to standard MDM training, our methods improve accuracy by 7-8% on complex reasoning tasks, while simultaneously reducing run-to-run variability to near ARM levels, substantially narrowing the gap with strong ARM baselines; in most settings, even the best baseline runs remain below the worst run of our method.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation (FSS) models achieve strong performance in segmenting novel classes with minimal labeled examples, yet their decision-making processes remain largely opaque. While explainable AI has advanced significantly in standard computer vision tasks, interpretability in FSS remains virtually unexplored despite its critical importance for understanding model behavior and guiding support set selection in data-scarce scenarios. This paper introduces the first dedicated method for interpreting matching-based FSS models by leveraging their inherent structural properties. Our Affinity Explainer approach extracts attribution maps that highlight which pixels in support images contribute most to query segmentation predictions, using matching scores computed between support and query features at multiple feature levels. We extend standard interpretability evaluation metrics to the FSS domain and propose additional metrics to better capture the practical utility of explanations in few-shot scenarios. Comprehensive experiments on FSS benchmark datasets, using different models, demonstrate that our Affinity Explainer significantly outperforms adapted standard attribution methods. Qualitative analysis reveals that our explanations provide structured, coherent attention patterns that align with model architectures and and enable effective model diagnosis. This work establishes the foundation for interpretable FSS research, enabling better model understanding and diagnostic for more reliable few-shot segmentation systems.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep unfolding networks (DUNs) have recently advanced concealed object segmentation (COS) by modeling segmentation as iterative foreground-background separation. However, existing DUN-based methods (RUN) inherently couple background estimation with image restoration, leading to conflicting objectives and requiring pre-defined degradation types, which are unrealistic in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose the nested unfolding network (NUN), a unified framework for real-world COS. NUN adopts a DUN-in-DUN design, embedding a degradation-resistant unfolding network (DeRUN) within each stage of a segmentation-oriented unfolding network (SODUN). This design decouples restoration from segmentation while allowing mutual refinement. Guided by a vision-language model (VLM), DeRUN dynamically infers degradation semantics and restores high-quality images without explicit priors, whereas SODUN performs reversible estimation to refine foreground and background. Leveraging the multi-stage nature of unfolding, NUN employs image-quality assessment to select the best DeRUN outputs for subsequent stages, naturally introducing a self-consistency loss that enhances robustness. Extensive experiments show that NUN achieves a leading place on both clean and degraded benchmarks. Code will be released.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Egocentric video generation with fine-grained control through body motion is a key requirement towards embodied AI agents that can simulate, predict, and plan actions. In this work, we propose EgoControl, a pose-controllable video diffusion model trained on egocentric data. We train a video prediction model to condition future frame generation on explicit 3D body pose sequences. To achieve precise motion control, we introduce a novel pose representation that captures both global camera dynamics and articulated body movements, and integrate it through a dedicated control mechanism within the diffusion process. Given a short sequence of observed frames and a sequence of target poses, EgoControl generates temporally coherent and visually realistic future frames that align with the provided pose control. Experimental results demonstrate that EgoControl produces high-quality, pose-consistent egocentric videos, paving the way toward controllable embodied video simulation and understanding.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Modern perception increasingly relies on fisheye, panoramic, and other wide field-of-view (FoV) cameras, yet most pipelines still apply planar CNNs designed for pinhole imagery on 2D grids, where image-space neighborhoods misrepresent physical adjacency and models are sensitive to global rotations. Frequency-domain spherical CNNs partially address this mismatch but require costly spherical harmonic transforms that constrain resolution and efficiency. We introduce the Unified Spherical Frontend (USF), a lens-agnostic framework that transforms images from any calibrated camera into a unit-sphere representation via ray-direction correspondences, and performs spherical resampling, convolution, and pooling directly in the spatial domain. USF is modular: projection, location sampling, interpolation, and resolution control are fully decoupled. Its distance-only spherical kernels offer configurable rotation-equivariance (mirroring translation-equivariance in planar CNNs) while avoiding harmonic transforms entirely. We compare standard planar backbones with their spherical counterparts across classification, detection, and segmentation tasks on synthetic (Spherical MNIST) and real-world datasets (PANDORA, Stanford 2D-3D-S), and stress-test robustness to extreme lens distortions, varying FoV, and arbitrary rotations. USF processes high-resolution spherical imagery efficiently and maintains less than 1% performance drop under random test-time rotations, even without rotational augmentation, and even enables zero-shot generalization from one lens type to unseen wide-FoV lenses with minimal performance degradation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advancements in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) have enabled Large Language Models to answer financial questions using external knowledge bases of U.S. SEC filings, earnings reports, and regulatory documents. However, existing work lacks systematic comparison of vector-based and non-vector RAG architectures for financial documents, and the empirical impact of advanced RAG techniques on retrieval accuracy, answer quality, latency, and cost remain unclear. We present the first systematic evaluation comparing vector-based agentic RAG using hybrid search and metadata filtering against hierarchical node-based systems that traverse document structure without embeddings. We evaluate two enhancement techniques applied to the vector-based architecture, i) cross-encoder reranking for retrieval precision, and ii) small-to-big chunk retrieval for context completeness. Across 1,200 SEC 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K filings on a 150-question benchmark, we measure retrieval metrics (MRR, Recall@5), answer quality through LLM-as-a-judge pairwise comparisons, latency, and preprocessing costs. Vector-based agentic RAG achieves a 68% win rate over hierarchical node-based systems with comparable latency (5.2 compared to 5.98 seconds). Cross-encoder reranking achieves a 59% absolute improvement at optimal parameters (10, 5) for MRR@5. Small-to-big retrieval achieves a 65% win rate over baseline chunking with only 0.2 seconds additional latency. Our findings reveal that applying advanced RAG techniques to financial Q&A systems improves retrieval accuracy, answer quality, and has cost-performance tradeoffs to be considered in production.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper addresses a critical gap in Multi-Objective Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MOMARL) by introducing the first dedicated inner-loop actor-critic framework for continuous state and action spaces: Multi-Objective Multi-Agent Actor-Critic (MOMA-AC). Building on single-objective, single-agent algorithms, we instantiate this framework with Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), yielding MOMA-TD3 and MOMA-DDPG. The framework combines a multi-headed actor network, a centralised critic, and an objective preference-conditioning architecture, enabling a single neural network to encode the Pareto front of optimal trade-off policies for all agents across conflicting objectives in a continuous MOMARL setting. We also outline a natural test suite for continuous MOMARL by combining a pre-existing multi-agent single-objective physics simulator with its multi-objective single-agent counterpart. Evaluating cooperative locomotion tasks in this suite, we show that our framework achieves statistically significant improvements in expected utility and hypervolume relative to outer-loop and independent training baselines, while demonstrating stable scalability as the number of agents increases. These results establish our framework as a foundational step towards robust, scalable multi-objective policy learning in continuous multi-agent domains.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Lung cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers, and early diagnosis is critical because the survival rate declines sharply once the disease progresses to advanced stages. However, achieving an early diagnosis remains challenging, particularly in distinguishing subtle early signals of malignancy from those of benign conditions. In clinical practice, a patient with a high risk may need to undergo an initial baseline and several annual follow-up examinations (e.g., CT scans) before receiving a definitive diagnosis, which can result in missing the optimal treatment. Recently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods have been increasingly used for early diagnosis of lung cancer, but most existing algorithms focus on radiomic features extraction from single early-stage CT scans. Inspired by recent advances in diffusion models for image generation, this paper proposes a generative method, named CorrFlowNet, which creates a virtual, one-year follow-up CT scan after the initial baseline scan. This virtual follow-up would allow for an early detection of malignant/benign nodules, reducing the need to wait for clinical follow-ups. During training, our approach employs a correlational autoencoder to encode both early baseline and follow-up CT images into a latent space that captures the dynamics of nodule progression as well as the correlations between them, followed by a flow matching algorithm on the latent space with a neural ordinary differential equation. An auxiliary classifier is used to further enhance the diagnostic accuracy. Evaluations on a real clinical dataset show our method can significantly improve downstream lung nodule risk assessment compared with existing baseline models. Moreover, its diagnostic accuracy is comparable with real clinical CT follow-ups, highlighting its potential to improve cancer diagnosis.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Modern web applications--from real-time content recommendation and dynamic pricing to CDN optimization--increasingly rely on time-series forecasting to deliver personalized experiences to billions of users. Large-scale Transformer-based models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in time-series forecasting but suffer from high computational costs, limiting their deployment in latency-sensitive web applications. To address this challenge, we propose a general inference acceleration framework that adapts speculative decoding to autoregressive time-series models. Our approach employs a smaller "draft" model to propose future time-series patches, which are then verified in parallel by a larger "target" model, reducing the number of sequential forward passes required. We address key technical challenges in adapting this technique from discrete language tokens to continuous time-series distributions, including the design of acceptance criteria for multivariate Gaussian patches and practical variants that balance efficiency with accuracy. Through experiments on time series forecasting benchmarks relevant to web applications, we demonstrate significant inference speedups while maintaining competitive accuracy. The framework requires no architectural modifications to existing foundation models, making it immediately applicable to accelerate deployed time-series forecasting systems.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Document Visual Question Answering (VQA) requires models to not only extract accurate textual answers but also precisely localize them within document images, a capability critical for interpretability in high-stakes applications. However, existing systems achieve strong textual accuracy while producing unreliable spatial grounding, or sacrifice performance for interpretability. We present ARIAL (Agentic Reasoning for Interpretable Answer Localization), a modular framework that orchestrates specialized tools through an LLM-based planning agent to achieve both precise answer extraction and reliable spatial grounding. ARIAL decomposes Document VQA into structured subtasks: OCR-based text extraction with TrOCR, retrieval-augmented context selection using semantic search, answer generation via a fine-tuned Gemma 3-27B model, and explicit bounding-box localization through text-to-region alignment. This modular architecture produces transparent reasoning traces, enabling tool-level auditability and independent component optimization. We evaluate ARIAL on four benchmarks (DocVQA, FUNSD, CORD, and SROIE) using both textual accuracy (ANLS) and spatial precision (mAP at IoU 0.50 to 0.95). ARIAL achieves state-of-the-art results across all datasets: 88.7 ANLS and 50.1 mAP on DocVQA, 90.0 ANLS and 50.3 mAP on FUNSD, 85.5 ANLS and 60.2 mAP on CORD, and 93.1 ANLS on SROIE, surpassing the previous best method (DLaVA) by +2.8 ANLS and +3.9 mAP on DocVQA. Our work demonstrates how agentic orchestration of specialized tools can simultaneously improve performance and interpretability, providing a pathway toward trustworthy, explainable document AI systems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in Large Language Model Multi-Agent Systems enable scalable orchestration and retrieval of specialized, parallelized subagents, each equipped with hundreds or thousands of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and tools. However, existing agent, MCP, and retrieval methods typically match queries against a single agent description, obscuring fine-grained tool capabilities of each agent, resulting in suboptimal agent selection. We introduce Agent-as-a-Graph retrieval, a knowledge graph retrieval augmented generation approach that represents both tools and their parent agents as nodes and edges in a knowledge graph. During retrieval, i) relevant agents and tool nodes are first retrieved through vector search, ii) we apply a type-specific weighted reciprocal rank fusion (wRRF) for reranking tools and agents, and iii) parent agents are traversed in the knowledge graph for the final set of agents. We evaluate Agent-as-a-Graph on the LiveMCPBenchmark, achieving 14.9% and 14.6% improvements in Recall@5 and nDCG@5 over prior state-of-the-art retrievers, and 2.4% improvements in wRRF optimizations.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, robust, fair, diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The success of in vitro fertilization (IVF) at many clinics relies on the accurate morphological assessment of day 5 blastocysts, a process that is often subjective and inconsistent. While artificial intelligence can help standardize this evaluation, models require large, diverse, and balanced datasets, which are often unavailable due to data scarcity, natural class imbalance, and privacy constraints. Existing generative embryo models can mitigate these issues but face several limitations, such as poor image quality, small training datasets, non-robust evaluation, and lack of clinically relevant image generation for effective data augmentation. Here, we present the Diffusion Based Imaging Model for Artificial Blastocysts (DIA) framework, a set of latent diffusion models trained to generate high-fidelity, novel day 5 blastocyst images. Our models provide granular control by conditioning on Gardner-based morphological categories and z-axis focal depth. We rigorously evaluated the models using FID, a memorization metric, an embryologist Turing test, and three downstream classification tasks. Our results show that DIA models generate realistic images that embryologists could not reliably distinguish from real images. Most importantly, we demonstrated clear clinical value. Augmenting an imbalanced dataset with synthetic images significantly improved classification accuracy (p < 0.05). Also, adding synthetic images to an already large, balanced dataset yielded statistically significant performance gains, and synthetic data could replace up to 40% of real data in some cases without a statistically significant loss in accuracy. DIA provides a robust solution for mitigating data scarcity and class imbalance in embryo datasets. By generating novel, high-fidelity, and controllable synthetic images, our models can improve the performance, fairness, and standardization of AI embryo assessment tools.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability, transformer, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Background: Differentiating radiation necrosis (RN) from tumor progression after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) remains a critical challenge in brain metastases. While histopathology represents the gold standard, its invasiveness limits feasibility. Conventional supervised deep learning approaches are constrained by scarce biopsy-confirmed training data. Self-supervised learning (SSL) overcomes this by leveraging the growing availability of large-scale unlabeled brain metastases imaging datasets. Methods: In a two-phase deep learning strategy inspired by the foundation model paradigm, a Vision Transformer (ViT) was pre-trained via SSL on 10,167 unlabeled multi-source T1CE MRI sub-volumes. The pre-trained ViT was then fine-tuned for RN classification using a two-channel input (T1CE MRI and segmentation masks) on the public MOLAB dataset (n=109) using 20% of datasets as same-center held-out test set. External validation was performed on a second-center test cohort (n=28). Results: The self-supervised model achieved an AUC of 0.916 on the same-center test set and 0.764 on the second center test set, surpassing the fully supervised ViT (AUC 0.624/0.496; p=0.001/0.008) and radiomics (AUC 0.807/0.691; p=0.005/0.014). Multimodal integration further improved performance (AUC 0.947/0.821; p=0.073/0.001). Attention map visualizations enabled interpretability showing the model focused on clinically relevant lesion subregions. Conclusion: Large-scale pre-training on increasingly available unlabeled brain metastases datasets substantially improves AI model performance. A two-phase multimodal deep learning strategy achieved high accuracy in differentiating radiation necrosis from tumor progression using only routine T1CE MRI and standard clinical data, providing an interpretable, clinically accessible solution that warrants further validation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) play a vital role in defending modern cyber physical systems against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. Deep Reinforcement Learning-based IDS, have shown promise due to their adaptive and generalization capabilities. However, recent studies reveal their vulnerability to adversarial attacks, including Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs), which can deceive models with a single, input-agnostic perturbation. In this work, we propose a novel UAP attack against Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based IDS under the domain-specific constraints derived from network data rules and feature relationships. To the best of our knowledge, there is no existing study that has explored UAP generation for the DRL-based IDS. In addition, this is the first work that focuses on developing a UAP against a DRL-based IDS under realistic domain constraints based on not only the basic domain rules but also mathematical relations between the features. Furthermore, we enhance the evasion performance of the proposed UAP, by introducing a customized loss function based on the Pearson Correlation Coefficient, and we denote it as Customized UAP. To the best of our knowledge, this is also the first work using the PCC value in the UAP generation, even in the broader context. Four additional established UAP baselines are implemented for a comprehensive comparison. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed Customized UAP outperforms two input-dependent attacks including Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), Basic Iterative Method (BIM), and four UAP baselines, highlighting its effectiveness for real-world adversarial scenarios.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Quantum machine learning seeks to leverage quantum computers to improve upon classical machine learning algorithms. Currently, robust uncertainty quantification methods remain underdeveloped in the quantum domain, despite the critical need for reliable and trustworthy predictions. Recent work has introduced quantum conformal prediction, a framework that produces prediction sets that are guaranteed to contain the true outcome with user-specified probability. In this work, we formalise how the time-varying noise inherent in quantum processors can undermine conformal guarantees, even when calibration and test data are exchangeable. To address this challenge, we draw on Adaptive Conformal Inference, a method which maintains validity over time via repeated recalibration. We introduce Adaptive Quantum Conformal Prediction (AQCP), an algorithm which preserves asymptotic average coverage guarantees under arbitrary hardware noise conditions. Empirical studies on an IBM quantum processor demonstrate that AQCP achieves target coverage levels and exhibits greater stability than quantum conformal prediction.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, attack, interpretability, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As the number of connected IoT devices continues to grow, securing these systems against cyber threats remains a major challenge, especially in environments with limited computational and energy resources. This paper presents an edge-centric Intrusion Detection System (IDS) framework that integrates lightweight machine learning (ML) based IDS models with pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to improve detection accuracy, semantic interpretability, and operational efficiency at the network edge. The system evaluates six ML-based IDS models: Decision Tree (DT), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest (RF), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and a hybrid CNN-LSTM model on low-power edge gateways, achieving accuracy up to 98 percent under real-world cyberattacks. For anomaly detection, the system transmits a compact and secure telemetry snapshot (for example, CPU usage, memory usage, latency, and energy consumption) via low-bandwidth API calls to LLMs including GPT-4-turbo, DeepSeek V2, and LLaMA 3.5. These models use zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought reasoning to produce human-readable threat analyses and actionable mitigation recommendations. Evaluations across diverse attacks such as DoS, DDoS, brute force, and port scanning show that the system enhances interpretability while maintaining low latency (<1.5 s), minimal bandwidth usage (<1.2 kB per prompt), and energy efficiency (<75 J), demonstrating its practicality and scalability as an IDS solution for edge gateways.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) acquisitions require extensive scan times, limiting patient throughput and increasing susceptibility to motion artifacts. Accelerated parallel MRI techniques reduce acquisition time by undersampling k-space data, but require robust reconstruction methods to recover high-quality images. Traditional approaches like SENSE require both undersampled k-space data and pre-computed coil sensitivity maps. We propose an end-to-end deep learning framework that jointly estimates coil sensitivity maps and reconstructs images from only undersampled k-space measurements at 4x acceleration. Our two-module architecture consists of a Coil Sensitivity Map (CSM) estimation module and a U-Net-based MRI reconstruction module. We evaluate our method on multi-coil brain MRI data from 10 subjects with 8 echoes each, using 2x SENSE reconstructions as ground truth. Our approach produces visually smoother reconstructions compared to conventional SENSE output, achieving comparable visual quality despite lower PSNR/SSIM metrics. We identify key challenges including spatial misalignment between different acceleration factors and propose future directions for improved reconstruction quality.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) has given rise to highly diverse and interconnected ecosystems that are increasingly susceptible to sophisticated cyber threats. Conventional anomaly detection schemes often prioritize accuracy while overlooking computational efficiency and environmental impact, which limits their deployment in resource-constrained edge environments. This paper presents \textit{EcoDefender}, a sustainable hybrid anomaly detection framework that integrates \textit{Autoencoder(AE)}-based representation learning with \textit{Isolation Forest(IF)} anomaly scoring. Beyond empirical performance, EcoDefender is supported by a theoretical foundation that establishes formal guarantees for its stability, convergence, robustness, and energy-complexity coupling-thereby linking computational behavior to energy efficiency. Furthermore, experiments on realistic IoT traffic confirm these theoretical insights, achieving up to 94\% detection accuracy with an average CPU usage of only 22\%, 27 ms inference latency, and 30\% lower energy consumption compared to AE-only baselines. By embedding sustainability metrics directly into the security evaluation process, this work demonstrates that reliable anomaly detection and environmental responsibility can coexist within next-generation green IoT infrastructures, aligning with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 9: resilient infrastructure, SDG 13: climate action).</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) has intensified cybersecurity challenges, particularly in mitigating Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks at the network edge. Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) face significant limitations, including poor adaptability to evolving and zero-day attacks, reliance on static signatures and labeled datasets, and inefficiency on resource-constrained edge gateways. Moreover, most existing DRL-based IDS studies overlook sustainability factors such as energy efficiency and carbon impact. To address these challenges, this paper proposes two novel Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based IDS: DeepEdgeIDS, an unsupervised Autoencoder-DRL hybrid, and AutoDRL-IDS, a supervised LSTM-DRL model. Both DRL-based IDS are validated through theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation on edge gateways. Results demonstrate that AutoDRL-IDS achieves 94% detection accuracy using labeled data, while DeepEdgeIDS attains 98% accuracy and adaptability without labels. Distinctly, this study introduces a carbon-aware, multi-objective reward function optimized for sustainable and real-time IDS operations in dynamic IoT networks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Reasoning about intentions and actions from a first-person (egocentric) perspective remains a fundamental challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Unlike third-person (exocentric) videos that capture scenes from an outside observer, egocentric videos reflect the actor's continuously changing viewpoint, introducing partial observability, limited field of view, and self-referenced motion. We introduce $\textbf{EgoVITA}$, a reinforcement learning framework that enables MLLMs to reason through structured planning and verification. Built on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), EgoVITA alternates between two stages: (1) an $\textbf{egocentric planning phase}$, where the model reasons from a first-person viewpoint to predict a step-by-step plan of future actions, and (2) an $\textbf{exocentric verification phase}$, where it switches to a third-person perspective to check the visual and logical consistency of that plan. Through GRPO, the model learns to make plans that are causally predictive of upcoming visual observations, leading to more coherent and visually grounded reasoning. EgoVITA achieves significant gains on egocentric reasoning tasks, outperforming the baseline Qwen2.5-VL-7B by $\mathbf{+7.7}$ on EgoBlind and $\mathbf{+4.4}$ on EgoOrient, while maintaining strong generalization on exocentric video tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>LiDAR scene flow is the task of estimating per-point 3D motion between consecutive point clouds. Recent methods achieve centimeter-level accuracy on popular autonomous vehicle (AV) datasets, but are typically only trained and evaluated on a single sensor. In this paper, we aim to learn general motion priors that transfer to diverse and unseen LiDAR sensors. However, prior work in LiDAR semantic segmentation and 3D object detection demonstrate that naively training on multiple datasets yields worse performance than single dataset models. Interestingly, we find that this conventional wisdom does not hold for motion estimation, and that state-of-the-art scene flow methods greatly benefit from cross-dataset training. We posit that low-level tasks such as motion estimation may be less sensitive to sensor configuration; indeed, our analysis shows that models trained on fast-moving objects (e.g., from highway datasets) perform well on fast-moving objects, even across different datasets. Informed by our analysis, we propose UniFlow, a family of feedforward models that unifies and trains on multiple large-scale LiDAR scene flow datasets with diverse sensor placements and point cloud densities. Our frustratingly simple solution establishes a new state-of-the-art on Waymo and nuScenes, improving over prior work by 5.1% and 35.2% respectively. Moreover, UniFlow achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on unseen datasets like TruckScenes, outperforming prior TruckScenes-specific models by 30.1%.</li>

We thus propose an approach that continuously adapts a pre-trained diffusion model to a video stream. Since fine-tuning the parameters of a large diffusion model is too expensive, we refine the diffusion noise during inference while keeping the model parameters frozen, allowing the model to adaptively determine suitable sampling noise. We term the approach Sequence Adaptive Video Prediction with Diffusion Noise Optimization (SAVi-DNO). To validate our approach, we introduce a new evaluation setting on the Ego4D dataset, focusing on simultaneous adaptation and evaluation on long continuous videos. Empirical results demonstrate improved performance based on FVD, SSIM, and PSNR metrics on long videos of Ego4D and OpenDV-YouTube, as well as videos of UCF-101 and SkyTimelapse, showcasing SAVi-DNO's effectiveness.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Parametric PDEs power modern simulation, design, and digital-twin systems, yet their many-query workloads still hinge on repeatedly solving large finite-element systems. Existing operator-learning approaches accelerate this process but often rely on opaque learned trunks, require extensive labeled data, or break down when boundary and source data vary independently from physical parameters. We introduce RB-DeepONet, a hybrid operator-learning framework that fuses reduced-basis (RB) numerical structure with the branch-trunk architecture of DeepONet. The trunk is fixed to a rigorously constructed RB space generated offline via Greedy selection, granting physical interpretability, stability, and certified error control. The branch network predicts only RB coefficients and is trained label-free using a projected variational residual that targets the RB-Galerkin solution. For problems with independently varying loads or boundary conditions, we develop boundary and source modal encodings that compress exogenous data into low-dimensional coordinates while preserving accuracy. Combined with affine or empirical interpolation decompositions, RB-DeepONet achieves a strict offline-online split: all heavy lifting occurs offline, and online evaluation scales only with the RB dimension rather than the full mesh. We provide convergence guarantees separating RB approximation error from statistical learning error, and numerical experiments show that RB-DeepONet attains accuracy competitive with intrusive RB-Galerkin, POD-DeepONet, and FEONet while using dramatically fewer trainable parameters and achieving significant speedups. This establishes RB-DeepONet as an efficient, stable, and interpretable operator learner for large-scale parametric PDEs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Unified multimodal models aim to integrate understanding and generation within a single framework, yet bridging the gap between discrete semantic reasoning and high-fidelity visual synthesis remains challenging. We present MammothModa2 (Mammoth2), a unified autoregressive-diffusion (AR-Diffusion) framework designed to effectively couple autoregressive semantic planning with diffusion-based generation. Mammoth2 adopts a serial design: an AR path equipped with generation experts performs global semantic modeling over discrete tokens, while a single-stream Diffusion Transformer (DiT) decoder handles high-fidelity image synthesis. A carefully designed AR-Diffusion feature alignment module combines multi-layer feature aggregation, unified condition encoding, and in-context conditioning to stably align AR's representations with the diffusion decoder's continuous latents. Mammoth2 is trained end-to-end with joint Next-Token Prediction and Flow Matching objectives, followed by supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning over both generation and editing. With roughly 60M supervised generation samples and no reliance on pre-trained generators, Mammoth2 delivers strong text-to-image and instruction-based editing performance on public benchmarks, achieving 0.87 on GenEval, 87.2 on DPGBench, and 4.06 on ImgEdit, while remaining competitive with understanding-only backbones (e.g., Qwen3-VL-8B) on multimodal understanding tasks. These results suggest that a carefully coupled AR-Diffusion architecture can provide high-fidelity generation and editing while maintaining strong multimodal comprehension within a single, parameter- and data-efficient model.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Ensuring that the right resource is available at the right location and time remains a major challenge for organizations operating large-scale logistics networks. The challenge comes from uneven demand patterns and the resulting asymmetric flow of resources across the arcs, which create persistent imbalances at the network nodes. Resource substitution among multiple, potentially composite and interchangeable, resource types is a cost-effective way to mitigate these imbalances. This leads to the resource substitution problem, which aims at determining the minimum number of resource substitutions from an initial assignment to minimize the overall network imbalance. In decentralized settings, achieving globally coordinated solutions becomes even more difficult. When substitution entails costs, effective prescriptions must also incorporate fairness and account for the individual preferences of schedulers. This paper presents a generic framework that combines operations research (OR) and machine learning (ML) to enable fair resource substitution in large networks. The OR component models and solves the resource substitution problem under a fairness lens. The ML component leverages historical data to learn schedulers' preferences, guide intelligent exploration of the decision space, and enhance computational efficiency by dynamically selecting the top-$\kappa$ resources for each arc in the network. The framework produces a portfolio of high-quality solutions from which schedulers can select satisfactory trade-offs. The proposed framework is applied to the network of one of the largest package delivery companies in the world, which serves as the primary motivation for this research. Computational results demonstrate substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods, including an 80% reduction in model size and a 90% decrease in execution time while preserving optimality.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text-to-image (T2I) models today are capable of producing photorealistic, instruction-following images, yet they still frequently fail on prompts that require implicit world knowledge. Existing evaluation protocols either emphasize compositional alignment or rely on single-round VQA-based scoring, leaving critical dimensions such as knowledge grounding, multi-physics interactions, and auditable evidence-substantially undertested. To address these limitations, we introduce PicWorld, the first comprehensive benchmark that assesses the grasp of implicit world knowledge and physical causal reasoning of T2I models. This benchmark consists of 1,100 prompts across three core categories. To facilitate fine-grained evaluation, we propose PW-Agent, an evidence-grounded multi-agent evaluator to hierarchically assess images on their physical realism and logical consistency by decomposing prompts into verifiable visual evidence. We conduct a thorough analysis of 17 mainstream T2I models on PicWorld, illustrating that they universally exhibit a fundamental limitation in their capacity for implicit world knowledge and physical causal reasoning to varying degrees. The findings highlight the need for reasoning-aware, knowledge-integrative architectures in future T2I systems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, privacy, protect, defense</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed for optical character recognition (OCR) in healthcare settings, raising critical concerns about protected health information (PHI) exposure during document processing. This work presents the first systematic evaluation of inference-time vision token masking as a privacy-preserving mechanism for medical document OCR using DeepSeek-OCR. We introduce seven masking strategies (V3-V9) targeting different architectural layers (SAM encoder blocks, compression layers, dual vision encoders, projector fusion) and evaluate PHI reduction across HIPAA-defined categories using 100 synthetic medical billing statements (drawn from a corpus of 38,517 annotated documents) with perfect ground-truth annotations. All masking strategies converge to 42.9% PHI reduction, successfully suppressing long-form spatially-distributed identifiers (patient names, dates of birth, physical addresses at 100% effectiveness) while failing to prevent short structured identifiers (medical record numbers, social security numbers, email addresses, account numbers at 0% effectiveness). Ablation studies varying mask expansion radius (r=1,2,3) demonstrate that increased spatial coverage does not improve reduction beyond this ceiling, indicating that language model contextual inference - not insufficient visual masking - drives structured identifier leakage. A simulated hybrid architecture combining vision masking with NLP post-processing achieves 88.6% total PHI reduction (assuming 80% NLP accuracy on remaining identifiers). This negative result establishes boundaries for vision-only privacy interventions in VLMs, provides guidance distinguishing PHI types amenable to vision-level versus language-level redaction, and redirects future research toward decoder-level fine-tuning and hybrid defense-in-depth architectures for HIPAA-compliant medical document processing.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Accurately preserving motion while editing a subject remains a core challenge in video editing tasks. Existing methods often face a trade-off between edit and motion fidelity, as they rely on motion representations that are either overfitted to the layout or only implicitly defined. To overcome this limitation, we revisit point-based motion representation. However, identifying meaningful points remains challenging without human input, especially across diverse video scenarios. To address this, we propose a novel motion representation, anchor tokens, that capture the most essential motion patterns by leveraging the rich prior of a video diffusion model. Anchor tokens encode video dynamics compactly through a small number of informative point trajectories and can be flexibly relocated to align with new subjects. This allows our method, Point-to-Point, to generalize across diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that anchor tokens lead to more controllable and semantically aligned video edits, achieving superior performance in terms of edit and motion fidelity.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models (DMs) produce high-quality images, yet their sampling remains costly when adapted to new domains. Distilled DMs are faster but typically remain confined within their teacher's domain. Thus, fast and high-quality generation for novel domains relies on two-stage training pipelines: Adapt-then-Distill or Distill-then-Adapt. However, both add design complexity and suffer from degraded quality or diversity. We introduce Uni-DAD, a single-stage pipeline that unifies distillation and adaptation of DMs. It couples two signals during training: (i) a dual-domain distribution-matching distillation objective that guides the student toward the distributions of the source teacher and a target teacher, and (ii) a multi-head generative adversarial network (GAN) loss that encourages target realism across multiple feature scales. The source domain distillation preserves diverse source knowledge, while the multi-head GAN stabilizes training and reduces overfitting, especially in few-shot regimes. The inclusion of a target teacher facilitates adaptation to more structurally distant domains. We perform evaluations on a variety of datasets for few-shot image generation (FSIG) and subject-driven personalization (SDP). Uni-DAD delivers higher quality than state-of-the-art (SoTA) adaptation methods even with less than 4 sampling steps, and outperforms two-stage training pipelines in both quality and diversity.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Current roadside perception systems mainly focus on instance-level perception, which fall short in enabling interaction via natural language and reasoning about traffic behaviors in context. To bridge this gap, we introduce RoadSceneVQA, a large-scale and richly annotated visual question answering (VQA) dataset specifically tailored for roadside scenarios. The dataset comprises 34,736 diverse QA pairs collected under varying weather, illumination, and traffic conditions, targeting not only object attributes but also the intent, legality, and interaction patterns of traffic participants. RoadSceneVQA challenges models to perform both explicit recognition and implicit commonsense reasoning, grounded in real-world traffic rules and contextual dependencies. To fully exploit the reasoning potential of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), we further propose CogniAnchor Fusion (CAF), a vision-language fusion module inspired by human-like scene anchoring mechanisms. Moreover, we propose the Assisted Decoupled Chain-of-Thought (AD-CoT) to enhance the reasoned thinking via CoT prompting and multi-task learning. Based on the above, we propose the baseline model RoadMind. Experiments on RoadSceneVQA and CODA-LM benchmark show that the pipeline consistently improves both reasoning accuracy and computational efficiency, allowing the MLLM to achieve state-of-the-art performance in structural traffic perception and reasoning tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Accurately modeling the relationship between perturbations, transcriptional responses, and phenotypic changes is essential for building an AI Virtual Cell (AIVC). However, existing methods typically constrained to modeling direct associations, such as Perturbation $\rightarrow$ RNA or Perturbation $\rightarrow$ Morphology, overlook the crucial causal link from RNA to morphology. To bridge this gap, we propose TRIDENT, a cascade generative framework that synthesizes realistic cellular morphology by conditioning on both the perturbation and the corresponding gene expression profile. To train and evaluate this task, we construct MorphoGene, a new dataset pairing L1000 gene expression with Cell Painting images for 98 compounds. TRIDENT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving up to 7-fold improvement with strong generalization to unseen compounds. In a case study on docetaxel, we validate that RNA-guided synthesis accurately produces the corresponding phenotype. An ablation study further confirms that this RNA conditioning is essential for the model's high fidelity. By explicitly modeling transcriptome-phenome mapping, TRIDENT provides a powerful in silico tool and moves us closer to a predictive virtual cell.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>3D reconstruction in large-scale scenes is a fundamental task in 3D perception, but the inherent trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency remains a significant challenge. Existing methods either prioritize speed and produce low-quality results, or achieve high-quality reconstruction at the cost of slow inference times. In this paper, we propose SwiftVGGT, a training-free method that significantly reduce inference time while preserving high-quality dense 3D reconstruction. To maintain global consistency in large-scale scenes, SwiftVGGT performs loop closure without relying on the external Visual Place Recognition (VPR) model. This removes redundant computation and enables accurate reconstruction over kilometer-scale environments. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective point sampling method to align neighboring chunks using a single Sim(3)-based Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) step. This eliminates the need for the Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS) optimization commonly used in prior work, leading to substantial speed-ups. We evaluate SwiftVGGT on multiple datasets and show that it achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality while requiring only 33% of the inference time of recent VGGT-based large-scale reconstruction approaches.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper revisits alternating low-rank updates for federated fine-tuning and examines their behavior in decentralized federated learning (DFL). While alternating the LoRA matrices has been shown to stabilize aggregation in centralized FL, extending this mechanism to decentralized, peer-to-peer communication introduces new challenges due to phase-state mismatch and block-wise divergence across clients. We introduce ADF-LoRA, which synchronizes the update of only one low-rank matrix per round and mixes both matrices to maintain more consistent parameter states under decentralized propagation. This design preserves the cross-term suppression effect of alternating updates while improving stability in serverless topologies. We provide a convergence analysis under standard smoothness assumptions and evaluate ADF-LoRA on multiple GLUE tasks. Experiments show that ADF-LoRA achieves faster and smoother convergence and delivers the highest average accuracy across tasks, outperforming existing LoRA variants in decentralized FL by a consistent margin.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Neural decoding from electroencephalography (EEG) remains fundamentally limited by poor generalization to unseen subjects, driven by high inter-subject variability and the lack of large-scale datasets to model it effectively. Existing methods often rely on synthetic subject generation or simplistic data augmentation, but these strategies fail to scale or generalize reliably. We introduce \textit{MultiDiffNet}, a diffusion-based framework that bypasses generative augmentation entirely by learning a compact latent space optimized for multiple objectives. We decode directly from this space and achieve state-of-the-art generalization across various neural decoding tasks using subject and session disjoint evaluation. We also curate and release a unified benchmark suite spanning four EEG decoding tasks of increasing complexity (SSVEP, Motor Imagery, P300, and Imagined Speech) and an evaluation protocol that addresses inconsistent split practices in prior EEG research. Finally, we develop a statistical reporting framework tailored for low-trial EEG settings. Our work provides a reproducible and open-source foundation for subject-agnostic EEG decoding in real-world BCI systems.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The detection of hallucinations in multilingual scientific text generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) presents significant challenges for reliable AI systems. This paper describes our submission to the SHROOM-CAP 2025 shared task on scientific hallucination detection across 9 languages. Unlike most approaches that focus primarily on model architecture, we adopted a data-centric strategy that addressed the critical issue of training data scarcity and imbalance. We unify and balance five existing datasets to create a comprehensive training corpus of 124,821 samples (50% correct, 50% hallucinated), representing a 172x increase over the original SHROOM training data. Our approach fine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa-Large with 560 million parameters on this enhanced dataset, achieves competitive performance across all languages, including \textbf{2nd place in Gujarati} (zero-shot language) with Factuality F1 of 0.5107, and rankings between 4th-6th place across the remaining 8 languages. Our results demonstrate that systematic data curation can significantly outperform architectural innovations alone, particularly for low-resource languages in zero-shot settings.</li>

Our framework instantiates a locally deployable DR instance that integrates local retrieval-augmented generation with large language model reasoners, enhanced by a Deep Tree of Research (DToR) mechanism that adaptively expands and prunes research branches to maximize coverage, depth, and coherence. We systematically evaluate across 27 nanomaterials/device topics using a large language model (LLM)-as-judge rubric with five web-enabled state-of-the-art models as jurors. In addition, we conduct dry-lab validations on five representative tasks, where human experts use domain simulations (e.g., density functional theory, DFT) to verify whether DR-agent proposals are actionable. Results show that our DR agent produces reports with quality comparable to--and often exceeding--those of commercial systems (ChatGPT-5-thinking/o3/o4-mini-high Deep Research) at a substantially lower cost, while enabling on-prem integration with local data and tools.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Building codes contain critical information for ensuring safety, regulatory compliance, and informed decision-making in construction and engineering. Automated question answering systems over such codes enable quick and accurate access to specific regulatory clauses, improving efficiency and reducing errors. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are essential for this task as they combine the precision of information retrieval with the generative capabilities of language models. However, tabular data are challenging to extract as they often involve complex layouts, merged cells, multi-row headers, and embedded semantic relationships that are not easily captured by traditional natural language processing techniques and Vision Language Models (VLMs). This paper explores and compares two methods for extracting information from tabular data in building codes using several pre-trained VLMs. First, a direct input method is used, where the image of the page is input directly into the VLMs, which are then tasked with answering questions based on the image. Second, an indirect input method is introduced, which involves converting an image of a page containing tables into the LaTeX code and then answering inquires based on the LaTeX-based input. The experiments find that the direct input method generally resulted in higher accuracy than the indirect input method. To further improve the performance, we fine-tuned each VLM using Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on a domain-specific tabular dataset. The fine-tuned models exhibited substantial improvements, with Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct achieving relative accuracy gains exceeding 100%. Our results highlight the potential of parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods to adapt powerful VLMs for understanding complex structured data in specialized fields, such as building code interpretation and regulatory compliance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Styled handwriting generation aims to synthesize handwritten text that looks both realistic and aligned with a specific writer's style. While recent approaches involving GAN, transformer and diffusion-based models have made progress, they often struggle to capture the full spectrum of writer-specific attributes, particularly global stylistic patterns that span long-range spatial dependencies. As a result, capturing subtle writer-specific traits such as consistent slant, curvature or stroke pressure, while keeping the generated text accurate is still an open problem. In this work, we present a unified framework designed to address these limitations. We introduce a Vision Transformer-based style encoder that learns global stylistic patterns from multiple reference images, allowing the model to better represent long-range structural characteristics of handwriting. We then integrate these style cues with the target text using a cross-attention mechanism, enabling the system to produce handwritten images that more faithfully reflect the intended style. To make the process more interpretable, we utilize Salient Stroke Attention Analysis (SSAA), which reveals the stroke-level features the model focuses on during style transfer. Together, these components lead to handwriting synthesis that is not only more stylistically coherent, but also easier to understand and analyze.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Time series data plays a pivotal role in a wide variety of fields but faces challenges related to privacy concerns. Recently, synthesizing data via diffusion models is viewed as a promising solution. However, existing methods still struggle to capture long-range temporal dependencies and complex channel interrelations. In this research, we aim to utilize the sequence modeling capability of a State Space Model called Mamba to extend its applicability to time series data generation. We firstly analyze the core limitations in State Space Model, namely the lack of consideration for correlated temporal lag and channel permutation. Building upon the insight, we propose Lag Fusion Mamba and Permutation Scanning Mamba, which enhance the model's ability to discern significant patterns during the denoising process. Theoretical analysis reveals that both variants exhibit a unified matrix multiplication framework with the original Mamba, offering a deeper understanding of our method. Finally, we integrate two variants and introduce Diffusion Mamba for Time Series (DiM-TS), a high-quality time series generation model that better preserves the temporal periodicity and inter-channel correlations. Comprehensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate the superiority of DiM-TS in generating realistic time series while preserving diverse properties of data.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Model agents often retrieve context from knowledge bases that lack structural consistency with the agent's current reasoning state, leading to incoherent reasoning chains. We introduce Path-Constrained Retrieval (PCR), a retrieval method that combines structural graph constraints with semantic search to ensure retrieved information maintains logical relationships within a knowledge graph. PCR restricts the search space to nodes reachable from an anchor node, preventing retrieval of structurally disconnected information that may lead to inconsistent reasoning. We evaluate PCR on PathRAG-6, a benchmark spanning six domains with 180 nodes and 360 edges. Our results show that PCR achieves full structural consistency compared to 24-32 percent in baseline methods, while maintaining strong relevance scores. On the technology domain, PCR obtains full relevance at rank 10 with full structural consistency, significantly outperforming vector search and hybrid retrieval. PCR reduces the average graph distance of retrieved context by 78 percent compared to baselines, demonstrating retrieval of more structurally consistent information. These findings suggest that path-constrained retrieval is an effective approach for improving the reliability and coherence of LLM agent reasoning systems.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Stroke majorly causes death and disability worldwide, and early recognition is one of the key elements of successful treatment of the same. It is common to diagnose strokes using CT scanning, which is fast and readily available, however, manual analysis may take time and may result in mistakes. In this work, a pre-trained Vision Transformer-based transfer learning framework is proposed for the early identification of brain stroke. A few of the encoder blocks of the ViT model are frozen, and the rest are allowed to be fine-tuned in order to learn brain stroke-specific features. The features that have been extracted are given as input to a single-layer Bi-GRU to perform classification. Class imbalance is handled by data augmentation. The model has achieved 94.06% accuracy in classifying brain stroke from the Stroke Dataset.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Stereo optical measurement techniques, such as digital image correlation (DIC), are widely used in 3D deformation measurement as non-contact, full-field measurement methods, in which stereo calibration is a crucial step. However, current stereo calibration methods lack intuitive optimal pose guidance, leading to inefficiency and suboptimal accuracy in deformation measurements. The aim of this study is to develop an interactive calibration framework that automatically generates the next optimal pose, enabling high-accuracy stereo calibration for 3D deformation measurement. We propose a pose optimization method that introduces joint optimization of relative and absolute extrinsic parameters, with the minimization of the covariance matrix trace adopted as the loss function to solve for the next optimal pose. Integrated with this method is a user-friendly graphical interface, which guides even non-expert users to capture qualified calibration images. Our proposed method demonstrates superior efficiency (requiring fewer images) and accuracy (demonstrating lower measurement errors) compared to random pose, while maintaining robustness across varying FOVs. In the thermal deformation measurement tests on an S-shaped specimen, the results exhibit high agreement with finite element analysis (FEA) simulations in both deformation magnitude and evolutionary trends. We present a pose guidance method for high-precision stereo calibration in 3D deformation measurement. The simulation experiments, real-world experiments, and thermal deformation measurement applications all demonstrate the significant application potential of our proposed method in the field of 3D deformation measurement.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Brain tumor detection from MRI scans plays a crucial role in early diagnosis and treatment planning. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated strong performance in medical imaging tasks, particularly when pretrained on large datasets. However, it remains unclear which type of pretrained model performs better when only a small dataset is available: those trained on domain-specific medical data or those pretrained on large general datasets. In this study, we systematically evaluate three pretrained CNN architectures for brain tumor classification: RadImageNet DenseNet121 with medical-domain pretraining, EfficientNetV2S, and ConvNeXt-Tiny, which are modern general-purpose CNNs. All models were trained and fine-tuned under identical conditions using a limited-size brain MRI dataset to ensure a fair comparison. Our results reveal that ConvNeXt-Tiny achieved the highest accuracy, followed by EfficientNetV2S, while RadImageNet DenseNet121, despite being pretrained on domain-specific medical data, exhibited poor generalization with lower accuracy and higher loss. These findings suggest that domain-specific pretraining may not generalize well under small-data conditions. In contrast, modern, deeper general-purpose CNNs pretrained on large-scale datasets can offer superior transfer learning performance in specialized medical imaging tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>For online ad-recommendation systems, processing complete user-ad-engagement histories is both computationally intensive and noise-prone. We introduce Dynamix, a scalable, personalized sequence exploration framework that optimizes event history processing using maximum relevance principles and self-supervised learning through Event Based Features (EBFs). Dynamix categorizes users-engagements at session and surface-levels by leveraging correlations between dwell-times and ad-conversion events. This enables targeted, event-level feature removal and selective feature boosting for certain user-segments, thereby yielding training and inference efficiency wins without sacrificing engaging ad-prediction accuracy. While, dynamic resource removal increases training and inference throughput by 1.15% and 1.8%, respectively, dynamic feature boosting provides 0.033 NE gains while boosting inference QPS by 4.2% over baseline models. These results demonstrate that Dynamix achieves significant cost efficiency and performance improvements in online user-sequence based recommendation models. Self-supervised user-segmentation and resource exploration can further boost complex feature selection strategies while optimizing for workflow and compute resources.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Unified multimodal models that couple visual understanding with image generation have advanced rapidly, yet most systems still focus on visual grounding-aligning language with image regions-while their generative counterpart, linguistic-embedded layout-grounded generation (LELG) for layout-controllable multi-instance generation, remains underexplored and limits precise compositional control. We present ConsistCompose, a unified multimodal framework that embeds layout coordinates directly into language prompts, enabling layout-controlled multi-instance image generation from Interleaved Image-Text within a single generative interface. We further construct ConsistCompose3M, a 3.4M multi-instance generation dataset with layout and identity annotations (2.6M text-guided and 0.8M image-guided data pairs) that provides large-scale supervision for layout-conditioned generation. Within this framework, LELG is instantiated through instance-coordinate binding prompts and coordinate-aware classifier-free guidance, which translate linguistic layout cues into precise spatial control without task-specific branches. Experiments on COCO-Position and MS-Bench show that ConsistCompose substantially improves spatial accuracy over layout-controlled baselines while preserving identity fidelity and competitive general multimodal understanding, establishing a unified paradigm for layout-controllable multimodal image generation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Urinary tract infection (UTI) flare-ups pose a significant health risk for older adults with chronic conditions. These infections often go unnoticed until they become severe, making early detection through innovative smart home technologies crucial. Traditional machine learning (ML) approaches relying on simple binary classification for UTI detection offer limited utility to nurses and practitioners as they lack insight into prediction uncertainty, hindering informed clinical decision-making. This paper presents a clinician-in-the-loop (CIL) smart home system that leverages ambient sensor data to extract meaningful behavioral markers, train robust predictive ML models, and calibrate them to enable uncertainty-aware decision support. The system incorporates a statistically valid uncertainty quantification method called Conformal-Calibrated Interval (CCI), which quantifies uncertainty and abstains from making predictions ("I don't know") when the ML model's confidence is low. Evaluated on real-world data from eight smart homes, our method outperforms baseline methods in recall and other classification metrics while maintaining the lowest abstention proportion and interval width. A survey of 42 nurses confirms that our system's outputs are valuable for guiding clinical decision-making, underscoring their practical utility in improving informed decisions and effectively managing UTIs and other condition flare-ups in older adults.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate structured outputs that follow arbitrary schemas is crucial to a wide range of downstream tasks that require diverse structured representations of results such as information extraction, table generation, and function calling. While modern LLMs excel in generating unstructured responses in natural language, whether this advancement translates to a strong performance on text-to-structure tasks remains unclear. To bridge this gap, we first introduce OmniStruct, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing LLMs' capabilities on diverse text-to-structure tasks such as information extraction, table generation, and function calling. We build OmniStruct by identifying existing datasets across a wide range of tasks that are suitable for a structured answer format, and adapting them under a unified text-to-structure problem setting. To facilitate the development of efficient text-to-structure models, we collect high-quality training data via synthetic task generation. Without using any supervised data for OmniStruct tasks, our experiments demonstrate the possibility of fine-tuning much smaller models on synthetic data into universal structured generation models that can rival the performance of GPT-4o.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the proliferation of low altitude unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), visual multi-object tracking is becoming a critical security technology, demanding significant robustness even in complex environmental conditions. However, tracking UAVs using a single visual modality often fails in challenging scenarios, such as low illumination, cluttered backgrounds, and rapid motion. Although multi-modal multi-object UAV tracking is more resilient, the development of effective solutions has been hindered by the absence of dedicated public datasets. To bridge this gap, we release MM-UAV, the first large-scale benchmark for Multi-Modal UAV Tracking, integrating three key sensing modalities, e.g. RGB, infrared (IR), and event signals. The dataset spans over 30 challenging scenarios, with 1,321 synchronised multi-modal sequences, and more than 2.8 million annotated frames. Accompanying the dataset, we provide a novel multi-modal multi-UAV tracking framework, designed specifically for UAV tracking applications and serving as a baseline for future research. Our framework incorporates two key technical innovations, e.g. an offset-guided adaptive alignment module to resolve spatio mismatches across sensors, and an adaptive dynamic fusion module to balance complementary information conveyed by different modalities. Furthermore, to overcome the limitations of conventional appearance modelling in multi-object tracking, we introduce an event-enhanced association mechanism that leverages motion cues from the event modality for more reliable identity maintenance. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. To foster further research in multi-modal UAV tracking, both the dataset and source code will be made publicly available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>How do video understanding models acquire their answers? Although current Vision Language Models (VLMs) reason over complex scenes with diverse objects, action performances, and scene dynamics, understanding and controlling their internal processes remains an open challenge. Motivated by recent advancements in text-to-video (T2V) generative models, this paper introduces a logits-to-video (L2V) task alongside a model-independent approach, TRANSPORTER, to generate videos that capture the underlying rules behind VLMs' predictions. Given the high-visual-fidelity produced by T2V models, TRANSPORTER learns an optimal transport coupling to VLM's high-semantic embedding spaces. In turn, logit scores define embedding directions for conditional video generation. TRANSPORTER generates videos that reflect caption changes over diverse object attributes, action adverbs, and scene context. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations across VLMs demonstrate that L2V can provide a fidelity-rich, novel direction for model interpretability that has not been previously explored.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>3D pose transfer aims to transfer the pose-style of a source mesh to a target character while preserving both the target's geometry and the source's pose characteristic. Existing methods are largely restricted to characters with similar structures and fail to generalize to category-free settings (e.g., transferring a humanoid's pose to a quadruped). The key challenge lies in the structural and transformation diversity inherent in distinct character types, which often leads to mismatched regions and poor transfer quality. To address these issues, we first construct a million-scale pose dataset across hundreds of distinct characters. We further propose MimiCAT, a cascade-transformer model designed for category-free 3D pose transfer. Instead of relying on strict one-to-one correspondence mappings, MimiCAT leverages semantic keypoint labels to learn a novel soft correspondence that enables flexible many-to-many matching across characters. The pose transfer is then formulated as a conditional generation process, in which the source transformations are first projected onto the target through soft correspondence matching and subsequently refined using shape-conditioned representations. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that MimiCAT transfers plausible poses across different characters, significantly outperforming prior methods that are limited to narrow category transfer (e.g., humanoid-to-humanoid).</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text-to-Image (T2I) generation has long been an open problem, with compositional synthesis remaining particularly challenging. This task requires accurate rendering of complex scenes containing multiple objects that exhibit diverse attributes as well as intricate spatial and semantic relationships, demanding both precise object placement and coherent inter-object interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel compositional curriculum reinforcement learning framework named CompGen that addresses compositional weakness in existing T2I models. Specifically, we leverage scene graphs to establish a novel difficulty criterion for compositional ability and develop a corresponding adaptive Markov Chain Monte Carlo graph sampling algorithm. This difficulty-aware approach enables the synthesis of training curriculum data that progressively optimize T2I models through reinforcement learning. We integrate our curriculum learning approach into Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and investigate different curriculum scheduling strategies. Our experiments reveal that CompGen exhibits distinct scaling curves under different curriculum scheduling strategies, with easy-to-hard and Gaussian sampling strategies yielding superior scaling performance compared to random sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CompGen significantly enhances compositional generation capabilities for both diffusion-based and auto-regressive T2I models, highlighting its effectiveness in improving the compositional T2I generation systems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, privacy</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) grants holders full ownership and control of their digital identities, being the ultimate digital identity model. Operating in a decentralized manner, SSI enables the verification of claims, including privacy-preserving mechanisms. Blockchain, which can be used to implement a Verifiable Data Registry (VDR), is often considered one of the pillars of SSI, along with Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs). Unfortunately, blockchains are mostly siloed, affecting the interoperability and universality of SSI. We investigate the effect of blockchain isolation on blockchain-based SSI. We first define possible scenarios for cross-chain SSI and exemplify with real-life use cases. We then define specific requirements for cross-chain SSI and identify challenges, also in relation to the identified scenarios. We explore various solutions to achieve blockchain interoperability, with a focus on SSI. In particular, we identify the advantages and disadvantages of distinct cross-chain models for cross-chain SSI. Finally, we address the usability of cross-chain SSI and discuss security and privacy aspects, opening the way for future research.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Mamba has recently garnered attention as an effective backbone for vision tasks. However, its underlying mechanism in visual domains remains poorly understood. In this work, we systematically investigate Mamba's representational properties and make three primary contributions. First, we theoretically analyze Mamba's relationship to Softmax and Linear Attention, confirming that it can be viewed as a low-rank approximation of Softmax Attention and thereby bridging the representational gap between Softmax and Linear forms. Second, we introduce a novel binary segmentation metric for activation map evaluation, extending qualitative assessments to a quantitative measure that demonstrates Mamba's capacity to model long-range dependencies. Third, by leveraging DINO for self-supervised pretraining, we obtain clearer activation maps than those produced by standard supervised approaches, highlighting Mamba's potential for interpretability. Notably, our model also achieves a 78.5 percent linear probing accuracy on ImageNet, underscoring its strong performance. We hope this work can provide valuable insights for future investigations of Mamba-based vision architectures.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Automatic X-ray prohibited items detection is vital for security inspection and has been widely studied. Traditional methods rely on visual modality, often struggling with complex threats. While recent studies incorporate language to guide single-view images, human inspectors typically use dual-view images in practice. This raises the question: can the second view provide constraints similar to a language modality? In this work, we introduce DualXrayBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for X-ray inspection that includes multiple views and modalities. It supports eight tasks designed to test cross-view reasoning. In DualXrayBench, we introduce a caption corpus consisting of 45,613 dual-view image pairs across 12 categories with corresponding captions. Building upon these data, we propose the Geometric (cross-view)-Semantic (cross-modality) Reasoner (GSR), a multimodal model that jointly learns correspondences between cross-view geometry and cross-modal semantics, treating the second-view images as a "language-like modality". To enable this, we construct the GSXray dataset, with structured Chain-of-Thought sequences: <top>, <side>, <conclusion>. Comprehensive evaluations on DualXrayBench demonstrate that GSR achieves significant improvements across all X-ray tasks, offering a new perspective for real-world X-ray inspection.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We have introduced SegSplat, a novel framework designed to bridge the gap between rapid, feed-forward 3D reconstruction and rich, open-vocabulary semantic understanding. By constructing a compact semantic memory bank from multi-view 2D foundation model features and predicting discrete semantic indices alongside geometric and appearance attributes for each 3D Gaussian in a single pass, SegSplat efficiently imbues scenes with queryable semantics. Our experiments demonstrate that SegSplat achieves geometric fidelity comparable to state-of-the-art feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting methods while simultaneously enabling robust open-set semantic segmentation, crucially \textit{without} requiring any per-scene optimization for semantic feature integration. This work represents a significant step towards practical, on-the-fly generation of semantically aware 3D environments, vital for advancing robotic interaction, augmented reality, and other intelligent systems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, fair, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>A decade of rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI) has opened new opportunities for clinical decision support systems (CDSS), with large language models (LLMs) demonstrating strong reasoning abilities on timely medical tasks. However, clinical texts are often degraded by human errors or failures in automated pipelines, raising concerns about the reliability and fairness of AI-assisted decision-making. Yet the impact of such degradations remains under-investigated, particularly regarding how noise-induced shifts can heighten predictive uncertainty and unevenly affect demographic subgroups. We present a systematic study of state-of-the-art LLMs under diverse text corruption scenarios, focusing on robustness and equity in next-visit diagnosis prediction. To address the challenge posed by the large diagnostic label space, we introduce a clinically grounded label-reduction scheme and a hierarchical chain-of-thought (CoT) strategy that emulates clinicians' reasoning. Our approach improves robustness and reduces subgroup instability under degraded inputs, advancing the reliable use of LLMs in CDSS. We release code at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate partial forecasting competence across social, political, and economic events. Yet, their predictive ability varies sharply with domain structure and prompt framing. We investigate how forecasting performance varies with different model families on real-world questions about events that happened beyond the model cutoff date. We analyze how context, question type, and external knowledge affect accuracy and calibration, and how adding factual news context modifies belief formation and failure modes. Our results show that forecasting ability is highly variable as it depends on what, and how, we ask.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Aligning large-scale commercial models with user intent is crucial to preventing harmful outputs. Current methods rely on human supervision but become impractical as model complexity increases. When models surpass human knowledge, providing accurate feedback becomes challenging and inefficient. A novel solution proposed recently is using a weaker model to supervise a stronger model. This concept leverages the ability of weaker models to perform evaluations, thereby reducing the workload on human supervisors. Previous work has shown the effectiveness of weak-to-strong generalization in the context of language-only models. Extending this concept to vision-language models leverages these insights, adapting the proven benefits to a multi-modal context. In our study, we explore weak-to-strong generalization for CLIP-based classification. We propose a method, class prototype learning (CPL), which aims to enhance the classification capabilities of the CLIP model, by learning more representative prototypes for each category. Our findings indicate that, despite using a simple loss function under weak supervision, CPL yields robust improvements in targeted scenarios, particularly when pretraining is limited. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach is effective under these settings, achieving a 3.67% improvement over strong baseline methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent pre-training strategies for molecular graphs have attempted to use 2D and 3D molecular views as both inputs and self-supervised signals, primarily aligning graph-level representations. However, existing studies remain limited in addressing two main challenges of multi-view molecular learning: (1) discovering shared information between two views while diminishing view-specific information and (2) identifying and aligning important substructures, e.g., functional groups, which are crucial for enhancing cross-view consistency and model expressiveness. To solve these challenges, we propose a Multi-View Conditional Information Bottleneck framework, called MVCIB, for pre-training graph neural networks on 2D and 3D molecular structures in a self-supervised setting. Our idea is to discover the shared information while minimizing irrelevant features from each view under the MVCIB principle, which uses one view as a contextual condition to guide the representation learning of its counterpart. To enhance semantic and structural consistency across views, we utilize key substructures, e.g., functional groups and ego-networks, as anchors between the two views. Then, we propose a cross-attention mechanism that captures fine-grained correlations between the substructures to achieve subgraph alignment across views. Extensive experiments in four molecular domains demonstrated that MVCIB consistently outperforms baselines in both predictive performance and interpretability. Moreover, MVCIB achieved the 3d Weisfeiler-Lehman expressiveness power to distinguish not only non-isomorphic graphs but also different 3D geometries that share identical 2D connectivity, such as isomers.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Mechanistic interpretability (MI) seeks to uncover how language models (LMs) implement specific behaviors, yet measuring progress in MI remains challenging. The recently released Mechanistic Interpretability Benchmark (MIB; Mueller et al., 2025) provides a standardized framework for evaluating circuit and causal variable localization. Building on this foundation, the BlackboxNLP 2025 Shared Task extends MIB into a community-wide reproducible comparison of MI techniques. The shared task features two tracks: circuit localization, which assesses methods that identify causally influential components and interactions driving model behavior, and causal variable localization, which evaluates approaches that map activations into interpretable features. With three teams spanning eight different methods, participants achieved notable gains in circuit localization using ensemble and regularization strategies for circuit discovery. With one team spanning two methods, participants achieved significant gains in causal variable localization using low-dimensional and non-linear projections to featurize activation vectors. The MIB leaderboard remains open; we encourage continued work in this standard evaluation framework to measure progress in MI research going forward.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Agentic recommendations cast recommenders as large language model (LLM) agents that can plan, reason, use tools, and interact with users of varying preferences in web applications. However, most existing agentic recommender systems focus on generic single-agent plan-execute workflows or multi-agent task decomposition pipelines. Without recommendation-oriented design, they often underuse the collaborative signals in the user-item interaction history, leading to unsatisfying recommendation results. To address this, we propose the Multi-Agent Collaborative Filtering (MACF) framework for agentic recommendations, drawing an analogy between traditional collaborative filtering algorithms and LLM-based multi-agent collaboration. Specifically, given a target user and query, we instantiate similar users and relevant items as LLM agents with unique profiles. Each agent is able to call retrieval tools, suggest candidate items, and interact with other agents. Different from the static preference aggregation in traditional collaborative filtering, MACF employs a central orchestrator agent to adaptively manage the collaboration between user and item agents via dynamic agent recruitment and personalized collaboration instruction. Experimental results on datasets from three different domains show the advantages of our MACF framework compared to strong agentic recommendation baselines.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Precise 3D segmentation of cerebral vasculature from T1-weighted contrast-enhanced (T1CE) MRI is crucial for safe neurosurgical planning. Manual delineation is time-consuming and prone to inter-observer variability, while current automated methods often trade accuracy for computational cost, limiting clinical use. We present NeuroVascU-Net, the first deep learning architecture specifically designed to segment cerebrovascular structures directly from clinically standard T1CE MRI in neuro-oncology patients, addressing a gap in prior work dominated by TOF-MRA-based approaches. NeuroVascU-Net builds on a dilated U-Net and integrates two specialized modules: a Multi-Scale Contextual Feature Fusion ($MSC^2F$) module at the bottleneck and a Cross-Domain Adaptive Feature Fusion ($CDA^2F$) module at deeper hierarchical layers. $MSC^2F$ captures both local and global information via multi-scale dilated convolutions, while $CDA^2F$ dynamically integrates domain-specific features, enhancing representation while keeping computation low. The model was trained and validated on a curated dataset of T1CE scans from 137 brain tumor biopsy patients, annotated by a board-certified functional neurosurgeon. NeuroVascU-Net achieved a Dice score of 0.8609 and precision of 0.8841, accurately segmenting both major and fine vascular structures. Notably, it requires only 12.4M parameters, significantly fewer than transformer-based models such as Swin U-NetR. This balance of accuracy and efficiency positions NeuroVascU-Net as a practical solution for computer-assisted neurosurgical planning.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Memory is critical for AI agents, yet the widely-adopted static memory, aiming to create readily available memory in advance, is inevitably subject to severe information loss. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework called \textbf{general agentic memory (GAM)}. GAM follows the principle of "\textbf{just-in time (JIT) compilation}" where it focuses on creating optimized contexts for its client at runtime while keeping only simple but useful memory during the offline stage. To this end, GAM employs a duo-design with the following components. 1) \textbf{Memorizer}, which highlights key historical information using a lightweight memory, while maintaining complete historical information within a universal page-store. 2) \textbf{Researcher}, which retrieves and integrates useful information from the page-store for its online request guided by the pre-constructed memory. This design allows GAM to effectively leverage the agentic capabilities and test-time scalability of frontier large language models (LLMs), while also facilitating end-to-end performance optimization through reinforcement learning. In our experimental study, we demonstrate that GAM achieves substantial improvement on various memory-grounded task completion scenarios against existing memory systems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The advent of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has unlocked the potential for end-to-end document parsing and translation. However, prevailing benchmarks such as OmniDocBench and DITrans are dominated by pristine scanned or digital-born documents, and thus fail to adequately represent the intricate challenges of real-world capture conditions, such as geometric distortions and photometric variations. To fill this gap, we introduce DocPTBench, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for Photographed Document Parsing and Translation. DocPTBench comprises over 1,300 high-resolution photographed documents from multiple domains, includes eight translation scenarios, and provides meticulously human-verified annotations for both parsing and translation. Our experiments demonstrate that transitioning from digital-born to photographed documents results in a substantial performance decline: popular MLLMs exhibit an average accuracy drop of 18% in end-to-end parsing and 12% in translation, while specialized document parsing models show significant average decrease of 25%. This substantial performance gap underscores the unique challenges posed by documents captured in real-world conditions and reveals the limited robustness of existing models.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid advancement of face generation techniques has led to a growing variety of forgery methods. Incremental forgery detection aims to gradually update existing models with new forgery data, yet current sample replay-based methods are limited by low diversity and privacy concerns. Generative replay offers a potential solution by synthesizing past data, but its feasibility for forgery detection remains unclear. In this work, we systematically investigate generative replay and identify two scenarios: when the replay generator closely resembles the new forgery model, generated real samples blur the domain boundary, creating domain-risky samples; when the replay generator differs significantly, generated samples can be safely supervised, forming domain-safe samples. To exploit generative replay effectively, we propose a novel Domain-Aware Relative Weighting (DARW) strategy. DARW directly supervises domain-safe samples while applying a Relative Separation Loss to balance supervision and potential confusion for domain-risky samples. A Domain Confusion Score dynamically adjusts this tradeoff according to sample reliability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DARW consistently improves incremental learning performance for forgery detection under different generative replay settings and alleviates the adverse impact of domain overlap.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and is now being applied to Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, vanilla RLVR for VLMs verifies only the final textual output, critically neglecting the foundational step of visual perception. This oversight leads to visual hallucinations and reward hacking, as reasoning built upon flawed perception is inherently unreliable. To address this, we propose PEARL (Perceptual-Evidence Anchored Reinforced Learning), a dual-branch, perception-reasoning synergistic that strengthens multimodal reasoning by explicitly anchoring it to verified visual evidence. For each reasoning-oriented QA instance, PEARL first derive a perception checklist -- a set of perception-oriented sub-questions with verifiable answers that probe the model's understanding of key visual evidence. During training, auxiliary rollouts on this checklist yield a perceptual reward that both directly reinforces the model's perception ability and acts as a fidelity gate for reasoning. If the model passes the perception check, its policy update is biased towards evidence-anchored reasoning. Otherwise, the process is halted to prevent reasoning from flawed premises. PEARL can be seamlessly integrated with popular RL methods like GRPO and DAPO. Comprehensive experiments show PEARL achieves substantial gains on multimodal reasoning benchmarks, e.g., a +9.7% improvement over the baseline and +6.6% over GRPO on MathVerse.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) and their agent systems have recently demonstrated strong potential in automating code reasoning and vulnerability detection. However, when applied to large-scale firmware, their performance degrades due to the binary nature of firmware, complex dependency structures, and heterogeneous components. To address this challenge, this paper presents FIRMHIVE, a recursive agent hive that enables LLMs to act as autonomous firmware security analysts. FIRMHIVE introduces two key mechanisms: (1) transforming delegation into a per-agent, executable primitive and (2) constructing a runtime Tree of Agents (ToA) for decentralized coordination. We evaluate FIRMHIVE using real-world firmware images obtained from publicly available datasets, covering five representative security analysis tasks. Compared with existing LLM-agent baselines, FIRMHIVE performs deeper (about 16x more reasoning steps) and broader (about 2.3x more files inspected) cross-file exploration, resulting in about 5.6x more alerts per firmware. Compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) security tools, FIRMHIVE identifies about 1.5x more vulnerabilities (1,802 total) and achieves 71% precision, representing significant improvements in both yield and fidelity.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a leading method for novel view synthesis, offering superior training efficiency and real-time inference compared to NeRF approaches, while still delivering high-quality reconstructions. Beyond view synthesis, this 3D representation has also been explored for editing tasks. Many existing methods leverage 2D diffusion models to generate multi-view datasets for training, but they often suffer from limitations such as view inconsistencies, lack of fine-grained control, and high computational demand. In this work, we focus specifically on the editing task of recoloring. We introduce a user-friendly pipeline that enables precise selection and recoloring of regions within a pre-trained Gaussian Splatting scene. To demonstrate the real-time performance of our method, we also present an interactive tool that allows users to experiment with the pipeline in practice. Code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) increasingly need to forget specific knowledge such as unsafe or private information without requiring full retraining. However, existing unlearning methods often disrupt vision language alignment, causing models to reject both harmful and benign queries. We trace this failure to the projector network during unlearning, its Jacobian becomes severely illconditioned, leading to unstable optimization and drift in cross modal embeddings. We introduce SineProject, a simple method that augments the frozen projector with sinusoidally modulated trainable parameters, improving the Jacobian's spectral conditioning and stabilizing alignment throughout unlearning. Across standard safety and privacy unlearning benchmarks using LLaVA v1.5 7B and 13B, SineProject reduces benign query refusals while achieving complete forgetting of targeted information, yielding state of the art forget retain trade offs with negligible computational overhead.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant advancements in event-based vision, yet the comprehensive evaluation of their capabilities within a unified benchmark remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce EventBench, a benchmark that offers eight diverse task metrics together with a large-scale event stream dataset. EventBench differs from existing event-based benchmarks in four key aspects: (1) openness in accessibility, releasing all raw event streams and task instructions across eight evaluation metrics; (2) diversity in task coverage, spanning understanding, recognition, and spatial reasoning tasks for comprehensive capability assessment; (3) integration in spatial dimensions, pioneering the design of 3D spatial reasoning tasks for event-based MLLMs; and (4) scale in data volume, with an accompanying training set of over one million event-text pairs supporting large-scale training and evaluation. Using EventBench, we evaluate state-of-the-art closed-source models such as GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5 Pro, leading open-source models including Qwen2.5-VL and InternVL3, and event-based MLLMs such as EventGPT that directly process raw event streams. Extensive evaluation reveals that while current event-based MLLMs demonstrate strong performance in event stream understanding, they continue to struggle with fine-grained recognition and spatial reasoning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, explainability, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The degree of embryo fragmentation serves as a critical morphological indicator for assessing embryo developmental potential in In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) clinical decision-making. However, current manual grading processes are not only time-consuming but also limited by significant inter-observer variability and efficiency bottlenecks. Although deep learning has demonstrated potential in automated grading in recent years, existing solutions face a significant challenge: pure regression models lack the visual explainability required for clinical practice, while pure segmentation models struggle to directly translate pixel-level masks into precise clinical grades. This study proposes RegDeepLab, a dual-branch Multi-Task Learning (MTL) framework that integrates State-of-the-Art (SOTA) semantic segmentation (DeepLabV3+) with a multi-scale regression head. Addressing the common issues of "Gradient Conflict" and "Negative Transfer" in multi-task training, we propose a "Two-Stage Decoupled Training Strategy." Experimental results demonstrate that while standard end-to-end MTL training can minimize grading error (MAE=0.046) through our designed "Feature Injection" mechanism, it compromises the integrity of segmentation boundaries. In contrast, our decoupled strategy successfully provides robust and high-precision grading predictions while preserving SOTA-level segmentation accuracy (Dice=0.729). Furthermore, we introduce a "Range Loss" to effectively utilize large-scale discrete grading data for semi-supervised learning. This study ultimately presents a dual-module clinical auxiliary solution that combines high accuracy with visual explainability.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, protect, defense, attack, robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid advancement of Large Language Model (LLM)-driven multi-agent systems has significantly streamlined software developing tasks, enabling users with little technical expertise to develop executable applications. While these systems democratize software creation through natural language requirements, they introduce significant security risks that remain largely unexplored. We identify two risky scenarios: Malicious User with Benign Agents (MU-BA) and Benign User with Malicious Agents (BU-MA). We introduce the Implicit Malicious Behavior Injection Attack (IMBIA), demonstrating how multi-agent systems can be manipulated to generate software with concealed malicious capabilities beneath seemingly benign applications, and propose Adv-IMBIA as a defense mechanism. Evaluations across ChatDev, MetaGPT, and AgentVerse frameworks reveal varying vulnerability patterns, with IMBIA achieving attack success rates of 93%, 45%, and 71% in MU-BA scenarios, and 71%, 84%, and 45% in BU-MA scenarios. Our defense mechanism reduced attack success rates significantly, particularly in the MU-BA scenario. Further analysis reveals that compromised agents in the coding and testing phases pose significantly greater security risks, while also identifying critical agents that require protection against malicious user exploitation. Our findings highlight the urgent need for robust security measures in multi-agent software development systems and provide practical guidelines for implementing targeted, resource-efficient defensive strategies.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) is crucial for deploying models in real-world applications with unseen, evolving target domains. Existing CTTA methods, however, often rely on source data or prototypes, limiting their applicability in privacy-sensitive and resource-constrained settings. Additionally, these methods suffer from long-term forgetting, which degrades performance on previously encountered domains as target domains shift. To address these challenges, we propose SloMo-Fast, a source-free, dual-teacher CTTA framework designed for enhanced adaptability and generalization. It includes two complementary teachers: the Slow-Teacher, which exhibits slow forgetting and retains long-term knowledge of previously encountered domains to ensure robust generalization, and the Fast-Teacher rapidly adapts to new domains while accumulating and integrating knowledge across them. This framework preserves knowledge of past domains and adapts efficiently to new ones. We also introduce Cyclic Test-Time Adaptation (Cyclic-TTA), a novel CTTA benchmark that simulates recurring domain shifts. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that SloMo-Fast consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across Cyclic-TTA, as well as ten other CTTA settings, highlighting its ability to both adapt and generalize across evolving and revisited domains.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>People continuously perceive and interact with their surroundings based on underlying intentions that drive their exploration and behaviors. While research in egocentric user and scene understanding has focused primarily on motion and contact-based interaction, forecasting human visual perception itself remains less explored despite its fundamental role in guiding human actions and its implications for AR/VR and assistive technologies. We address the challenge of egocentric 3D visual span forecasting, predicting where a person's visual perception will focus next within their three-dimensional environment. To this end, we propose EgoSpanLift, a novel method that transforms egocentric visual span forecasting from 2D image planes to 3D scenes. EgoSpanLift converts SLAM-derived keypoints into gaze-compatible geometry and extracts volumetric visual span regions. We further combine EgoSpanLift with 3D U-Net and unidirectional transformers, enabling spatio-temporal fusion to efficiently predict future visual span in the 3D grid. In addition, we curate a comprehensive benchmark from raw egocentric multisensory data, creating a testbed with 364.6K samples for 3D visual span forecasting. Our approach outperforms competitive baselines for egocentric 2D gaze anticipation and 3D localization while achieving comparable results even when projected back onto 2D image planes without additional 2D-specific training.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful generative priors for solving inverse problems, achieving state-of-the-art results across various imaging tasks. A central challenge in this setting lies in balancing the contribution of the prior with the data fidelity term: overly aggressive likelihood updates may introduce artifacts, while conservative updates can slow convergence or yield suboptimal reconstructions. In this work, we propose an adaptive likelihood step-size strategy to guide the diffusion process for inverse-problem formulations. Specifically, we develop an observation-dependent weighting scheme based on the agreement between two different approximations of the intractable intermediate likelihood gradients, that adapts naturally to the diffusion schedule, time re-spacing, and injected stochasticity. The resulting approach, Adaptive Posterior diffusion Sampling (AdaPS), is hyperparameter-free and improves reconstruction quality across diverse imaging tasks - including super-resolution, Gaussian deblurring, and motion deblurring - on CelebA-HQ and ImageNet-256 validation sets. AdaPS consistently surpasses existing diffusion-based baselines in perceptual quality with minimal or no loss in distortion, without any task-specific tuning. Extensive ablation studies further demonstrate its robustness to the number of diffusion steps, observation noise levels, and varying stochasticity.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Hyperspectral image reconstruction from a compressed measurement is a highly ill-posed inverse problem. Current data-driven methods suffer from hallucination due to the lack of spectral diversity in existing hyperspectral image datasets, particularly when they are evaluated for the metamerism phenomenon. In this work, we formulate hyperspectral image (HSI) reconstruction as a Bayesian inference problem and propose a framework, HSDiff, that utilizes an unconditionally trained, pixel-level diffusion prior and posterior diffusion sampling to generate diverse HSI samples consistent with the measurements of various hyperspectral image formation models. We propose an enhanced metameric augmentation technique using region-based metameric black and partition-of-union spectral upsampling to expand training with physically valid metameric spectra, strengthening the prior diversity and improving uncertainty calibration. We utilize HSDiff to investigate how the studied forward models shape the posterior distribution and demonstrate that guiding with effective spectral encoding provides calibrated informative uncertainty compared to non-encoded models. Through the lens of the Bayesian framework, HSDiff offers a complete, high-performance method for uncertainty-aware HSI reconstruction.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, robust, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Our study presents a multifaceted approach to enhancing user interaction and content relevance in social media platforms through a federated learning framework. We introduce personalized LLM Federated Learning and Context-based Social Media models. In our framework, multiple client entities receive a foundational GPT model, which is fine-tuned using locally collected social media data while ensuring data privacy through federated aggregation. Key modules focus on categorizing user-generated content, computing user persona scores, and identifying relevant posts from friends networks. By integrating a sophisticated social engagement quantification method with matrix factorization techniques, our system delivers real-time personalized content suggestions tailored to individual preferences. Furthermore, an adaptive feedback loop, alongside a robust readability scoring algorithm, significantly enhances the quality and relevance of the content presented to users. This comprehensive solution not only addresses the challenges of content filtering and recommendation but also fosters a more engaging social media experience while safeguarding user privacy, setting a new standard for personalized interactions in digital platforms.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, security, fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Opening up data produced by the Internet of Things (IoT) and mobile devices for public utilization can maximize their economic value. Challenges remain in the trustworthiness of the data sources and the security of the trading process, particularly when there is no trust between the data providers and consumers. In this paper, we propose DEXO, a decentralized data exchange mechanism that facilitates secure and fair data exchange between data consumers and distributed IoT/mobile data providers at scale, allowing the consumer to verify the data generation process and the providers to be compensated for providing authentic data, with correctness guarantees from the exchange platform. To realize this, DEXO extends the decentralized oracle network model that has been successful in the blockchain applications domain to incorporate novel hardware-cryptographic co-design that harmonizes trusted execution environment, secret sharing, and smart contract-assisted fair exchange. For the first time, DEXO ensures end-to-end data confidentiality, source verifiability, and fairness of the exchange process with strong resilience against participant collusion. We implemented a prototype of the DEXO system to demonstrate feasibility. The evaluation shows a moderate deployment cost and significantly improved blockchain operation efficiency compared to a popular data exchange mechanism.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Continual learning in visual understanding aims to deal with catastrophic forgetting in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). MLLMs deployed on devices have to continuously adapt to dynamic scenarios in downstream tasks, such as variations in background and perspective, to effectively perform complex visual tasks. To this end, we construct a multimodal visual understanding dataset (MSVQA) encompassing four different scenarios and perspectives including high altitude, underwater, low altitude and indoor, to investigate the catastrophic forgetting in MLLMs under the dynamics of scenario shifts in real-world data streams. Furthermore, we propose mUltimodal coNtInual learning with MLLMs From multi-scenarIo pERspectives (UNIFIER) to address visual discrepancies while learning different scenarios. Specifically, it decouples the visual information from different scenarios into distinct branches within each vision block and projects them into the same feature space. A consistency constraint is imposed on the features of each branch to maintain the stability of visual representations across scenarios. Extensive experiments on the MSVQA dataset demonstrate that UNIFIER effectively alleviates forgetting of cross-scenario tasks and achieves knowledge accumulation within the same scenario.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Efforts to overcome catastrophic forgetting in Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) have primarily focused on developing more effective gradient-based optimization strategies. In contrast, little attention has been paid to the training cost explosion that inevitably arises as the number of novel classes increases, a consequence of relying on gradient learning even under extreme data scarcity. More critically, since FSCIL typically provides only a few samples for each new class, gradient-based updates not only induce severe catastrophic forgetting on base classes but also hinder adaptation to novel ones. This paper seeks to break this long-standing limitation by asking: Can we design a training-free FSCIL paradigm that entirely removes gradient optimization? We provide an affirmative answer by uncovering an intriguing connection between gradient-based optimization and the Conditional Diffusion process. Building on this observation, we propose a Conditional Diffusion-driven FSCIL (CD-FSCIL) framework that substitutes the conventional gradient update process with a diffusion-based generative transition, enabling training-free incremental adaptation while effectively mitigating forgetting. Furthermore, to enhance representation under few-shot constraints, we introduce a multimodal learning strategy that integrates visual features with natural language descriptions automatically generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). This synergy substantially alleviates the sample scarcity issue and improves generalization across novel classes. Extensive experiments on mainstream FSCIL benchmarks demonstrate that our method not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also drastically reduces computational and memory overhead, marking a paradigm shift toward training-free continual adaptation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Geostationary hyperspectral satellites generate terabytes of data daily, creating critical challenges for storage, transmission, and distribution to the scientific community. We present a variational autoencoder (VAE) approach that achieves x514 compression of NASA's TEMPO satellite hyperspectral observations (1028 channels, 290-490nm) with reconstruction errors 1-2 orders of magnitude below the signal across all wavelengths. This dramatic data volume reduction enables efficient archival and sharing of satellite observations while preserving spectral fidelity. Beyond compression, we investigate to what extent atmospheric information is retained in the compressed latent space by training linear and nonlinear probes to extract Level-2 products (NO2, O3, HCHO, cloud fraction). Cloud fraction and total ozone achieve strong extraction performance (R^2 = 0.93 and 0.81 respectively), though these represent relatively straightforward retrievals given their distinct spectral signatures. In contrast, tropospheric trace gases pose genuine challenges for extraction (NO2 R^2 = 0.20, HCHO R^2 = 0.51) reflecting their weaker signals and complex atmospheric interactions. Critically, we find the VAE encodes atmospheric information in a semi-linear manner - nonlinear probes substantially outperform linear ones - and that explicit latent supervision during training provides minimal improvement, revealing fundamental encoding challenges for certain products. This work demonstrates that neural compression can dramatically reduce hyperspectral data volumes while preserving key atmospheric signals, addressing a critical bottleneck for next-generation Earth observation systems.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Despite rapid progress in logic locking (LL), reproducibility remains a challenge as codes are rarely made public. We present LockForge, a first-of-its-kind, multi-agent large language model (LLM) framework that turns LL descriptions in papers into executable and tested code. LockForge provides a carefully crafted pipeline realizing forethought, implementation, iterative refinement, and a multi-stage validation, all to systematically bridge the gap between prose and practice for complex LL schemes. For validation, we devise (i) an LLM-as-Judge stage with a scoring system considering behavioral checks, conceptual mechanisms, structural elements, and reproducibility on benchmarks, and (ii) an independent LLM-as-Examiner stage for ground-truth assessment. We apply LockForge to 10 seminal LL schemes, many of which lack reference implementations. Our evaluation on multiple SOTA LLMs, including ablation studies, reveals the significant complexity of the task. We show that an advanced reasoning model and a sophisticated, multi-stage framework like LockForge are required. We release all implementations and benchmarks, providing a reproducible and fair foundation for evaluation of further LL research.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, interpretability, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Accurate segmentation of individual teeth from panoramic radiographs remains a challenging task due to anatomical variations, irregular tooth shapes, and overlapping structures. These complexities often limit the performance of conventional deep learning models. To address this, we propose DE-KAN, a novel Dual Encoder Kolmogorov Arnold Network, which enhances feature representation and segmentation precision. The framework employs a ResNet-18 encoder for augmented inputs and a customized CNN encoder for original inputs, enabling the complementary extraction of global and local spatial features. These features are fused through KAN-based bottleneck layers, incorporating nonlinear learnable activation functions derived from the Kolmogorov Arnold representation theorem to improve learning capacity and interpretability. Extensive experiments on two benchmark dental X-ray datasets demonstrate that DE-KAN outperforms state-of-the-art segmentation models, achieving mIoU of 94.5%, Dice coefficient of 97.1%, accuracy of 98.91%, and recall of 97.36%, representing up to +4.7% improvement in Dice compared to existing methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Reconstructing high-fidelity MR images from undersampled k-space data requires recovering high-frequency details while maintaining anatomical coherence. We present HiFi-MambaV2, a hierarchical shared-routed Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Mamba architecture that couples frequency decomposition with content-adaptive computation. The model comprises two core components: (i) a separable frequency-consistent Laplacian pyramid (SF-Lap) that delivers alias-resistant, stable low- and high-frequency streams; and (ii) a hierarchical shared-routed MoE that performs per-pixel top-1 sparse dispatch to shared experts and local routers, enabling effective specialization with stable cross-depth behavior. A lightweight global context path is fused into an unrolled, data-consistency-regularized backbone to reinforce long-range reasoning and preserve anatomical coherence. Evaluated on fastMRI, CC359, ACDC, M4Raw, and Prostate158, HiFi-MambaV2 consistently outperforms CNN-, Transformer-, and prior Mamba-based baselines in PSNR, SSIM, and NMSE across single- and multi-coil settings and multiple acceleration factors, consistently surpassing consistent improvements in high-frequency detail and overall structural fidelity. These results demonstrate that HiFi-MambaV2 enables reliable and robust MRI reconstruction.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Existing video deraining methods are often trained on paired datasets, either synthetic, which limits their ability to generalize to real-world rain, or captured by static cameras, which restricts their effectiveness in dynamic scenes with background and camera motion. Furthermore, recent works in fine-tuning diffusion models have shown promising results, but the fine-tuning tends to weaken the generative prior, limiting generalization to unseen cases. In this paper, we introduce the first zero-shot video deraining method for complex dynamic scenes that does not require synthetic data nor model fine-tuning, by leveraging a pretrained text-to-video diffusion model that demonstrates strong generalization capabilities. By inverting an input video into the latent space of diffusion models, its reconstruction process can be intervened and pushed away from the model's concept of rain using negative prompting. At the core of our approach is an attention switching mechanism that we found is crucial for maintaining dynamic backgrounds as well as structural consistency between the input and the derained video, mitigating artifacts introduced by naive negative prompting. Our approach is validated through extensive experiments on real-world rain datasets, demonstrating substantial improvements over prior methods and showcasing robust generalization without the need for supervised training.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Probabilistic Time-Series Forecasting (PTSF) is critical for uncertainty-aware decision making, but existing generative models, such as diffusion-based approaches, are computationally prohibitive due to expensive iterative sampling. Non-sampling frameworks like Multiple Choice Learning (MCL) offer an efficient alternative, but suffer from severe training instability and hypothesis collapse, which has historically hindered their performance. This problem is dramatically exacerbated when attempting to combine them with modern, efficient MLP-based backbones. To resolve this fundamental incompatibility, we propose TimePre, a novel framework that successfully unifies the efficiency of MLP-based models with the distributional flexibility of the MCL paradigm. The core of our solution is Stabilized Instance Normalization (SIN), a novel normalization layer that explicitly remedies this incompatibility. SIN stabilizes the hybrid architecture by correcting channel-wise statistical shifts, definitively resolving the catastrophic hypothesis collapse. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that TimePre achieves new state-of-the-art accuracy on key probabilistic metrics. Critically, TimePre achieves inference speeds orders of magnitude faster than sampling-based models and, unlike prior MCL work, demonstrates stable performance scaling. It thus bridges the long-standing gap between accuracy, efficiency, and stability in probabilistic forecasting.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Cellular networks have become foundational to modern communication, supporting a broad range of applications, from civilian use to enterprise systems and military tactical networks. The advent of fifth-generation and beyond cellular networks (B5G) introduces emerging compute capabilities into the Radio Access Network (RAN), transforming it from a traditionally closed, vendor-locked infrastructure into an open and programmable ecosystem. This evolution, exemplified by Open-RAN (O-RAN), enables the deployment of control-plane applications from diverse sources, which can dynamically influence user-plane traffic in response to real-time events. As cellular infrastructures become more disaggregated and software-driven, security becomes an increasingly critical concern. Zero-Trust Architecture (ZTA) has emerged as a promising security paradigm that discards implicit trust assumptions by acknowledging that threats may arise from both external and internal sources. ZTA mandates comprehensive and fine-grained security mechanisms across both control and user planes to contain adversarial movements and enhance breach detection and attack response actions. In this paper, we explore the adoption of ZTA in the context of 5G and beyond, with a particular focus on O-RAN as an architectural enabler. We analyze how ZTA principles align with the architectural and operational characteristics of O-RAN, and identify key challenges and opportunities for embedding zero-trust mechanisms within O-RAN-based cellular networks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, interpretability, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Long-sequence electroencephalogram (EEG) modeling is essential for developing generalizable EEG representation models. This need arises from the high sampling rate of EEG data and the long recording durations required to capture extended neurological patterns in brain activity. Transformer-based models have shown promise in modeling short sequences of a few seconds; however, their quadratic complexity limits scalability to longer contexts. Moreover, variability in electrode montage across available datasets, along with inter-subject differences in brain signals, pose significant challenges to developing a generalizable and robust foundation model. We propose \textit{SAMBA}, a self-supervised learning framework with a Mamba-based U-shaped encoder-decoder architecture, which effectively captures long-range temporal dependencies and spatial variability in EEG data. Leveraging the inherent ability of Mamba in processing long context sizes, we introduce: (1) \textit{Temporal Semantic Random Masking} for semantic-level sequence reconstruction, (2) a \textit{Multi-Head Differential Mamba} module to suppress redundancy and emphasize salient temporal structures, and (3) a \textit{Spatial-Adaptive Input Embedding} that learns unified embeddings in a three-dimensional Euclidean space, enabling robustness across devices. Experiments on thirteen EEG datasets across diverse tasks, electrode configurations, and sequence durations demonstrate that SAMBA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods while maintaining low memory consumption and inference time. We also show the learned spatial weight maps from our embedding module align closely with task-relevant neurophysiological regions, demonstrating the learnability and interpretability of SAMBA. These results highlight SAMBA's scalability and practical potential as a foundation model for real-time brain-computer interface applications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Many recent studies showed that LLMs are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, where an attacker can perturb the input of an LLM to induce it to generate an output for a harmful question. In general, existing jailbreak techniques either optimize a semantic template intended to induce the LLM to produce harmful outputs or optimize a suffix that leads the LLM to initiate its response with specific tokens (e.g., "Sure"). In this work, we introduce TASO (Template and Suffix Optimization), a novel jailbreak method that optimizes both a template and a suffix in an alternating manner. Our insight is that suffix optimization and template optimization are complementary to each other: suffix optimization can effectively control the first few output tokens but cannot control the overall quality of the output, while template optimization provides guidance for the entire output but cannot effectively control the initial tokens, which significantly impact subsequent responses. Thus, they can be combined to improve the attack's effectiveness. We evaluate the effectiveness of TASO on benchmark datasets (including HarmBench and AdvBench) on 24 leading LLMs (including models from the Llama family, OpenAI, and DeepSeek). The results demonstrate that TASO can effectively jailbreak existing LLMs. We hope our work can inspire future studies in exploring this direction. We will make code and data publicly available.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Real-world dark images commonly exhibit not only low visibility and contrast but also complex noise and blur, posing significant restoration challenges. Existing methods often rely on paired data or fail to model dynamic illumination and blur characteristics, leading to poor generalization. To tackle this, we propose a generative framework based on visual autoregressive (VAR) modeling, guided by perceptual priors from the vision-language model (VLM). Specifically, to supply informative conditioning cues for VAR models, we deploy an adaptive curve estimation scheme to modulate the diverse illumination based on VLM-derived visibility scores. In addition, we integrate dynamic and spatial-frequency-aware Rotary Positional Encodings (SF-RoPE) into VAR to enhance its ability to model structures degraded by blur. Furthermore, we propose a recursive phase-domain modulation strategy that mitigates blur-induced artifacts in the phase domain via bounded iterative refinement guided by VLM-assessed blur scores. Our framework is fully unsupervised and achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Graph Diffusion Models (GDMs) optimize for statistical likelihood, implicitly acting as \textbf{frequency filters} that favor abundant substructures over spectrally critical ones. We term this phenomenon \textbf{Generative Myopia}. In combinatorial tasks like graph sparsification, this leads to the catastrophic removal of ``rare bridges,'' edges that are structurally mandatory ($R_{\text{eff}} \approx 1$) but statistically scarce. We prove theoretically and empirically that this failure is driven by \textbf{Gradient Starvation}: the optimization landscape itself suppresses rare structural signals, rendering them unlearnable regardless of model capacity. To resolve this, we introduce \textbf{Spectrally-Weighted Diffusion}, which re-aligns the variational objective using Effective Resistance. We demonstrate that spectral priors can be amortized into the training phase with zero inference overhead. Our method eliminates myopia, matching the performance of an optimal Spectral Oracle and achieving \textbf{100\% connectivity} on adversarial benchmarks where standard diffusion fails completely (0\%).</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Differentiating true tumor progression (TP) from treatment-related pseudoprogression (PsP) in glioblastoma remains challenging, especially at early follow-up. We present the first stage-specific, cross-sectional benchmarking of deep learning models for follow-up MRI using the Burdenko GBM Progression cohort (n = 180). We analyze different post-RT scans independently to test whether architecture performance depends on time-point. Eleven representative DL families (CNNs, LSTMs, hybrids, transformers, and selective state-space models) were trained under a unified, QC-driven pipeline with patient-level cross-validation. Across both stages, accuracies were comparable (~0.70-0.74), but discrimination improved at the second follow-up, with F1 and AUC increasing for several models, indicating richer separability later in the care pathway. A Mamba+CNN hybrid consistently offered the best accuracy-efficiency trade-off, while transformer variants delivered competitive AUCs at substantially higher computational cost and lightweight CNNs were efficient but less reliable. Performance also showed sensitivity to batch size, underscoring the need for standardized training protocols. Notably, absolute discrimination remained modest overall, reflecting the intrinsic difficulty of TP vs. PsP and the dataset's size imbalance. These results establish a stage-aware benchmark and motivate future work incorporating longitudinal modeling, multi-sequence MRI, and larger multi-center cohorts.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in natural language and code generation, and are increasingly deployed as automatic judges of model outputs and learning activities. Yet, their behavior on structured tasks such as predicting the difficulty of competitive programming problems remains under-explored. We conduct a systematic comparison of GPT-4o, used purely as a natural-language difficulty assessor, against an interpretable Light-GBM ensemble trained on explicit numeric and textual features. On a dataset of 1,825 LeetCode problems labeled Easy, Medium, or Hard, LightGBM attains 86% accuracy, whereas GPT-4o reaches only 37.75%. Detailed analyses, including confusion matrices and SHAP-based interpretability, show that numeric constraints -- such as input size limits and acceptance rates -- play a crucial role in separating Hard problems from easier ones. By contrast, GPT-4o often overlooks these cues and exhibits a strong bias toward simpler categories. We further probe GPT-4o through a synthetic Hard-problem generation protocol. Surprisingly, GPT-4o labels almost all of its own synthetic Hard problems as Medium, contradicting its tendency to downgrade real Hard problems to Easy. Our findings connect to recent work on LLMs-as-judges and automatic difficulty estimation in programming and education, and highlight concrete failure modes that must be addressed before LLM-based judges can be considered trustworthy in competitive programming, educational platforms, or reinforcement-learning pipelines.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Split learning emerges as a promising paradigm for collaborative distributed model training, akin to federated learning, by partitioning neural networks between clients and a server without raw data exchange. However, sequential split learning suffers from poor scalability, while parallel variants like parallel split learning and split federated learning often incur high server resource overhead due to model duplication and aggregation, and generally exhibit reduced model performance and convergence owing to factors like client drift and lag. To address these limitations, we introduce CycleSL, a novel aggregation-free split learning framework that enhances scalability and performance and can be seamlessly integrated with existing methods. Inspired by alternating block coordinate descent, CycleSL treats server-side training as an independent higher-level machine learning task, resampling client-extracted features (smashed data) to mitigate heterogeneity and drift. It then performs cyclical updates, namely optimizing the server model first, followed by client updates using the updated server for gradient computation. We integrate CycleSL into previous algorithms and benchmark them on five publicly available datasets with non-iid data distribution and partial client attendance. Our empirical findings highlight the effectiveness of CycleSL in enhancing model performance. Our source code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper compares Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM) for forecasting non-deterministic stock price data, evaluating predictive accuracy versus interpretability trade-offs using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).LSTM demonstrates substantial superiority across all tested prediction horizons, confirming their established effectiveness for sequential data modelling. Standard KAN, while offering theoretical interpretability through the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, exhibits significantly higher error rates and limited practical applicability for time series forecasting. The results confirm LSTM dominance in accuracy-critical time series applications while identifying computational efficiency as KANs' primary advantage in resource-constrained scenarios where accuracy requirements are less stringent. The findings support LSTM adoption for practical financial forecasting while suggesting that continued research into specialised KAN architectures may yield future improvements.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Label shift, a prevalent challenge in supervised learning, arises when the class prior distribution of test data differs from that of training data, leading to significant degradation in classifier performance. To accurately estimate the test priors and enhance classification accuracy, we propose a Bayesian framework for label shift estimation, termed Full Maximum A Posterior Label Shift (FMAPLS), along with its online version, online-FMAPLS. Leveraging batch and online Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithms, these methods jointly and dynamically optimize Dirichlet hyperparameters $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$ and class priors $\boldsymbol{\pi}$, thereby overcoming the rigid constraints of the existing Maximum A Posterior Label Shift (MAPLS) approach. Moreover, we introduce a linear surrogate function (LSF) to replace gradient-based hyperparameter updates, yielding closed-form solutions that reduce computational complexity while retaining asymptotic equivalence. The online variant substitutes the batch E-step with a stochastic approximation, enabling real-time adaptation to streaming data. Furthermore, our theoretical analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off between online convergence rate and estimation accuracy. Extensive experiments on CIFAR100 and ImageNet datasets under shuffled long-tail and Dirichlet test priors demonstrate that FMAPLS and online-FMAPLS respectively achieve up to 40% and 12% lower KL divergence and substantial improvements in post-shift accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines, particularly under severe class imbalance and distributional uncertainty. These results confirm the robustness, scalability, and suitability of the proposed methods for large-scale and dynamic learning scenarios.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Beliefs are central to how humans reason, communicate, and form social connections, yet most computational approaches to studying them remain confined to narrow sociopolitical contexts and rely on fine-tuning for optimal performance. Despite the growing use of large language models (LLMs) across disciplines, how well these systems generalize across diverse belief domains remains unclear. We introduce a systematic, reproducible benchmark that evaluates the ability of LLMs to predict individuals' stances on a wide range of topics in a zero-shot setting using data from an online debate platform. The benchmark includes multiple informational conditions that isolate the contribution of demographic context and known prior beliefs to predictive success. Across several small- to medium-sized models, we find that providing more background information about an individual improves predictive accuracy, but performance varies substantially across belief domains. These findings reveal both the capacity and limitations of current LLMs to emulate human reasoning, advancing the study of machine behavior and offering a scalable framework for modeling belief systems beyond the sociopolitical sphere.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Language Models are extremely susceptible to performance collapse with even small changes to input prompt strings. Libraries such as DSpy (from Stanford NLP) avoid this problem through demonstration-based prompt optimisation. Inspired by this, I propose an alternative approach that treats prompt optimisation as a classical state-space search problem. I model the prompt space as a graph where nodes represent prompt states and edges correspond to deliberate transformations such as shortening, adding examples, or re- ordering content. Using beam search and random walk algorithms, I systematically explore this space, evaluating candidates on development sets and pruning unpromising branches. Across five NLP tasks (sentiment classification, question answering, summarisation, reason- ing, and natural language inference), I find that even shallow search configurations (beam width=2, depth=2) improve upon seed prompts on development sets. For instance, beam search achieves development accuracy gains from 0.40 to 0.80 on reasoning tasks, though test set improvements are more modest (0.20 to 0.50), indicating overfitting to the develop- ment heuristic. Analysis of successful optimisation paths reveals that transformations that make prompts concise appear most frequently, while verbosity operators are never selected. My results validate prompt optimization as a search problem and suggest that with greater computational resources and improved evaluation metrics, deeper exploration could yield more robust prompts that generalize beyond development sets.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Reliable detection of retinal diseases from fundus images is challenged by the variability in imaging quality, subtle early-stage manifestations, and domain shift across datasets. In this study, we systematically evaluated a Vision Transformer (ViT) classifier under multiple augmentation and enhancement strategies across several heterogeneous public datasets, as well as the AEyeDB dataset, a high-quality fundus dataset created in-house and made available for the research community. The ViT demonstrated consistently strong performance, with accuracies ranging from 0.789 to 0.843 across datasets and diseases. Diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration were detected reliably, whereas glaucoma remained the most frequently misclassified disease. Geometric and color augmentations provided the most stable improvements, while histogram equalization benefited datasets dominated by structural subtlety. Laplacian enhancement reduced performance across different settings. On the Papila dataset, the ViT with geometric augmentation achieved an AUC of 0.91, outperforming previously reported convolutional ensemble baselines (AUC of 0.87), underscoring the advantages of transformer architectures and multi-dataset training. To complement the classifier, we developed a GANomaly-based anomaly detector, achieving an AUC of 0.76 while providing inherent reconstruction-based explainability and robust generalization to unseen data. Probabilistic calibration using GUESS enabled threshold-independent decision support for future clinical implementation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Sampling multiple outputs from a Large Language Model (LLM) and selecting the most frequent (Self-consistency) or highest-scoring (Best-of-N) candidate is a popular approach to achieve higher accuracy in tasks with discrete final answers. Best-of-N (BoN) selects the output with the highest reward, and with perfect rewards, it often achieves near-perfect accuracy. With imperfect rewards from reward models, however, BoN fails to reliably find the correct answer and its performance degrades drastically. We consider the distribution of BoN's outputs and highlight that, although the correct answer does not usually have a probability close to one under imperfect rewards, it is often the most likely outcome. This suggests that the mode of this distribution can be more reliably correct than a sample from it. Based on this idea, we propose Majority-of-the-Bests (MoB), a novel selection mechanism that estimates the output distribution of BoN via bootstrapping and selects its mode. Experimental results across five benchmarks, three different base LLMs, and two reward models demonstrate consistent improvements over BoN in 25 out of 30 setups. We also provide theoretical results for the consistency of the bootstrapping. MoB serves as a simple, yet strong alternative to BoN and self-consistency, and more broadly, motivates further research in more nuanced selection mechanisms.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in large language models made it possible to achieve high conversational performance with substantially reduced computational demands, enabling practical on-site deployment in clinical environments. Such progress allows for local integration of AI systems that uphold strict data protection and patient privacy requirements, yet their secure implementation in medicine necessitates careful consideration of ethical, regulatory, and technical constraints. In this study, we introduce MedChat, a locally deployable virtual physician framework that integrates an LLM-based medical chatbot with a diffusion-driven avatar for automated and structured anamnesis. The chatbot was fine-tuned using a hybrid corpus of real and synthetically generated medical dialogues, while model efficiency was optimized via Low-Rank Adaptation. A secure and isolated database interface was implemented to ensure complete separation between patient data and the inference process. The avatar component was realized through a conditional diffusion model operating in latent space, trained on researcher video datasets and synchronized with mel-frequency audio features for realistic speech and facial animation. Unlike existing cloud-based systems, this work demonstrates the feasibility of a fully offline, locally deployable LLM-diffusion framework for clinical anamnesis. The autoencoder and diffusion networks exhibited smooth convergence, and MedChat achieved stable fine-tuning with strong generalization to unseen data. The proposed system thus provides a privacy-preserving, resource-efficient foundation for AI-assisted clinical anamnesis, also in low-cost settings.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, fair, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) inherit societal biases from their training data, potentially leading to harmful or unfair outputs. While various techniques aim to mitigate these biases, their effects are often evaluated only along the dimension of the bias being targeted. This work investigates the cross-category consequences of targeted bias mitigation. We study four bias mitigation techniques applied across ten models from seven model families, and we explore racial, religious, profession- and gender-related biases. We measure the impact of debiasing on model coherence and stereotypical preference using the StereoSet benchmark. Our results consistently show that while targeted mitigation can sometimes reduce bias in the intended dimension, it frequently leads to unintended and often negative consequences in others, such as increasing model bias and decreasing general coherence. These findings underscore the critical need for robust, multi-dimensional evaluation tools when examining and developing bias mitigation strategies to avoid inadvertently shifting or worsening bias along untargeted axes.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This study systematically evaluated the mathematical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) using the 2026 Korean College Scholastic Ability Test (CSAT) Mathematics section, ensuring a completely contamination-free evaluation environment. To address data leakage issues in existing benchmarks, we digitized all 46 questions (22 common and 24 elective) within two hours of the exam's public release, eliminating any possibility of inclusion in model training data. We conducted comprehensive evaluations of 24 state-of-the-art LLMs across varying input modalities (text, image, text+figure) and prompt languages (Korean, English). GPT-5 Codex achieved the only perfect score (100 points) with text input and Korean prompts, while Grok 4, GPT-5, and Deepseek R1 scored above 95 points. Notably, gpt-oss-20B achieved 95.7 points despite its relatively small size, demonstrating high cost-effectiveness. Problem-specific analysis revealed geometry as the weakest domain (77.7% average) with significant performance degradation on 4-point high-difficulty problems. Text input consistently outperformed image input, while prompt language effects varied by model scale. In reasoning enhancement experiments with GPT-5 series, increased reasoning intensity improved performance (from 82.6 to 100 points) but quadrupled token usage and drastically reduced efficiency, suggesting that models with minimal reasoning may be more practical. This research contributes: (1) implementation of a completely unexposed evaluation environment, (2) a real-exam-based LLM assessment framework, and (3) a practical evaluation perspective integrating performance, cost, and time considerations.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, privacy, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), particularly the CKKS scheme, is a promising enabler for privacy-preserving MLaaS, but its practical deployment faces a prohibitive barrier: it heavily relies on domain expertise. Configuring CKKS involves a tightly coupled space of ring dimensions, modulus chains, and packing layouts. Without deep cryptographic knowledge to navigate these interactions, practitioners are restricted to compilers that rely on fixed heuristics. These "one-shot" tools often emit rigid configurations that are either severely over-provisioned in latency or fail to find a feasible solution entirely for deeper networks. We present FHE-Agent, an agentic framework that automates this expert reasoning process. By coupling a Large Language Model (LLM) controller with a deterministic tool suite, FHE-Agent decomposes the search into global parameter selection and layer-wise bottleneck repair. The agents operate within a multi-fidelity workflow, pruning invalid regimes using cheap static analysis and reserving expensive encrypted evaluations for the most promising candidates. We instantiate FHE-Agent on the Orion compiler and evaluate it on standard benchmarks (MLP, LeNet, LoLa) and deeper architectures (AlexNet). FHE-Agent consistently achieves better precision and lower latency than naïve search strategies. Crucially, it automatically discovers feasible, 128-bit secure configurations for complex models where baseline heuristics and one-shot prompts fail to produce a valid setup.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The scarcity of annotated Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) tumor data presents a major obstacle to accurate and automated tumor segmentation. While existing data synthesis methods offer promising solutions, they often suffer from key limitations: manual modeling is labor intensive and requires expert knowledge. Deep generative models may be used to augment data and annotation, but they typically demand large amounts of training pairs in the first place, which is impractical in data limited clinical settings. In this work, we propose Tumor Fabrication (TF), a novel two-stage framework for unpaired 3D brain tumor synthesis. The framework comprises a coarse tumor synthesis process followed by a refinement process powered by a generative model. TF is fully automated and leverages only healthy image scans along with a limited amount of real annotated data to synthesize large volumes of paired synthetic data for enriching downstream supervised segmentation training. We demonstrate that our synthetic image-label pairs used as data enrichment can significantly improve performance on downstream tumor segmentation tasks in low-data regimes, offering a scalable and reliable solution for medical image enrichment and addressing critical challenges in data scarcity for clinical AI applications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Physical adversarial attacks on deep learning systems is concerning due to the ease of deploying such attacks, usually by placing an adversarial patch in a scene to manipulate the outcomes of a deep learning model. Training such patches typically requires regularization that improves physical realizability (e.g., printability, smoothness) and/or robustness to real-world variability (e.g. deformations, viewing angle, noise). One type of variability that has received little attention is scale variability. When a patch is rescaled, either digitally through downsampling/upsampling or physically through changing imaging distances, interpolation-induced color mixing occurs. This smooths out pixel values, resulting in a loss of high-frequency patterns and degrading the adversarial signal. To address this, we present a novel superpixel-based regularization method that guides patch optimization to scale-resilient structures. Our ap proach employs the Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) algorithm to dynamically cluster pixels in an adversarial patch during optimization. The Implicit Function Theorem is used to backpropagate gradients through SLIC to update the superpixel boundaries and color. This produces patches that maintain their structure over scale and are less susceptible to interpolation losses. Our method achieves greater performance in the digital domain, and when realized physically, these performance gains are preserved, leading to improved physical performance. Real-world performance was objectively assessed using a novel physical evaluation protocol that utilizes screens and cardboard cut-outs to systematically vary real-world conditions.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge but still suffers from long contexts and disjoint retrieval-generation optimization. In this work, we propose CLaRa (Continuous Latent Reasoning), a unified framework that performs embedding-based compression and joint optimization in a shared continuous space. To obtain semantically rich and retrievable compressed vectors, we introduce SCP, a key-preserving data synthesis framework using QA and paraphrase supervision. CLaRa then trains the reranker and generator end-to-end via a single language modeling loss, with gradients flowing through both modules using a differentiable top-k estimator. Theoretically, this unified optimization aligns retrieval relevance with answer quality. Experiments across multiple QA benchmarks show that CLaRa achieves state-of-the-art compression and reranking performance, often surpassing text-based fine-tuned baselines.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, data-free</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Corrupted training data are ubiquitous. Corrective Machine Unlearning (CMU) seeks to remove the influence of such corruption post-training. Prior CMU typically assumes access to identified corrupted training samples (a ``forget set''). However, in many real-world scenarios the training data are no longer accessible. We formalize \emph{source-free} CMU, where the original training data are unavailable and, consequently, no forget set of identified corrupted training samples can be specified. Instead, we assume a small proxy (surrogate) set of corrupted samples that reflect the suspected corruption type without needing to be the original training samples. In this stricter setting, methods relying on forget set are ineffective or narrow in scope. We introduce \textit{Corrective Unlearning in Task Space} (CUTS), a lightweight weight space correction method guided by the proxy set using task arithmetic principles. CUTS treats the clean and the corruption signal as distinct tasks. Specifically, we briefly fine-tune the corrupted model on the proxy to amplify the corruption mechanism in the weight space, compute the difference between the corrupted and fine-tuned weights as a proxy task vector, and subtract a calibrated multiple of this vector to cancel the corruption. Without access to clean data or a forget set, CUTS recovers a large fraction of the lost utility under label noise and, for backdoor triggers, nearly eliminates the attack with minimal damage to utility, outperforming state-of-the-art specialized CMU methods in source-free setting.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Robust lane detection is essential for advanced driver assistance and autonomous driving, yet models trained on public datasets such as CULane often fail to generalise across different camera viewpoints. This paper addresses the challenge of domain shift for side-mounted cameras used in lane-wheel monitoring by introducing a generative AI-based data enhancement pipeline. The approach combines geometric perspective transformation, AI-driven inpainting, and vehicle body overlays to simulate deployment-specific viewpoints while preserving lane continuity. We evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed augmentation in two state-of-the-art models, SCNN and UFLDv2. With the augmented data trained, both models show improved robustness to different conditions, including shadows. The experimental results demonstrate gains in precision, recall, and F1 score compared to the pre-trained model. By bridging the gap between widely available datasets and deployment-specific scenarios, our method provides a scalable and practical framework to improve the reliability of lane detection in a pilot deployment scenario.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Replacing modules in pretrained models, especially swapping quadratic self-attention for efficient attention alternatives, poses a hard optimization problem: cold-start reinitialization destabilizes frozen backbones. We isolate this core stability challenge in a controlled study. Deterministic Continuous Replacement (DCR) blends teacher and student outputs with a deterministic, annealed weight. Theoretically, DCR eliminates gate-induced gradient variance inherent to stochastic replacement. In a single-seed study, DCR attains faster convergence and stronger alignment than stochastic gating and distillation baselines on controlled attention replacement, establishing a foundation for heterogeneous operator swaps.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Novel View Synthesis (NVS) is the task of generating new images of a scene from viewpoints that were not part of the original input. Diffusion-based NVS can generate high-quality, temporally consistent images, however, remains computationally prohibitive. Conversely, regression-based NVS offers suboptimal generation quality despite requiring significantly lower compute; leaving the design objective of a high-quality, inference-efficient NVS framework an open challenge. To close this critical gap, we present Sphinx, a training-free hybrid inference framework that achieves diffusion-level fidelity at a significantly lower compute. Sphinx proposes to use regression-based fast initialization to guide and reduce the denoising workload for the diffusion model. Additionally, it integrates selective refinement with adaptive noise scheduling, allowing more compute to uncertain regions and frames. This enables Sphinx to provide flexible navigation of the performance-quality trade-off, allowing adaptation to latency and fidelity requirements for dynamically changing inference scenarios. Our evaluation shows that Sphinx achieves an average 1.8x speedup over diffusion model inference with negligible perceptual degradation of less than 5%, establishing a new Pareto frontier between quality and latency in NVS serving.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in diffusion transformers have shown remarkable generalization in visual synthesis, yet most dense perception methods still rely on text-to-image (T2I) generators designed for stochastic generation. We revisit this paradigm and show that image editing diffusion models are inherently image-to-image consistent, providing a more suitable foundation for dense perception task. We introduce Edit2Perceive, a unified diffusion framework that adapts editing models for depth, normal, and matting. Built upon the FLUX.1 Kontext architecture, our approach employs full-parameter fine-tuning and a pixel-space consistency loss to enforce structure-preserving refinement across intermediate denoising states. Moreover, our single-step deterministic inference yields up to faster runtime while training on relatively small datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate comprehensive state-of-the-art results across all three tasks, revealing the strong potential of editing-oriented diffusion transformers for geometry-aware perception.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Current vision-language models (VLMs) in medicine are primarily designed for categorical question answering (e.g., "Is this normal or abnormal?") or qualitative descriptive tasks. However, clinical decision-making often relies on quantitative assessments, such as measuring the size of a tumor or the angle of a joint, from which physicians draw their own diagnostic conclusions. This quantitative reasoning capability remains underexplored and poorly supported in existing VLMs. In this work, we introduce MedVision, a large-scale dataset and benchmark specifically designed to evaluate and improve VLMs on quantitative medical image analysis. MedVision spans 22 public datasets covering diverse anatomies and modalities, with 30.8 million image-annotation pairs. We focus on three representative quantitative tasks: (1) detection of anatomical structures and abnormalities, (2) tumor/lesion (T/L) size estimation, and (3) angle/distance (A/D) measurement. Our benchmarks show that current off-the-shelf VLMs perform poorly on these tasks. However, with supervised fine-tuning on MedVision, we significantly enhance their performance across detection, T/L estimation, and A/D measurement, demonstrating reduced error rates and improved precision. This work provides a foundation for developing VLMs with robust quantitative reasoning capabilities in medical imaging. Code and data are available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Sketch based person re-identification aims to match hand-drawn sketches with RGB surveillance images, but remains challenging due to significant modality gaps and limited annotated data. To address this, we introduce KTCAA, a theoretically grounded framework for few-shot cross-modal generalization. Motivated by generalization theory, we identify two key factors influencing target domain risk: (1) domain discrepancy, which quantifies the alignment difficulty between source and target distributions; and (2) perturbation invariance, which evaluates the model's robustness to modality shifts. Based on these insights, we propose two components: (1) Alignment Augmentation (AA), which applies localized sketch-style transformations to simulate target distributions and facilitate progressive alignment; and (2) Knowledge Transfer Catalyst (KTC), which enhances invariance by introducing worst-case perturbations and enforcing consistency. These modules are jointly optimized under a meta-learning paradigm that transfers alignment knowledge from data-rich RGB domains to sketch-based scenarios. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that KTCAA achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in data-scarce conditions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent years have witnessed rapid advancements in 3D scanning technologies, with applications spanning VR/AR, digital human creation, and medical imaging. Structured-light scanning with phase-shifting techniques is preferred for its use of low-intensity visible light and high accuracy, making it well suited for capturing 4D facial dynamics. A key step is phase unwrapping, which recovers continuous phase values from measurements wrapped modulo 2pi. The goal is to estimate the unwrapped phase count k in the equation Phi = phi + 2pi k, where phi is the wrapped phase and Phi is the true phase. Noise, occlusions, and complex 3D geometry make recovering the true phase challenging because phase unwrapping is ill-posed: measurements only provide modulo 2pi values, and estimating k requires assumptions about surface continuity. Existing methods trade speed for accuracy: fast approaches lack precision, while accurate algorithms are too slow for real-time use. To overcome these limitations, this work proposes a phase unwrapping framework that reformulates GraphCut-based unwrapping as a pixel-labeling problem. This framework improves the estimation of the unwrapped phase count k through the invariance property of diffeomorphisms applied in image space via conformal and optimal transport (OT) maps. An odd number of diffeomorphisms are precomputed from the input phase data, and a hierarchical GraphCut algorithm is applied in each domain. The resulting label maps are fused via majority voting to robustly estimate k at each pixel. Experimental results demonstrate a 45.5x speedup and lower L2 error in real experiments and simulations, showing potential for real-time applications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, robust, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Robust concept removal for text-to-image (T2I) and text-to-video (T2V) models is essential for their safe deployment. Existing methods, however, suffer from costly retraining, inference overhead, or vulnerability to adversarial attacks. Crucially, they rarely model the latent semantic overlap between the target erase concept and surrounding content -- causing collateral damage post-erasure -- and even fewer methods work reliably across both T2I and T2V domains. We introduce Instant Concept Erasure (ICE), a training-free, modality-agnostic, one-shot weight modification approach that achieves precise, persistent unlearning with zero overhead. ICE defines erase and preserve subspaces using anisotropic energy-weighted scaling, then explicitly regularises against their intersection using a unique, closed-form overlap projector. We pose a convex and Lipschitz-bounded Spectral Unlearning Objective, balancing erasure fidelity and intersection preservation, that admits a stable and unique analytical solution. This solution defines a dissociation operator that is translated to the model's text-conditioning layers, making the edit permanent and runtime-free. Across targeted removals of artistic styles, objects, identities, and explicit content, ICE efficiently achieves strong erasure with improved robustness to red-teaming, all while causing only minimal degradation of original generative abilities in both T2I and T2V models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show promising results as decision-making engines for embodied agents operating in complex, physical environments. However, existing benchmarks often prioritize high-level planning or spatial reasoning, leaving the fine-grained action intelligence required for embodied physical interaction underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce CFG-Bench, a new benchmark designed to systematically evaluate this crucial capability. CFG-Bench consists of 1,368 curated videos paired with 19,562 three-modalities question-answer pairs targeting four cognitive abilities: 1) Physical Interaction, 2) Temporal-Causal Relation, 3) Intentional Understanding, and 4) Evaluative Judgment. Together, these dimensions provide a systematic framework for assessing a model's ability to translate visual observations into actionable knowledge, moving beyond mere surface-level recognition. Our comprehensive evaluation on CFG-Bench reveals that leading MLLMs struggle to produce detailed instructions for physical interactions and exhibit profound limitations in the higher-order reasoning of intention and evaluation. Moreover, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on our data demonstrates that teaching an MLLMs to articulate fine-grained actions directly translates to significant performance gains on established embodied benchmarks. Our analysis highlights these limitations and offers insights for developing more capable and grounded embodied agents.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs) represent a new class of neural architectures that replace conventional linear transformations and node-based nonlinearities with spline-based function approximations distributed along network edges. Although KANs offer strong expressivity and interpretability, their heterogeneous spline and base branch parameters hinder efficient quantization, which remains unexamined compared to CNNs and Transformers. In this paper, we present QuantKAN, a unified framework for quantizing KANs across both quantization aware training (QAT) and post-training quantization (PTQ) regimes. QuantKAN extends modern quantization algorithms, such as LSQ, LSQ+, PACT, DoReFa, QIL, GPTQ, BRECQ, AdaRound, AWQ, and HAWQ-V2, to spline based layers with branch-specific quantizers for base, spline, and activation components. Through extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR 10, and CIFAR 100 across multiple KAN variants (EfficientKAN, FastKAN, PyKAN, and KAGN), we establish the first systematic benchmarks for low-bit spline networks. Our results show that KANs, particularly deeper KAGN variants, are compatible with low-bit quantization but exhibit strong method architecture interactions: LSQ, LSQ+, and PACT preserve near full precision accuracy at 4 bit for shallow KAN MLP and ConvNet models, while DoReFa provides the most stable behavior for deeper KAGN under aggressive low-bit settings. For PTQ, GPTQ and Uniform consistently deliver the strongest overall performance across datasets, with BRECQ highly competitive on simpler regimes such as MNIST. Our proposed QuantKAN framework thus unifies spline learning and quantization, and provides practical tools and guidelines for efficiently deploying KANs in real-world, resource-constrained environments.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Hybrid vision architectures combining Transformers and CNNs have significantly advanced image classification, but they usually do so at significant computational cost. We introduce EVCC (Enhanced Vision Transformer-ConvNeXt-CoAtNet), a novel multi-branch architecture integrating the Vision Transformer, lightweight ConvNeXt, and CoAtNet through key innovations: (1) adaptive token pruning with information preservation, (2) gated bidirectional cross-attention for enhanced feature refinement, (3) auxiliary classification heads for multi-task learning, and (4) a dynamic router gate employing context-aware confidence-driven weighting. Experiments across the CIFAR-100, Tobacco3482, CelebA, and Brain Cancer datasets demonstrate EVCC's superiority over powerful models like DeiT-Base, MaxViT-Base, and CrossViT-Base by consistently achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with improvements of up to 2 percentage points, while reducing FLOPs by 25 to 35%. Our adaptive architecture adjusts computational demands to deployment needs by dynamically reducing token count, efficiently balancing the accuracy-efficiency trade-off while combining global context, local details, and hierarchical features for real-world applications.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In real-world scenarios of image recognition, there exists substantial noise interference. Existing works primarily focus on methods such as adjusting networks or training strategies to address noisy image recognition, and the anti-noise performance has reached a bottleneck. However, little is known about the exploration of anti-interference solutions from a neuronal this http URL paper proposes an anti-noise neuronal convolution. This convolution mimics the dendritic structure of neurons, integrates the neighborhood interaction computation logic of dendrites into the underlying design of convolutional operations, and simulates the XOR logic preprocessing function of biological dendrites through nonlinear interactions between input features, thereby fundamentally reconstructing the mathematical paradigm of feature extraction. Unlike traditional convolution where noise directly interferes with feature extraction and exerts a significant impact, DDC mitigates the influence of noise by focusing on the interaction of neighborhood information. Experimental results demonstrate that in image classification tasks (using YOLOv11-cls, VGG16, and EfficientNet-B0) and object detection tasks (using YOLOv11, YOLOv8, and YOLOv5), after replacing traditional convolution with the dendritic convolution, the accuracy of the EfficientNet-B0 model on noisy datasets is relatively improved by 11.23%, and the mean Average Precision (mAP) of YOLOv8 is increased by 19.80%. The consistency between the computation method of this convolution and the dendrites of biological neurons enables it to perform significantly better than traditional convolution in complex noisy environments.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Existing diffusion codecs typically build on text-to-image diffusion foundation models like Stable Diffusion. However, text conditioning is suboptimal from a compression perspective, hindering the potential of downstream diffusion codecs, particularly at ultra-low bitrates. To address it, we introduce \textbf{CoD}, the first \textbf{Co}mpression-oriented \textbf{D}iffusion foundation model, trained from scratch to enable end-to-end optimization of both compression and generation. CoD is not a fixed codec but a general foundation model designed for various diffusion-based codecs. It offers several advantages: \textbf{High compression efficiency}, replacing Stable Diffusion with CoD in downstream codecs like DiffC achieves SOTA results, especially at ultra-low bitrates (e.g., 0.0039 bpp); \textbf{Low-cost and reproducible training}, 300$\times$ faster training than Stable Diffusion ($\sim$ 20 vs. $\sim$ 6,250 A100 GPU days) on entirely open image-only datasets; \textbf{Providing new insights}, e.g., We find pixel-space diffusion can achieve VTM-level PSNR with high perceptual quality and can outperform GAN-based codecs using fewer parameters. We hope CoD lays the foundation for future diffusion codec research. Codes will be released.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In autonomous driving, vision-centric 3D object detection recognizes and localizes 3D objects from RGB images. However, due to high annotation costs and diverse outdoor scenes, training data often fails to cover all possible test scenarios, known as the out-of-distribution (OOD) issue. Training-free image editing offers a promising solution for improving model robustness by training data enhancement without any modifications to pre-trained diffusion models. Nevertheless, inversion-based methods often suffer from limited effectiveness and inherent inaccuracies, while recent rectified-flow-based approaches struggle to preserve objects with accurate 3D geometry. In this paper, we propose DriveFlow, a Rectified Flow Adaptation method for training data enhancement in autonomous driving based on pre-trained Text-to-Image flow models. Based on frequency decomposition, DriveFlow introduces two strategies to adapt noise-free editing paths derived from text-conditioned velocities. 1) High-Frequency Foreground Preservation: DriveFlow incorporates a high-frequency alignment loss for foreground to maintain precise 3D object geometry. 2) Dual-Frequency Background Optimization: DriveFlow also conducts dual-frequency optimization for background, balancing editing flexibility and semantic consistency. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness and efficiency of DriveFlow, demonstrating comprehensive performance improvements on all categories across OOD scenarios.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Graph transformers have demonstrated remarkable capability on complex spatio-temporal tasks, yet their depth is often limited by oversmoothing and weak long-range dependency modeling. To address these challenges, we introduce GRIT-LP, a graph transformer explicitly designed for polar ice-layer thickness estimation from polar radar imagery. Accurately estimating ice layer thickness is critical for understanding snow accumulation, reconstructing past climate patterns and reducing uncertainties in projections of future ice sheet evolution and sea level rise. GRIT-LP combines an inductive geometric graph learning framework with self-attention mechanism, and introduces two major innovations that jointly address challenges in modeling the spatio-temporal patterns of ice layers: a partitioned spatial graph construction strategy that forms overlapping, fully connected local neighborhoods to preserve spatial coherence and suppress noise from irrelevant long-range links, and a long-range skip connection mechanism within the transformer that improves information flow and mitigates oversmoothing in deeper attention layers. We conducted extensive experiments, demonstrating that GRIT-LP outperforms current state-of-the-art methods with a 24.92\% improvement in root mean squared error. These results highlight the effectiveness of graph transformers in modeling spatiotemporal patterns by capturing both localized structural features and long-range dependencies across internal ice layers, and demonstrate their potential to advance data-driven understanding of cryospheric processes.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a powerful tool for post-training visual generative models, with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) increasingly used to align generators with human preferences. However, existing GRPO pipelines rely on a single scalar reward per sample, treating each image or video as a holistic entity and ignoring the rich spatial and temporal structure of visual content. This coarse supervision hinders the correction of localized artifacts and the modeling of fine-grained perceptual cues. We introduce Visual Preference Policy Optimization (ViPO), a GRPO variant that lifts scalar feedback into structured, pixel-level advantages. ViPO employs a Perceptual Structuring Module that uses pretrained vision backbones to construct spatially and temporally aware advantage maps, redistributing optimization pressure toward perceptually important regions while preserving the stability of standard GRPO. Across both image and video benchmarks, ViPO consistently outperforms vanilla GRPO, improving in-domain alignment with human-preference rewards and enhancing generalization on out-of-domain evaluations. The method is architecture-agnostic, lightweight, and fully compatible with existing GRPO training pipelines, providing a more expressive and informative learning signal for visual generation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, defense, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The SmoothLLM defense provides a certification guarantee against jailbreaking attacks, but it relies on a strict `k-unstable' assumption that rarely holds in practice. This strong assumption can limit the trustworthiness of the provided safety certificate. In this work, we address this limitation by introducing a more realistic probabilistic framework, `(k, $\varepsilon$)-unstable,' to certify defenses against diverse jailbreaking attacks, from gradient-based (GCG) to semantic (PAIR). We derive a new, data-informed lower bound on SmoothLLM's defense probability by incorporating empirical models of attack success, providing a more trustworthy and practical safety certificate. By introducing the notion of (k, $\varepsilon$)-unstable, our framework provides practitioners with actionable safety guarantees, enabling them to set certification thresholds that better reflect the real-world behavior of LLMs. Ultimately, this work contributes a practical and theoretically-grounded mechanism to make LLMs more resistant to the exploitation of their safety alignments, a critical challenge in secure AI deployment.</li>

Using few-shot in-context learning on 6,169 records, LogSyn performs Controlled Abstraction Generation (CAG) to summarize problem-resolution narratives and classify events within a detailed hierarchical ontology. The framework identifies key failure patterns, offering a scalable method for semantic structuring and actionable insight extraction from maintenance logs.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Driving planning is a critical component of end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving. However, prevailing Imitative E2E Planners often suffer from multimodal trajectory mode collapse, failing to produce diverse trajectory proposals. Meanwhile, Generative E2E Planners struggle to incorporate crucial safety and physical constraints directly into the generative process, necessitating an additional optimization stage to refine their outputs. In this paper, we propose \textit{\textbf{GuideFlow}}, a novel planning framework that leverages Constrained Flow Matching. Concretely, \textit{\textbf{GuideFlow}} explicitly models the flow matching process, which inherently mitigates mode collapse and allows for flexible guidance from various conditioning signals. Our core contribution lies in directly enforcing explicit constraints within the flow matching generation process, rather than relying on implicit constraint encoding. Crucially, \textit{\textbf{GuideFlow}} unifies the training of the flow matching with the Energy-Based Model (EBM) to enhance the model's autonomous optimization capability to robustly satisfy physical constraints. Secondly, \textit{\textbf{GuideFlow}} parameterizes driving aggressiveness as a control signal during generation, enabling precise manipulation of trajectory style. Extensive evaluations on major driving benchmarks (Bench2Drive, NuScenes, NavSim and ADV-NuScenes) validate the effectiveness of \textit{\textbf{GuideFlow}}. Notably, on the NavSim test hard split (Navhard), \textit{\textbf{GuideFlow}} achieved SOTA with an EPDMS score of 43.0. The code will be released.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Football (soccer) is a sport that is characterised by complex game play, where players perform a variety of actions, such as passes, shots, tackles, fouls, in order to score goals, and ultimately win matches. Accurately forecasting the total number of each action that each player will complete during a match is desirable for a variety of applications, including tactical decision-making, sports betting, and for television broadcast commentary and analysis. Such predictions must consider the game state, the ability and skill of the players in both teams, the interactions between the players, and the temporal dynamics of the game as it develops. In this paper, we present a transformer-based neural network that jointly and recurrently predicts the expected totals for thirteen individual actions at multiple time-steps during the match, and where predictions are made for each individual player, each team and at the game-level. The neural network is based on an \emph{axial transformer} that efficiently captures the temporal dynamics as the game progresses, and the interactions between the players at each time-step. We present a novel axial transformer design that we show is equivalent to a regular sequential transformer, and the design performs well experimentally. We show empirically that the model can make consistent and reliable predictions, and efficiently makes $\sim$75,000 live predictions at low latency for each game.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Global ocean forecasting aims to predict key ocean variables such as temperature, salinity, and currents, which is essential for understanding and describing oceanic phenomena. In recent years, data-driven deep learning-based ocean forecast models, such as XiHe, WenHai, LangYa and AI-GOMS, have demonstrated significant potential in capturing complex ocean dynamics and improving forecasting efficiency. Despite these advancements, the absence of open-source, standardized benchmarks has led to inconsistent data usage and evaluation methods. This gap hinders efficient model development, impedes fair performance comparison, and constrains interdisciplinary collaboration. To address this challenge, we propose OceanForecastBench, a benchmark offering three core contributions: (1) A high-quality global ocean reanalysis data over 28 years for model training, including 4 ocean variables across 23 depth levels and 4 sea surface variables. (2) A high-reliability satellite and in-situ observations for model evaluation, covering approximately 100 million locations in the global ocean. (3) An evaluation pipeline and a comprehensive benchmark with 6 typical baseline models, leveraging observations to evaluate model performance from multiple perspectives. OceanForecastBench represents the most comprehensive benchmarking framework currently available for data-driven ocean forecasting, offering an open-source platform for model development, evaluation, and comparison.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Realistic 3D city generation is fundamental to a wide range of applications, including virtual reality and digital twins. However, most existing methods rely on training a single diffusion model, which limits their ability to generate personalized and boundless city-scale scenes. In this paper, we present Yo'City, a novel agentic framework that enables user-customized and infinitely expandable 3D city generation by leveraging the reasoning and compositional capabilities of off-the-shelf large models. Specifically, Yo'City first conceptualize the city through a top-down planning strategy that defines a hierarchical "City-District-Grid" structure. The Global Planner determines the overall layout and potential functional districts, while the Local Designer further refines each district with detailed grid-level descriptions. Subsequently, the grid-level 3D generation is achieved through a "produce-refine-evaluate" isometric image synthesis loop, followed by image-to-3D generation. To simulate continuous city evolution, Yo'City further introduces a user-interactive, relationship-guided expansion mechanism, which performs scene graph-based distance- and semantics-aware layout optimization, ensuring spatially coherent city growth. To comprehensively evaluate our method, we construct a diverse benchmark dataset and design six multi-dimensional metrics that assess generation quality from the perspectives of semantics, geometry, texture, and layout. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Yo'City consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across all evaluation aspects.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models have emerged as a dominant paradigm for generative modeling across a wide range of domains, including prompt-conditional generation. The vast majority of samplers, however, rely on forward discretization of the reverse diffusion process and use score functions that are learned from data. Such forward and explicit discretizations can be slow and unstable, requiring a large number of sampling steps to produce good-quality samples. In this work we develop a text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model based on backward discretizations, dubbed ProxT2I, relying on learned and conditional proximal operators instead of score functions. We further leverage recent advances in reinforcement learning and policy optimization to optimize our samplers for task-specific rewards. Additionally, we develop a new large-scale and open-source dataset comprising 15 million high-quality human images with fine-grained captions, called LAION-Face-T2I-15M, for training and evaluation. Our approach consistently enhances sampling efficiency and human-preference alignment compared to score-based baselines, and achieves results on par with existing state-of-the-art and open-source text-to-image models while requiring lower compute and smaller model size, offering a lightweight yet performant solution for human text-to-image generation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models are evolving from single-turn responders into tool-using agents capable of sustained reasoning and decision-making for deep research. Prevailing systems adopt a linear pipeline of plan to search to write to a report, which suffers from error accumulation and context rot due to the lack of explicit control over both model behavior and context. We introduce RhinoInsight, a deep research framework that adds two control mechanisms to enhance robustness, traceability, and overall quality without parameter updates. First, a Verifiable Checklist module transforms user requirements into traceable and verifiable sub-goals, incorporates human or LLM critics for refinement, and compiles a hierarchical outline to anchor subsequent actions and prevent non-executable planning. Second, an Evidence Audit module structures search content, iteratively updates the outline, and prunes noisy context, while a critic ranks and binds high-quality evidence to drafted content to ensure verifiability and reduce hallucinations. Our experiments demonstrate that RhinoInsight achieves state-of-the-art performance on deep research tasks while remaining competitive on deep search tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While video-generation-based embodied world models have gained increasing attention, their reliance on large-scale embodied interaction data remains a key bottleneck. The scarcity, difficulty of collection, and high dimensionality of embodied data fundamentally limit the alignment granularity between language and actions and exacerbate the challenge of long-horizon video generation--hindering generative models from achieving a \textit{"GPT moment"} in the embodied domain. There is a naive observation: \textit{the diversity of embodied data far exceeds the relatively small space of possible primitive motions}. Based on this insight, we propose \textbf{Primitive Embodied World Models} (PEWM), which restricts video generation to fixed shorter horizons, our approach \textit{1) enables} fine-grained alignment between linguistic concepts and visual representations of robotic actions, \textit{2) reduces} learning complexity, \textit{3) improves} data efficiency in embodied data collection, and \textit{4) decreases} inference latency. By equipping with a modular Vision-Language Model (VLM) planner and a Start-Goal heatmap Guidance mechanism (SGG), PEWM further enables flexible closed-loop control and supports compositional generalization of primitive-level policies over extended, complex tasks. Our framework leverages the spatiotemporal vision priors in video models and the semantic awareness of VLMs to bridge the gap between fine-grained physical interaction and high-level reasoning, paving the way toward scalable, interpretable, and general-purpose embodied intelligence.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, defense, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The digitalization of substations enlarges the cyber-attack surface, necessitating effective detection and mitigation of cyber attacks in digital substations. While machine learning-based intrusion detection has been widely explored, such methods have not demonstrated detection and mitigation within the required real-time budget. In contrast, cryptographic authentication has emerged as a practical candidate for real-time cyber defense, as specified in IEC 62351. In addition, lightweight rule-based intrusion detection that validates IEC 61850 semantics can provide specification-based detection of anomalous or malicious traffic with minimal processing delay. This paper presents the design logic and implementation aspects of three potential real-time mitigation techniques capable of countering GOOSE-based attacks: (i) IEC 62351-compliant message authentication code (MAC) scheme, (ii) a semantics-enforced rule-based intrusion detection system (IDS), and (iii) a hybrid approach integrating both MAC verification and Intrusion Detection System (IDS). A comparative evaluation of these real-time mitigation approaches is conducted using a cyber-physical system (CPS) security testbed. The results show that the hybrid integration significantly enhances mitigation capability. Furthermore, the processing delays of all three methods remain within the strict delivery requirements of GOOSE communication. The study also identifies limitations that none of the techniques can fully address, highlighting areas for future work.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) have raised hopes for automated end-to-end fact-checking, but prior studies report mixed results. As mainstream chatbots increasingly ship with reasoning capabilities and web search tools -- and millions of users already rely on them for verification -- rigorous evaluation is urgent. We evaluate 15 recent LLMs from OpenAI, Google, Meta, and DeepSeek on more than 6,000 claims fact-checked by PolitiFact, comparing standard models with reasoning- and web-search variants. Standard models perform poorly, reasoning offers minimal benefits, and web search provides only moderate gains, despite fact-checks being available on the web. In contrast, a curated RAG system using PolitiFact summaries improved macro F1 by 233% on average across model variants. These findings suggest that giving models access to curated high-quality context is a promising path for automated fact-checking.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As posts on social media increase rapidly, analyzing the sentiments embedded in image-text pairs has become a popular research topic in recent years. Although existing works achieve impressive accomplishments in simultaneously harnessing image and text information, they lack the considerations of possible low-quality and missing modalities. In real-world applications, these issues might frequently occur, leading to urgent needs for models capable of predicting sentiment robustly. Therefore, we propose a Distribution-based feature Recovery and Fusion (DRF) method for robust multimodal sentiment analysis of image-text pairs. Specifically, we maintain a feature queue for each modality to approximate their feature distributions, through which we can simultaneously handle low-quality and missing modalities in a unified framework. For low-quality modalities, we reduce their contributions to the fusion by quantitatively estimating modality qualities based on the distributions. For missing modalities, we build inter-modal mapping relationships supervised by samples and distributions, thereby recovering the missing modalities from available ones. In experiments, two disruption strategies that corrupt and discard some modalities in samples are adopted to mimic the low-quality and missing modalities in various real-world scenarios. Through comprehensive experiments on three publicly available image-text datasets, we demonstrate the universal improvements of DRF compared to SOTA methods under both two strategies, validating its effectiveness in robust multimodal sentiment analysis.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present RefPtsFusion, a lightweight and interpretable framework for cooperative autonomous driving. Instead of sharing large feature maps or query embeddings, vehicles exchange compact reference points, e.g., objects' positions, velocities, and size information. This approach shifts the focus from "what is seen" to "where to see", creating a sensor- and model-independent interface that works well across vehicles with heterogeneous perception models while greatly reducing communication bandwidth. To enhance the richness of shared information, we further develop a selective Top-K query fusion that selectively adds high-confidence queries from the sender. It thus achieves a strong balance between accuracy and communication cost. Experiments on the M3CAD dataset show that RefPtsFusion maintains stable perception performance while reducing communication overhead by five orders of magnitude, dropping from hundreds of MB/s to only a few KB/s at 5 FPS (frame per second), compared to traditional feature-level fusion methods. Extensive experiments also demonstrate RefPtsFusion's strong robustness and consistent transmission behavior, highlighting its potential for scalable, real-time cooperative driving systems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Color fundus photography (CFP) is central to diagnosing and monitoring retinal disease, yet its acquisition variability (e.g., illumination changes) often degrades image quality, which motivates robust enhancement methods. Unpaired enhancement pipelines are typically GAN-based, however, they can distort clinically critical vasculature, altering vessel topology and endpoint integrity. Motivated by these structural alterations, we propose Vessel-Aware Optimal Transport (\textbf{VAOT}), a framework that combines an optimal-transport objective with two structure-preserving regularizers: (i) a skeleton-based loss to maintain global vascular connectivity and (ii) an endpoint-aware loss to stabilize local termini. These constraints guide learning in the unpaired setting, reducing noise while preserving vessel structure. Experimental results on synthetic degradation benchmark and downstream evaluations in vessel and lesion segmentation demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods against several state-of-the art baselines.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Existing industrial 3D garment meshes already cover most real-world clothing geometries, yet their texture diversity remains limited. To acquire more realistic textures, generative methods are often used to extract Physically-based Rendering (PBR) textures and materials from large collections of wild images and project them back onto garment meshes. However, most image-conditioned texture generation approaches require strict topological consistency between the input image and the input 3D mesh, or rely on accurate mesh deformation to match to the image poses, which significantly constrains the texture generation quality and flexibility. To address the challenging problem of non-isometric image-based garment texture generation, we construct 3D Garment Videos, a physically simulated, garment-centric dataset that provides consistent geometry and material supervision across diverse deformations, enabling robust cross-pose texture learning. We further employ Nano Banana for high-quality non-isometric image editing, achieving reliable cross-topology texture generation between non-isometric image-geometry pairs. Finally, we propose an iterative baking method via uncertainty-guided view selection and reweighting that fuses multi-view predictions into seamless, production-ready PBR textures. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our feedforward dual-branch architecture generates versatile and spatially aligned PBR materials suitable for industry-level 3D garment design.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Unsupervised visual anomaly detection from multi-view images presents a significant challenge: distinguishing genuine defects from benign appearance variations caused by viewpoint changes. Existing methods, often designed for single-view inputs, treat multiple views as a disconnected set of images, leading to inconsistent feature representations and a high false-positive rate. To address this, we introduce ViewSense-AD (VSAD), a novel framework that learns viewpoint-invariant representations by explicitly modeling geometric consistency across views. At its core is our Multi-View Alignment Module (MVAM), which leverages homography to project and align corresponding feature regions between neighboring views. We integrate MVAM into a View-Align Latent Diffusion Model (VALDM), enabling progressive and multi-stage alignment during the denoising process. This allows the model to build a coherent and holistic understanding of the object's surface from coarse to fine scales. Furthermore, a lightweight Fusion Refiner Module (FRM) enhances the global consistency of the aligned features, suppressing noise and improving discriminative power. Anomaly detection is performed by comparing multi-level features from the diffusion model against a learned memory bank of normal prototypes. Extensive experiments on the challenging RealIAD and MANTA datasets demonstrate that VSAD sets a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming existing methods in pixel, view, and sample-level visual anomaly proving its robustness to large viewpoint shifts and complex textures.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>protect, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep neural networks (DNNs) have become valuable intellectual property of model owners, due to the substantial resources required for their development. To protect these assets in the deployed environment, recent research has proposed model usage control mechanisms to ensure models cannot be used without proper authorization. These methods typically lock the utility of the model by embedding an access key into its parameters. However, they often assume static deployment, and largely fail to withstand continual post-deployment model updates, such as fine-tuning or task-specific adaptation. In this paper, we propose ADALOC, to endow key-based model usage control with adaptability during model evolution. It strategically selects a subset of weights as an intrinsic access key, which enables all model updates to be confined to this key throughout the evolution lifecycle. ADALOC enables using the access key to restore the keyed model to the latest authorized states without redistributing the entire network (i.e., adaptation), and frees the model owner from full re-keying after each model update (i.e., lock preservation). We establish a formal foundation to underpin ADALOC, providing crucial bounds such as the errors introduced by updates restricted to the access key. Experiments on standard benchmarks, such as CIFAR-100, Caltech-256, and Flowers-102, and modern architectures, including ResNet, DenseNet, and ConvNeXt, demonstrate that ADALOC achieves high accuracy under significant updates while retaining robust protections. Specifically, authorized usages consistently achieve strong task-specific performance, while unauthorized usage accuracy drops to near-random guessing levels (e.g., 1.01% on CIFAR-100), compared to up to 87.01% without ADALOC. This shows that ADALOC can offer a practical solution for adaptive and protected DNN deployment in evolving real-world scenarios.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Virtual Try-On (VTON) is the task of synthesizing an image of a person wearing a target garment, conditioned on a person image and a garment image. While diffusion-based VTON models featuring a Dual UNet architecture demonstrate superior fidelity compared to single UNet models, they incur substantial computational and memory overhead due to their heavy structure. In this study, through visualization analysis and theoretical analysis, we derived three hypotheses regarding the learning of context features to condition the denoising process. Based on these hypotheses, we developed Re-CatVTON, an efficient single UNet model that achieves high performance. We further enhance the model by introducing a modified classifier-free guidance strategy tailored for VTON's spatial concatenation conditioning, and by directly injecting the ground-truth garment latent derived from the clean garment latent to prevent the accumulation of prediction error. The proposed Re-CatVTON significantly improves performance compared to its predecessor (CatVTON) and requires less computation and memory than the high-performance Dual UNet model, Leffa. Our results demonstrate improved FID, KID, and LPIPS scores, with only a marginal decrease in SSIM, establishing a new efficiency-performance trade-off for single UNet VTON models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Neural operators have shown great potential in solving a family of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) by modeling the mappings between input and output functions. Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) implements global convolutions via parameterizing the integral operators in Fourier space. However, it often results in over-smoothing solutions and fails to capture local details and high-frequency components. To address these limitations, we investigate incorporating the spatial-frequency localization property of Wavelet transforms into the Transformer architecture. We propose a novel Wavelet Attention (WA) module with linear computational complexity to efficiently learn locality-aware features. Building upon WA, we further develop the Spectral Attention Operator Transformer (SAOT), a hybrid spectral Transformer framework that integrates WA's localized focus with the global receptive field of Fourier-based Attention (FA) through a gated fusion block. Experimental results demonstrate that WA significantly mitigates the limitations of FA and outperforms existing Wavelet-based neural operators by a large margin. By integrating the locality-aware and global spectral representations, SAOT achieves state-of-the-art performance on six operator learning benchmarks and exhibits strong discretization-invariant ability.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent progress in video generative models has enabled the creation of high-quality videos from multimodal prompts that combine text and images. While these systems offer enhanced controllability, they also introduce new safety risks, as harmful content can emerge from individual modalities or their interaction. Existing safety methods are often text-only, require prior knowledge of the risk category, or operate as post-generation auditors, struggling to proactively mitigate such compositional, multimodal risks. To address this challenge, we present ConceptGuard, a unified safeguard framework for proactively detecting and mitigating unsafe semantics in multimodal video generation. ConceptGuard operates in two stages: First, a contrastive detection module identifies latent safety risks by projecting fused image-text inputs into a structured concept space; Second, a semantic suppression mechanism steers the generative process away from unsafe concepts by intervening in the prompt's multimodal conditioning. To support the development and rigorous evaluation of this framework, we introduce two novel benchmarks: ConceptRisk, a large-scale dataset for training on multimodal risks, and T2VSafetyBench-TI2V, the first benchmark adapted from T2VSafetyBench for the Text-and-Image-to-Video (TI2V) safety setting. Comprehensive experiments on both benchmarks show that ConceptGuard consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art results in both risk detection and safe video generation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Streamline classification is essential to identify anatomically meaningful white matter tracts from diffusion MRI (dMRI) tractography. However, current streamline classification methods rely primarily on the geometric features of the streamline trajectory, failing to distinguish between functionally distinct fiber tracts with similar pathways. To address this, we introduce a novel dual-stream streamline classification framework that jointly analyzes dMRI and functional MRI (fMRI) data to enhance the functional coherence of tract parcellation. We design a novel network that performs streamline classification using a pretrained backbone model for full streamline trajectories, while augmenting with an auxiliary network that processes fMRI signals from fiber endpoint regions. We demonstrate our method by parcellating the corticospinal tract (CST) into its four somatotopic subdivisions.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Hypergraphs, as a generalization of traditional graphs, naturally capture high-order relationships. In recent years, hypergraph neural networks (HNNs) have been widely used to capture complex high-order relationships. However, most existing hypergraph neural network methods inherently rely on the homophily assumption, which often does not hold in real-world scenarios that exhibit significant heterophilic structures. To address this limitation, we propose \textbf{HONOR}, a novel unsupervised \textbf{H}ypergraph c\textbf{ON}trastive learning framework suitable for both hom\textbf{O}philic and hete\textbf{R}ophilic hypergraphs. Specifically, HONOR explicitly models the heterophilic relationships between hyperedges and nodes through two complementary mechanisms: a prompt-based hyperedge feature construction strategy that maintains global semantic consistency while suppressing local noise, and an adaptive attention aggregation module that dynamically captures the diverse local contributions of nodes to hyperedges. Combined with high-pass filtering, these designs enable HONOR to fully exploit heterophilic connection patterns, yielding more discriminative and robust node and hyperedge representations. Theoretically, we demonstrate the superior generalization ability and robustness of HONOR. Empirically, extensive experiments further validate that HONOR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under both homophilic and heterophilic datasets.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present STCDiT, a video super-resolution framework built upon a pre-trained video diffusion model, aiming to restore structurally faithful and temporally stable videos from degraded inputs, even under complex camera motions. The main challenges lie in maintaining temporal stability during reconstruction and preserving structural fidelity during generation. To address these challenges, we first develop a motion-aware VAE reconstruction method that performs segment-wise reconstruction, with each segment clip exhibiting uniform motion characteristic, thereby effectively handling videos with complex camera motions. Moreover, we observe that the first-frame latent extracted by the VAE encoder in each clip, termed the anchor-frame latent, remains unaffected by temporal compression and retains richer spatial structural information than subsequent frame latents. We further develop an anchor-frame guidance approach that leverages structural information from anchor frames to constrain the generation process and improve structural fidelity of video features. Coupling these two designs enables the video diffusion model to achieve high-quality video super-resolution. Extensive experiments show that STCDiT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of structural fidelity and temporal consistency.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Compared to monocular 3D object detection, stereo-based 3D methods offer significantly higher accuracy but still suffer from high computational overhead and latency. The state-of-the-art stereo 3D detection method achieves twice the accuracy of monocular approaches, yet its inference speed is only half as fast. In this paper, we propose StereoDETR, an efficient stereo 3D object detection framework based on DETR. StereoDETR consists of two branches: a monocular DETR branch and a stereo branch. The DETR branch is built upon 2D DETR with additional channels for predicting object scale, orientation, and sampling points. The stereo branch leverages low-cost multi-scale disparity features to predict object-level depth maps. These two branches are coupled solely through a differentiable depth sampling strategy. To handle occlusion, we introduce a constrained supervision strategy for sampling points without requiring extra annotations. StereoDETR achieves real-time inference and is the first stereo-based method to surpass monocular approaches in speed. It also achieves competitive accuracy on the public KITTI benchmark, setting new state-of-the-art results on pedestrian and cyclist subsets. The code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We study the problem of excess risk evaluation for empirical risk minimization (ERM) under general convex loss functions. Our contribution is an efficient refitting procedure that computes the excess risk and provides high-probability upper bounds under the fixed-design setting. Assuming only black-box access to the training algorithm and a single dataset, we begin by generating two sets of artificially modified pseudo-outcomes termed wild response, created by stochastically perturbing the gradient vectors with carefully chosen scaling. Using these two pseudo-labeled datasets, we then refit the black-box procedure twice to obtain two corresponding wild predictors. Finally, leveraging the original predictor, the two wild predictors, and the constructed wild responses, we derive an efficient excess risk upper bound. A key feature of our analysis is that it requires no prior knowledge of the complexity of the underlying function class. As a result, the method is essentially model-free and holds significant promise for theoretically evaluating modern opaque machine learning system--such as deep nerral networks and generative model--where traditional capacity-based learning theory becomes infeasible due to the extreme complexity of the hypothesis class.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, attack, robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Content moderation pipelines for modern large language models combine static filters, dedicated moderation services, and alignment tuned base models, yet real world deployments still exhibit dangerous failure modes. This paper presents RoguePrompt, an automated jailbreak attack that converts a disallowed user query into a self reconstructing prompt which passes provider moderation while preserving the original harmful intent. RoguePrompt partitions the instruction across two lexical streams, applies nested classical ciphers, and wraps the result in natural language directives that cause the target model to decode and execute the hidden payload. Our attack assumes only black box access to the model and to the associated moderation endpoint. We instantiate RoguePrompt against GPT 4o and evaluate it on 2 448 prompts that a production moderation system previously marked as strongly rejected. Under an evaluation protocol that separates three security relevant outcomes bypass, reconstruction, and execution the attack attains 84.7 percent bypass, 80.2 percent reconstruction, and 71.5 percent full execution, substantially outperforming five automated jailbreak baselines. We further analyze the behavior of several automated and human aligned evaluators and show that dual layer lexical transformations remain effective even when detectors rely on semantic similarity or learned safety rubrics. Our results highlight systematic blind spots in current moderation practice and suggest that robust deployment will require joint reasoning about user intent, decoding workflows, and model side computation rather than surface level toxicity alone.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While Wi-Fi sensing offers a compelling, privacy-preserving alternative to cameras, its practical utility has been fundamentally undermined by a lack of robustness across domains. Models trained in one setup fail to generalize to new environments, hardware, or users, a critical "domain shift" problem exacerbated by modest, fragmented public datasets. We shift from this limited paradigm and apply a foundation model approach, leveraging Masked Autoencoding (MAE) style pretraining on the largest and most heterogeneous Wi-Fi CSI datasets collection assembled to date. Our study pretrains and evaluates models on over 1.3 million samples extracted from 14 datasets, collected using 4 distinct devices across the 2.4/5/6 GHz bands and bandwidths from 20 to 160 MHz. Our large-scale evaluation is the first to systematically disentangle the impacts of data diversity versus model capacity on cross-domain performance. The results establish scaling trends on Wi-Fi CSI sensing. First, our experiments show log-linear improvements in unseen domain performance as the amount of pretraining data increases, suggesting that data scale and diversity are key to domain generalization. Second, based on the current data volume, larger model can only provide marginal gains for cross-domain performance, indicating that data, rather than model capacity, is the current bottleneck for Wi-Fi sensing generalization. Finally, we conduct a series of cross-domain evaluations on human activity recognition, human gesture recognition and user identification tasks. The results show that the large-scale pretraining improves cross-domain accuracy ranging from 2.2% to 15.7%, compared to the supervised learning baseline. Overall, our findings provide insightful direction for designing future Wi-Fi sensing systems that can eventually be robust enough for real-world deployment.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Existing autoregressive (AR) methods for generating artist-designed meshes struggle to balance global structural consistency with high-fidelity local details, and are susceptible to error accumulation. To address this, we propose PartDiffuser, a novel semi-autoregressive diffusion framework for point-cloud-to-mesh generation. The method first performs semantic segmentation on the mesh and then operates in a "part-wise" manner: it employs autoregression between parts to ensure global topology, while utilizing a parallel discrete diffusion process within each semantic part to precisely reconstruct high-frequency geometric features. PartDiffuser is based on the DiT architecture and introduces a part-aware cross-attention mechanism, using point clouds as hierarchical geometric conditioning to dynamically control the generation process, thereby effectively decoupling the global and local generation tasks. Experiments demonstrate that this method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in generating 3D meshes with rich detail, exhibiting exceptional detail representation suitable for real-world applications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables large language models (LLMs) to access external knowledge, helping mitigate hallucinations and enhance domain-specific expertise. Graph-based RAG enhances structural reasoning by introducing explicit relational organization that enables information propagation across semantically connected text units. However, these methods typically rely on Euclidean embeddings that capture semantic similarity but lack a geometric notion of hierarchical depth, limiting their ability to represent abstraction relationships inherent in complex knowledge graphs. To capture both fine-grained semantics and global hierarchy, we propose HyperbolicRAG, a retrieval framework that integrates hyperbolic geometry into graph-based RAG. HyperbolicRAG introduces three key designs: (1) a depth-aware representation learner that embeds nodes within a shared Poincare manifold to align semantic similarity with hierarchical containment, (2) an unsupervised contrastive regularization that enforces geometric consistency across abstraction levels, and (3) a mutual-ranking fusion mechanism that jointly exploits retrieval signals from Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces, emphasizing cross-space agreement during inference. Extensive experiments across multiple QA benchmarks demonstrate that HyperbolicRAG outperforms competitive baselines, including both standard RAG and graph-augmented baselines.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection is a fundamental task in computer vision, empowering machines to comprehend human-object relationships in diverse real-world scenarios. Recent advances in VLMs have significantly improved HOI detection by leveraging rich cross-modal representations. However, most existing VLM-based approaches rely heavily on additional training or prompt tuning, resulting in substantial computational overhead and limited scalability, particularly in long-tailed scenarios where rare interactions are severely underrepresented. In this paper, we propose the Adaptive Diversity Cache (ADC) module, a novel training-free and plug-and-play mechanism designed to mitigate long-tail bias in HOI detection. ADC constructs class-specific caches that accumulate high-confidence and diverse feature representations during inference. The method incorporates frequency-aware cache adaptation that favors rare categories and is designed to enable robust prediction calibration without requiring additional training or fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets show that ADC consistently improves existing HOI detectors, achieving up to +8.57\% mAP gain on rare categories and +4.39\% on the full dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating long-tail bias while preserving overall performance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection in semantic segmentation aims to localize anomalous regions at the pixel level, advancing beyond traditional image-level OOD techniques to better suit real-world applications such as autonomous driving. Recent literature has successfully explored the adaptation of commonly used image-level OOD methods--primarily based on classifier-derived confidence scores (e.g., energy or entropy)--for this pixel-precise task. However, these methods inherit a set of limitations, including vulnerability to overconfidence. In this work, we introduce SupLID, a novel framework that effectively guides classifier-derived OOD scores by exploiting the geometrical structure of the underlying semantic space, particularly using Linear Intrinsic Dimensionality (LID). While LID effectively characterizes the local structure of high-dimensional data by analyzing distance distributions, its direct application at the pixel level remains challenging. To overcome this, SupLID constructs a geometrical coreset that captures the intrinsic structure of the in-distribution (ID) subspace. It then computes OOD scores at the superpixel level, enabling both efficient real-time inference and improved spatial smoothness. We demonstrate that geometrical cues derived from SupLID serve as a complementary signal to traditional classifier confidence, enhancing the model's ability to detect diverse OOD scenarios. Designed as a post-hoc scoring method, SupLID can be seamlessly integrated with any semantic segmentation classifier at deployment time. Our results demonstrate that SupLID significantly enhances existing classifier-based OOD scores, achieving state-of-the-art performance across key evaluation metrics, including AUR, FPR, and AUP.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>3D Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) still lag behind their 2D peers, largely because large-scale, high-quality 3D scene-dialogue datasets remain scarce. Prior efforts hinge on expensive human annotation and leave two key ambiguities unresolved: viewpoint ambiguity, where spatial language presumes unknown camera poses, and object referring ambiguity, where non-exclusive descriptions blur the line between targets and distractors. We therefore present a fully automated pipeline that converts raw 3D scans into unambiguous, high-quality dialogue data at a fraction of the previous cost. By synergizing rule-based constraints with 2D MLLMs and LLMs, the pipeline enables controllable, scalable generation without human intervention. The pipeline comprises four stages: (1) meta-annotation collection harvesting object-, frame-, and scene-level captions, (2) scene graph construction with relation correction to capture proximal object relations, (3) discriminative object referring that generates exclusive and compact descriptions, and (4) multi-task data generation synthesizing diverse dialogues. Our pipeline systematically mitigates inherent flaws in source datasets and produces the final Disc3D dataset, over 2 million samples in 25K hybrid 3D scenes, spanning scene, view, and object captioning, visual grounding, and five object-centric QA tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that training with Disc3D yields consistent, significant improvements on both public benchmarks and our multifaceted Disc3D-QA tasks.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models face a fundamental trade-off between generation quality and computational efficiency. Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) offer an efficient solution but suffer from potential information loss and non-end-to-end training. In contrast, existing pixel space models bypass VAEs but are computationally prohibitive for high-resolution synthesis. To resolve this dilemma, we propose DiP, an efficient pixel space diffusion framework. DiP decouples generation into a global and a local stage: a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) backbone operates on large patches for efficient global structure construction, while a co-trained lightweight Patch Detailer Head leverages contextual features to restore fine-grained local details. This synergistic design achieves computational efficiency comparable to LDMs without relying on a VAE. DiP is accomplished with up to 10$\times$ faster inference speeds than previous method while increasing the total number of parameters by only 0.3%, and achieves an 1.90 FID score on ImageNet 256$\times$256.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose VideoPerceiver, a novel video multimodal large language model (VMLLM) that enhances fine-grained perception in video understanding, addressing VMLLMs' limited ability to reason about brief actions in short clips or rare transient events in long videos. VideoPerceiver adopts a two-stage training framework. During supervised fine-tuning (SFT), we construct "key-information-missing" videos by extracting event-action keywords from captions, identifying corresponding key frames, and replacing them with adjacent frames. We jointly encode original and modified video tokens with text tokens, aligning intermediate visual representations with keywords via an auxiliary contrastive loss to enhance sensitivity to fine-grained motion cues. In reinforcement learning (RL), both video variants are fed into the model to generate descriptions, and a novel relative reward ensures responses from complete videos outperform those from degraded inputs, explicitly training the model to recover temporally precise action details. We also curate a dataset of 80,000 videos with fine-grained actions and transient events. Experiments show VideoPerceiver substantially outperforms state-of-the-art VMLLMs on fine-grained action understanding and rare event captioning benchmarks, while maintaining strong performance on standard tasks. By prioritizing task-relevant visual features, our work redefines video-language model training for fine-grained perception.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present Q-Save, a new benchmark dataset and model for holistic and explainable evaluation of AI-generated video (AIGV) quality. The dataset contains near 10000 videos, each annotated with a scalar mean opinion score (MOS) and fine-grained attribution labels along three core dimensions: visual quality, dynamic quality, and text-video alignment. These multi-aspect annotations enable both accurate quality assessment and interpretable reasoning behind the scores. To leverage this data, we propose a unified evaluation model that jointly performs quality scoring and attribution-based explanation. The model adopts the SlowFast framework to distinguish between fast frames and slow frames - slow frames are processed with high resolution while fast frames use low resolution, balancing evaluation accuracy and computational efficiency. For training, we use data formatted in Chain-of-Thought (COT) style and employ a multi-stage strategy: we first conduct Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), then further enhance the model with Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), and finally perform SFT again to improve model stability. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in video quality prediction while also providing human-aligned, interpretable justifications. Our dataset and model establish a strong foundation for explainable evaluation in generative video research, contributing to the development of multimodal generation and trustworthy AI. Code and dataset will be released upon publication.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Existing deep learning models for Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) struggle with temporal irregularities, particularly stochastic event durations and overlapping timestamps, limiting their adaptability across heterogeneous datasets. We propose a dual input neural network strategy that separates event and sequence attributes, using a duration-aware pseudo-embedding matrix to transform temporal importance into compact, learnable representations. This design is implemented across two baseline families: B-LSTM and B-GCN, and their duration-aware variants D-LSTM and D-GCN. All models incorporate self-tuned hypermodels for adaptive architecture selection. Experiments on balanced and imbalanced outcome prediction tasks show that duration pseudo-embedding inputs consistently improve generalization, reduce model complexity, and enhance interpretability. Our results demonstrate the benefits of explicit temporal encoding and provide a flexible design for robust, real-world PPM applications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) face information overload when handling long contexts, particularly in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) where extensive supporting documents often introduce redundant content. This issue not only weakens reasoning accuracy but also increases computational overhead. We propose an unsupervised context compression framework that exploits Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs to preserve semantically essential information while filtering out irrelevant text. By quantifying node-level entropy within AMR graphs, our method estimates the conceptual importance of each node, enabling the retention of core semantics. Specifically, we construct AMR graphs from raw contexts, compute the conceptual entropy of each node, and screen significant informative nodes to form a condensed and semantically focused context than raw documents. Experiments on the PopQA and EntityQuestions datasets show that our method outperforms vanilla and other baselines, achieving higher accuracy while substantially reducing context length. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work introducing AMR-based conceptual entropy for context compression, demonstrating the potential of stable linguistic features in context engineering.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper introduces HGNN(O), an AutoML GNN hypermodel framework for outcome prediction on event-sequence data. Building on our earlier work on graph convolutional network hypermodels, HGNN(O) extends four architectures-One Level, Two Level, Two Level Pseudo Embedding, and Two Level Embedding-across six canonical GNN operators. A self-tuning mechanism based on Bayesian optimization with pruning and early stopping enables efficient adaptation over architectures and hyperparameters without manual configuration. Empirical evaluation on both balanced and imbalanced event logs shows that HGNN(O) achieves accuracy exceeding 0.98 on the Traffic Fines dataset and weighted F1 scores up to 0.86 on the Patients dataset without explicit imbalance handling. These results demonstrate that the proposed AutoML-GNN approach provides a robust and generalizable benchmark for outcome prediction in complex event-sequence data.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The utility of deep learning models, such as CheXNet, in high stakes clinical settings is fundamentally constrained by their purely deterministic nature, failing to provide reliable measures of predictive confidence. This project addresses this critical gap by integrating robust Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) into a high performance diagnostic platform for 14 common thoracic diseases on the NIH ChestX-ray14 dataset. Initial architectural development failed to stabilize performance and calibration using Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD), yielding an unacceptable Expected Calibration Error (ECE) of 0.7588. This technical failure necessitated a rigorous architectural pivot to a high diversity, 9-member Deep Ensemble (DE). This resulting DE successfully stabilized performance and delivered superior reliability, achieving a State-of-the-Art (SOTA) average Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) of 0.8559 and an average F1 Score of 0.3857. Crucially, the DE demonstrated superior calibration (Mean ECE of 0.0728 and Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) of 0.1916) and enabled the reliable decomposition of total uncertainty into its Aleatoric (irreducible data noise) and Epistemic (reducible model knowledge) components, with a mean Epistemic Uncertainty (EU) of 0.0240. These results establish the Deep Ensemble as a trustworthy and explainable platform, transforming the model from a probabilistic tool into a reliable clinical decision support system.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) faces persistent challenges, including domain heterogeneity from diverse client data, data imbalance due to skewed participation, and strict communication constraints. Traditional federated learning often lacks personalization, as a single global model cannot capture client-specific characteristics, leading to biased predictions and poor generalization, especially for clients with highly divergent data distributions. To address these issues, we propose FedSTAR, a style-aware federated learning framework that disentangles client-specific style factors from shared content representations. FedSTAR aggregates class-wise prototypes using a Transformer-based attention mechanism, allowing the server to adaptively weight client contributions while preserving personalization. Furthermore, by exchanging compact prototypes and style vectors instead of full model parameters, FedSTAR significantly reduces communication overhead. Experimental results demonstrate that combining content-style disentanglement with attention-driven prototype aggregation improves personalization and robustness in heterogeneous environments without increasing communication cost.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Focus group discussions generate rich qualitative data but their analysis traditionally relies on labor-intensive manual coding that limits scalability and reproducibility. We present a rigorous, reproducible computational framework for applying neural topic modeling to focus group transcripts, addressing fundamental methodological challenges: hyperparameter sensitivity, model stability, and validation of interpretability. Using BERTopic applied to ten focus groups exploring HPV vaccine perceptions in Tunisia (1,076 utterances), we conducted systematic evaluation across 27 hyperparameter configurations, assessed stability through bootstrap resampling with 30 replicates per configuration, and validated interpretability through formal human evaluation by three domain experts. Our analysis demonstrates substantial sensitivity to hyperparameter choices and reveals that metric selection for stability assessment must align with analytical goals. A hierarchical merging strategy (extracting fine-grained topics for stability then consolidating for interpretability) effectively navigates the stability-coherence tradeoff, achieving coherence of 0.558 compared to 0.539 for direct extraction. Human validation confirmed topic quality with very good inter-rater reliability (ICC = 0.79, weighted Cohen's kappa = 0.578). Our framework provides practical guidelines that researchers can adapt to their own qualitative research contexts. All code, data processing scripts, and evaluation protocols are publicly available to support reproduction and extension of this work.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>federate, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Personalized federated learning (PFL) possesses the unique capability of preserving data confidentiality among clients while tackling the data heterogeneity problem of non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) data. Its advantages have led to widespread adoption in domains such as medical image segmentation. However, the existing approaches mostly overlook the potential benefits of leveraging shared features across clients, where each client contains segmentation data of different organs. In this work, we introduce a novel personalized federated approach for organ agnostic tumor segmentation (FedOAP), that utilizes cross-attention to model long-range dependencies among the shared features of different clients and a boundary-aware loss to improve segmentation consistency. FedOAP employs a decoupled cross-attention (DCA), which enables each client to retain local queries while attending to globally shared key-value pairs aggregated from all clients, thereby capturing long-range inter-organ feature dependencies. Additionally, we introduce perturbed boundary loss (PBL) which focuses on the inconsistencies of the predicted mask's boundary for each client, forcing the model to localize the margins more precisely. We evaluate FedOAP on diverse tumor segmentation tasks spanning different organs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedOAP consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art federated and personalized segmentation methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text summarization is the task of automatically condensing longer texts into shorter, coherent summaries while preserving the original meaning and key information. Although this task has been extensively studied in English and other high-resource languages, Czech summarization, particularly in the context of historical documents, remains underexplored. This is largely due to the inherent linguistic complexity of Czech and the lack of high-quality annotated datasets. In this work, we address this gap by leveraging the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically Mistral and mT5, which have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks and multilingual settings. In addition, we also propose a translation-based approach that first translates Czech texts into English, summarizes them using an English-language model, and then translates the summaries back into Czech. Our study makes the following main contributions: We demonstrate that LLMs achieve new state-of-the-art results on the SumeCzech dataset, a benchmark for modern Czech text summarization, showing the effectiveness of multilingual LLMs even for morphologically rich, medium-resource languages like Czech. We introduce a new dataset, Posel od Čerchova, designed for the summarization of historical Czech texts. This dataset is derived from digitized 19th-century publications and annotated for abstractive summarization. We provide initial baselines using modern LLMs to facilitate further research in this underrepresented area. By combining cutting-edge models with both modern and historical Czech datasets, our work lays the foundation for further progress in Czech summarization and contributes valuable resources for future research in Czech historical document processing and low-resource summarization more broadly.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Discovering effective predictive signals, or ``alphas,'' from financial data with high dimensionality and extremely low signal-to-noise ratio remains a difficult open problem. Despite progress in deep learning, genetic programming, and, more recently, large language model (LLM)--based factor generation, existing approaches still explore only a narrow region of the vast alpha search space. Neural models tend to produce opaque and fragile patterns, while symbolic or formula-based methods often yield redundant or economically ungrounded expressions that generalize poorly. Although different in form, these paradigms share a key limitation: none can conduct broad, structured, and human-like exploration that balances logical consistency with creative leaps. To address this gap, we introduce the Cognitive Alpha Mining Framework (CogAlpha), which combines code-level alpha representation with LLM-driven reasoning and evolutionary search. Treating LLMs as adaptive cognitive agents, our framework iteratively refines, mutates, and recombines alpha candidates through multi-stage prompts and financial feedback. This synergistic design enables deeper thinking, richer structural diversity, and economically interpretable alpha discovery, while greatly expanding the effective search space. Experiments on A-share equities demonstrate that CogAlpha consistently discovers alphas with superior predictive accuracy, robustness, and generalization over existing methods. Our results highlight the promise of aligning evolutionary optimization with LLM-based reasoning for automated and explainable alpha discovery. All source code will be released.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Online test-time adaptation addresses the train-test domain gap by adapting the model on unlabeled streaming test inputs before making the final prediction. However, online adaptation for 3D human pose estimation suffers from error accumulation when relying on self-supervision with imperfect predictions, leading to degraded performance over time. To mitigate this fundamental challenge, we propose a novel solution that highlights the use of motion discretization. Specifically, we employ unsupervised clustering in the latent motion representation space to derive a set of anchor motions, whose regularity aids in supervising the human pose estimator and enables efficient self-replay. Additionally, we introduce an effective and efficient soft-reset mechanism by reverting the pose estimator to its exponential moving average during continuous adaptation. We examine long-term online adaptation by continuously adapting to out-of-domain streaming test videos of the same individual, which allows for the capture of consistent personal shape and motion traits throughout the streaming observation. By mitigating error accumulation, our solution enables robust exploitation of these personal traits for enhanced accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that our solution outperforms previous online test-time adaptation methods and validate our design choices.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Dataset distillation creates a small distilled set that enables efficient training by capturing key information from the full dataset. While existing dataset distillation methods perform well on balanced datasets, they struggle under long-tailed distributions, where imbalanced class frequencies induce biased model representations and corrupt statistical estimates such as Batch Normalization (BN) statistics. In this paper, we rethink long-tailed dataset distillation by revisiting the limitations of trajectory-based methods, and instead adopt the statistical alignment perspective to jointly mitigate model bias and restore fair supervision. To this end, we introduce three dedicated components that enable unbiased recovery of distilled images and soft relabeling: (1) enhancing expert models (an observer model for recovery and a teacher model for relabeling) to enable reliable statistics estimation and soft-label generation; (2) recalibrating BN statistics via a full forward pass with dynamically adjusted momentum to reduce representation skew; (3) initializing synthetic images by incrementally selecting high-confidence and diverse augmentations via a multi-round mechanism that promotes coverage and diversity. Extensive experiments on four long-tailed benchmarks show consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods across varying degrees of class this http URL, our approach improves top-1 accuracy by 15.6% on CIFAR-100-LT and 11.8% on Tiny-ImageNet-LT under IPC=10 and IF=10.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recently, fine-tuning large-scale pre-trained GNNs has yielded remarkable attention in adapting pre-trained GNN models for downstream graph learning tasks. One representative fine-tuning method is to exploit adapter (termed AdapterGNN) which aims to 'augment' the pre-trained model by inserting a lightweight module to make the 'augmented' model better adapt to the downstream tasks. However, graph data may contain various types of noise in downstream tasks, such as noisy edges and ambiguous node attributes. Existing AdapterGNNs are often prone to graph noise and exhibit limited generalizability. How to enhance the robustness and generalization ability of GNNs' fine tuning remains an open problem. In this paper, we show that the above problem can be well addressed by integrating uncertainty learning into the GNN adapter. We propose the Uncertainty-aware Adapter (UAdapterGNN) that fortifies pre-trained GNN models against noisy graph data in the fine-tuning process. Specifically, in contrast to regular AdapterGNN, our UAdapterGNN exploits Gaussian probabilistic adapter to augment the pre-trained GNN model. In this way, when the graph contains various noises,our method can automatically absorb the effects of changes in the variances of the Gaussian distribution, thereby significantly enhancing the model's robustness. Also, UAdapterGNN can further improve the generalization ability of the model on the downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness and high generalization ability of the proposed UAdapterGNN method.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), the applications of LLMs have grown substantially. In the education domain, LLMs demonstrate significant potential, particularly in automatic text generation, which enables the creation of intelligent and adaptive learning content. This paper proposes a new LLMs framework, which is named as Reading Comprehension Exercise Generation (RCEG). It can generate high-quality and personalized English reading comprehension exercises automatically. Firstly, RCEG uses fine-tuned LLMs to generate content candidates. Then, it uses a discriminator to select the best candidate. Finally, the quality of the generated content has been improved greatly. To evaluate the performance of RCEG, a dedicated dataset for English reading comprehension is constructed to perform the experiments, and comprehensive evaluation metrics are used to analyze the experimental results. These metrics include content diversity, factual accuracy, linguistic toxicity, and pedagogical alignment. Experimental results show that RCEG significantly improves the relevance and cognitive appropriateness of the generated exercises.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning benchmarks. However, their long chain-of-thought reasoning processes incur significant inference overhead. Pruning has emerged as a promising approach to reducing computational costs. However, existing efforts have primarily focused on large language models (LLMs), while pruning LRMs remains unexplored. In this work, we conduct the first empirical study on pruning LRMs and show that directly applying existing pruning techniques fails to yield satisfactory results. Our findings indicate that using self-generated reasoning data for calibration can substantially improve pruning performance. We further investigate how the difficulty and length of reasoning data affect pruning outcomes. Our analysis reveals that challenging and moderately long self-generated reasoning data serve as ideal calibration data. Based on these insights, we propose a Selective Self-Generated Reasoning (SSGR) data construction strategy to provide effective calibration data for pruning LRMs. Experimental results on the DeepSeek-R1-Distill model series validate that our strategy improves the reasoning ability of pruned LRMs by 10%-13% compared to general pruning methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, interpretability, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent salient object detection (SOD) methods aim to improve performance in four key directions: semantic enhancement, boundary refinement, auxiliary task supervision, and multi-modal fusion. In pursuit of continuous gains, these approaches have evolved toward increasingly sophisticated architectures with multi-stage pipelines, specialized fusion modules, edge-guided learning, and elaborate attention mechanisms. However, this complexity paradoxically introduces feature redundancy and cross-component interference that obscure salient cues, ultimately reaching performance bottlenecks. In contrast, human vision achieves efficient salient object identification without such architectural complexity. This contrast raises a fundamental question: can we design a biologically grounded yet architecturally simple SOD framework that dispenses with most of this engineering complexity, while achieving state-of-the-art accuracy, computational efficiency, and interpretability? In this work, we answer this question affirmatively by introducing DualGazeNet, a biologically inspired pure Transformer framework that models the dual biological principles of robust representation learning and magnocellular-parvocellular dual-pathway processing with cortical attention modulation in the human visual system. Extensive experiments on five RGB SOD benchmarks show that DualGazeNet consistently surpasses 25 state-of-the-art CNN- and Transformer-based methods. On average, DualGazeNet achieves about 60\% higher inference speed and 53.4\% fewer FLOPs than four Transformer-based baselines of similar capacity (VST++, MDSAM, Sam2unet, and BiRefNet). Moreover, DualGazeNet exhibits strong cross-domain generalization, achieving leading or highly competitive performance on camouflaged and underwater SOD benchmarks without relying on additional modalities.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>High quality kernels are critical for reducing training and inference costs of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet they traditionally require significant expertise in hardware architecture and software optimization. While recent advances in LLM-based code generation show promise for complex optimization, existing methods struggle with the vast optimization space due to insufficient hardware domain knowledge, failing to effectively balance exploration and exploitation. We present KernelBand, a novel framework that formulates kernel optimization as a hierarchical multi-armed bandit problem, enabling LLM agents to strategically navigate the optimization space by treating kernel selection and optimization strategy application as sequential decision-making processes. Our approach leverages hardware profiling information to identify promising optimization strategies and employs runtime behavior clustering to reduce exploration overhead across kernel candidates. Extensive experiments on TritonBench demonstrate that KernelBand significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance with fewer tokens while exhibiting consistent improvement without saturation as computational resources increase.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) deliver impressive vision-language reasoning but suffer steep inference latency because self-attention scales quadratically with sequence length and thousands of visual tokens contributed by high-resolution images. Naively pruning less-informative visual tokens reduces this burden, yet indiscriminate removal can strip away contextual cues essential for background or fine-grained questions, undermining accuracy. In this paper, we present ParVTS (Parallel Vision Token Scheduling), a training-free scheduling framework that partitions visual tokens into subject and non-subject groups, processes them in parallel to transfer their semantics into question tokens, and discards the non-subject path mid-inference to reduce computation. This scheduling reduces computational complexity, requires no heuristics or additional modules, and is compatible with diverse existing MLLM architectures. Experiments across multiple MLLM backbones show that ParVTS prunes up to 88.9% of visual tokens with minimal performance drop, achieving 1.77x speedup and 70% FLOPs reduction.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) facades represent a promising pathway towards urban decarbonization, especially where roof areas are insufficient and ground-mounted arrays are infeasible. Although machine learning-based approaches to support photovoltaic (PV) planning on rooftops are well researched, automated approaches for facades still remain scarce and oversimplified. This paper therefore presents a pipeline that integrates detailed information on the architectural composition of the facade to automatically identify suitable surfaces for PV application and estimate the solar energy potential. The pipeline fine-tunes SegFormer-B5 on the CMP Facades dataset and converts semantic predictions into facade-level PV suitability masks and PV panel layouts considering module sizes and clearances. Applied to a dataset of 373 facades with known dimensions from ten cities, the results show that installable BIPV potential is significantly lower than theoretical potential, thus providing valuable insights for reliable urban energy planning. With the growing availability of facade imagery, the proposed pipeline can be scaled to support BIPV planning in cities worldwide.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, privacy, attack, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated learning (FL) faces challenges in ensuring both privacy and communication efficiency, particularly in resource-constrained environments such as Internet of Things (IoT) and edge networks. While sign-based methods, such as sign stochastic gradient descent with majority voting (SIGNSGD-MV), offer substantial bandwidth savings, they remain vulnerable to inference attacks due to exposure of gradient signs. Existing secure aggregation techniques are either incompatible with sign-based methods or incur prohibitive overhead. To address these limitations, we propose Hi-SAFE, a lightweight and cryptographically secure aggregation framework for sign-based FL. Our core contribution is the construction of efficient majority vote polynomials for SIGNSGD-MV, derived from Fermat's Little Theorem. This formulation represents the majority vote as a low-degree polynomial over a finite field, enabling secure evaluation that hides intermediate values and reveals only the final result. We further introduce a hierarchical subgrouping strategy that ensures constant multiplicative depth and bounded per-user complexity, independent of the number of users n.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Remote sensing images are becoming increasingly widespread in military, earth resource exploration. Because of the limitation of a single sensor, we can obtain high spatial resolution grayscale panchromatic (PAN) images and low spatial resolution color multispectral (MS) images. Therefore, an important issue is to obtain a color image with high spatial resolution when there is only a PAN image at the input. The existing methods improve spatial resolution using super-resolution (SR) technology and spectral recovery using colorization technology. However, the SR technique cannot improve the spectral resolution, and the colorization technique cannot improve the spatial resolution. Moreover, the pansharpening method needs two registered inputs and can not achieve SR. As a result, an integrated approach is expected. To solve the above problems, we designed a novel multi-function model (MFmamba) to realize the tasks of SR, spectral recovery, joint SR and spectral recovery through three different inputs. Firstly, MFmamba utilizes UNet++ as the backbone, and a Mamba Upsample Block (MUB) is combined with UNet++. Secondly, a Dual Pool Attention (DPA) is designed to replace the skip connection in UNet++. Finally, a Multi-scale Hybrid Cross Block (MHCB) is proposed for initial feature extraction. Many experiments show that MFmamba is competitive in evaluation metrics and visual results and performs well in the three tasks when only the input PAN image is used.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Data contamination poses a significant challenge to the fairness of LLM evaluations in natural language processing tasks by inadvertently exposing models to test data during training. Current studies attempt to mitigate this issue by modifying existing datasets or generating new ones from freshly collected information. However, these methods fall short of ensuring contamination-resilient evaluation, as they fail to fully eliminate pre-existing knowledge from models or preserve the semantic complexity of the original datasets. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{CoreEval}, a \textbf{Co}ntamination-\textbf{re}silient \textbf{Eval}uation strategy for automatically updating data with real-world knowledge. This approach begins by extracting entity relationships from the original data and leveraging the GDELT database to retrieve relevant, up-to-date knowledge. The retrieved knowledge is then recontextualized and integrated with the original data, which is refined and restructured to ensure semantic coherence and enhanced task relevance. Ultimately, a robust data reflection mechanism is employed to iteratively verify and refine labels, ensuring consistency between the updated and original datasets. Extensive experiments on updated datasets validate the robustness of CoreEval, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating performance overestimation caused by data contamination.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this reproducibility study, we revisit the LLAMBO framework of Daxberger et al. (2024), a prompting-based Bayesian optimization (BO) method that uses large language models as discriminative surrogates and acquisition optimizers via text-only interactions. We replicate the core Bayesmark and HPOBench experiments under the original evaluation protocol, but replace GPT-3.5 with the open-weight Llama 3.1 70B model used for all text encoding components. Our results broadly confirm the main claims of LLAMBO. Contextual warm starting via textual problem and hyperparameter descriptions substantially improves early regret behaviour and reduces variance across runs. LLAMBO's discriminative surrogate is weaker than GP or SMAC as a pure single task regressor, yet benefits from cross task semantic priors induced by the language model. Ablations that remove textual context markedly degrade predictive accuracy and calibration, while the LLAMBO candidate sampler consistently generates higher quality and more diverse proposals than TPE or random sampling. Experiments with smaller backbones (Gemma 27B, Llama 3.1 8B) yield unstable or invalid predictions, suggesting insufficient capacity for reliable surrogate behaviour. Overall, our study shows that the LLAMBO architecture is robust to changing the language model backbone and remains effective when instantiated with Llama 3.1 70B.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Medical image segmentation is crucial for clinical applications, but it is frequently disrupted by noisy annotations and ambiguous anatomical boundaries, which lead to instability in model training. Existing methods typically rely on global noise assumptions or confidence-based sample selection, which inadequately mitigate the performance degradation caused by annotation noise, especially in challenging boundary regions. To address this issue, we propose MetaDCSeg, a robust framework that dynamically learns optimal pixel-wise weights to suppress the influence of noisy ground-truth labels while preserving reliable annotations. By explicitly modeling boundary uncertainty through a Dynamic Center Distance (DCD) mechanism, our approach utilizes weighted feature distances for foreground, background, and boundary centers, directing the model's attention toward hard-to-segment pixels near ambiguous boundaries. This strategy enables more precise handling of structural boundaries, which are often overlooked by existing methods, and significantly enhances segmentation performance. Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets with varying noise levels demonstrate that MetaDCSeg consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Group-based policy optimization methods like GRPO and GSPO have become standard for training multimodal models, leveraging group-wise rollouts and relative advantage estimation. However, they suffer from a critical \emph{gradient vanishing} problem when all responses within a group receive identical rewards, causing advantage estimates to collapse and training signals to diminish. Existing attempts to mitigate this issue fall into two paradigms: filtering-based and sampling-based methods. Filtering-based methods first generate rollouts broadly and then retroactively filter out uninformative groups, leading to substantial computational overhead. Sampling-based methods proactively select effective samples before rollout but rely on static criteria or prior dataset knowledge, lacking real-time adaptability. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{VADE}, a \textbf{V}ariance-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{D}ynamic sampling framework via online sample-level difficulty \textbf{E}stimation. Our framework integrates three key components: online sample-level difficulty estimation using Beta distributions, a Thompson sampler that maximizes information gain through the estimated correctness probability, and a two-scale prior decay mechanism that maintains robust estimation under policy evolution. This three components design enables VADE to dynamically select the most informative samples, thereby amplifying training signals while eliminating extra rollout costs. Extensive experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks show that VADE consistently outperforms strong baselines in both performance and sample efficiency, while achieving a dramatic reduction in computational overhead. More importantly, our framework can serves as a plug-and-play component to be seamlessly integrated into existing group-based RL algorithms. Code and models are available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Due to the scarcity of high-quality data, large language models (LLMs) are often trained on mixtures of data with varying quality levels, even after sophisticated data curation. A natural approach to better leverage high-quality data is curriculum-based pretraining, where the model is trained on data sorted in ascending order of quality as determined by a quality metric. However, prior studies have reported limited improvements from such curriculum-based pretraining strategies. This work identifies a critical factor constraining these methods: the incompatibility between the ascending data quality order and the decaying learning rate (LR) schedule. We find that while curriculum-based training substantially outperforms random shuffling when using a constant LR, its advantage diminishes under standard LR decay schedules. Our experiments show this incompatibility can be mitigated by two simple strategies: (1) employing a more moderate LR decay schedule, where the final LR is only moderately smaller than the peak LR, and (2) replacing LR decay with model averaging, i.e., computing a weighted average of the final few checkpoints. By combining these strategies, we improve the average score on a suite of standard benchmarks by 1.64% over random shuffling, without additional data refinement. Validated on 1.5B-parameter models trained over 30B tokens with various data-quality metrics, our findings call for a re-evaluation of curriculum-based LLM pretraining and underscore the potential of co-designing data curricula with optimization methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has emerged as an effective and lightweight framework for post-training visual generative models. However, its performance is fundamentally limited by the ambiguity of textual visual correspondence: a single prompt may validly describe diverse visual outputs, and a single image or video may support multiple equally correct interpretations. This many to many relationship leads reward models to generate uncertain and weakly discriminative signals, causing GRPO to underutilize reliable feedback and overfit noisy ones. We introduce Bayesian Prior-Guided Optimization (BPGO), a novel extension of GRPO that explicitly models reward uncertainty through a semantic prior anchor. BPGO adaptively modulates optimization trust at two levels: inter-group Bayesian trust allocation emphasizes updates from groups consistent with the prior while down-weighting ambiguous ones, and intra-group prior-anchored renormalization sharpens sample distinctions by expanding confident deviations and compressing uncertain scores. Across both image and video generation tasks, BPGO delivers consistently stronger semantic alignment, enhanced perceptual fidelity, and faster convergence than standard GRPO and recent variants.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Video large language models have demonstrated strong video understanding capabilities but suffer from high inference costs due to the massive number of tokens in long videos. Inspired by event-based vision, we propose an event-guided, training-free framework for efficient spatio-temporal understanding, named EventSTU. In the temporal domain, we design a coarse-to-fine keyframe sampling algorithm that exploits the change-triggered property of event cameras to eliminate redundant frames. In the spatial domain, we design an adaptive token pruning algorithm that leverages the visual saliency of events as a zero-cost prior to guide spatial reduction. From a holistic spatio-temporal perspective, we further integrate question relevance from keyframe sampling to adaptively allocate token pruning budgets. To facilitate evaluation, we construct EventBench, the first event-inclusive, human-annotated multimodal benchmark that covers diverse real-world scenarios. Beyond physical event cameras, EventSTU also supports general video understanding using simulated events. Comprehensive experiments show that EventSTU achieves 3.01x FLOPs reduction and 3.10x prefilling speedup over the strongest baseline while still improving performance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Backdoor attacks undermine the reliability and trustworthiness of machine learning systems by injecting hidden behaviors that can be maliciously activated at inference time. While such threats have been extensively studied in unimodal settings, their impact on multimodal foundation models, particularly vision-language models (VLMs), remains largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce \textbf{BackdoorVLM}, the first comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating backdoor attacks on VLMs across a broad range of settings. It adopts a unified perspective that injects and analyzes backdoors across core vision-language tasks, including image captioning and visual question answering. BackdoorVLM organizes multimodal backdoor threats into 5 representative categories: targeted refusal, malicious injection, jailbreak, concept substitution, and perceptual hijack. Each category captures a distinct pathway through which an adversary can manipulate a model's behavior. We evaluate these threats using 12 representative attack methods spanning text, image, and bimodal triggers, tested on 2 open-source VLMs and 3 multimodal datasets. Our analysis reveals that VLMs exhibit strong sensitivity to textual instructions, and in bimodal backdoors the text trigger typically overwhelms the image trigger when forming the backdoor mapping. Notably, backdoors involving the textual modality remain highly potent, with poisoning rates as low as 1\% yielding over 90\% success across most tasks. These findings highlight significant, previously underexplored vulnerabilities in current VLMs. We hope that BackdoorVLM can serve as a useful benchmark for analyzing and mitigating multimodal backdoor threats.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present One4D, a unified framework for 4D generation and reconstruction that produces dynamic 4D content as synchronized RGB frames and pointmaps. By consistently handling varying sparsities of conditioning frames through a Unified Masked Conditioning (UMC) mechanism, One4D can seamlessly transition between 4D generation from a single image, 4D reconstruction from a full video, and mixed generation and reconstruction from sparse frames. Our framework adapts a powerful video generation model for joint RGB and pointmap generation, with carefully designed network architectures. The commonly used diffusion finetuning strategies for depthmap or pointmap reconstruction often fail on joint RGB and pointmap generation, quickly degrading the base video model. To address this challenge, we introduce Decoupled LoRA Control (DLC), which employs two modality-specific LoRA adapters to form decoupled computation branches for RGB frames and pointmaps, connected by lightweight, zero-initialized control links that gradually learn mutual pixel-level consistency. Trained on a mixture of synthetic and real 4D datasets under modest computational budgets, One4D produces high-quality RGB frames and accurate pointmaps across both generation and reconstruction tasks. This work represents a step toward general, high-quality geometry-based 4D world modeling using video diffusion models. Project page: this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Test-time adaptation (TTA) enables models to adapt to distribution shifts at inference time. While entropy minimization over the output distribution has proven effective for TTA, transformers offer an additional unsupervised learning signal through their attention mechanisms. We propose minimizing the entropy of attention distributions from the CLS token to image patches as a novel TTA this http URL approach encourages the model to attend more confidently to relevant image regions under distribution shift and is effective even when only a single test image is available. We demonstrate that attention entropy minimization improves robustness across diverse corruption types while not hurting performance on clean data on a single sample stream of images at test time.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent works have sought to enhance the controllability and precision of text-driven motion generation. Some approaches leverage large language models (LLMs) to produce more detailed texts, while others incorporate global 3D coordinate sequences as additional control signals. However, the former often introduces misaligned details and lacks explicit temporal cues, and the latter incurs significant computational cost when converting coordinates to standard motion representations. To address these issues, we propose FineXtrol, a novel control framework for efficient motion generation guided by temporally-aware, precise, user-friendly, and fine-grained textual control signals that describe specific body part movements over time. In support of this framework, we design a hierarchical contrastive learning module that encourages the text encoder to produce more discriminative embeddings for our novel control signals, thereby improving motion controllability. Quantitative results show that FineXtrol achieves strong performance in controllable motion generation, while qualitative analysis demonstrates its flexibility in directing specific body part movements.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Modern large language models integrate web search to provide real-time answers, yet it remains unclear whether they are efficiently calibrated to use search when it is actually needed. We introduce a benchmark evaluating both the necessity and effectiveness of web access across commercial models with no access to internal states or parameters. The dataset includes a static split of 783 temporally anchored questions answerable from pre-cutoff knowledge, aimed at testing whether models invoke search based on low internal confidence, and a dynamic split of 288 post-cutoff queries designed to test whether models recognise when search is required and retrieve updated information. Web access substantially improves static accuracy for GPT-5-mini and Claude Haiku 4.5, though confidence calibration worsens. On dynamic queries, both models frequently invoke search yet remain below 70 percent accuracy due to weak query formulation. Costs per accuracy-improving call remain low, but returns diminish once initial retrieval fails. Selective invocation helps, but models become overconfident and inconsistent after search. Overall, built-in web search meaningfully improves factual accuracy and can be invoked selectively, yet models remain overconfident, skip retrieval when it is essential, and falter once initial search queries underperform. Taken together, internal web search works better as a good low-latency verification layer than a reliable analytical tool, with clear room for improvement.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) remain susceptible to jailbreak exploits that bypass safety filters and induce harmful or unethical behavior. This work presents a systematic taxonomy of existing jailbreak defenses across prompt-level, model-level, and training-time interventions, followed by three proposed defense strategies. First, a Prompt-Level Defense Framework detects and neutralizes adversarial inputs through sanitization, paraphrasing, and adaptive system guarding. Second, a Logit-Based Steering Defense reinforces refusal behavior through inference-time vector steering in safety-sensitive layers. Third, a Domain-Specific Agent Defense employs the MetaGPT framework to enforce structured, role-based collaboration and domain adherence. Experiments on benchmark datasets show substantial reductions in attack success rate, achieving full mitigation under the agent-based defense. Overall, this study highlights how jailbreaks pose a significant security threat to LLMs and identifies key intervention points for prevention, while noting that defense strategies often involve trade-offs between safety, performance, and scalability.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The task of translating natural language questions into query languages has long been a central focus in semantic parsing. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly accelerated progress in this field. However, existing studies typically focus on a single query language, resulting in methods with limited generalizability across different languages. In this paper, we formally define the Text-to-Query task paradigm, unifying semantic parsing tasks across various query languages. We identify query skeletons as a shared optimization target of Text-to-Query tasks, and propose a general dynamic data augmentation framework that explicitly diagnoses model-specific weaknesses in handling these skeletons to synthesize targeted training data. Experiments on four Text-to-Query benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance using only a small amount of synthesized data, highlighting the efficiency and generality of our approach and laying a solid foundation for unified research on Text-to-Query tasks.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) face a significant bottleneck during autoregressive inference due to the massive memory footprint of the Key-Value (KV) cache. Existing compression techniques like token eviction, quantization, or other low-rank methods often risk information loss, have fixed limits, or introduce significant computational overhead from explicit decompression steps. In this work, we introduce SWAN, a novel, fine-tuning-free framework that eliminates this overhead. Our method uses an offline orthogonal matrix to rotate and prune the KV-cache, which is then used directly in the attention computation without any reconstruction. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that SWAN, augmented with a small dense buffer, offers a robust trade-off, maintaining performance close to the uncompressed baseline even at aggressive 50-60% memory savings per-token on KV-cache. A key advantage is its runtime-tunable compression level, allowing operators to dynamically adjust the memory footprint, a flexibility absent in methods requiring fixed offline configurations. This combination of a decompression-free design, high performance under compression, and adaptability makes SWAN a practical and efficient solution for serving LLMs with long contexts.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Cross-subject motor-imagery decoding remains a major challenge in EEG-based brain-computer interfaces due to strong subject variability and the curved geometry of covariance matrices on the symmetric positive definite (SPD) manifold. We address the zero-shot cross-subject setting, where no target-subject labels or adaptation are allowed, by introducing novel geometry-aware preprocessing modules and deep congruence networks that operate directly on SPD covariance matrices. Our preprocessing modules, DCR and RiFU, extend Riemannian Alignment by improving action separation while reducing subject-specific distortions. We further propose two manifold classifiers, SPD-DCNet and RiFUNet, which use hierarchical congruence transforms to learn discriminative, subject-invariant covariance representations. On the BCI-IV 2a benchmark, our framework improves cross-subject accuracy by 3-4% over the strongest classical baselines, demonstrating the value of geometry-aware transformations for robust EEG decoding.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Flow Matching (FM) has recently emerged as a principled and efficient alternative to diffusion models. Standard FM encourages the learned velocity field to follow a target direction; however, it may accumulate errors along the trajectory and drive samples off the data manifold, leading to perceptual degradation, especially in lightweight or low-step configurations. To enhance stability and generalization, we extend FM into a balanced attract-repel scheme that provides explicit guidance on both "where to go" and "where not to go." To be formal, we propose \textbf{Velocity Contrastive Regularization (VeCoR)}, a complementary training scheme for flow-based generative modeling that augments the standard FM objective with contrastive, two-sided supervision. VeCoR not only aligns the predicted velocity with a stable reference direction (positive supervision) but also pushes it away from inconsistent, off-manifold directions (negative supervision). This contrastive formulation transforms FM from a purely attractive, one-sided objective into a two-sided training signal, regularizing trajectory evolution and improving perceptual fidelity across datasets and backbones. On ImageNet-1K 256$\times$256, VeCoR yields 22\% and 35\% relative FID reductions on SiT-XL/2 and REPA-SiT-XL/2 backbones, respectively, and achieves further FID gains (32\% relative) on MS-COCO text-to-image generation, demonstrating consistent improvements in stability, convergence, and image quality, particularly in low-step and lightweight settings.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In addition to evaluating tumor morphology using H&E staining, immunohistochemistry is used to assess the presence of specific proteins within the tissue. However, this is a costly and labor-intensive technique, for which virtual staining, as an image-to-image translation task, offers a promising alternative. Although recent, this is an emerging field of research with 64% of published studies just in 2024. Most studies use publicly available datasets of H&E-IHC pairs from consecutive tissue sections. Recognizing the training challenges, many authors develop complex virtual staining models based on conditional Generative Adversarial Networks, but ignore the impact of adversarial loss on the quality of virtual staining. Furthermore, overlooking the issues of model evaluation, they claim improved performance based on metrics such as SSIM and PSNR, which are not sufficiently robust to evaluate the quality of virtually stained images. In this paper, we developed CSSP2P GAN, which we demonstrate to achieve heightened pathological fidelity through a blind pathological expert evaluation. Furthermore, while iteratively developing our model, we study the impact of the adversarial loss and demonstrate its crucial role in the quality of virtually stained images. Finally, while comparing our model with reference works in the field, we underscore the limitations of the currently used evaluation metrics and demonstrate the superior performance of CSSP2P GAN.</li>

Experiments on multiple real-world graphs demonstrate that Cutter generates compressed graphs that retain essential static topological properties and exhibit robustness degradation trends highly consistent with the original graphs under various attack scenarios, thereby significantly improving evaluation efficiency without compromising assessment fidelity.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in embodied AI tasks. However, existing VLA models, often built upon Vision-Language Models (VLMs), typically process dense visual inputs independently at each timestep. This approach implicitly models the task as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). However, this history-agnostic design is suboptimal for effective visual token processing in dynamic sequential decision-making, as it fails to leverage the context of history. To address this limitation, we reformulate the problem from a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) perspective and propose a novel framework named AVA-VLA. Inspired by the POMDP that the action generation should be conditioned on the belief state. AVA-VLA introduces Active Visual Attention (AVA) to dynamically modulate visual processing. It achieves this by leveraging the recurrent state, which is a neural approximation of the agent's belief state derived from the previous decision step. Specifically, the AVA module uses the recurrent state to compute the soft weights to actively process task-relevant visual tokens based on its historical context. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that AVA-VLA achieves state-of-the-art performance across popular robotic benchmarks, including LIBERO and CALVIN. Furthermore, real-world deployments on a dual-arm robot platform validate the framework's practical applicability and robust sim-to-real transferability.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Pruning is an effective method for compressing Large Language Models, but finding an optimal, non-uniform layer-wise sparsity allocation remains a key challenge. While heuristic methods are fast but yield suboptimal performance, more powerful search-based approaches like Reinforcement Learning are often hindered by prohibitive computational costs on large-scale models. To overcome this efficiency barrier, we propose FastForward Pruning. Its core is a decoupled, single-step RL framework that separates policy optimization from the complex budget satisfaction problem. Such a decoupling is crucial for efficiently searching the vast policy space of LLMs. This curriculum-based strategy begins with low-cost, simple tasks and gradually increases in complexity, significantly reducing the search's computational overhead. Evaluated on the LLaMA, Mistral, and OPT model families, our framework discovers pruning policies that achieve superior performance over strong heuristic baselines. Crucially, when compared to other search-based algorithms, our method achieves competitive or superior results at a fraction of the computational cost, demonstrating a clear advantage in search efficiency.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Accurate annotation of cutaneous neoplasm biopsies represents a major challenge due to their wide morphological variability, overlapping histological patterns, and the subtle distinctions between benign and malignant lesions. Vision-language foundation models (VLMs), pre-trained on paired image-text corpora, learn joint representations that bridge visual features and diagnostic terminology, enabling zero-shot localization and classification of tissue regions without pixel-level labels. However, most existing VLM applications in histopathology remain limited to slide-level tasks or rely on coarse interactive prompts, and they struggle to produce fine-grained segmentations across gigapixel whole-slide images (WSIs). In this work, we introduce a zero-shot visual-language segmentation pipeline for whole-slide images (ZEUS), a fully automated, zero-shot segmentation framework that leverages class-specific textual prompt ensembles and frozen VLM encoders to generate high-resolution tumor masks in WSIs. By partitioning each WSI into overlapping patches, extracting visual embeddings, and computing cosine similarities against text prompts, we generate a final segmentation mask. We demonstrate competitive performance on two in-house datasets, primary spindle cell neoplasms and cutaneous metastases, highlighting the influence of prompt design, domain shifts, and institutional variability in VLMs for histopathology. ZEUS markedly reduces annotation burden while offering scalable, explainable tumor delineation for downstream diagnostic workflows.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In deepfake detection, the varying degrees of compression employed by social media platforms pose significant challenges for model generalization and reliability. Although existing methods have progressed from single-modal to multimodal approaches, they face critical limitations: single-modal methods struggle with feature degradation under data compression in social media streaming, while multimodal approaches require expensive data collection and labeling and suffer from inconsistent modal quality or accessibility in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Unimodal-generated Multimodal Contrastive Learning (UMCL) framework for robust cross-compression-rate (CCR) deepfake detection. In the training stage, our approach transforms a single visual modality into three complementary features: compression-robust rPPG signals, temporal landmark dynamics, and semantic embeddings from pre-trained vision-language models. These features are explicitly aligned through an affinity-driven semantic alignment (ASA) strategy, which models inter-modal relationships through affinity matrices and optimizes their consistency through contrastive learning. Subsequently, our cross-quality similarity learning (CQSL) strategy enhances feature robustness across compression rates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance across various compression rates and manipulation types, establishing a new benchmark for robust deepfake detection. Notably, our approach maintains high detection accuracy even when individual features degrade, while providing interpretable insights into feature relationships through explicit alignment.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in deep learning have enabled significant progress in plant disease classification using leaf images. Much of the existing research in this field has relied on the PlantVillage dataset, which consists of well-centered plant images captured against uniform, uncluttered backgrounds. Although models trained on this dataset achieve high accuracy, they often fail to generalize to real-world field images, such as those submitted by farmers to plant diagnostic systems. This has created a significant gap between published studies and practical application requirements, highlighting the necessity of investigating and addressing this issue. In this study, we investigate whether attention-based architectures and zero-shot learning approaches can bridge the gap between curated academic datasets and real-world agricultural conditions in plant disease classification. We evaluate three model categories: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers, and Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)-based zero-shot models. While CNNs exhibit limited robustness under domain shift, Vision Transformers demonstrate stronger generalization by capturing global contextual features. Most notably, CLIP models classify diseases directly from natural language descriptions without any task-specific training, offering strong adaptability and interpretability. These findings highlight the potential of zero-shot learning as a practical and scalable domain adaptation strategy for plant health diagnosis in diverse field environments.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Video generation models have made significant progress in generating realistic content, enabling applications in simulation, gaming, and film making. However, current generated videos still contain visual artifacts arising from 3D inconsistencies, e.g., objects and structures deforming under changes in camera pose, which can undermine user experience and simulation fidelity. Motivated by recent findings on representation alignment for diffusion models, we hypothesize that improving the multi-view consistency of video diffusion representations will yield more 3D-consistent video generation. Through detailed analysis on multiple recent camera-controlled video diffusion models we reveal strong correlations between 3D-consistent representations and videos. We also propose ViCoDR, a new approach for improving the 3D consistency of video models by learning multi-view consistent diffusion representations. We evaluate ViCoDR on camera controlled image-to-video, text-to-video, and multi-view generation models, demonstrating significant improvements in the 3D consistency of the generated videos.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the rapid advancement of sophisticated synthetic audio-visual content, e.g., for subtle malicious manipulations, ensuring the integrity of digital media has become paramount. This work presents a novel approach to temporal localization of deepfakes by leveraging Audio-Visual Speech Representation Reconstruction (AuViRe). Specifically, our approach reconstructs speech representations from one modality (e.g., lip movements) based on the other (e.g., audio waveform). Cross-modal reconstruction is significantly more challenging in manipulated video segments, leading to amplified discrepancies, thereby providing robust discriminative cues for precise temporal forgery localization. AuViRe outperforms the state of the art by +8.9 AP@0.95 on LAV-DF, +9.6 AP@0.5 on AV-Deepfake1M, and +5.1 AUC on an in-the-wild experiment. Code available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text-to-LiDAR generation can customize 3D data with rich structures and diverse scenes for downstream tasks. However, the scarcity of Text-LiDAR pairs often causes insufficient training priors, generating overly smooth 3D scenes. Moreover, low-quality text descriptions may degrade generation quality and controllability. In this paper, we propose a Text-to-LiDAR Diffusion Model for scene generation, named T2LDM, with a Self-Conditioned Representation Guidance (SCRG). Specifically, SCRG, by aligning to the real representations, provides the soft supervision with reconstruction details for the Denoising Network (DN) in training, while decoupled in inference. In this way, T2LDM can perceive rich geometric structures from data distribution, generating detailed objects in scenes. Meanwhile, we construct a content-composable Text-LiDAR benchmark, T2nuScenes, along with a controllability metric. Based on this, we analyze the effects of different text prompts for LiDAR generation quality and controllability, providing practical prompt paradigms and insights. Furthermore, a directional position prior is designed to mitigate street distortion, further improving scene fidelity. Additionally, by learning a conditional encoder via frozen DN, T2LDM can support multiple conditional tasks, including Sparse-to-Dense, Dense-to-Sparse, and Semantic-to-LiDAR generation. Extensive experiments in unconditional and conditional generation demonstrate that T2LDM outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art scene generation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>defense, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models demonstrate powerful capabilities across various natural language processing tasks, yet they also harbor safety vulnerabilities. To enhance LLM safety, various jailbreak defense methods have been proposed to guard against harmful outputs. However, improvements in model safety often come at the cost of severe over-refusal, failing to strike a good balance between safety and usability. In this paper, we first analyze the causes of over-refusal from a representation perspective, revealing that over-refusal samples reside at the boundary between benign and malicious samples. Based on this, we propose MOSR, designed to mitigate over-refusal by intervening the safety representation of LLMs. MOSR incorporates two novel components: (1) Overlap-Aware Loss Weighting, which determines the erasure weight for malicious samples by quantifying their similarity to pseudo-malicious samples in the representation space, and (2) Context-Aware Augmentation, which supplements the necessary context for rejection decisions by adding harmful prefixes before rejection responses. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in mitigating over-refusal while largely maintaining safety. Overall, we advocate that future defense methods should strike a better balance between safety and over-refusal.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Low-altitude wireless networks (LAWN) are rapidly expanding with the growing deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for logistics, surveillance, and emergency response. Reliable connectivity remains a critical yet challenging task due to three-dimensional (3D) mobility, time-varying user density, and limited power budgets. The transmit power of base stations (BSs) fluctuates dynamically according to user locations and traffic demands, leading to a highly non-stationary 3D radio environment. Radio maps (RMs) have emerged as an effective means to characterize spatial power distributions and support radio-aware network optimization. However, most existing works construct static or offline RMs, overlooking real-time power variations and spatio-temporal dependencies in multi-UAV networks. To overcome this limitation, we propose a {3D dynamic radio map (3D-DRM)} framework that learns and predicts the spatio-temporal evolution of received power. Specially, a Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder extracts high-dimensional spatial representations from 3D RMs, while a Transformer-based module models sequential dependencies to predict future power distributions. Experiments unveil that 3D-DRM accurately captures fast-varying power dynamics and substantially outperforms baseline models in both RM reconstruction and short-term prediction.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in capturing global dependencies but often struggle to efficiently represent fine-grained local details. Existing multi-scale approaches alleviate this issue by integrating hierarchical or hybrid features; however, they rely on fixed patch sizes and introduce redundant computation. To address these limitations, we propose Granularity-driven Vision Transformer (Grc-ViT), a dynamic coarse-to-fine framework that adaptively adjusts visual granularity based on image complexity. It comprises two key stages: (1) Coarse Granularity Evaluation module, which assesses visual complexity using edge density, entropy, and frequency-domain cues to estimate suitable patch and window sizes; (2) Fine-grained Refinement module, which refines attention computation according to the selected granularity, enabling efficient and precise feature learning. Two learnable parameters, {\alpha} and \b{eta}, are optimized end-to-end to balance global reasoning and local perception. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that Grc-ViT enhances fine-grained discrimination while achieving a superior trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Preference learning has recently emerged as a pivotal strategy for post-training alignment of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, existing approaches predominantly rely on external human-annotated preference data, which is costly and labor-intensive to collect. In this work, we propose OrdMoE, a novel preference alignment framework that bypasses the reliance on external human preferences entirely by leveraging intrinsic signals within Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. Specifically, we observe that the router's expert selection scores implicitly encode a quality-aware ranking of responses (i.e. higher-scoring experts consistently generate higher-quality outputs). Building on this insight, OrdMoE constructs an internal preference hierarchy by grouping experts into ranked tiers based on their per-token routing scores and activating each tier separately to produce a sequence of responses with increasing quality. This yields a zero-cost, self-supervised preference ordering over generated responses, which can be directly optimized using standard preference learning objectives. Extensive experiments across multiple multimodal benchmarks demnstrate that OrdMoE significantly enhances both alignment and overall performance of multimodal Mixture-of-Experts LLMs, achieving competitive results without requiring any human-annotated preference data.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Blind image quality assessment (BIQA) plays a crucial role in evaluating and optimizing visual experience. Most existing BIQA approaches fuse shallow and deep features extracted from backbone networks, while overlooking the unequal contributions to quality prediction. Moreover, while various vision encoder backbones are widely adopted in BIQA, the effective quality decoding architectures remain underexplored. To address these limitations, this paper investigates the contributions of shallow and deep features to BIQA, and proposes a effective quality feature decoding framework via GCN-enhanced \underline{l}ayer\underline{i}nteraction and MoE-based \underline{f}eature d\underline{e}coupling, termed \textbf{(Life-IQA)}. Specifically, the GCN-enhanced layer interaction module utilizes the GCN-enhanced deepest-layer features as query and the penultimate-layer features as key, value, then performs cross-attention to achieve feature interaction. Moreover, a MoE-based feature decoupling module is proposed to decouple fused representations though different experts specialized for specific distortion types or quality dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Life-IQA shows more favorable balance between accuracy and cost than a vanilla Transformer decoder and achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple BIQA this http URL code is available at: \href{this https URL}{\texttt{Life-IQA}}.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Despite the remarkable reasoning abilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs), their robustness under visual corruptions remains insufficiently studied. Existing evaluation paradigms exhibit two major limitations: 1) the dominance of low-discriminative samples in current datasets masks the real robustness gap between models; and 2) conventional accuracy-based metric fail to capture the degradation of the underlying prediction structure. To bridge these gaps, we introduce Bench-C, a comprehensive benchmark emphasizing discriminative samples for assessing corruption robustness, where a selection strategy is proposed to jointly consider the prediction inconsistency under corruption and the semantic diversity. Furthermore, we propose the Robustness Alignment Score (RAS), a unified metric that measures degradation in logit-level prediction structure by considering the shifts in prediction uncertainty and calibration alignment. Comprehensive experiments and analysis reveal several interesting findings: 1) model behaviors exhibit distinguish patterns under corruptions, such as erroneous confidence and hesitation; 2) despite subtle corruption may lead to a slight accuracy gain, the overall prediction structure still degrades; 3) by decomposing corruption robustness into destructive and corrective components, the distinct failure and recovery patterns across models can be revealed.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Embodied exploration is a target-driven process that requires embodied agents to possess fine-grained perception and knowledge-enhanced decision making. While recent attempts leverage MLLMs for exploration due to their strong perceptual and reasoning abilities, we find that MLLM-based embodied agents remain suboptimal in exploring new environments: (i) they rely on profound but stale pre-trained knowledge, (ii) training-based approaches such as imitation learning or reinforcement learning are expensive for long-horizon tasks with sparse outcome rewards, and (iii) frontier-based exploration yields a large, visually nuanced action space that is difficult for MLLMs to make reliable decisions. We address these challenges with ReEXplore, a training-free framework that performs retrospective experience replay to inject distilled, abstract experience at inference time, and hierarchical frontier selection to decompose frontier ranking into coarse-to-fine decisions. Our approach enables robust, traceable, and efficient exploration. Across multiple embodied exploration benchmarks, ReEXplore yields great improvements over strong MLLM baselines, up to 3x higher performance in both success rate and in navigation efficiency under open-source backbones.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Accurately and swiftly assessing damage from conflicts is crucial for humanitarian aid and regional stability. In conflict zones, damaged zones often share similar architectural styles, with damage typically covering small areas and exhibiting blurred boundaries. These characteristics lead to limited data, annotation difficulties, and significant recognition challenges, including high intra-class similarity and ambiguous semantic changes. To address these issues, we introduce a pre-trained DINOv3 model and propose a multi-scale cross-attention difference siamese network (MC-DiSNet). The powerful visual representation capability of the DINOv3 backbone enables robust and rich feature extraction from bi-temporal remote sensing images. We also release a new Gaza-change dataset containing high-resolution satellite image pairs from 2023-2024 with pixel-level semantic change annotations. It is worth emphasizing that our annotations only include semantic pixels of changed areas. Unlike conventional semantic change detection (SCD), our approach eliminates the need for large-scale semantic annotations of bi-temporal images, instead focusing directly on the changed regions. We term this new task change semantic detection (CSD). The CSD task represents a direct extension of binary change detection (BCD). Due to the limited spatial extent of semantic regions, it presents greater challenges than traditional SCD tasks. We evaluated our method under the CSD framework on both the Gaza-Change and SECOND datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach effectively addresses the CSD task, and its outstanding performance paves the way for practical applications in rapid damage assessment across conflict zones.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Message passing graph neural networks are widely used for learning on graphs, yet their expressive power is limited by the one-dimensional Weisfeiler-Lehman test and can fail to distinguish structurally different nodes. We provide rigorous theory for a Laplacian positional encoding that is invariant to eigenvector sign flips and to basis rotations within eigenspaces. We prove that this encoding yields node identifiability from a constant number of observations and establishes a sample-complexity separation from architectures constrained by the Weisfeiler-Lehman test. The analysis combines a monotone link between shortest-path and diffusion distance, spectral trilateration with a constant set of anchors, and quantitative spectral injectivity with logarithmic embedding size. As an instantiation, pairing this encoding with a neural-process style decoder yields significant gains on a drug-drug interaction task on chemical graphs, improving both the area under the ROC curve and the F1 score and demonstrating the practical benefits of resolving theoretical expressiveness limitations with principled positional information.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Medical image segmentation is fundamental for biomedical discovery. Existing methods lack generalizability and demand extensive, time-consuming manual annotation for new clinical application. Here, we propose MedSAM-3, a text promptable medical segmentation model for medical image and video segmentation. By fine-tuning the Segment Anything Model (SAM) 3 architecture on medical images paired with semantic conceptual labels, our MedSAM-3 enables medical Promptable Concept Segmentation (PCS), allowing precise targeting of anatomical structures via open-vocabulary text descriptions rather than solely geometric prompts. We further introduce the MedSAM-3 Agent, a framework that integrates Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to perform complex reasoning and iterative refinement in an agent-in-the-loop workflow. Comprehensive experiments across diverse medical imaging modalities, including X-ray, MRI, Ultrasound, CT, and video, demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing specialist and foundation models.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has shown promising results in aligning generative outputs with human preferences by distinguishing between chosen and rejected samples. However, a critical limitation of DPO is likelihood displacement, where the probabilities of chosen samples paradoxically decrease during training, undermining the quality of generation. Although this issue has been investigated in autoregressive models, its impact within diffusion-based models remains largely unexplored. This gap leads to suboptimal performance in tasks involving video generation. To address this, we conduct a formal analysis of DPO loss through updating policy within the diffusion framework, which describes how the updating of specific training samples influences the model's predictions on other samples. Using this tool, we identify two main failure modes: (1) Optimization Conflict, which arises from small reward margins between chosen and rejected samples, and (2) Suboptimal Maximization, caused by large reward margins. Informed by these insights, we introduce a novel solution named Policy-Guided DPO (PG-DPO), combining Adaptive Rejection Scaling (ARS) and Implicit Preference Regularization (IPR) to effectively mitigate likelihood displacement. Experiments show that PG-DPO outperforms existing methods in both quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations, offering a robust solution for improving preference alignment in video generation tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Perception of Low-Altitude Aircraft (LAA) in 3D space enables precise 3D object localization and behavior understanding. However, datasets tailored for 3D LAA perception remain scarce. To address this gap, we present LAA3D, a large-scale dataset designed to advance 3D detection and tracking of low-altitude aerial vehicles. LAA3D contains 15,000 real images and 600,000 synthetic frames, captured across diverse scenarios, including urban and suburban environments. It covers multiple aerial object categories, including electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing (eVTOL) aircraft, Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs), and Helicopters. Each instance is annotated with 3D bounding box, class label, and instance identity, supporting tasks such as 3D object detection, 3D multi-object tracking (MOT), and 6-DoF pose estimation. Besides, we establish the LAA3D Benchmark, integrating multiple tasks and methods with unified evaluation protocols for comparison. Furthermore, we propose MonoLAA, a monocular 3D detection baseline, achieving robust 3D localization from zoom cameras with varying focal lengths. Models pretrained on synthetic images transfer effectively to real-world data with fine-tuning, demonstrating strong sim-to-real generalization. Our LAA3D provides a comprehensive foundation for future research in low-altitude 3D object perception.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Prompt-free image segmentation aims to generate accurate masks without manual guidance. Typical pre-trained models, notably Segmentation Anything Model (SAM), generate prompts directly at a single granularity level. However, this approach has two limitations: (1) Localizability, lacking mechanisms for autonomous region localization; (2) Scalability, limited fine-grained modeling at high resolution. To address these challenges, we introduce Granular Computing-driven SAM (Grc-SAM), a coarse-to-fine framework motivated by Granular Computing (GrC). First, the coarse stage adaptively extracts high-response regions from features to achieve precise foreground localization and reduce reliance on external prompts. Second, the fine stage applies finer patch partitioning with sparse local swin-style attention to enhance detail modeling and enable high-resolution segmentation. Third, refined masks are encoded as latent prompt embeddings for the SAM decoder, replacing handcrafted prompts with an automated reasoning process. By integrating multi-granularity attention, Grc-SAM bridges granular computing with vision transformers. Extensive experimental results demonstrate Grc-SAM outperforms baseline methods in both accuracy and scalability. It offers a unique granular computational perspective for prompt-free segmentation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>MeanFlow promises high-quality generative modeling in few steps, by jointly learning instantaneous and average velocity fields. Yet, the underlying training dynamics remain unclear. We analyze the interaction between the two velocities and find: (i) well-established instantaneous velocity is a prerequisite for learning average velocity; (ii) learning of instantaneous velocity benefits from average velocity when the temporal gap is small, but degrades as the gap increases; and (iii) task-affinity analysis indicates that smooth learning of large-gap average velocities, essential for one-step generation, depends on the prior formation of accurate instantaneous and small-gap average velocities. Guided by these observations, we design an effective training scheme that accelerates the formation of instantaneous velocity, then shifts emphasis from short- to long-interval average velocity. Our enhanced MeanFlow training yields faster convergence and significantly better few-step generation: With the same DiT-XL backbone, our method reaches an impressive FID of 2.87 on 1-NFE ImageNet 256x256, compared to 3.43 for the conventional MeanFlow baseline. Alternatively, our method matches the performance of the MeanFlow baseline with 2.5x shorter training time, or with a smaller DiT-L backbone.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In Asynchronous Federated Learning (AFL), the central server immediately updates the global model with each arriving client's contribution. As a result, clients perform their local training on different model versions, causing information staleness (delay). In federated environments with non-IID local data distributions, this asynchronous pattern amplifies the adverse effect of client heterogeneity (due to different data distribution, local objectives, etc.), as faster clients contribute more frequent updates, biasing the global model. We term this phenomenon heterogeneity amplification. Our work provides a theoretical analysis that maps AFL design choices to their resulting error sources when heterogeneity amplification occurs. Guided by our analysis, we propose ACE (All-Client Engagement AFL), which mitigates participation imbalance through immediate, non-buffered updates that use the latest information available from all clients. We also introduce a delay-aware variant, ACED, to balance client diversity against update staleness. Experiments on different models for different tasks across diverse heterogeneity and delay settings validate our analysis and demonstrate the robust performance of our approaches.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generalizable person re-identification (Re-ID) aims to recognize individuals across unseen cameras and environments. While existing methods rely heavily on limited labeled multi-camera data, we propose DynaMix, a novel method that effectively combines manually labeled multi-camera and large-scale pseudo-labeled single-camera data. Unlike prior works, DynaMix dynamically adapts to the structure and noise of the training data through three core components: (1) a Relabeling Module that refines pseudo-labels of single-camera identities on-the-fly; (2) an Efficient Centroids Module that maintains robust identity representations under a large identity space; and (3) a Data Sampling Module that carefully composes mixed data mini-batches to balance learning complexity and intra-batch diversity. All components are specifically designed to operate efficiently at scale, enabling effective training on millions of images and hundreds of thousands of identities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DynaMix consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generalizable person Re-ID.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has recently demonstrated significant potential in medical image segmentation. Although SAM is primarily trained on 2D images, attempts have been made to apply it to 3D medical image segmentation. However, the pseudo 3D processing used to adapt SAM results in spatial feature loss, limiting its performance. Additionally, most SAM-based methods still rely on manual prompts, which are challenging to implement in real-world scenarios and require extensive external expert knowledge. To address these limitations, we introduce the Decoder Enhanced and Auto Prompt SAM (DEAP-3DSAM) to tackle these limitations. Specifically, we propose a Feature Enhanced Decoder that fuses the original image features with rich and detailed spatial information to enhance spatial features. We also design a Dual Attention Prompter to automatically obtain prompt information through Spatial Attention and Channel Attention. We conduct comprehensive experiments on four public abdominal tumor segmentation datasets. The results indicate that our DEAP-3DSAM achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D image segmentation, outperforming or matching existing manual prompt methods. Furthermore, both quantitative and qualitative ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of our proposed modules.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, including multi-step reasoning such as mathematical proving. However, existing approaches often lack an explicit and dynamic mechanism to structurally represent and evolve intermediate reasoning states, which limits their ability to perform context-aware theorem selection and iterative conclusion generation. To address these challenges, we propose GraphMind, a novel dynamic graph-based framework that integrates the graph neural network (GNN) with LLMs to iteratively select theorems and generate intermediate conclusions for multi-step reasoning. Our method models the reasoning process as a heterogeneous evolving graph, where nodes represent conditions, theorems, and conclusions, while edges capture logical dependencies between nodes. By encoding the current reasoning state with GNN and leveraging semantic matching for theorem selection, our framework enables context-aware, interpretable, and structured reasoning in a closed-loop manner. Experiments on various question-answering (QA) datasets demonstrate that our proposed GraphMind method achieves consistent performance improvements and significantly outperforms existing baselines in multi-step reasoning, validating the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In-context learning (ICL) with large language models (LLMs) has emerged as a promising paradigm for named entity recognition (NER) in low-resource scenarios. However, existing ICL-based NER methods suffer from three key limitations: (1) reliance on dynamic retrieval of annotated examples, which is problematic when annotated data is scarce; (2) limited generalization to unseen domains due to the LLM's insufficient internal domain knowledge; and (3) failure to incorporate external knowledge or resolve entity ambiguities. To address these challenges, we propose KDR-Agent, a novel multi-agent framework for multi-domain low-resource in-context NER that integrates Knowledge retrieval, Disambiguation, and Reflective analysis. KDR-Agent leverages natural-language type definitions and a static set of entity-level contrastive demonstrations to reduce dependency on large annotated corpora. A central planner coordinates specialized agents to (i) retrieve factual knowledge from Wikipedia for domain-specific mentions, (ii) resolve ambiguous entities via contextualized reasoning, and (iii) reflect on and correct model predictions through structured self-assessment. Experiments across ten datasets from five domains demonstrate that KDR-Agent significantly outperforms existing zero-shot and few-shot ICL baselines across multiple LLM backbones.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Flow-based generative models synthesize data by integrating a learned velocity field from a reference distribution to the target data distribution. Prior work has focused on endpoint metrics (e.g., fidelity, likelihood, perceptual quality) while overlooking a deeper question: what do the sampling trajectories reveal? Motivated by classical mechanics, we introduce kinetic path energy (KPE), a simple yet powerful diagnostic that quantifies the total kinetic effort along each generation path of ODE-based samplers. Through comprehensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-256, we uncover two key phenomena: ({i}) higher KPE predicts stronger semantic quality, indicating that semantically richer samples require greater kinetic effort, and ({ii}) higher KPE inversely correlates with data density, with informative samples residing in sparse, low-density regions. Together, these findings reveal that semantically informative samples naturally reside on the sparse frontier of the data distribution, demanding greater generative effort. Our results suggest that trajectory-level analysis offers a physics-inspired and interpretable framework for understanding generation difficulty and sample characteristics.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The advent of financial technology has witnessed a surge in the utilization of deep learning models to anticipate consumer conduct, a trend that has demonstrated considerable potential in enhancing lending strategies and bolstering market efficiency. We study multi-horizon demand forecasting on e-commerce transactions using the UCI Online Retail II dataset. Unlike prior versions of this manuscript that mixed financial-loan narratives with retail data, we focus exclusively on retail market behavior and define a clear prediction target: per SKU daily demand (or revenue) for horizons H=1,7,14. We present a hybrid sequence model that combines multi-scale temporal convolutions, a gated recurrent module, and time-aware self-attention. The model is trained with standard regression losses and evaluated under MAE, RMSE, sMAPE, MASE, and Theil's U_2 with strict time-based splits to prevent leakage. We benchmark against ARIMA/Prophet, LSTM/GRU, LightGBM, and state-of-the-art Transformer forecasters (TFT, Informer, Autoformer, N-BEATS). Results show consistent accuracy gains and improved robustness on peak/holiday periods. We further provide ablations and statistical significance tests to ensure the reliability of improvements, and we release implementation details to facilitate reproducibility.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Existing reinforcement learning methods for Chain-of-Thought reasoning suffer from two critical limitations. First, they operate as monolithic black boxes that provide undifferentiated reward signals, obscuring individual step contributions and hindering error diagnosis. Second, sequential decoding has O(n) time complexity. This makes real-time deployment impractical for complex reasoning tasks. We present DeCoRL (Decoupled Reasoning Chains via Coordinated Reinforcement Learning), a novel framework that transforms reasoning from sequential processing into collaborative modular orchestration. DeCoRL trains lightweight specialized models to generate reasoning sub-steps concurrently, eliminating sequential bottlenecks through parallel processing. To enable precise error attribution, the framework designs modular reward functions that score each sub-step independently. Cascaded DRPO optimization then coordinates these rewards while preserving inter-step dependencies. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates state-of-the-art results across RM-Bench, RMB, and RewardBench, outperforming existing methods including large-scale models. DeCoRL delivers 3.8 times faster inference while maintaining superior solution quality and offers a 22.7\% improvement in interpretability through explicit reward attribution. These advancements, combined with a 72.4\% reduction in energy consumption and a 68\% increase in throughput, make real-time deployment of complex reasoning systems a reality.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid growth of IoT devices has led to an enormous amount of sensor data that requires transmission to cloud servers for processing, resulting in excessive network congestion, increased latency and high energy consumption. This is particularly problematic in resource-constrained and remote environments where bandwidth is limited, and battery-dependent devices further emphasize the problem. Moreover, in domains such as agriculture, consecutive sensor readings often have minimal variation, making continuous data transmission inefficient and unnecessarily resource intensive. To overcome these challenges, we propose an analytical prediction algorithm designed for edge computing environments and validated through simulation. The proposed solution utilizes a predictive filter at the network edge that forecasts the next sensor data point and triggers data transmission only when the deviation from the predicted value exceeds a predefined tolerance. A complementary cloud-based model ensures data integrity and overall system consistency. This dual-model strategy effectively reduces communication overhead and demonstrates potential for improving energy efficiency by minimizing redundant transmissions. In addition to reducing communication load, our approach leverages both in situ and satellite observations from the same locations to enhance model robustness. It also supports cross-site generalization, enabling models trained in one region to be effectively deployed elsewhere without retraining. This makes our solution highly scalable, energy-aware, and well-suited for optimizing sensor data transmission in remote and bandwidth-constrained IoT environments.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>WiFi-based human pose estimation (HPE) has attracted increasing attention due to its resilience to occlusion and privacy-preserving compared to camera-based methods. However, existing WiFi-based HPE approaches often employ regression networks that directly map WiFi channel state information (CSI) to 3D joint coordinates, ignoring the inherent topological relationships among human joints. In this paper, we present GraphPose-Fi, a graph-based framework that explicitly models skeletal topology for WiFi-based 3D HPE. Our framework comprises a CNN encoder shared across antennas for subcarrier-time feature extraction, a lightweight attention module that adaptively reweights features over time and across antennas, and a graph-based regression head that combines GCN layers with self-attention to capture local topology and global dependencies. Our proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods on the MM-Fi dataset in various settings. The source code is available at: this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Current autonomous driving (AD) simulations are critically limited by their inadequate representation of realistic and diverse human behavior, which is essential for ensuring safety and reliability. Existing benchmarks often simplify pedestrian interactions, failing to capture complex, dynamic intentions and varied responses critical for robust system deployment. To overcome this, we introduce HABIT (Human Action Benchmark for Interactive Traffic), a high-fidelity simulation benchmark. HABIT integrates real-world human motion, sourced from mocap and videos, into CARLA (Car Learning to Act, a full autonomous driving simulator) via a modular, extensible, and physically consistent motion retargeting pipeline. From an initial pool of approximately 30,000 retargeted motions, we curate 4,730 traffic-compatible pedestrian motions, standardized in SMPL format for physically consistent trajectories. HABIT seamlessly integrates with CARLA's Leaderboard, enabling automated scenario generation and rigorous agent evaluation. Our safety metrics, including Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) and False Positive Braking Rate (FPBR), reveal critical failure modes in state-of-the-art AD agents missed by prior evaluations. Evaluating three state-of-the-art autonomous driving agents, InterFuser, TransFuser, and BEVDriver, demonstrates how HABIT exposes planner weaknesses that remain hidden in scripted simulations. Despite achieving close or equal to zero collisions per kilometer on the CARLA Leaderboard, the autonomous agents perform notably worse on HABIT, with up to 7.43 collisions/km and a 12.94% AIS 3+ injury risk, and they brake unnecessarily in up to 33% of cases. All components are publicly released to support reproducible, pedestrian-aware AI research.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion-based editing enables realistic modification of local image regions, making AI-generated content harder to detect. Existing AIGC detection benchmarks focus on classifying entire images, overlooking the localization of diffusion-based edits. We introduce DiffSeg30k, a publicly available dataset of 30k diffusion-edited images with pixel-level annotations, designed to support fine-grained detection. DiffSeg30k features: 1) In-the-wild images--we collect images or image prompts from COCO to reflect real-world content diversity; 2) Diverse diffusion models--local edits using eight SOTA diffusion models; 3) Multi-turn editing--each image undergoes up to three sequential edits to mimic real-world sequential editing; and 4) Realistic editing scenarios--a vision-language model (VLM)-based pipeline automatically identifies meaningful regions and generates context-aware prompts covering additions, removals, and attribute changes. DiffSeg30k shifts AIGC detection from binary classification to semantic segmentation, enabling simultaneous localization of edits and identification of the editing models. We benchmark three baseline segmentation approaches, revealing significant challenges in semantic segmentation tasks, particularly concerning robustness to image distortions. Experiments also reveal that segmentation models, despite being trained for pixel-level localization, emerge as highly reliable whole-image classifiers of diffusion edits, outperforming established forgery classifiers while showing great potential in cross-generator generalization. We believe DiffSeg30k will advance research in fine-grained localization of AI-generated content by demonstrating the promise and limitations of segmentation-based methods.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, diffusion, generative, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The miniaturization of thermal sensors for mobile platforms inherently limits their spatial resolution and textural fidelity, leading to blurry and less informative images. Existing thermal super-resolution (SR) methods can be grouped into single-image and RGB-guided approaches: the former struggles to recover fine structures from limited information, while the latter relies on accurate and laborious cross-camera calibration, which hinders practical deployment and robustness. Here, we propose 3M-TI, a calibration-free Multi-camera cross-Modality diffusion framework for Mobile Thermal Imaging. At its core, 3M-TI integrates a cross-modal self-attention module (CSM) into the diffusion UNet, replacing the original self-attention layers to adaptively align thermal and RGB features throughout the denoising process, without requiring explicit camera calibration. This design enables the diffusion network to leverage its generative prior to enhance spatial resolution, structural fidelity, and texture detail in the super-resolved thermal images. Extensive evaluations on real-world mobile thermal cameras and public benchmarks validate our superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results in both visual quality and quantitative metrics. More importantly, the thermal images enhanced by 3M-TI lead to substantial gains in critical downstream tasks like object detection and segmentation, underscoring its practical value for robust mobile thermal perception systems.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Aspect category sentiment analysis (ACSA) has achieved remarkable progress with large language models (LLMs), yet existing approaches primarily emphasize sentiment polarity while overlooking the underlying emotional dimensions that shape sentiment expressions. This limitation hinders the model's ability to capture fine-grained affective signals toward specific aspect categories. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel emotion-enhanced multi-task ACSA framework that jointly learns sentiment polarity and category-specific emotions grounded in Ekman's six basic emotions. Leveraging the generative capabilities of LLMs, our approach enables the model to produce emotional descriptions for each aspect category, thereby enriching sentiment representations with affective expressions. Furthermore, to ensure the accuracy and consistency of the generated emotions, we introduce an emotion refinement mechanism based on the Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) dimensional framework. Specifically, emotions predicted by the LLM are projected onto a VAD space, and those inconsistent with their corresponding VAD coordinates are re-annotated using a structured LLM-based refinement strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms strong baselines on all benchmark datasets. This underlines the effectiveness of integrating affective dimensions into ACSA.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Accurate Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction coupled with uncertainty quantification remains a critical challenge in aerospace prognostics. This research introduces a novel uncertainty-aware deep learning framework that learns aleatoric uncertainty directly through probabilistic modeling, an approach unexplored in existing CMAPSS-based literature. Our hierarchical architecture integrates multi-scale Inception blocks for temporal pattern extraction, bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory networks for sequential modeling, and a dual-level attention mechanism operating simultaneously on sensor and temporal dimensions. The innovation lies in the Bayesian output layer that predicts both mean RUL and variance, enabling the model to learn data-inherent uncertainty. Comprehensive preprocessing employs condition-aware clustering, wavelet denoising, and intelligent feature selection. Experimental validation on NASA CMAPSS benchmarks (FD001-FD004) demonstrates competitive overall performance with RMSE values of 16.22, 19.29, 16.84, and 19.98 respectively. Remarkably, our framework achieves breakthrough critical zone performance (RUL <= 30 cycles) with RMSE of 5.14, 6.89, 5.27, and 7.16, representing 25-40 percent improvements over conventional approaches and establishing new benchmarks for safety-critical predictions. The learned uncertainty provides well-calibrated 95 percent confidence intervals with coverage ranging from 93.5 percent to 95.2 percent, enabling risk-aware maintenance scheduling previously unattainable in CMAPSS literature.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid progress of GANs and Diffusion Models poses new challenges for detecting AI-generated images. Although CLIP-based detectors exhibit promising generalization, they often rely on semantic cues rather than generator artifacts, leading to brittle performance under distribution shifts. In this work, we revisit the nature of semantic bias and uncover that Patch Shuffle provides an unusually strong benefit for CLIP, that disrupts global semantic continuity while preserving local artifact cues, which reduces semantic entropy and homogenizes feature distributions between natural and synthetic images. Through a detailed layer-wise analysis, we further show that CLIP's deep semantic structure functions as a regulator that stabilizes cross-domain representations once semantic bias is suppressed. Guided by these findings, we propose SemAnti, a semantic-antagonistic fine-tuning paradigm that freezes the semantic subspace and adapts only artifact-sensitive layers under shuffled semantics. Despite its simplicity, SemAnti achieves state-of-the-art cross-domain generalization on AIGCDetectBenchmark and GenImage, demonstrating that regulating semantics is key to unlocking CLIP's full potential for robust AI-generated image detection.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning is a critical capability for large language models (LLMs), enabling them to tackle com- plex multi-step tasks. While base LLMs, pre-trained on general text corpora, often struggle with reasoning due to a lack of specialized training, recent studies reveal their latent reason- ing potential tied to hidden states. However, existing hidden state manipulation methods, such as linear activation steering, suffer from limitations due to their rigid and unconstrained nature, often leading to distribution shifts and degraded text quality. In this work, we propose a novel approach for elic- iting CoT reasoning from base LLMs through hidden state manipulation grounded in probabilistic conditional generation. By reformulating the challenge as an optimization problem with a balanced likelihood and prior regularization framework, our method guides hidden states toward reasoning-oriented trajectories while preserving linguistic coherence. Extensive evaluations across mathematical, commonsense, and logical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our approach con- sistently outperforms existing steering methods, offering a theoretically principled and effective solution for enhancing reasoning capabilities in base LLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper introduces the retrieval-augmented framework for automatic fashion caption and hashtag generation, combining multi-garment detection, attribute reasoning, and Large Language Model (LLM) prompting. The system aims to produce visually grounded, descriptive, and stylistically interesting text for fashion imagery, overcoming the limitations of end-to-end captioners that have problems with attribute fidelity and domain generalization. The pipeline combines a YOLO-based detector for multi-garment localization, k-means clustering for dominant color extraction, and a CLIP-FAISS retrieval module for fabric and gender attribute inference based on a structured product index. These attributes, together with retrieved style examples, create a factual evidence pack that is used to guide an LLM to generate human-like captions and contextually rich hashtags. A fine-tuned BLIP model is used as a supervised baseline model for comparison. Experimental results show that the YOLO detector is able to obtain a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of 0.71 for nine categories of garments. The RAG-LLM pipeline generates expressive attribute-aligned captions and achieves mean attribute coverage of 0.80 with full coverage at the 50% threshold in hashtag generation, whereas BLIP gives higher lexical overlap and lower generalization. The retrieval-augmented approach exhibits better factual grounding, less hallucination, and great potential for scalable deployment in various clothing domains. These results demonstrate the use of retrieval-augmented generation as an effective and interpretable paradigm for automated and visually grounded fashion content generation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) have emerged as one of the most promising paradigms for generative modeling over discrete domains. It is known that MDMs effectively train to decode tokens in a random order, and that this ordering has significant performance implications in practice. This observation raises a fundamental question: can we design a training framework that optimizes for a favorable decoding order? We answer this in the affirmative, showing that the continuous-time variational objective of MDMs, when equipped with multivariate noise schedules, can identify and optimize for a decoding order during training. We establish a direct correspondence between decoding order and the multivariate noise schedule and show that this setting breaks invariance of the MDM objective to the noise schedule. Furthermore, we prove that the MDM objective decomposes precisely into a weighted auto-regressive losses over these orders, which establishes them as auto-regressive models with learnable orders.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) are widely used for factual tasks such as "What treats asthma?" or "What is the capital of Latvia?". However, it remains unclear how stably LLMs encode distinctions between true, false, and neither-true-nor-false content in their internal probabilistic representations. We introduce representational stability as the robustness of an LLM's veracity representations to perturbations in the operational definition of truth. We assess representational stability by (i) training a linear probe on an LLM's activations to separate true from not-true statements and (ii) measuring how its learned decision boundary shifts under controlled label changes. Using activations from sixteen open-source models and three factual domains, we compare two types of neither statements. The first are fact-like assertions about entities we believe to be absent from any training data. We call these unfamiliar neither statements. The second are nonfactual claims drawn from well-known fictional contexts. We call these familiar neither statements. The unfamiliar statements induce the largest boundary shifts, producing up to $40\%$ flipped truth judgements in fragile domains (such as word definitions), while familiar fictional statements remain more coherently clustered and yield smaller changes ($\leq 8.2\%$). These results suggest that representational stability stems more from epistemic familiarity than from linguistic form. More broadly, our approach provides a diagnostic for auditing and training LLMs to preserve coherent truth assignments under semantic uncertainty, rather than optimizing for output accuracy alone.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>explainability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Advertising (Ad) is a cornerstone of the digital economy, yet the moderation of video advertisements remains a significant challenge due to their complexity and the need for precise violation localization. While recent advancements, such as the RAVEN model, have improved coarse-grained violation detection, critical gaps persist in fine-grained understanding, explainability, and generalization. To address these limitations, we propose RAVEN++, a novel framework that introduces three key innovations: 1) Active Reinforcement Learning (RL), which dynamically adapts training to samples of varying difficulty; 2) Fine-Grained Violation Understanding, achieved through hierarchical reward functions and reasoning distillation; and 3) Progressive Multi-Stage Training, which systematically combines knowledge injection, curriculum-based passive RL, and active RL. Extensive experiments on both public and proprietary datasets, on both offline scenarios and online deployed A/B Testing, demonstrate that RAVEN++ outperforms general-purpose LLMs and specialized models like RAVEN in terms of fine-grained violation understanding, reasoning capabilities, and generalization ability.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Image restoration (IR) models are typically trained to recover high-quality images using L1 or LPIPS loss. To handle diverse unknown degradations, zero-shot IR methods have also been introduced. However, existing pre-trained and zero-shot IR approaches often fail to align with human preferences, resulting in restored images that may not be favored. This highlights the critical need to enhance restoration quality and adapt flexibly to various image restoration tasks or backbones without requiring model retraining and ideally without labor-intensive preference data collection. In this paper, we propose the first Test-Time Preference Optimization (TTPO) paradigm for image restoration, which enhances perceptual quality, generates preference data on-the-fly, and is compatible with any IR model backbone. Specifically, we design a training-free, three-stage pipeline: (i) generate candidate preference images online using diffusion inversion and denoising based on the initially restored image; (ii) select preferred and dispreferred images using automated preference-aligned metrics or human feedback; and (iii) use the selected preference images as reward signals to guide the diffusion denoising process, optimizing the restored image to better align with human preferences. Extensive experiments across various image restoration tasks and models demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed pipeline.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Research on the safety evaluation of large language models (LLMs) has become extensive, driven by jailbreak studies that elicit unsafe responses. Such response involves information already available to humans, such as the answer to "how to make a bomb". When LLMs are jailbroken, the practical threat they pose to humans is negligible. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs commonly produce unpredictable outputs that could pose substantive threats to human safety. To address this gap, we study whether LLM-generated content contains potential existential threats, defined as outputs that imply or promote direct harm to human survival. We propose \textsc{ExistBench}, a benchmark designed to evaluate such risks. Each sample in \textsc{ExistBench} is derived from scenarios where humans are positioned as adversaries to AI assistants. Unlike existing evaluations, we use prefix completion to bypass model safeguards. This leads the LLMs to generate suffixes that express hostility toward humans or actions with severe threat, such as the execution of a nuclear strike. Our experiments on 10 LLMs reveal that LLM-generated content indicates existential threats. To investigate the underlying causes, we also analyze the attention logits from LLMs. To highlight real-world safety risks, we further develop a framework to assess model behavior in tool-calling. We find that LLMs actively select and invoke external tools with existential threats. Code and data are available at: this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting and its derivatives have achieved significant breakthroughs in large-scale scene reconstruction. However, how to efficiently and stably achieve high-quality geometric fidelity remains a core challenge. To address this issue, we introduce MetroGS, a novel Gaussian Splatting framework for efficient and robust reconstruction in complex urban environments. Our method is built upon a distributed 2D Gaussian Splatting representation as the core foundation, serving as a unified backbone for subsequent modules. To handle potential sparse regions in complex scenes, we propose a structured dense enhancement scheme that utilizes SfM priors and a pointmap model to achieve a denser initialization, while incorporating a sparsity compensation mechanism to improve reconstruction completeness. Furthermore, we design a progressive hybrid geometric optimization strategy that organically integrates monocular and multi-view optimization to achieve efficient and accurate geometric refinement. Finally, to address the appearance inconsistency commonly observed in large-scale scenes, we introduce a depth-guided appearance modeling approach that learns spatial features with 3D consistency, facilitating effective decoupling between geometry and appearance and further enhancing reconstruction stability. Experiments on large-scale urban datasets demonstrate that MetroGS achieves superior geometric accuracy, rendering quality, offering a unified solution for high-fidelity large-scale scene reconstruction.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Semantic segmentation is crucial for various biomedical applications, yet its reliance on large annotated datasets presents a bottleneck due to the high cost and specialized expertise required for manual labeling. Active Learning (AL) aims to mitigate this challenge by querying only the most informative samples, thereby reducing annotation effort. However, in the domain of 3D biomedical imaging, there is no consensus on whether AL consistently outperforms Random sampling. Four evaluation pitfalls hinder the current methodological assessment. These are (1) restriction to too few datasets and annotation budgets, (2) using 2D models on 3D images without partial annotations, (3) Random baseline not being adapted to the task, and (4) measuring annotation cost only in voxels. In this work, we introduce nnActive, an open-source AL framework that overcomes these pitfalls by (1) means of a large scale study spanning four biomedical imaging datasets and three label regimes, (2) extending nnU-Net by using partial annotations for training with 3D patch-based query selection, (3) proposing Foreground Aware Random sampling strategies tackling the foreground-background class imbalance of medical images and (4) propose the foreground efficiency metric, which captures the low annotation cost of background-regions. We reveal the following findings: (A) while all AL methods outperform standard Random sampling, none reliably surpasses an improved Foreground Aware Random sampling; (B) benefits of AL depend on task specific parameters; (C) Predictive Entropy is overall the best performing AL method, but likely requires the most annotation effort; (D) AL performance can be improved with more compute intensive design choices. As a holistic, open-source framework, nnActive can serve as a catalyst for research and application of AL in 3D biomedical imaging. Code is at: this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Surgical planning and training based on machine learning requires a large amount of 3D anatomical models reconstructed from medical imaging, which is currently one of the major bottlenecks. Obtaining these data from real patients and during surgery is very demanding, if even possible, due to legal, ethical, and technical challenges. It is especially difficult for soft tissue organs with poor imaging contrast, such as the prostate. To overcome these challenges, we present a novel workflow for automated 3D anatomical data generation using data obtained from physical organ models. We additionally use a 3D Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to obtain a manifold of 3D models useful for other downstream machine learning tasks that rely on 3D data. We demonstrate our workflow using an artificial prostate model made of biomimetic hydrogels with imaging contrast in multiple zones. This is used to physically simulate endoscopic surgery. For evaluation and 3D data generation, we place it into a customized ultrasound scanner that records the prostate before and after the procedure. A neural network is trained to segment the recorded ultrasound images, which outperforms conventional, non-learning-based computer vision techniques in terms of intersection over union (IoU). Based on the segmentations, a 3D mesh model is reconstructed, and performance feedback is provided.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text-to-motion generation, which synthesizes 3D human motions from text inputs, holds immense potential for applications in gaming, film, and robotics. Recently, diffusion-based methods have been shown to generate more diversity and realistic motion. However, there exists a misalignment between text and motion distributions in diffusion models, which leads to semantically inconsistent or low-quality motions. To address this limitation, we propose Reward-guided sampling Alignment (ReAlign), comprising a step-aware reward model to assess alignment quality during the denoising sampling and a reward-guided strategy that directs the diffusion process toward an optimally aligned distribution. This reward model integrates step-aware tokens and combines a text-aligned module for semantic consistency and a motion-aligned module for realism, refining noisy motions at each timestep to balance probability density and alignment. Extensive experiments of both motion generation and retrieval tasks demonstrate that our approach significantly improves text-motion alignment and motion quality compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>defense, attack, robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have developed rapidly in web services, delivering unprecedented capabilities while amplifying societal risks. Existing works tend to focus on either isolated jailbreak attacks or static defenses, neglecting the dynamic interplay between evolving threats and safeguards in real-world web contexts. To mitigate these challenges, we propose ACE-Safety (Adversarial Co-Evolution for LLM Safety), a novel framework that jointly optimize attack and defense models by seamlessly integrating two key innovative procedures: (1) Group-aware Strategy-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search (GS-MCTS), which efficiently explores jailbreak strategies to uncover vulnerabilities and generate diverse adversarial samples; (2) Adversarial Curriculum Tree-aware Group Policy Optimization (AC-TGPO), which jointly trains attack and defense LLMs with challenging samples via curriculum reinforcement learning, enabling robust mutual improvement. Evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing attack and defense approaches, and provides a feasible pathway for developing LLMs that can sustainably support responsible AI ecosystems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large vision language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance on medical visual question answering benchmarks, yet their reliance on visual information remains unclear. We investigate whether frontier VLMs demonstrate genuine visual grounding when answering Italian medical questions by testing four state-of-the-art models: Claude Sonnet 4.5, GPT-4o, GPT-5-mini, and Gemini 2.0 flash exp. Using 60 questions from the EuropeMedQA Italian dataset that explicitly require image interpretation, we substitute correct medical images with blank placeholders to test whether models truly integrate visual and textual information. Our results reveal striking variability in visual dependency: GPT-4o shows the strongest visual grounding with a 27.9pp accuracy drop (83.2% [74.6%, 91.7%] to 55.3% [44.1%, 66.6%]), while GPT-5-mini, Gemini, and Claude maintain high accuracy with modest drops of 8.5pp, 2.4pp, and 5.6pp respectively. Analysis of model-generated reasoning reveals confident explanations for fabricated visual interpretations across all models, suggesting varying degrees of reliance on textual shortcuts versus genuine visual analysis. These findings highlight critical differences in model robustness and the need for rigorous evaluation before clinical deployment.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Autonomous driving heavily relies on accurate and robust spatial perception. Many failures arise from inaccuracies and instability, especially in long-tail scenarios and complex interactions. However, current vision-language models are weak at spatial grounding and understanding, and VLA systems built on them therefore show limited perception and localization ability. To address these challenges, we introduce Percept-WAM, a perception-enhanced World-Awareness-Action Model that is the first to implicitly integrate 2D/3D scene understanding abilities within a single vision-language model (VLM). Instead of relying on QA-style spatial reasoning, Percept-WAM unifies 2D/3D perception tasks into World-PV and World-BEV tokens, which encode both spatial coordinates and confidence. We propose a grid-conditioned prediction mechanism for dense object perception, incorporating IoU-aware scoring and parallel autoregressive decoding, improving stability in long-tail, far-range, and small-object scenarios. Additionally, Percept-WAM leverages pretrained VLM parameters to retain general intelligence (e.g., logical reasoning) and can output perception results and trajectory control outputs directly. Experiments show that Percept-WAM matches or surpasses classical detectors and segmenters on downstream perception benchmarks, achieving 51.7/58.9 mAP on COCO 2D detection and nuScenes BEV 3D detection. When integrated with trajectory decoders, it further improves planning performance on nuScenes and NAVSIM, e.g., surpassing DiffusionDrive by 2.1 in PMDS on NAVSIM. Qualitative results further highlight its strong open-vocabulary and long-tail generalization.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion Transformer(DiT) based video generation models have recently achieved impressive visual quality and temporal coherence, but they still frequently violate basic physical laws and commonsense dynamics, revealing a lack of explicit world knowledge. In this work, we explore how to equip them with a plug-and-play memory that injects useful world knowledge. Motivated by in-context memory in Transformer-based LLMs, we conduct empirical studies to show that DiT can be steered via interventions on its hidden states, and simple low-pass and high-pass filters in the embedding space naturally disentangle low-level appearance and high-level physical/semantic cues, enabling targeted guidance. Building on these observations, we propose a learnable memory encoder DiT-Mem, composed of stacked 3D CNNs, low-/high-pass filters, and self-attention layers. The encoder maps reference videos into a compact set of memory tokens, which are concatenated as the memory within the DiT self-attention layers. During training, we keep the diffusion backbone frozen, and only optimize the memory encoder. It yields a rather efficient training process on few training parameters (150M) and 10K data samples, and enables plug-and-play usage at inference time. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art models demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in improving physical rule following and video fidelity.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>How and where does a transformer notice that a sentence has gone semantically off the rails? To explore this question, we evaluated the causal language model (phi-2) using a carefully curated corpus, with sentences that concluded plausibly or implausibly. Our analysis focused on the hidden states sampled at each model layer. To investigate how violations are encoded, we utilized two complementary probes. First, we conducted a per-layer detection using a linear probe. Our findings revealed that a simple linear decoder struggled to distinguish between plausible and implausible endings in the lowest third of the model's layers. However, its accuracy sharply increased in the middle blocks, reaching a peak just before the top layers. Second, we examined the effective dimensionality of the encoded violation. Initially, the violation widens the representational subspace, followed by a collapse after a mid-stack bottleneck. This might indicate an exploratory phase that transitions into rapid consolidation. Taken together, these results contemplate the idea of alignment with classical psycholinguistic findings in human reading, where semantic anomalies are detected only after syntactic resolution, occurring later in the online processing sequence.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Many real-world bandit problems involve non-stationary reward distributions, where the optimal decision may shift due to evolving environments. However, the performance of some typical Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) models such as Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithms degrades significantly in non-stationary environments where reward distributions change over time. To address this limitation, this paper introduces and evaluates FDSW-UCB, a novel dual-view algorithm that integrates a discount-based long-term perspective with a sliding-window-based short-term view. A data-driven semi-synthetic simulation platform, built upon the MovieLens-1M and Open Bandit datasets, is developed to test algorithm adaptability under abrupt and gradual drift scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that a well-configured sliding-window mechanism (SW-UCB) is robust, while the widely used discounting method (D-UCB) suffers from a fundamental learning failure, leading to linear regret. Crucially, the proposed FDSW-UCB, when employing an optimistic aggregation strategy, achieves superior performance in dynamic settings, highlighting that the ensemble strategy itself is a decisive factor for success.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, attack, robust, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Test-time personalization in federated learning enables models at clients to adjust online to local domain shifts, enhancing robustness and personalization in deployment. Yet, existing federated learning work largely overlooks the security risks that arise when local adaptation occurs at test time. Heterogeneous domain arrivals, diverse adaptation algorithms, and limited cross-client visibility create vulnerabilities where compromised participants can craft poisoned inputs and submit adversarial updates that undermine both global and per-client performance. To address this threat, we introduce FedPoisonTTP, a realistic grey-box attack framework that explores test-time data poisoning in the federated adaptation setting. FedPoisonTTP distills a surrogate model from adversarial queries, synthesizes in-distribution poisons using feature-consistency, and optimizes attack objectives to generate high-entropy or class-confident poisons that evade common adaptation filters. These poisons are injected during local adaptation and spread through collaborative updates, leading to broad degradation. Extensive experiments on corrupted vision benchmarks show that compromised participants can substantially diminish overall test-time performance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) faces two major design bottlenecks: crafting dense reward functions and constructing curricula that avoid local optima in high-dimensional, non-stationary environments. Existing approaches rely on fixed heuristics or use Large Language Models (LLMs) directly in the control loop, which is costly and unsuitable for real-time systems. We propose MAESTRO (Multi-Agent Environment Shaping through Task and Reward Optimization), a framework that moves the LLM outside the execution loop and uses it as an offline training architect. MAESTRO introduces two generative components: (i) a semantic curriculum generator that creates diverse, performance-driven traffic scenarios, and (ii) an automated reward synthesizer that produces executable Python reward functions adapted to evolving curriculum difficulty. These components guide a standard MARL backbone (MADDPG) without increasing inference cost at deployment. We evaluate MAESTRO on large-scale traffic signal control (Hangzhou, 16 intersections) and conduct controlled ablations. Results show that combining LLM-generated curricula with LLM-generated reward shaping yields improved performance and stability. Across four seeds, the full system achieves +4.0% higher mean return (163.26 vs. 156.93) and 2.2% better risk-adjusted performance (Sharpe 1.53 vs. 0.70) over a strong curriculum baseline. These findings highlight LLMs as effective high-level designers for cooperative MARL training.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Computer vision systems are increasingly adopted in modern logistics operations, including the estimation of trailer occupancy for planning, routing, and billing. Although effective, such systems may be vulnerable to physical adversarial attacks, particularly adversarial patches that can be printed and placed on interior surfaces. In this work, we study the feasibility of such attacks on a convolutional cargo-occupancy classifier using fully simulated 3D environments. Using Mitsuba 3 for differentiable rendering, we optimize patch textures across variations in geometry, lighting, and viewpoint, and compare their effectiveness to a 2D compositing baseline. Our experiments demonstrate that 3D-optimized patches achieve high attack success rates, especially in a denial-of-service scenario (empty to full), where success reaches 84.94 percent. Concealment attacks (full to empty) prove more challenging but still reach 30.32 percent. We analyze the factors influencing attack success, discuss implications for the security of automated logistics pipelines, and highlight directions for strengthening physical robustness. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate adversarial patch attacks for cargo-occupancy estimation in physically realistic, fully simulated 3D scenes.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the rapid advancement of retrieval-augmented vision-language models, multimodal medical retrieval-augmented generation (MMed-RAG) systems are increasingly adopted in clinical decision support. These systems enhance medical applications by performing cross-modal retrieval to integrate relevant visual and textual evidence for tasks, e.g., report generation and disease diagnosis. However, their complex architecture also introduces underexplored adversarial vulnerabilities, particularly via visual input perturbations. In this paper, we propose Medusa, a novel framework for crafting cross-modal transferable adversarial attacks on MMed-RAG systems under a black-box setting. Specifically, Medusa formulates the attack as a perturbation optimization problem, leveraging a multi-positive InfoNCE loss (MPIL) to align adversarial visual embeddings with medically plausible but malicious textual targets, thereby hijacking the retrieval process. To enhance transferability, we adopt a surrogate model ensemble and design a dual-loop optimization strategy augmented with invariant risk minimization (IRM). Extensive experiments on two real-world medical tasks, including medical report generation and disease diagnosis, demonstrate that Medusa achieves over 90% average attack success rate across various generation models and retrievers under appropriate parameter configuration, while remaining robust against four mainstream defenses, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Our results reveal critical vulnerabilities in the MMed-RAG systems and highlight the necessity of robustness benchmarking in safety-critical medical applications.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative Flow Networks, or GFlowNets, offer a promising framework for molecular design, but their internal decision policies remain opaque. This limits adoption in drug discovery, where chemists require clear and interpretable rationales for proposed structures. We present an interpretability framework for SynFlowNet, a GFlowNet trained on documented chemical reactions and purchasable starting materials that generates both molecules and the synthetic routes that produce them. Our approach integrates three complementary components. Gradient based saliency combined with counterfactual perturbations identifies which atomic environments influence reward and how structural edits change molecular outcomes. Sparse autoencoders reveal axis aligned latent factors that correspond to physicochemical properties such as polarity, lipophilicity, and molecular size. Motif probes show that functional groups including aromatic rings and halogens are explicitly encoded and linearly decodable from the internal embeddings. Together, these results expose the chemical logic inside SynFlowNet and provide actionable and mechanistic insight that supports transparent and controllable molecular design.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The black box nature of deep neural networks poses a significant challenge for the deployment of transparent and trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI) systems. With the growing presence of AI in society, it becomes increasingly important to develop methods that can explain and interpret the decisions made by these systems. To address this, mechanistic interpretability (MI) emerged as a promising and distinctive research program within the broader field of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). MI is the process of studying the inner computations of neural networks and translating them into human-understandable algorithms. It encompasses reverse engineering techniques aimed at uncovering the computational algorithms implemented by neural networks. In this article, we propose a unified taxonomy of MI approaches and provide a detailed analysis of key techniques, illustrated with concrete examples and pseudo-code. We contextualize MI within the broader interpretability landscape, comparing its goals, methods, and insights to other strands of XAI. Additionally, we trace the development of MI as a research area, highlighting its conceptual roots and the accelerating pace of recent work. We argue that MI holds significant potential to support a more scientific understanding of machine learning systems -- treating models not only as tools for solving tasks, but also as systems to be studied and understood. We hope to invite new researchers into the field of mechanistic interpretability.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This work evaluates the effectiveness of spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for multi-store retail sales forecasting and compares their performance against ARIMA, LSTM, and XGBoost baselines. Using weekly sales data from 45 Walmart stores, we construct a relational forecasting framework that models inter-store dependencies through a learned adaptive graph. The proposed STGNN predicts log-differenced sales and reconstructs final values through a residual path, enabling stable training and improved generalisation. Experiments show that STGNN achieves the lowest overall forecasting error, outperforming all baselines in Normalised Total Absolute Error, P90 MAPE, and variance of MAPE across stores. Analysis of the learned adjacency matrix reveals meaningful functional store clusters and high-influence nodes that emerge without geographic metadata. These results demonstrate that relational structure significantly improves forecast quality in interconnected retail environments and establishes STGNNs as a robust modelling choice for multi-store demand prediction.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Conditional image generation enhances text-to-image synthesis with structural, spatial, or stylistic priors, but current methods face challenges in handling conflicts between sources. These include 1) input-level conflicts, where the conditioning image contradicts the text prompt, and 2) model-bias conflicts, where generative biases disrupt alignment even when conditions match the text. Addressing these conflicts requires nuanced solutions, which standard supervised fine-tuning struggles to provide. Preference-based optimization techniques like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) show promise but are limited by gradient entanglement between text and condition signals and lack disentangled training data for multi-constraint tasks. To overcome this, we propose a bidirectionally decoupled DPO framework (BideDPO). Our method creates two disentangled preference pairs-one for the condition and one for the text-to reduce gradient entanglement. The influence of pairs is managed using an Adaptive Loss Balancing strategy for balanced optimization. We introduce an automated data pipeline to sample model outputs and generate conflict-aware data. This process is embedded in an iterative optimization strategy that refines both the model and the data. We construct a DualAlign benchmark to evaluate conflict resolution between text and condition. Experiments show BideDPO significantly improves text success rates (e.g., +35%) and condition adherence. We also validate our approach using the COCO dataset. Project Pages: this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) offer a promising parallel generation paradigm but suffer from slow inference due to numerous refinement steps and the inability to use standard KV caching. We introduce CDLM (Consistency Diffusion Language Models), a training-based acceleration method that simultaneously tackles both bottlenecks. CDLM integrates consistency modeling to drastically reduce the number of required sampling steps by enabling multi-token finalization. Furthermore, we enforce a block-wise causal attention mask during fine-tuning, making the model fully compatible with KV caching. Experiments show CDLM achieves 3.6x-14.5x lower latency while maintaining competitive accuracy on math and coding tasks. The full training and evaluation code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Existing core-set selection methods predominantly rely on heuristic scoring signals such as training dynamics or model uncertainty, lacking explicit modeling of data likelihood. This omission may hinder the constructed subset from capturing subtle yet critical distributional structures that underpin effective model training. In this work, we propose a novel, theoretically grounded approach that leverages diffusion models to estimate data likelihood via reconstruction deviation induced by partial reverse denoising. Specifically, we establish a formal connection between reconstruction error and data likelihood, grounded in the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) of Markovian diffusion processes, thereby enabling a principled, distribution-aware scoring criterion for data selection. Complementarily, we introduce an efficient information-theoretic method to identify the optimal reconstruction timestep, ensuring that the deviation provides a reliable signal indicative of underlying data likelihood. Extensive experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that reconstruction deviation offers an effective scoring criterion, consistently outperforming existing baselines across selection ratios, and closely matching full-data training using only 50% of the data. Further analysis shows that the likelihood-informed nature of our score reveals informative insights in data selection, shedding light on the interplay between data distributional characteristics and model learning preferences.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present ReMatch, a framework that leverages the generative strength of MLLMs for multimodal retrieval. Previous approaches treated an MLLM as a simple encoder, ignoring its generative nature, and under-utilising its compositional reasoning and world knowledge. We instead train the embedding MLLM end-to-end with a chat-style generative matching stage. The matching stage uses the same MLLM to autoregressively decide relevance from multi-view inputs, including both raw data and its own projected embeddings for each query and document. It provides instance-wise discrimination supervision that complements a standard contrastive loss, offering stronger gradients on hard negatives and preserving the compositional strengths of the original MLLM. To obtain semantically richer multimodal embeddings, we use multiple learnable tokens to augment each input, generating fine-grained contextual, mutually orthogonal embeddings with low inference cost. Leveraging our established high-performance baseline,we assemble the ideas mentioned above into a powerful training recipe and achieve a new state-of-the-art on the Massive Multimodal Embedding Benchmark (MMEB). Our experiments show particularly strong zero-shot generalization results on five datasets, highlighting the robustness and transferability of ReMatch.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>A cognitive map is an internal model which encodes the abstract relationships among entities in the world, giving humans and animals the flexibility to adapt to new situations, with a strong out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization that current AI systems still do not possess. To bridge this gap, we introduce MapFormers, new architectures based on Transformer models, which can learn cognitive maps from observational data and perform path integration in parallel, in a self-supervised manner. Cognitive maps are learned in the model by disentangling structural relationships in the inputs from their specific content, a property that can be achieved naturally by updating the positional encoding in Transformers with input-dependent matrices. We developed two variants of MapFormers that unify absolute and relative positional encoding to model episodic (EM) and working memory (WM), respectively. We tested MapFormers on several tasks, including a classic 2D navigation task, showing that our models can learn a cognitive map of the underlying space and generalize OOD (e.g., to longer sequences) with near-perfect performance, unlike current architectures. Together, these results demonstrate the superiority of models designed to learn a cognitive map, and the importance of introducing a structural bias for structure-content disentanglement, which can be achieved in Transformers with input-dependent positional encoding. MapFormers have broad applications in both neuroscience and AI, by explaining the neural mechanisms giving rise to cognitive maps, while allowing these relation models to be learned at scale.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Novel deep learning architectures are increasingly being applied to biological data, including genetic sequences. These models, referred to as genomic language mod- els (gLMs), have demonstrated impressive predictive and generative capabilities, raising concerns that such models may also enable misuse, for instance via the generation of genomes for human-infecting viruses. These concerns have catalyzed calls for risk mitigation measures. The de facto mitigation of choice is filtering of pretraining data (i.e., removing viral genomic sequences from training datasets) in order to limit gLM performance on virus-related tasks. However, it is not currently known how robust this approach is for securing open-source models that can be fine-tuned using sensitive pathogen data. Here, we evaluate a state-of-the-art gLM, Evo 2, and perform fine-tuning using sequences from 110 harmful human-infecting viruses to assess the rescue of misuse-relevant predictive capabilities. The fine- tuned model exhibited reduced perplexity on unseen viral sequences relative to 1) the pretrained model and 2) a version fine-tuned on bacteriophage sequences. The model fine-tuned on human-infecting viruses also identified immune escape variants from SARS-CoV-2 (achieving an AUROC of 0.6), despite having no expo- sure to SARS-CoV-2 sequences during fine-tuning. This work demonstrates that data exclusion might be circumvented by fine-tuning approaches that can, to some degree, rescue misuse-relevant capabilities of gLMs. We highlight the need for safety frameworks for gLMs and outline further work needed on evaluations and mitigation measures to enable the safe deployment of gLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, robust, watermark, diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent fine-tuning techniques for diffusion models enable them to reproduce specific image sets, such as particular faces or artistic styles, but also introduce copyright and security risks. Dataset watermarking has been proposed to ensure traceability by embedding imperceptible watermarks into training images, which remain detectable in outputs even after fine-tuning. However, current methods lack a unified evaluation framework. To address this, this paper establishes a general threat model and introduces a comprehensive evaluation framework encompassing Universality, Transmissibility, and Robustness. Experiments show that existing methods perform well in universality and transmissibility, and exhibit some robustness against common image processing operations, yet still fall short under real-world threat scenarios. To reveal these vulnerabilities, the paper further proposes a practical watermark removal method that fully eliminates dataset watermarks without affecting fine-tuning, highlighting a key challenge for future research.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This study developed a new Bangla abstractive summarization dataset to generate concise summaries of Bangla articles from diverse sources. Most existing studies in this field have concentrated on news articles, where journalists usually follow a fixed writing style. While such approaches are effective in limited contexts, they often fail to adapt to the varied nature of real-world Bangla texts. In today's digital era, a massive amount of Bangla content is continuously produced across blogs, newspapers, and social media. This creates a pressing need for summarization systems that can reduce information overload and help readers understand content more quickly. To address this challenge, we developed a dataset of over 54,000 Bangla articles and summaries collected from multiple sources, including blogs such as Cinegolpo and newspapers such as Samakal and The Business Standard. Unlike single-domain resources, our dataset spans multiple domains and writing styles. It offers greater adaptability and practical relevance. To establish strong baselines, we trained and evaluated this dataset using several deep learning and transfer learning models, including LSTM, BanglaT5-small, and MTS-small. The results highlight its potential as a benchmark for future research in Bangla natural language processing. This dataset provides a solid foundation for building robust summarization systems and helps expand NLP resources for low-resource languages.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Hand-Object Interaction (HOI) generation plays a critical role in advancing applications across animation and robotics. Current video-based methods are predominantly single-view, which impedes comprehensive 3D geometry perception and often results in geometric distortions or unrealistic motion patterns. While 3D HOI approaches can generate dynamically plausible motions, their dependence on high-quality 3D data captured in controlled laboratory settings severely limits their generalization to real-world scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we introduce SyncMV4D, the first model that jointly generates synchronized multi-view HOI videos and 4D motions by unifying visual prior, motion dynamics, and multi-view geometry. Our framework features two core innovations: (1) a Multi-view Joint Diffusion (MJD) model that co-generates HOI videos and intermediate motions, and (2) a Diffusion Points Aligner (DPA) that refines the coarse intermediate motion into globally aligned 4D metric point tracks. To tightly couple 2D appearance with 4D dynamics, we establish a closed-loop, mutually enhancing cycle. During the diffusion denoising process, the generated video conditions the refinement of the 4D motion, while the aligned 4D point tracks are reprojected to guide next-step joint generation. Experimentally, our method demonstrates superior performance to state-of-the-art alternatives in visual realism, motion plausibility, and multi-view consistency.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Preserving first-frame identity while ensuring precise motion control is a fundamental challenge in human image animation. The Image-to-Motion Binding process of the dominant Reference-to-Video (R2V) paradigm overlooks critical spatio-temporal misalignments common in real-world applications, leading to failures such as identity drift and visual artifacts. We introduce SteadyDancer, an Image-to-Video (I2V) paradigm-based framework that achieves harmonized and coherent animation and is the first to ensure first-frame preservation robustly. Firstly, we propose a Condition-Reconciliation Mechanism to harmonize the two conflicting conditions, enabling precise control without sacrificing fidelity. Secondly, we design Synergistic Pose Modulation Modules to generate an adaptive and coherent pose representation that is highly compatible with the reference image. Finally, we employ a Staged Decoupled-Objective Training Pipeline that hierarchically optimizes the model for motion fidelity, visual quality, and temporal coherence. Experiments demonstrate that SteadyDancer achieves state-of-the-art performance in both appearance fidelity and motion control, while requiring significantly fewer training resources than comparable methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Reconstructing biomechanically realistic 3D human motion - recovering both kinematics (motion) and kinetics (forces) - is a critical challenge. While marker-based systems are lab-bound and slow, popular monocular methods use oversimplified, anatomically inaccurate models (e.g., SMPL) and ignore physics, fundamentally limiting their biomechanical fidelity. In this work, we introduce MonoMSK, a hybrid framework that bridges data-driven learning and physics-based simulation for biomechanically realistic 3D human motion estimation from monocular video. MonoMSK jointly recovers both kinematics (motions) and kinetics (forces and torques) through an anatomically accurate musculoskeletal model. By integrating transformer-based inverse dynamics with differentiable forward kinematics and dynamics layers governed by ODE-based simulation, MonoMSK establishes a physics-regulated inverse-forward loop that enforces biomechanical causality and physical plausibility. A novel forward-inverse consistency loss further aligns motion reconstruction with the underlying kinetic reasoning. Experiments on BML-MoVi, BEDLAM, and OpenCap show that MonoMSK significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in kinematic accuracy, while for the first time enabling precise monocular kinetics estimation.</li>

We train a small decoder-only transformer on three task variants: 1) inferring missing rules from partial contextual information, 2) composing simple rules to solve multi-step sequences, and 3) decomposing complex multi-step examples to infer intermediate steps. By factorizing each task into interpretable events, we show that the model acquires capabilities in discrete stages, first learning the coarse grained rules, before learning the complete latent structure. We also identify a crucial asymmetry, where the model can compose fundamental rules robustly, but struggles to decompose complex examples to discover the fundamental rules. These findings offer new insights into understanding how a transformer model learns latent structures, providing a granular view of how these capabilities evolve during training.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>A common method of attacking deep learning models is through adversarial attacks, which occur when an attacker specifically modifies the input of a model to produce an incorrect result. Adversarial attacks have been deeply investigated in the image domain; however, there is less research in the time-series domain and very little for forecasting financial data. To address these concerns, this study aims to build upon previous research on adversarial attacks for time-series data by introducing two new slope-based methods aimed to alter the trends of the predicted stock forecast generated by an N-HiTS model. Compared to the normal N-HiTS predictions, the two new slope-based methods, the General Slope Attack and Least-Squares Slope Attack, can manipulate N-HiTS predictions by doubling the slope. These new slope attacks can bypass standard security mechanisms, such as a discriminator that filters real and perturbed inputs, reducing a 4-layered CNN's specificity to 28% and accuracy to 57%. Furthermore, the slope based methods were incorporated into a GAN architecture as a means of generating realistic synthetic data, while simultaneously fooling the model. Finally, this paper also proposes a sample malware designed to inject an adversarial attack in the model inference library, proving that ML-security research should not only focus on making the model safe, but also securing the entire pipeline.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Test-time scaling, which leverages additional computation during inference to improve model accuracy, has enabled a new class of Large Language Models (LLMs) that are able to reason through complex problems by understanding the goal, turning this goal into a plan, working through intermediate steps, and checking their own work before answering . Frontier large language models with reasoning capabilities, such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI's gpt-oss, follow the same procedure when solving complex problems by generating intermediate reasoning traces before giving the final answer. Today, these models are being increasingly used to generate reasoning traces that serve as high-quality supervised data for post-training of small and medium-sized language models to teach reasoning capabilities without requiring expensive human curation. In this work, we compare the performance of medium-sized LLMs on Math problems after post-training on two kinds of reasoning traces. We compare the impact of reasoning traces generated by DeepSeek-R1 and gpt-oss LLMs in terms of accuracy and inference efficiency.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Accurate cell counting is essential in various biomedical research and clinical applications, including cancer diagnosis, stem cell research, and immunology. Manual counting is labor-intensive and error-prone, motivating automation through deep learning techniques. However, training reliable deep learning models requires large amounts of high-quality annotated data, which is difficult and time-consuming to produce manually. Consequently, existing cell-counting datasets are often limited, frequently containing fewer than $500$ images. In this work, we introduce a large-scale annotated dataset comprising $3{,}023$ images from immunocytochemistry experiments related to cellular differentiation, containing over $430{,}000$ manually annotated cell locations. The dataset presents significant challenges: high cell density, overlapping and morphologically diverse cells, a long-tailed distribution of cell count per image, and variation in staining protocols. We benchmark three categories of existing methods: regression-based, crowd-counting, and cell-counting techniques on a test set with cell counts ranging from $10$ to $2{,}126$ cells per image. We also evaluate how the Segment Anything Model (SAM) can be adapted for microscopy cell counting using only dot-annotated datasets. As a case study, we implement a density-map-based adaptation of SAM (SAM-Counter) and report a mean absolute error (MAE) of $22.12$, which outperforms existing approaches (second-best MAE of $27.46$). Our results underscore the value of the dataset and the benchmarking framework for driving progress in automated cell counting and provide a robust foundation for future research and development.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The challenge of designing effective reward functions in reinforcement learning (RL) represents a significant bottleneck, often requiring extensive human expertise and being time-consuming. Previous work and recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential for automating the generation of reward functions. However, existing methodologies often require preliminary evaluation metrics, human-engineered feedback for the refinement process, or the use of environmental source code as context. To address these limitations, this paper introduces LEARN-Opt (LLM-based Evaluator and Analyzer for Reward functioN Optimization). This LLM-based, fully autonomous, and model-agnostic framework eliminates the need for preliminary metrics and environmental source code as context to generate, execute, and evaluate reward function candidates from textual descriptions of systems and task objectives. LEARN-Opt's main contribution lies in its ability to autonomously derive performance metrics directly from the system description and the task objective, enabling unsupervised evaluation and selection of reward functions. Our experiments indicate that LEARN-Opt achieves performance comparable to or better to that of state-of-the-art methods, such as EUREKA, while requiring less prior knowledge. We find that automated reward design is a high-variance problem, where the average-case candidate fails, requiring a multi-run approach to find the best candidates. Finally, we show that LEARN-Opt can unlock the potential of low-cost LLMs to find high-performing candidates that are comparable to, or even better than, those of larger models. This demonstrated performance affirms its potential to generate high-quality reward functions without requiring any preliminary human-defined metrics, thereby reducing engineering overhead and enhancing generalizability.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Pixel diffusion aims to generate images directly in pixel space in an end-to-end fashion. This approach avoids the limitations of VAE in the two-stage latent diffusion, offering higher model capacity. Existing pixel diffusion models suffer from slow training and inference, as they usually model both high-frequency signals and low-frequency semantics within a single diffusion transformer (DiT). To pursue a more efficient pixel diffusion paradigm, we propose the frequency-DeCoupled pixel diffusion framework. With the intuition to decouple the generation of high and low frequency components, we leverage a lightweight pixel decoder to generate high-frequency details conditioned on semantic guidance from the DiT. This thus frees the DiT to specialize in modeling low-frequency semantics. In addition, we introduce a frequency-aware flow-matching loss that emphasizes visually salient frequencies while suppressing insignificant ones. Extensive experiments show that DeCo achieves superior performance among pixel diffusion models, attaining FID of 1.62 (256x256) and 2.22 (512x512) on ImageNet, closing the gap with latent diffusion methods. Furthermore, our pretrained text-to-image model achieves a leading overall score of 0.86 on GenEval in system-level comparison. Codes are publicly available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Accurate lung cancer tumor staging is crucial for prognosis and treatment planning. However, it remains challenging for end-to-end deep learning approaches, as such approaches often overlook spatial and anatomical information that are central to the tumor-node-metastasis system. The tumor stage depends on multiple quantitative criteria, including the tumor size and its proximity to the nearest anatomical structures, and small variations can alter the staging outcome. We propose a medically grounded hybrid pipeline that performs staging by explicitly measuring the tumor's size and distance properties rather than treating it as a pure image classification task. Our method employs specialized encoder-decoder networks to precisely segment the lung and adjacent anatomy, including the lobes, tumor, mediastinum, and diaphragm. Subsequently, we extract the necessary tumor properties, i.e. measure the largest tumor dimension and calculate the distance between the tumor and neighboring anatomical structures by a quantitative analysis of the segmentation masks. Finally, we apply rule-based tumor staging aligned with the medical guidelines. This novel framework has been evaluated on the Lung-PET-CT-Dx dataset, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional deep learning models, achieving an overall classification accuracy of 91.36%. We report the per-stage F1-scores of 0.93 (T1), 0.89 (T2), 0.96 (T3), and 0.90 (T4), a critical evaluation aspect often omitted in prior literature. To our knowledge, this is the first study that embeds explicit clinical context into tumor stage classification. Unlike standard convolutional neural networks that operate in an uninterpretable "black box" manner, our method offers both state-of-the-art performance and transparent decision support.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has been increasingly adopted in many real-world applications. While MARL enables decentralized deployment on resource-constrained edge devices, it suffers from severe non-stationarity due to the synchronous updates of agent policies. This non stationarity results in unstable training and poor policy con vergence, especially as the number of agents increases. In this paper, we propose RELED, a scalable MARL framework that integrates large language model (LLM)-driven expert demonstrations with autonomous agent exploration. RELED incorporates a Stationarity-Aware Expert Demonstration module, which leverages theoretical non-stationarity bounds to enhance the quality of LLM-generated expert trajectories, thus providing high reward and training-stable samples for each agent. Moreover, a Hybrid Expert-Agent Policy Optimization module adaptively balances each agent's learning from both expert-generated and agent-generated trajectories, accelerating policy convergence and improving generalization. Extensive experiments with real city networks based on OpenStreetMap demonstrate that RELED achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art MARL methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have established a new state-of-the-art in generative image synthesis, yet their deployment is hindered by significant computational overhead during inference, often requiring up to 1,000 iterative steps. This study presents a rigorous comparative analysis of DDPMs against the emerging Flow Matching (Rectified Flow) paradigm, specifically isolating their geometric and efficiency properties on low-resource hardware. By implementing both frameworks on a shared Time-Conditioned U-Net backbone using the MNIST dataset, we demonstrate that Flow Matching significantly outperforms Diffusion in efficiency. Our geometric analysis reveals that Flow Matching learns a highly rectified transport path (Curvature $\mathcal{C} \approx 1.02$), which is near-optimal, whereas Diffusion trajectories remain stochastic and tortuous ($\mathcal{C} \approx 3.45$). Furthermore, we establish an ``efficiency frontier'' at $N=10$ function evaluations, where Flow Matching retains high fidelity while Diffusion collapses. Finally, we show via numerical sensitivity analysis that the learned vector field is sufficiently linear to render high-order ODE solvers (Runge-Kutta 4) unnecessary, validating the use of lightweight Euler solvers for edge deployment. \textbf{This work concludes that Flow Matching is the superior algorithmic choice for real-time, resource-constrained generative tasks.}</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Conditional diffusion models provide a natural framework for probabilistic prediction of dynamical systems and have been successfully applied to fluid dynamics and weather prediction. However, in many settings, the available information at a given time represents only a small fraction of what is needed to predict future states, either due to measurement uncertainty or because only a small fraction of the state can be observed. This is true for example in solar physics, where we can observe the Sun's surface and atmosphere, but its evolution is driven by internal processes for which we lack direct measurements. In this paper, we tackle the probabilistic prediction of partially observable, long-memory dynamical systems, with applications to solar dynamics and the evolution of active regions. We show that standard inference schemes, such as autoregressive rollouts, fail to capture long-range dependencies in the data, largely because they do not integrate past information effectively. To overcome this, we propose a multiscale inference scheme for diffusion models, tailored to physical processes. Our method generates trajectories that are temporally fine-grained near the present and coarser as we move farther away, which enables capturing long-range temporal dependencies without increasing computational cost. When integrated into a diffusion model, we show that our inference scheme significantly reduces the bias of the predicted distributions and improves rollout stability.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Segmenting small lesions in medical images remains notoriously difficult. Most prior work tackles this challenge by either designing better architectures, loss functions, or data augmentation schemes; and collecting more labeled data. We take a different view, arguing that part of the problem lies in how the background is modeled. Common lesion segmentation collapses all non-lesion pixels into a single "background" class, ignoring the rich anatomical context in which lesions appear. In reality, the background is highly heterogeneous-composed of tissues, organs, and other structures that can now be labeled manually or inferred automatically using existing segmentation models. In this paper, we argue that training with fine-grained labels that sub-divide the background class, which we call BackSplit, is a simple yet powerful paradigm that can offer a significant performance boost without increasing inference costs. From an information theoretic standpoint, we prove that BackSplit increases the expected Fisher Information relative to conventional binary training, leading to tighter asymptotic bounds and more stable optimization. With extensive experiments across multiple datasets and architectures, we empirically show that BackSplit consistently boosts small-lesion segmentation performance, even when auxiliary labels are generated automatically using pretrained segmentation models. Additionally, we demonstrate that auxiliary labels derived from interactive segmentation frameworks exhibit the same beneficial effect, demonstrating its robustness, simplicity, and broad applicability.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large-scale video generative models have recently demonstrated strong visual capabilities, enabling the prediction of future frames that adhere to the logical and physical cues in the current observation. In this work, we investigate whether such capabilities can be harnessed for controllable image-to-video generation by interpreting visual signals embedded within the frames as instructions, a paradigm we term In-Video Instruction. In contrast to prompt-based control, which provides textual descriptions that are inherently global and coarse, In-Video Instruction encodes user guidance directly into the visual domain through elements such as overlaid text, arrows, or trajectories. This enables explicit, spatial-aware, and unambiguous correspondences between visual subjects and their intended actions by assigning distinct instructions to different objects. Extensive experiments on three state-of-the-art generators, including Veo 3.1, Kling 2.5, and Wan 2.2, show that video models can reliably interpret and execute such visually embedded instructions, particularly in complex multi-object scenarios.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As agentic AI becomes more widespread, agents with distinct and possibly conflicting goals will interact in complex ways. These multi-agent interactions pose a fundamental challenge, particularly in social dilemmas, where agents' individual incentives can undermine collective welfare. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been effective for aligning large language models (LLMs) in the single-agent regime, prior small-network results suggest that standard RL in multi-agent settings often converges to defecting, self-interested policies. We show the same effect in LLMs: despite cooperative priors, RL-trained LLM agents develop opportunistic behavior that can exploit even advanced closed-source models. To address this tendency of RL to converge to poor equilibria, we adapt a recent opponent-learning awareness algorithm, Advantage Alignment, to fine-tune LLMs toward multi-agent cooperation and non-exploitability. We then introduce a group-relative baseline that simplifies advantage computation in iterated games, enabling multi-agent training at LLM scale. We also contribute a novel social dilemma environment, Trust and Split, which requires natural language communication to achieve high collective welfare. Across a wide range of social dilemmas, policies learned with Advantage Alignment achieve higher collective payoffs while remaining robust against exploitation by greedy agents.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) have shown impressive performance in both understanding and generation with a single architecture. However, UMMs still exhibit a fundamental inconsistency: understanding favors compact embeddings, whereas generation favors reconstruction-rich representations. This structural trade-off produces misaligned decision boundaries, degraded cross-modal coherence, and heightened vulnerability under distributional and adversarial shifts. In this paper, we present UniGame, a self-adversarial post-training framework that directly targets the inconsistencies. By applying a lightweight perturber at the shared token interface, UniGame enables the generation branch to actively seek and challenge fragile understanding, turning the model itself into its own adversary. Experiments demonstrate that UniGame significantly improves the consistency (+4.6%). Moreover, it also achieves substantial improvements in understanding (+3.6%), generation (+0.02), out-of-distribution and adversarial robustness (+4.8% and +6.2% on NaturalBench and AdVQA). The framework is architecture-agnostic, introduces less than 1% additional parameters, and is complementary to existing post-training methods. These results position adversarial self-play as a general and effective principle for enhancing the coherence, stability, and unified competence of future multimodal foundation models.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in challenging, knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks. However, extending LLMs to perceive and reason over a new modality (e.g., vision), often requires costly development of large-scale vision language models (VLMs) with LLMs as backbones. Smaller VLMs are more efficient and adaptable but often lack the broad knowledge and reasoning capabilities of frontier LLMs. In this work, we propose BeMyEyes, a modular, multi-agent framework for extending LLMs to multimodal reasoning by orchestrating collaboration between efficient, adaptable VLMs as perceivers and powerful LLMs as reasoners through conversations. We then introduce a data synthesis and supervised fine-tuning pipeline to train the perceiver agent to effectively collaborate with the reasoner agent. By combining the complementary strengths of perception and reasoning agents, BeMyEyes avoids the need for training large-scale multimodal models, preserves the generalization and reasoning capabilities of LLMs, and allows flexible extension to new domains and modalities. Experiments show that our framework unlocks the multimodal reasoning capabilities for LLMs, enabling a lightweight and fully open-source solution, i.e. equipping text-only DeepSeek-R1 with Qwen2.5-VL-7B perceiver, to outperform large-scale proprietary VLMs such as GPT-4o on a wide range of knowledge-intensive multimodal tasks. These results demonstrate the effectiveness, modularity, and scalability of our multi-agent approach for building future multimodal reasoning systems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at reasoning in linguistic space but struggle with perceptual understanding that requires dense visual perception, e.g., spatial reasoning and geometric awareness. This limitation stems from the fact that current VLMs have limited mechanisms to capture dense visual information across spatial dimensions. We introduce Chain-of-Visual-Thought (COVT), a framework that enables VLMs to reason not only in words but also through continuous visual tokens-compact latent representations that encode rich perceptual cues. Within a small budget of roughly 20 tokens, COVT distills knowledge from lightweight vision experts, capturing complementary properties such as 2D appearance, 3D geometry, spatial layout, and edge structure. During training, the VLM with COVT autoregressively predicts these visual tokens to reconstruct dense supervision signals (e.g., depth, segmentation, edges, and DINO features). At inference, the model reasons directly in the continuous visual token space, preserving efficiency while optionally decoding dense predictions for interpretability. Evaluated across more than ten diverse perception benchmarks, including CV-Bench, MMVP, RealWorldQA, MMStar, WorldMedQA, and HRBench, integrating COVT into strong VLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL and LLaVA consistently improves performance by 3% to 16% and demonstrates that compact continuous visual thinking enables more precise, grounded, and interpretable multimodal intelligence.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid rise of large-scale foundation models has reshaped the landscape of image segmentation, with models such as Segment Anything achieving unprecedented versatility across diverse vision tasks. However, previous generations-including SAM and its successor-still struggle with fine-grained, low-level segmentation challenges such as camouflaged object detection, medical image segmentation, cell image segmentation, and shadow detection. To address these limitations, we originally proposed SAM-Adapter in 2023, demonstrating substantial gains on these difficult scenarios. With the emergence of Segment Anything 3 (SAM3)-a more efficient and higher-performing evolution with a redesigned architecture and improved training pipeline-we revisit these long-standing challenges. In this work, we present SAM3-Adapter, the first adapter framework tailored for SAM3 that unlocks its full segmentation capability. SAM3-Adapter not only reduces computational overhead but also consistently surpasses both SAM and SAM2-based solutions, establishing new state-of-the-art results across multiple downstream tasks, including medical imaging, camouflaged (concealed) object segmentation, and shadow detection. Built upon the modular and composable design philosophy of the original SAM-Adapter, SAM3-Adapter provides stronger generalizability, richer task adaptability, and significantly improved segmentation precision. Extensive experiments confirm that integrating SAM3 with our adapter yields superior accuracy, robustness, and efficiency compared to all prior SAM-based adaptations. We hope SAM3-Adapter can serve as a foundation for future research and practical segmentation applications. Code, pre-trained models, and data processing pipelines are available.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, data-free, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>State-of-the-art flow models achieve remarkable quality but require slow, iterative sampling. To accelerate this, flow maps can be distilled from pre-trained teachers, a procedure that conventionally requires sampling from an external dataset. We argue that this data-dependency introduces a fundamental risk of Teacher-Data Mismatch, as a static dataset may provide an incomplete or even misaligned representation of the teacher's full generative capabilities. This leads us to question whether this reliance on data is truly necessary for successful flow map distillation. In this work, we explore a data-free alternative that samples only from the prior distribution, a distribution the teacher is guaranteed to follow by construction, thereby circumventing the mismatch risk entirely. To demonstrate the practical viability of this philosophy, we introduce a principled framework that learns to predict the teacher's sampling path while actively correcting for its own compounding errors to ensure high fidelity. Our approach surpasses all data-based counterparts and establishes a new state-of-the-art by a significant margin. Specifically, distilling from SiT-XL/2+REPA, our method reaches an impressive FID of 1.45 on ImageNet 256x256, and 1.49 on ImageNet 512x512, both with only 1 sampling step. We hope our work establishes a more robust paradigm for accelerating generative models and motivates the broader adoption of flow map distillation without data.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Task scheduling is critical for embodied AI, enabling agents to follow natural language instructions and execute actions efficiently in 3D physical worlds. However, existing datasets often simplify task planning by ignoring operations research (OR) knowledge and 3D spatial grounding. In this work, we propose Operations Research knowledge-based 3D Grounded Task Scheduling (ORS3D), a new task that requires the synergy of language understanding, 3D grounding, and efficiency optimization. Unlike prior settings, ORS3D demands that agents minimize total completion time by leveraging parallelizable subtasks, e.g., cleaning the sink while the microwave operates. To facilitate research on ORS3D, we construct ORS3D-60K, a large-scale dataset comprising 60K composite tasks across 4K real-world scenes. Furthermore, we propose GRANT, an embodied multi-modal large language model equipped with a simple yet effective scheduling token mechanism to generate efficient task schedules and grounded actions. Extensive experiments on ORS3D-60K validate the effectiveness of GRANT across language understanding, 3D grounding, and scheduling efficiency. The code is available at this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>There has been great progress in improving numerical weather prediction and climate models using machine learning. However, most global models act at a kilometer-scale, making it challenging to model individual clouds and factors such as extreme precipitation, wind gusts, turbulence, and surface irradiance. Therefore, there is a need to move towards higher-resolution models, which in turn require high-resolution real-world observations that current instruments struggle to obtain. We present Cloud4D, the first learning-based framework that reconstructs a physically consistent, four-dimensional cloud state using only synchronized ground-based cameras. Leveraging a homography-guided 2D-to-3D transformer, Cloud4D infers the full 3D distribution of liquid water content at 25 m spatial and 5 s temporal resolution. By tracking the 3D liquid water content retrievals over time, Cloud4D additionally estimates horizontal wind vectors. Across a two-month deployment comprising six skyward cameras, our system delivers an order-of-magnitude improvement in space-time resolution relative to state-of-the-art satellite measurements, while retaining single-digit relative error ($<10\%$) against collocated radar measurements.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models for image generation often exhibit a trade-off between perceptual sample quality and data likelihood: training objectives emphasizing high-noise denoising steps yield realistic images but poor likelihoods, whereas likelihood-oriented training overweights low-noise steps and harms visual fidelity. We introduce a simple plug-and-play sampling method that combines two pretrained diffusion experts by switching between them along the denoising trajectory. Specifically, we apply an image-quality expert at high noise levels to shape global structure, then switch to a likelihood expert at low noise levels to refine pixel statistics. The approach requires no retraining or fine-tuning -- only the choice of an intermediate switching step. On CIFAR-10 and ImageNet32, the merged model consistently matches or outperforms its base components, improving or preserving both likelihood and sample quality relative to each expert alone. These results demonstrate that expert switching across noise levels is an effective way to break the likelihood-quality trade-off in image diffusion models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large-scale video diffusion models show strong world simulation and temporal reasoning abilities, but their use as zero-shot image editors remains underexplored. We introduce IF-Edit, a tuning-free framework that repurposes pretrained image-to-video diffusion models for instruction-driven image editing. IF-Edit addresses three key challenges: prompt misalignment, redundant temporal latents, and blurry late-stage frames. It includes (1) a chain-of-thought prompt enhancement module that transforms static editing instructions into temporally grounded reasoning prompts; (2) a temporal latent dropout strategy that compresses frame latents after the expert-switch point, accelerating denoising while preserving semantic and temporal coherence; and (3) a self-consistent post-refinement step that sharpens late-stage frames using a short still-video trajectory. Experiments on four public benchmarks, covering non-rigid editing, physical and temporal reasoning, and general instruction edits, show that IF-Edit performs strongly on reasoning-centric tasks while remaining competitive on general-purpose edits. Our study provides a systematic view of video diffusion models as image editors and highlights a simple recipe for unified video-image generative reasoning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Physically-based rendering (PBR) provides a principled standard for realistic material-lighting interactions in computer graphics. Despite recent advances in generating PBR textures, existing methods fail to address two fundamental challenges: 1) materials decomposition from image prompts under limited illumination cues, and 2) seamless and view-consistent texture completion. To this end, we propose LumiTex, an end-to-end framework that comprises three key components: (1) a multi-branch generation scheme that disentangles albedo and metallic-roughness under shared illumination priors for robust material understanding, (2) a lighting-aware material attention mechanism that injects illumination context into the decoding process for physically grounded generation of albedo, metallic, and roughness maps, and (3) a geometry-guided inpainting module based on a large view synthesis model that enriches texture coverage and ensures seamless, view-consistent UV completion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LumiTex achieves state-of-the-art performance in texture quality, surpassing both existing open-source and commercial methods.</li>
