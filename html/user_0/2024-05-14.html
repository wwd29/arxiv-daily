<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Developing domain models is one of the few remaining places that require manual human labor in AI planning. Thus, in order to make planning more accessible, it is desirable to automate the process of domain model generation. To this end, we investigate if large language models (LLMs) can be used to generate planning domain models from simple textual descriptions. Specifically, we introduce a framework for automated evaluation of LLM-generated domains by comparing the sets of plans for domain instances. Finally, we perform an empirical analysis of 7 large language models, including coding and chat models across 9 different planning domains, and under three classes of natural language domain descriptions. Our results indicate that LLMs, particularly those with high parameter counts, exhibit a moderate level of proficiency in generating correct planning domains from natural language descriptions.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, a tool for detecting LLM AI text generation is developed based on the Transformer model, aiming to improve the accuracy of AI text generation detection and provide reference for subsequent research. Firstly the text is Unicode normalised, converted to lowercase form, characters other than non-alphabetic characters and punctuation marks are removed by regular expressions, spaces are added around punctuation marks, first and last spaces are removed, consecutive ellipses are replaced with single spaces and the text is connected using the specified delimiter. Next remove non-alphabetic characters and extra whitespace characters, replace multiple consecutive whitespace characters with a single space and again convert to lowercase form. The deep learning model combines layers such as LSTM, Transformer and CNN for text classification or sequence labelling tasks. The training and validation sets show that the model loss decreases from 0.127 to 0.005 and accuracy increases from 94.96 to 99.8, indicating that the model has good detection and classification ability for AI generated text. The test set confusion matrix and accuracy show that the model has 99% prediction accuracy for AI-generated text, with a precision of 0.99, a recall of 1, and an f1 score of 0.99, achieving a very high classification accuracy. Looking forward, it has the prospect of wide application in the field of AI text detection.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The Financial Relation Extraction (FinRE) task involves identifying the entities and their relation, given a piece of financial statement/text. To solve this FinRE problem, we propose a simple but effective strategy that improves the performance of pre-trained language models by augmenting them with Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Part-Of-Speech (POS), as well as different approaches to combine these information. Experiments on a financial relations dataset show promising results and highlights the benefits of incorporating NER and POS in existing models.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>protect</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The Internet has become an essential tool for people in the modern world. Humans, like all living organisms, have essential requirements for survival. These include access to atmospheric oxygen, potable water, protective shelter, and sustenance. The constant flux of the world is making our existence less complicated. A significant portion of the population utilizes online food ordering services to have meals delivered to their residences. Although there are numerous methods for ordering food, customers sometimes experience disappointment with the food they receive. Our endeavor was to establish a model that could determine if food is of good or poor quality. We compiled an extensive dataset of over 1484 online reviews from prominent food ordering platforms, including Food Panda and HungryNaki. Leveraging the collected data, a rigorous assessment of various deep learning and machine learning techniques was performed to determine the most accurate approach for predicting food quality. Out of all the algorithms evaluated, logistic regression emerged as the most accurate, achieving an impressive 90.91% accuracy. The review offers valuable insights that will guide the user in deciding whether or not to order the food.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>explainability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Social media platforms enable the rapid dissemination and consumption of information. However, users instantly consume such content regardless of the reliability of the shared data. Consequently, the latter crowdsourcing model is exposed to manipulation. This work contributes with an explainable and online classification method to recognize fake news in real-time. The proposed method combines both unsupervised and supervised Machine Learning approaches with online created lexica. The profiling is built using creator-, content- and context-based features using Natural Language Processing techniques. The explainable classification mechanism displays in a dashboard the features selected for classification and the prediction confidence. The performance of the proposed solution has been validated with real data sets from Twitter and the results attain 80 % accuracy and macro F-measure. This proposal is the first to jointly provide data stream processing, profiling, classification and explainability. Ultimately, the proposed early detection, isolation and explanation of fake news contribute to increase the quality and trustworthiness of social media contents.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We study the problem of automatically annotating relevant numerals (GAAP metrics) occurring in the financial documents with their corresponding XBRL tags. Different from prior works, we investigate the feasibility of solving this extreme classification problem using a generative paradigm through instruction tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs). To this end, we leverage metric metadata information to frame our target outputs while proposing a parameter efficient solution for the task using LoRA. We perform experiments on two recently released financial numeric labeling datasets. Our proposed model, FLAN-FinXC, achieves new state-of-the-art performances on both the datasets, outperforming several strong baselines. We explain the better scores of our proposed model by demonstrating its capability for zero-shot as well as the least frequently occurring tags. Also, even when we fail to predict the XBRL tags correctly, our generated output has substantial overlap with the ground-truth in majority of the cases.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Despite the success of large language models (LLMs) in Text-to-SQL tasks, open-source LLMs encounter challenges in contextual understanding and response coherence. To tackle these issues, we present \ours, a systematic methodology tailored for Text-to-SQL with open-source LLMs. Our contributions include a comprehensive evaluation of open-source LLMs in Text-to-SQL tasks, the \openprompt strategy for effective question representation, and novel strategies for supervised fine-tuning. We explore the benefits of Chain-of-Thought in step-by-step inference and propose the \openexample method for enhanced few-shot learning. Additionally, we introduce token-efficient techniques, such as \textbf{Variable-length Open DB Schema}, \textbf{Target Column Truncation}, and \textbf{Example Column Truncation}, addressing challenges in large-scale databases. Our findings emphasize the need for further investigation into the impact of supervised fine-tuning on contextual learning capabilities. Remarkably, our method significantly improved Llama2-7B from 2.54\% to 41.04\% and Code Llama-7B from 14.54\% to 48.24\% on the BIRD-Dev dataset. Notably, the performance of Code Llama-7B surpassed GPT-4 (46.35\%) on the BIRD-Dev dataset.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) serve as powerful tools for design, providing capabilities for both task automation and design assistance. Recent advancements have shown tremendous potential for facilitating LLM integration into the chip design process; however, many of these works rely on data that are not publicly available and/or not permissively licensed for use in LLM training and distribution. In this paper, we present a solution aimed at bridging this gap by introducing an open-source dataset tailored for OpenROAD, a widely adopted open-source EDA toolchain. The dataset features over 1000 data points and is structured in two formats: (i) a pairwise set comprised of question prompts with prose answers, and (ii) a pairwise set comprised of code prompts and their corresponding OpenROAD scripts. By providing this dataset, we aim to facilitate LLM-focused research within the EDA domain. The dataset is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Humans can develop new theorems to explore broader and more complex mathematical results. While current generative language models (LMs) have achieved significant improvement in automatically proving theorems, their ability to generate new or reusable theorems is still under-explored. Without the new theorems, current LMs struggle to prove harder theorems that are distant from the given hypotheses with the exponentially growing search space. Therefore, this paper proposes an Automated Theorem Generation (ATG) benchmark that evaluates whether an agent can automatically generate valuable (and possibly brand new) theorems that are applicable for downstream theorem proving as reusable knowledge. Specifically, we construct the ATG benchmark by splitting the Metamath library into three sets: axioms, library, and problem based on their proving depth. We conduct extensive experiments to investigate whether current LMs can generate theorems in the library and benefit the problem theorems proving. The results demonstrate that high-quality ATG data facilitates models' performances on downstream ATP. However, there is still room for current LMs to develop better ATG and generate more advanced and human-like theorems. We hope the new ATG challenge can shed some light on advanced complex theorem proving.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Human cognition exhibits systematic compositionality, the algebraic ability to generate infinite novel combinations from finite learned components, which is the key to understanding and reasoning about complex logic. In this work, we investigate the compositionality of large language models (LLMs) in mathematical reasoning. Specifically, we construct a new dataset \textsc{MathTrap}\footnotemark[3] by introducing carefully designed logical traps into the problem descriptions of MATH and GSM8k. Since problems with logical flaws are quite rare in the real world, these represent ``unseen'' cases to LLMs. Solving these requires the models to systematically compose (1) the mathematical knowledge involved in the original problems with (2) knowledge related to the introduced traps. Our experiments show that while LLMs possess both components of requisite knowledge, they do not \textbf{spontaneously} combine them to handle these novel cases. We explore several methods to mitigate this deficiency, such as natural language prompts, few-shot demonstrations, and fine-tuning. We find that LLMs' performance can be \textbf{passively} improved through the above external intervention. Overall, systematic compositionality remains an open challenge for large language models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper presents the use of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to improve the feedback generated by Large Language Models for programming tasks. For this purpose, corresponding lecture recordings were transcribed and made available to the Large Language Model GPT-4 as external knowledge source together with timestamps as metainformation by using RAG. The purpose of this is to prevent hallucinations and to enforce the use of the technical terms and phrases from the lecture. In an exercise platform developed to solve programming problems for an introductory programming lecture, students can request feedback on their solutions generated by GPT-4. For this task GPT-4 receives the students' code solution, the compiler output, the result of unit tests and the relevant passages from the lecture notes available through the use of RAG as additional context. The feedback generated by GPT-4 should guide students to solve problems independently and link to the lecture content, using the time stamps of the transcript as meta-information. In this way, the corresponding lecture videos can be viewed immediately at the corresponding positions. For the evaluation, students worked with the tool in a workshop and decided for each feedback whether it should be extended by RAG or not. First results based on a questionnaire and the collected usage data show that the use of RAG can improve feedback generation and is preferred by students in some situations. Due to the slower speed of feedback generation, the benefits are situation dependent.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this study, we investigated the effects of self-reflection in large language models (LLMs) on problem-solving performance. We instructed nine popular LLMs to answer a series of multiple-choice questions to provide a performance baseline. For each incorrectly answered question, we instructed eight types of self-reflecting LLM agents to reflect on their mistakes and provide themselves with guidance to improve problem-solving. Then, using this guidance, each self-reflecting agent attempted to re-answer the same questions. Our results indicate that LLM agents are able to significantly improve their problem-solving performance through self-reflection ($p < 0.001$). In addition, we compared the various types of self-reflection to determine their individual contribution to performance. All code and data are available on GitHub at this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Social media aids disaster response but suffers from noise, hindering accurate impact assessment and decision making for resilient cities, which few studies considered. To address the problem, this study proposes the first domain-specific LLM model and an integrated method for rapid earthquake impact assessment. First, a few categories are introduced to classify and filter microblogs considering their relationship to the physical and social impacts of earthquakes, and a dataset comprising 7282 earthquake-related microblogs from twenty earthquakes in different locations is developed as well. Then, with a systematic analysis of various influential factors, QuakeBERT, a domain-specific large language model (LLM), is developed and fine-tuned for accurate classification and filtering of microblogs. Meanwhile, an integrated method integrating public opinion trend analysis, sentiment analysis, and keyword-based physical impact quantification is introduced to assess both the physical and social impacts of earthquakes based on social media texts. Experiments show that data diversity and data volume dominate the performance of QuakeBERT and increase the macro average F1 score by 27%, while the best classification model QuakeBERT outperforms the CNN- or RNN-based models by improving the macro average F1 score from 60.87% to 84.33%. Finally, the proposed approach is applied to assess two earthquakes with the same magnitude and focal depth. Results show that the proposed approach can effectively enhance the impact assessment process by accurate detection of noisy microblogs, which enables effective post-disaster emergency responses to create more resilient cities.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have proven their worth across a diverse spectrum of disciplines. LLMs have shown great potential in Procedural Content Generation (PCG) as well, but directly generating a level through a pre-trained LLM is still challenging. This work introduces Word2World, a system that enables LLMs to procedurally design playable games through stories, without any task-specific fine-tuning. Word2World leverages the abilities of LLMs to create diverse content and extract information. Combining these abilities, LLMs can create a story for the game, design narrative, and place tiles in appropriate places to create coherent worlds and playable games. We test Word2World with different LLMs and perform a thorough ablation study to validate each step. We open-source the code at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the impressive performance in various downstream tasks, large language models (LLMs) have been widely integrated into production pipelines, like recruitment and recommendation systems. A known issue of models trained on natural language data is the presence of human biases, which can impact the fairness of the system. This paper investigates LLMs' behavior with respect to gender stereotypes, in the context of occupation decision making. Our framework is designed to investigate and quantify the presence of gender stereotypes in LLMs' behavior via multi-round question answering. Inspired by prior works, we construct a dataset by leveraging a standard occupation classification knowledge base released by authoritative agencies. We tested three LLMs (RoBERTa-large, GPT-3.5-turbo, and Llama2-70b-chat) and found that all models exhibit gender stereotypes analogous to human biases, but with different preferences. The distinct preferences of GPT-3.5-turbo and Llama2-70b-chat may imply the current alignment methods are insufficient for debiasing and could introduce new biases contradicting the traditional gender stereotypes.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) have significantly evolved, moving from simple output generation to complex reasoning and from stand-alone usage to being embedded into broader frameworks. In this paper, we introduce \emph{Fleet of Agents (FoA)}, a novel framework utilizing LLMs as agents to navigate through dynamic tree searches, employing a genetic-type particle filtering approach. FoA spawns a multitude of agents, each exploring autonomously, followed by a selection phase where resampling based on a heuristic value function optimizes the balance between exploration and exploitation. This mechanism enables dynamic branching, adapting the exploration strategy based on discovered solutions. We experimentally validate FoA using two benchmark tasks, "Game of 24" and "Mini-Crosswords". FoA outperforms the previously proposed Tree-of-Thoughts method in terms of efficacy and efficiency: it significantly decreases computational costs (by calling the value function less frequently) while preserving comparable or even superior accuracy.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Inspired by the 'Bias Considerations in Bilingual Natural Language Processing' report by Statistics Canada, this study delves into potential biases in multilingual sentiment analysis between English and French. Given a 50-50 dataset of French and English, we aim to determine if there exists a language bias and explore how the incorporation of more diverse datasets in the future might affect the equity of multilingual Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems. By employing Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes models on three balanced datasets, we reveal potential biases in multilingual sentiment classification. Utilizing Fairlearn, a tool for assessing bias in machine learning models, our findings indicate nuanced outcomes. With French data outperforming English across accuracy, recall, and F1 score metrics in both models, hinting at a language bias favoring French. However, Fairlearn's metrics suggest that the SVM approaches equitable levels with a demographic parity ratio of 0.963, 0.989, and 0.985 for the three separate datasets, indicating near-equitable treatment across languages. In contrast, Naive Bayes demonstrates greater disparities, evidenced by a demographic parity ratio of 0.813, 0.908, and 0.961. These findings reveal the importance of developing equitable multilingual NLP systems, particularly as we anticipate the inclusion of more datasets in various languages in the future.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we introduce SUTRA, multilingual Large Language Model architecture capable of understanding, reasoning, and generating text in over 50 languages. SUTRA's design uniquely decouples core conceptual understanding from language-specific processing, which facilitates scalable and efficient multilingual alignment and learning. Employing a Mixture of Experts framework both in language and concept processing, SUTRA demonstrates both computational efficiency and responsiveness. Through extensive evaluations, SUTRA is demonstrated to surpass existing models like GPT-3.5, Llama2 by 20-30% on leading Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmarks for multilingual tasks. SUTRA models are also online LLMs that can use knowledge from the internet to provide hallucination-free, factual and up-to-date responses while retaining their multilingual capabilities. Furthermore, we explore the broader implications of its architecture for the future of multilingual AI, highlighting its potential to democratize access to AI technology globally and to improve the equity and utility of AI in regions with predominantly non-English languages. Our findings suggest that SUTRA not only fills pivotal gaps in multilingual model capabilities but also establishes a new benchmark for operational efficiency and scalability in AI applications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>An important issue impacting healthcare is a lack of available experts. Machine learning (ML) models could resolve this by aiding in diagnosing patients. However, creating datasets large enough to train these models is expensive. We evaluated large language models (LLMs) for data creation. Using Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), we prompted ChatGPT and GPT-Premium to generate 4,200 synthetic observations to augment existing medical data. Our goal is to label behaviors corresponding to autism criteria and improve model accuracy with synthetic training data. We used a BERT classifier pre-trained on biomedical literature to assess differences in performance between models. A random sample (N=140) from the LLM-generated data was evaluated by a clinician and found to contain 83% correct example-label pairs. Augmenting data increased recall by 13% but decreased precision by 16%, correlating with higher quality and lower accuracy across pairs. Future work will analyze how different synthetic data traits affect ML outcomes.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we explore the potential application of Large Language Models (LLMs) that will automatically model constraints and generate code for dynamic scheduling problems given an existing static model. Static scheduling problems are modelled and coded by optimization experts. These models may be easily obsoleted as the underlying constraints may need to be fine-tuned in order to reflect changes in the scheduling rules. Furthermore, it may be necessary to turn a static model into a dynamic one in order to cope with disturbances in the environment. In this paper, we propose a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based LLM model to automate the process of implementing constraints for Dynamic Scheduling (RAGDyS), without seeking help from an optimization modeling expert. Our framework aims to minimize technical complexities related to mathematical modelling and computational workload for end-users, thereby allowing end-users to quickly obtain a new schedule close to the original schedule with changes reflected by natural language constraint descriptions.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the rapid advancement of natural language processing technologies, generative artificial intelligence techniques, represented by large language models (LLMs), are gaining increasing prominence and demonstrating significant potential for applications in safety engineering. However, fundamental LLMs face constraints such as limited training data coverage and unreliable responses. This study develops a vector database from 117 explosion accident reports in China spanning 2013 to 2023, employing techniques such as corpus segmenting and vector embedding. By utilizing the vector database, which outperforms the relational database in information retrieval quality, we provide LLMs with richer, more relevant knowledge. Comparative analysis of LLMs demonstrates that ChatSOS significantly enhances reliability, accuracy, and comprehensiveness, improves adaptability and clarification of responses. These results illustrate the effectiveness of supplementing LLMs with an external database, highlighting their potential to handle professional queries in safety engineering and laying a foundation for broader applications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Documents that consist of diverse templates and exhibit complex spatial structures pose a challenge for document entity classification. We propose KNN-former, which incorporates a new kind of spatial bias in attention calculation based on the K-nearest-neighbor (KNN) graph of document entities. We limit entities' attention only to their local radius defined by the KNN graph. We also use combinatorial matching to address the one-to-one mapping property that exists in many documents, where one field has only one corresponding entity. Moreover, our method is highly parameter-efficient compared to existing approaches in terms of the number of trainable parameters. Despite this, experiments across various datasets show our method outperforms baselines in most entity types. Many real-world documents exhibit combinatorial properties which can be leveraged as inductive biases to improve extraction accuracy, but existing datasets do not cover these documents. To facilitate future research into these types of documents, we release a new ID document dataset that covers diverse templates and languages. We also release enhanced annotations for an existing dataset.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we introduce the Interpretable Cross-Examination Technique (ICE-T), a novel approach that leverages structured multi-prompt techniques with Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve classification performance over zero-shot and few-shot methods. In domains where interpretability is crucial, such as medicine and law, standard models often fall short due to their "black-box" nature. ICE-T addresses these limitations by using a series of generated prompts that allow an LLM to approach the problem from multiple directions. The responses from the LLM are then converted into numerical feature vectors and processed by a traditional classifier. This method not only maintains high interpretability but also allows for smaller, less capable models to achieve or exceed the performance of larger, more advanced models under zero-shot conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ICE-T across a diverse set of data sources, including medical records and legal documents, consistently surpassing the zero-shot baseline in terms of classification metrics such as F1 scores. Our results indicate that ICE-T can be used for improving both the performance and transparency of AI applications in complex decision-making environments.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Online commerce relies heavily on user generated reviews to provide unbiased information about products that they have not physically seen. The importance of reviews has attracted multiple exploitative online behaviours and requires methods for monitoring and detecting reviews. We present a machine learning methodology for review detection and extraction, and demonstrate that it generalises for use across websites that were not contained in the training data. This method promises to drive applications for automatic detection and evaluation of reviews, regardless of their source. Furthermore, we showcase the versatility of our method by implementing and discussing three key applications for analysing reviews: Sentiment Inconsistency Analysis, which detects and filters out unreliable reviews based on inconsistencies between ratings and comments; Multi-language support, enabling the extraction and translation of reviews from various languages without relying on HTML scraping; and Fake review detection, achieved by integrating a trained NLP model to identify and distinguish between genuine and fake reviews.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Self-correction is emerging as a promising approach to mitigate the issue of hallucination in Large Language Models (LLMs). To facilitate effective self-correction, recent research has proposed mistake detection as its initial step. However, current literature suggests that LLMs often struggle with reliably identifying reasoning mistakes when using simplistic prompting strategies. To address this challenge, we introduce a unique prompting strategy, termed the Pedagogical Chain-of-Thought (PedCoT), which is specifically designed to guide the identification of reasoning mistakes, particularly mathematical reasoning mistakes. PedCoT consists of pedagogical principles for prompts (PPP) design, two-stage interaction process (TIP) and grounded PedCoT prompts, all inspired by the educational theory of the Bloom Cognitive Model (BCM). We evaluate our approach on two public datasets featuring math problems of varying difficulty levels. The experiments demonstrate that our zero-shot prompting strategy significantly outperforms strong baselines. The proposed method can achieve the goal of reliable mathematical mistake identification and provide a foundation for automatic math answer grading. The results underscore the significance of educational theory, serving as domain knowledge, in guiding prompting strategy design for addressing challenging tasks with LLMs effectively.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Combining different forms of prompts with pre-trained large language models has yielded remarkable results on reasoning tasks (e.g. Chain-of-Thought prompting). However, along with testing on more complex reasoning, these methods also expose problems such as invalid reasoning and fictional reasoning paths. In this paper, we develop \textit{Hypothesis Testing Prompting}, which adds conclusion assumptions, backward reasoning, and fact verification during intermediate reasoning steps. \textit{Hypothesis Testing prompting} involves multiple assumptions and reverses validation of conclusions leading to its unique correct answer. Experiments on two challenging deductive reasoning datasets ProofWriter and RuleTaker show that hypothesis testing prompting not only significantly improves the effect, but also generates a more reasonable and standardized reasoning process.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the digital era, with escalating privacy concerns, it's imperative to devise robust strategies that protect private data while maintaining the intrinsic value of textual information. This research embarks on a comprehensive examination of text anonymisation methods, focusing on Conditional Random Fields (CRF), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Embeddings from Language Models (ELMo), and the transformative capabilities of the Transformers architecture. Each model presents unique strengths since LSTM is modeling long-term dependencies, CRF captures dependencies among word sequences, ELMo delivers contextual word representations using deep bidirectional language models and Transformers introduce self-attention mechanisms that provide enhanced scalability. Our study is positioned as a comparative analysis of these models, emphasising their synergistic potential in addressing text anonymisation challenges. Preliminary results indicate that CRF, LSTM, and ELMo individually outperform traditional methods. The inclusion of Transformers, when compared alongside with the other models, offers a broader perspective on achieving optimal text anonymisation in contemporary settings.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Category fluency is a widely studied cognitive phenomenon, yet two conflicting accounts have been proposed as the underlying retrieval mechanism -- an optimal foraging process deliberately searching through memory (Hills et al., 2012) and a random walk sampling from a semantic network (Abbott et al., 2015). Evidence for both accounts has centered around predicting human patch switches, where both existing models of category fluency produce paradoxically identical results. We begin by peeling back the assumptions made by existing models, namely that each named example only depends on the previous example, by (i) adding an additional bias to model the category transition probability directly and (ii) relying on a large language model to predict based on the entire existing sequence. Then, we present evidence towards resolving the disagreement between each account of foraging by reformulating models as sequence generators. To evaluate, we compare generated category fluency runs to a bank of human-written sequences by proposing a metric based on n-gram overlap. We find category switch predictors do not necessarily produce human-like sequences, in fact the additional biases used by the Hills et al. (2012) model are required to improve generation quality, which are later improved by our category modification. Even generating exclusively with an LLM requires an additional global cue to trigger the patch switching behavior during production. Further tests on only the search process on top of the semantic network highlight the importance of deterministic search to replicate human behavior.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper explores the enhancement of creativity in Large Language Models (LLMs) like vGPT-4 through associative thinking, a cognitive process where creative ideas emerge from linking seemingly unrelated concepts. Associative thinking strategies have been found to effectively help humans boost creativity. However, whether the same strategies can help LLMs become more creative remains under-explored. In this work, we investigate whether prompting LLMs to connect disparate concepts can augment their creative outputs. Focusing on three domains -- Product Design, Storytelling, and Marketing -- we introduce creativity tasks designed to assess vGPT-4's ability to generate original and useful content. By challenging the models to form novel associations, we evaluate the potential of associative thinking to enhance the creative capabilities of LLMs. Our findings show that leveraging associative thinking techniques can significantly improve the originality of vGPT-4's responses.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Traffic prediction is pivotal for rational transportation supply scheduling and allocation. Existing researches into short-term traffic prediction, however, face challenges in adequately addressing exceptional circumstances and integrating non-numerical contextual information like weather into models. While, Large language models offer a promising solution due to their inherent world knowledge. However, directly using them for traffic prediction presents drawbacks such as high cost, lack of determinism, and limited mathematical capability. To mitigate these issues, this study proposes a novel approach. Instead of directly employing large models for prediction, it utilizes them to process textual information and obtain embeddings. These embeddings are then combined with historical traffic data and inputted into traditional spatiotemporal forecasting models. The study investigates two types of special scenarios: regional-level and node-level. For regional-level scenarios, textual information is represented as a node connected to the entire network. For node-level scenarios, embeddings from the large model represent additional nodes connected only to corresponding nodes. This approach shows a significant improvement in prediction accuracy according to our experiment of New York Bike dataset.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the last twenty years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have garnered growing interest due to their expanding applications in both military and civilian domains. Detecting non-cooperative aerial vehicles with efficiency and estimating collisions accurately are pivotal for achieving fully autonomous aircraft and facilitating Advanced Air Mobility (AAM). This paper presents a deep-learning framework that utilizes optical sensors for the detection, tracking, and distance estimation of non-cooperative aerial vehicles. In implementing this comprehensive sensing framework, the availability of depth information is essential for enabling autonomous aerial vehicles to perceive and navigate around obstacles. In this work, we propose a method for estimating the distance information of a detected aerial object in real time using only the input of a monocular camera. In order to train our deep learning components for the object detection, tracking and depth estimation tasks we utilize the Amazon Airborne Object Tracking (AOT) Dataset. In contrast to previous approaches that integrate the depth estimation module into the object detector, our method formulates the problem as image-to-image translation. We employ a separate lightweight encoder-decoder network for efficient and robust depth estimation. In a nutshell, the object detection module identifies and localizes obstacles, conveying this information to both the tracking module for monitoring obstacle movement and the depth estimation module for calculating distances. Our approach is evaluated on the Airborne Object Tracking (AOT) dataset which is the largest (to the best of our knowledge) air-to-air airborne object dataset.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The main barrier to achieving fully autonomous flights lies in autonomous aircraft navigation. Managing non-cooperative traffic presents the most important challenge in this problem. The most efficient strategy for handling non-cooperative traffic is based on monocular video processing through deep learning models. This study contributes to the vision-based deep learning aircraft detection and tracking literature by investigating the impact of data corruption arising from environmental and hardware conditions on the effectiveness of these methods. More specifically, we designed $7$ types of common corruptions for camera inputs taking into account real-world flight conditions. By applying these corruptions to the Airborne Object Tracking (AOT) dataset we constructed the first robustness benchmark dataset named AOT-C for air-to-air aerial object detection. The corruptions included in this dataset cover a wide range of challenging conditions such as adverse weather and sensor noise. The second main contribution of this letter is to present an extensive experimental evaluation involving $8$ diverse object detectors to explore the degradation in the performance under escalating levels of corruptions (domain shifts). Based on the evaluation results, the key observations that emerge are the following: 1) One-stage detectors of the YOLO family demonstrate better robustness, 2) Transformer-based and multi-stage detectors like Faster R-CNN are extremely vulnerable to corruptions, 3) Robustness against corruptions is related to the generalization ability of models. The third main contribution is to present that finetuning on our augmented synthetic data results in improvements in the generalisation ability of the object detector in real-world flight experiments.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In today's digital landscape, where cyber attacks have become the norm, the detection of cyber attacks and threats is critically imperative across diverse domains. Our research presents a new empirical framework for cyber threat modeling, adept at parsing and categorizing cyber-related information from news articles, enhancing real-time vigilance for market stakeholders. At the core of this framework is a fine-tuned BERT model, which we call CANAL - Cyber Activity News Alerting Language Model, tailored for cyber categorization using a novel silver labeling approach powered by Random Forest. We benchmark CANAL against larger, costlier LLMs, including GPT-4, LLaMA, and Zephyr, highlighting their zero to few-shot learning in cyber news classification. CANAL demonstrates superior performance by outperforming all other LLM counterparts in both accuracy and cost-effectiveness. Furthermore, we introduce the Cyber Signal Discovery module, a strategic component designed to efficiently detect emerging cyber signals from news articles. Collectively, CANAL and Cyber Signal Discovery module equip our framework to provide a robust and cost-effective solution for businesses that require agile responses to cyber intelligence.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Human motion synthesis is an important task in computer graphics and computer vision. While focusing on various conditioning signals such as text, action class, or audio to guide the generation process, most existing methods utilize skeleton-based pose representation, requiring additional skinning to produce renderable meshes. Given that human motion is a complex interplay of bones, joints, and muscles, considering solely the skeleton for generation may neglect their inherent interdependency, which can limit the variability and precision of the generated results. To address this issue, we propose a Shape-conditioned Motion Diffusion model (SMD), which enables the generation of motion sequences directly in mesh format, conditioned on a specified target mesh. In SMD, the input meshes are transformed into spectral coefficients using graph Laplacian, to efficiently represent meshes. Subsequently, we propose a Spectral-Temporal Autoencoder (STAE) to leverage cross-temporal dependencies within the spectral domain. Extensive experimental evaluations show that SMD not only produces vivid and realistic motions but also achieves competitive performance in text-to-motion and action-to-motion tasks when compared to state-of-the-art methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose a gradient flow procedure for generative modeling by transporting particles from an initial source distribution to a target distribution, where the gradient field on the particles is given by a noise-adaptive Wasserstein Gradient of the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). The noise-adaptive MMD is trained on data distributions corrupted by increasing levels of noise, obtained via a forward diffusion process, as commonly used in denoising diffusion probabilistic models. The result is a generalization of MMD Gradient Flow, which we call Diffusion-MMD-Gradient Flow or DMMD. The divergence training procedure is related to discriminator training in Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), but does not require adversarial training. We obtain competitive empirical performance in unconditional image generation on CIFAR10, MNIST, CELEB-A (64 x64) and LSUN Church (64 x 64). Furthermore, we demonstrate the validity of the approach when MMD is replaced by a lower bound on the KL divergence.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This survey explores the transformative impact of foundation models (FMs) in artificial intelligence, focusing on their integration with federated learning (FL) for advancing biomedical research. Foundation models such as ChatGPT, LLaMa, and CLIP, which are trained on vast datasets through methods including unsupervised pretraining, self-supervised learning, instructed fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning from human feedback, represent significant advancements in machine learning. These models, with their ability to generate coherent text and realistic images, are crucial for biomedical applications that require processing diverse data forms such as clinical reports, diagnostic images, and multimodal patient interactions. The incorporation of FL with these sophisticated models presents a promising strategy to harness their analytical power while safeguarding the privacy of sensitive medical data. This approach not only enhances the capabilities of FMs in medical diagnostics and personalized treatment but also addresses critical concerns about data privacy and security in healthcare. This survey reviews the current applications of FMs in federated settings, underscores the challenges, and identifies future research directions including scaling FMs, managing data diversity, and enhancing communication efficiency within FL frameworks. The objective is to encourage further research into the combined potential of FMs and FL, laying the groundwork for groundbreaking healthcare innovations.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming vital tools that help us solve and understand complex problems by acting as digital assistants. LLMs can generate convincing explanations, even when only given the inputs and outputs of these problems, i.e., in a ``black-box'' approach. However, our research uncovers a hidden risk tied to this approach, which we call *adversarial helpfulness*. This happens when an LLM's explanations make a wrong answer look right, potentially leading people to trust incorrect solutions. In this paper, we show that this issue affects not just humans, but also LLM evaluators. Digging deeper, we identify and examine key persuasive strategies employed by LLMs. Our findings reveal that these models employ strategies such as reframing the questions, expressing an elevated level of confidence, and cherry-picking evidence to paint misleading answers in a credible light. To examine if LLMs are able to navigate complex-structured knowledge when generating adversarially helpful explanations, we create a special task based on navigating through graphs. Some LLMs are not able to find alternative paths along simple graphs, indicating that their misleading explanations aren't produced by only logical deductions using complex knowledge. These findings shed light on the limitations of black-box explanation setting. We provide some advice on how to use LLMs as explainers safely.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Given recent advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), the task of translating from natural language prompts to different programming languages (code generation) attracts immense attention for wide application in different domains. Specially code generation for Bash (NL2Bash) is widely used to generate Bash scripts for automating different tasks, such as performance monitoring, compilation, system administration, system diagnostics, etc. Besides code generation, validating synthetic code is critical before using them for any application. Different methods for code validation are proposed, both direct (execution evaluation) and indirect validations (i.e. exact/partial match, BLEU score). Among these, Execution-based Evaluation (EE) can validate the predicted code by comparing the execution output of model prediction and expected output in system. However, designing and implementing such an execution-based evaluation system for NL2Bash is not a trivial task. In this paper, we present a machinery for execution-based evaluation for NL2Bash. We create a set of 50 prompts to evaluate some popular LLMs for NL2Bash. We also analyze several advantages and challenges of EE such as syntactically different yet semantically equivalent Bash scripts generated by different LLMs, or syntactically correct but semantically incorrect Bash scripts, and how we capture and process them correctly.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a severe and sudden medical condition caused by the rupture of blood vessels in the brain, leading to permanent damage to brain tissue and often resulting in functional disabilities or death in patients. Diagnosis and analysis of ICH typically rely on brain CT imaging. Given the urgency of ICH conditions, early treatment is crucial, necessitating rapid analysis of CT images to formulate tailored treatment plans. However, the complexity of ICH CT images and the frequent scarcity of specialist radiologists pose significant challenges. Therefore, we built a dataset for ICH and normal classification and three types of ICH image classification based on the hemorrhage location, i.e., Deep, Subcortical, and Lobar. In addition, we propose a dual-task vision transformer (DTViT) for the automated classification and diagnosis of ICH images. This neural network utilizes the encoder from ViT, employing attention mechanisms for feature extraction from CT images. We incorporated two multilayer perception (MLP)-based decoders within the network to simultaneously identify the presence of ICH and classify three types of hemorrhage locations. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed multi-classification network performs well on the built real-world test dataset.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated learning is widely used in medical applications for training global models without needing local data access. However, varying computational capabilities and network architectures (system heterogeneity), across clients pose significant challenges in effectively aggregating information from non-independently and identically distributed (non-IID) data. Current federated learning methods using knowledge distillation require public datasets, raising privacy and data collection issues. Additionally, these datasets require additional local computing and storage resources, which is a burden for medical institutions with limited hardware conditions. In this paper, we introduce a novel federated learning paradigm, named Model Heterogeneous personalized Federated Learning via Injection and Distillation (MH-pFLID). Our framework leverages a lightweight messenger model that carries concentrated information to collect the information from each client. We also develop a set of receiver and transmitter modules to receive and send information from the messenger model, so that the information could be injected and distilled with efficiency.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>protect, attack, steal, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) enable a new ecosystem with many downstream applications, called LLM applications, with different natural language processing tasks. The functionality and performance of an LLM application highly depend on its system prompt, which instructs the backend LLM on what task to perform. Therefore, an LLM application developer often keeps a system prompt confidential to protect its intellectual property. As a result, a natural attack, called prompt leaking, is to steal the system prompt from an LLM application, which compromises the developer's intellectual property. Existing prompt leaking attacks primarily rely on manually crafted queries, and thus achieve limited effectiveness. In this paper, we design a novel, closed-box prompt leaking attack framework, called PLeak, to optimize an adversarial query such that when the attacker sends it to a target LLM application, its response reveals its own system prompt. We formulate finding such an adversarial query as an optimization problem and solve it with a gradient-based method approximately. Our key idea is to break down the optimization goal by optimizing adversary queries for system prompts incrementally, i.e., starting from the first few tokens of each system prompt step by step until the entire length of the system prompt. We evaluate PLeak in both offline settings and for real-world LLM applications, e.g., those on Poe, a popular platform hosting such applications. Our results show that PLeak can effectively leak system prompts and significantly outperforms not only baselines that manually curate queries but also baselines with optimized queries that are modified and adapted from existing jailbreaking attacks. We responsibly reported the issues to Poe and are still waiting for their response. Our implementation is available at this repository: this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Cookies provide a state management mechanism for the web and are often used for authentication, storing a user's session ID, and replacing their credentials in subsequent requests. These ``session cookies'' are valuable targets of attacks such as Session Hijacking and Fixation that attempt to steal them and gain unauthorized access to user accounts. Multiple controls such as the Secure and HttpOnly cookie attributes restrict cookie accessibility, effectively mitigating attacks from the network or malicious websites, but often ignoring untrusted extensions within the user's browser. Extensions are third-party HTML/JavaScript add-ons with access to several privileged APIs and can run on multiple websites at once. Unfortunately, this can provide malicious/compromised extensions with unrestricted access to session cookies. In this work, we first conduct a study assessing the prevalence of extensions with these ``risky'' APIs (i.e., those enabling cookie modification and theft) and find that they are currently used by hundreds of millions of users. Motivated by this, we propose browser controls based on two new cookie attributes that protect cookies from malicious extensions: BrowserOnly and Tracked. The BrowserOnly attribute prevents accessing cookies from extensions altogether. While effective, not all cookies can be inaccessible. Cookies with the Tracked attribute remain accessible, are tied to a single browser, and record any modifications made by extensions. Thus, stolen Tracked cookies become unusable outside their original browser and servers can verify any modifications. To demonstrate these features' practicality, we implement CREAM (Cookie Restrictions for Extension Abuse Mitigation): a modified version of Chromium realizing these controls. Our evaluation indicates that CREAM controls effectively protect cookies from malicious extensions while incurring small run-time overheads.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper explores the possibilities of the current generation of Large Language Models for incorporating Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) functionalities into ML training code bases. We evaluate the performance of OpenAI (gpt-3.5-turbo) and WizardCoder (open-source, 15B parameters) models on the automated accomplishment of various MLOps functionalities in different settings. We perform a benchmarking study that assesses the ability of these models to: (1) adapt existing code samples (Inlining) with component-specific MLOps functionality such as MLflow and Weights & Biases for experiment tracking, Optuna for hyperparameter optimization etc., and (2) perform the task of Translation from one component of an MLOps functionality to another, e.g., translating existing GitPython library based version control code to Data Version Control library based. We also propose three different approaches that involve teaching LLMs to comprehend the API documentation of the components as a reference while accomplishing the Translation tasks. In our evaluations, the gpt-3.5-turbo model significantly outperforms WizardCoder by achieving impressive Pass@3 accuracy in model optimization (55% compared to 0% by WizardCoder), experiment tracking (100%, compared to 62.5% by WizardCoder), model registration (92% compared to 42% by WizardCoder) and hyperparameter optimization (83% compared to 58% by WizardCoder) on average, in their best possible settings, showcasing its superior code adaptability performance in complex MLOps tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The increasing integration of machine learning algorithms in daily life underscores the critical need for fairness and equity in their deployment. As these technologies play a pivotal role in decision-making, addressing biases across diverse subpopulation groups, including age, gender, and race, becomes paramount. Automatic affect analysis, at the intersection of physiology, psychology, and machine learning, has seen significant development. However, existing databases and methodologies lack uniformity, leading to biased evaluations. This work addresses these issues by analyzing six affective databases, annotating demographic attributes, and proposing a common protocol for database partitioning. Emphasis is placed on fairness in evaluations. Extensive experiments with baseline and state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the impact of these changes, revealing the inadequacy of prior assessments. The findings underscore the importance of considering demographic attributes in affect analysis research and provide a foundation for more equitable methodologies.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>It is now possible to estimate 3D human pose from monocular images with off-the-shelf 3D pose estimators. However, many practical applications require fine-grained absolute pose information for which multi-view cues and camera calibration are necessary. Such multi-view recordings are laborious because they require manual calibration, and are expensive when using dedicated hardware. Our goal is full automation, which includes temporal synchronization, as well as intrinsic and extrinsic camera calibration. This is done by using persons in the scene as the calibration objects. Existing methods either address only synchronization or calibration, assume one of the former as input, or have significant limitations. A common limitation is that they only consider single persons, which eases correspondence finding. We attain this generality by partitioning the high-dimensional time and calibration space into a cascade of subspaces and introduce tailored algorithms to optimize each efficiently and robustly. The outcome is an easy-to-use, flexible, and robust motion capture toolbox that we release to enable scientific applications, which we demonstrate on diverse multi-view benchmarks.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vision graph neural networks (ViG) offer a new avenue for exploration in computer vision. A major bottleneck in ViGs is the inefficient k-nearest neighbor (KNN) operation used for graph construction. To solve this issue, we propose a new method for designing ViGs, Dynamic Axial Graph Construction (DAGC), which is more efficient than KNN as it limits the number of considered graph connections made within an image. Additionally, we propose a novel CNN-GNN architecture, GreedyViG, which uses DAGC. Extensive experiments show that GreedyViG beats existing ViG, CNN, and ViT architectures in terms of accuracy, GMACs, and parameters on image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation tasks. Our smallest model, GreedyViG-S, achieves 81.1% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, 2.9% higher than Vision GNN and 2.2% higher than Vision HyperGraph Neural Network (ViHGNN), with less GMACs and a similar number of parameters. Our largest model, GreedyViG-B obtains 83.9% top-1 accuracy, 0.2% higher than Vision GNN, with a 66.6% decrease in parameters and a 69% decrease in GMACs. GreedyViG-B also obtains the same accuracy as ViHGNN with a 67.3% decrease in parameters and a 71.3% decrease in GMACs. Our work shows that hybrid CNN-GNN architectures not only provide a new avenue for designing efficient models, but that they can also exceed the performance of current state-of-the-art models.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been used to create models for many complex analysis problems like image recognition and medical diagnosis. DNNs are a popular tool within machine learning due to their ability to model complex patterns and distributions. However, the performance of these networks is highly dependent on the quality of the data used to train the models. Two characteristics of these sets, noisy labels and training set biases, are known to frequently cause poor generalization performance as a result of overfitting to the training set. This paper aims to solve this problem using the approach proposed by Ren et al. (2018) using meta-training and online weight approximation. We will first implement a toy-problem to crudely verify the claims made by the authors of Ren et al.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative AI models are often used to perform mimicry attacks, where a pretrained model is fine-tuned on a small sample of images to learn to mimic a specific artist of interest. While researchers have introduced multiple anti-mimicry protection tools (Mist, Glaze, Anti-Dreambooth), recent evidence points to a growing trend of mimicry models using videos as sources of training data. This paper presents our experiences exploring techniques to disrupt style mimicry on video imagery. We first validate that mimicry attacks can succeed by training on individual frames extracted from videos. We show that while anti-mimicry tools can offer protection when applied to individual frames, this approach is vulnerable to an adaptive countermeasure that removes protection by exploiting randomness in optimization results of consecutive (nearly-identical) frames. We develop a new, tool-agnostic framework that segments videos into short scenes based on frame-level similarity, and use a per-scene optimization baseline to remove inter-frame randomization while reducing computational cost. We show via both image level metrics and an end-to-end user study that the resulting protection restores protection against mimicry (including the countermeasure). Finally, we develop another adaptive countermeasure and find that it falls short against our framework.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In recent years, genetic programming (GP)-based evolutionary feature construction has achieved significant success. However, a primary challenge with evolutionary feature construction is its tendency to overfit the training data, resulting in poor generalization on unseen data. In this research, we draw inspiration from PAC-Bayesian theory and propose using sharpness-aware minimization in function space to discover symbolic features that exhibit robust performance within a smooth loss landscape in the semantic space. By optimizing sharpness in conjunction with cross-validation loss, as well as designing a sharpness reduction layer, the proposed method effectively mitigates the overfitting problem of GP, especially when dealing with a limited number of instances or in the presence of label noise. Experimental results on 58 real-world regression datasets show that our approach outperforms standard GP as well as six state-of-the-art complexity measurement methods for GP in controlling overfitting. Furthermore, the ensemble version of GP with sharpness-aware minimization demonstrates superior performance compared to nine fine-tuned machine learning and symbolic regression algorithms, including XGBoost and LightGBM.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Existing action quality assessment (AQA) methods mainly learn deep representations at the video level for scoring diverse actions. Due to the lack of a fine-grained understanding of actions in videos, they harshly suffer from low credibility and interpretability, thus insufficient for stringent applications, such as Olympic diving events. We argue that a fine-grained understanding of actions requires the model to perceive and parse actions in both time and space, which is also the key to the credibility and interpretability of the AQA technique. Based on this insight, we propose a new fine-grained spatial-temporal action parser named \textbf{FineParser}. It learns human-centric foreground action representations by focusing on target action regions within each frame and exploiting their fine-grained alignments in time and space to minimize the impact of invalid backgrounds during the assessment. In addition, we construct fine-grained annotations of human-centric foreground action masks for the FineDiving dataset, called \textbf{FineDiving-HM}. With refined annotations on diverse target action procedures, FineDiving-HM can promote the development of real-world AQA systems. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of FineParser, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods while supporting more tasks of fine-grained action understanding.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Event relation extraction (ERE) is a critical and fundamental challenge for natural language processing. Existing work mainly focuses on directly modeling the entire document, which cannot effectively handle long-range dependencies and information redundancy. To address these issues, we propose a cluster-aware compression method for improving event relation extraction (TacoERE), which explores a compression-then-extraction paradigm. Specifically, we first introduce document clustering for modeling event dependencies. It splits the document into intra- and inter-clusters, where intra-clusters aim to enhance the relations within the same cluster, while inter-clusters attempt to model the related events at arbitrary distances. Secondly, we utilize cluster summarization to simplify and highlight important text content of clusters for mitigating information redundancy and event distance. We have conducted extensive experiments on both pre-trained language models, such as RoBERTa, and large language models, such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, on three ERE datasets, i.e., MAVEN-ERE, EventStoryLine and HiEve. Experimental results demonstrate that TacoERE is an effective method for ERE.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Efficient and robust data clustering remains a challenging task in the field of data analysis. Recent efforts have explored the integration of granular-ball (GB) computing with clustering algorithms to address this challenge, yielding promising results. However, existing methods for generating GBs often rely on single indicators to measure GB quality and employ threshold-based or greedy strategies, potentially leading to GBs that do not accurately capture the underlying data distribution. To address these limitations, this article introduces a novel GB generation method. The originality of this method lies in leveraging the principle of justifiable granularity to measure the quality of a GB for clustering tasks. To be precise, we define the coverage and specificity of a GB and introduce a comprehensive measure for assessing GB quality. Utilizing this quality measure, the method incorporates a binary tree pruning-based strategy and an anomaly detection method to determine the best combination of sub-GBs for each GB and identify abnormal GBs, respectively. Compared to previous GB generation methods, the new method maximizes the overall quality of generated GBs while ensuring alignment with the data distribution, thereby enhancing the rationality of the generated GBs. Experimental results obtained from both synthetic and publicly available datasets underscore the effectiveness of the proposed GB generation method, showcasing improvements in clustering accuracy and normalized mutual information.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Since their inception, programming languages have trended towards greater readability and lower barriers for programmers. Following this trend, natural language can be a promising type of programming language that provides great flexibility and usability and helps towards the democracy of programming. However, the inherent vagueness, ambiguity, and verbosity of natural language pose significant challenges in developing an interpreter that can accurately understand the programming logic and execute instructions written in natural language. Fortunately, recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in interpreting complex natural language. Inspired by this, we develop a novel system for Code Representation and Execution (CoRE), which employs LLM as interpreter to interpret and execute natural language instructions. The proposed system unifies natural language programming, pseudo-code programming, and flow programming under the same representation for constructing language agents, while LLM serves as the interpreter to interpret and execute the agent programs. In this paper, we begin with defining the programming syntax that structures natural language instructions logically. During the execution, we incorporate external memory to minimize redundancy. Furthermore, we equip the designed interpreter with the capability to invoke external tools, compensating for the limitations of LLM in specialized domains or when accessing real-time information.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While our understanding of fairness in machine learning has significantly progressed, our understanding of fairness in reinforcement learning (RL) remains nascent. Most of the attention has been on fairness in one-shot classification tasks; however, real-world, RL-enabled systems (e.g., autonomous vehicles) are much more complicated in that agents operate in dynamic environments over a long period of time. To ensure the responsible development and deployment of these systems, we must better understand fairness in RL. In this paper, we survey the literature to provide the most up-to-date snapshot of the frontiers of fairness in RL. We start by reviewing where fairness considerations can arise in RL, then discuss the various definitions of fairness in RL that have been put forth thus far. We continue to highlight the methodologies researchers used to implement fairness in single- and multi-agent RL systems before showcasing the distinct application domains that fair RL has been investigated in. Finally, we critically examine gaps in the literature, such as understanding fairness in the context of RLHF, that still need to be addressed in future work to truly operationalize fair RL in real-world systems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose a generative flow-induced neural architecture search algorithm. The proposed approach devices simple feed-forward neural networks to learn stochastic policies to generate sequences of architecture hyperparameters such that the generated states are in proportion with the reward from the terminal state. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed search algorithm on the wavelet neural operator (WNO), where we learn a policy to generate a sequence of hyperparameters like wavelet basis and activation operators for wavelet integral blocks. While the trajectory of the generated wavelet basis and activation sequence is cast as flow, the policy is learned by minimizing the flow violation between each state in the trajectory and maximizing the reward from the terminal state. In the terminal state, we train WNO simultaneously to guide the search. We propose to use the exponent of the negative of the WNO loss on the validation dataset as the reward function. While the grid search-based neural architecture generation algorithms foresee every combination, the proposed framework generates the most probable sequence based on the positive reward from the terminal state, thereby reducing exploration time. Compared to reinforcement learning schemes, where complete episodic training is required to get the reward, the proposed algorithm generates the hyperparameter trajectory sequentially. Through four fluid mechanics-oriented problems, we illustrate that the learned policies can sample the best-performing architecture of the neural operator, thereby improving the performance of the vanilla wavelet neural operator.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We tackle the common challenge of inter-concept visual confusion in compositional concept generation using text-guided diffusion models (TGDMs). It becomes even more pronounced in the generation of customized concepts, due to the scarcity of user-provided concept visual examples. By revisiting the two major stages leading to the success of TGDMs -- 1) contrastive image-language pre-training (CLIP) for text encoder that encodes visual semantics, and 2) training TGDM that decodes the textual embeddings into pixels -- we point that existing customized generation methods only focus on fine-tuning the second stage while overlooking the first one. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective solution called CLIF: contrastive image-language fine-tuning. Specifically, given a few samples of customized concepts, we obtain non-confusing textual embeddings of a concept by fine-tuning CLIP via contrasting a concept and the over-segmented visual regions of other concepts. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of CLIF in preventing the confusion of multi-customized concept generation.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Super-resolution from motion-blurred images poses a significant challenge due to the combined effects of motion blur and low spatial resolution. To address this challenge, this paper introduces an Event-based Blurry Super Resolution Network (EBSR-Net), which leverages the high temporal resolution of events to mitigate motion blur and improve high-resolution image prediction. Specifically, we propose a multi-scale center-surround event representation to fully capture motion and texture information inherent in events. Additionally, we design a symmetric cross-modal attention module to fully exploit the complementarity between blurry images and events. Furthermore, we introduce an intermodal residual group composed of several residual dense Swin Transformer blocks, each incorporating multiple Swin Transformer layers and a residual connection, to extract global context and facilitate inter-block feature aggregation. Extensive experiments show that our method compares favorably against state-of-the-art approaches and achieves remarkable performance.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Existing subject-driven text-to-image generation models suffer from tedious fine-tuning steps and struggle to maintain both text-image alignment and subject fidelity. For generating compositional subjects, it often encounters problems such as object missing and attribute mixing, where some subjects in the input prompt are not generated or their attributes are incorrectly combined. To address these limitations, we propose a subject-driven generation framework and introduce training-free guidance to intervene in the generative process during inference time. This approach strengthens the attention map, allowing for precise attribute binding and feature injection for each subject. Notably, our method exhibits exceptional zero-shot generation ability, especially in the challenging task of compositional generation. Furthermore, we propose a novel metric GroundingScore to evaluate subject alignment thoroughly. The obtained quantitative results serve as compelling evidence showcasing the effectiveness of our proposed method. The code will be released soon.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Open-set Semi-supervised Learning (OSSL) holds a realistic setting that unlabeled data may come from classes unseen in the labeled set, i.e., out-of-distribution (OOD) data, which could cause performance degradation in conventional SSL models. To handle this issue, except for the traditional in-distribution (ID) classifier, some existing OSSL approaches employ an extra OOD detection module to avoid the potential negative impact of the OOD data. Nevertheless, these approaches typically employ the entire set of open-set data during their training process, which may contain data unfriendly to the OSSL task that can negatively influence the model performance. This inspires us to develop a robust open-set data selection strategy for OSSL. Through a theoretical understanding from the perspective of learning theory, we propose Wise Open-set Semi-supervised Learning (WiseOpen), a generic OSSL framework that selectively leverages the open-set data for training the model. By applying a gradient-variance-based selection mechanism, WiseOpen exploits a friendly subset instead of the whole open-set dataset to enhance the model's capability of ID classification. Moreover, to reduce the computational expense, we also propose two practical variants of WiseOpen by adopting low-frequency update and loss-based selection respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of WiseOpen in comparison with the state-of-the-art.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Anomaly detection is crucial in large-scale industrial manufacturing as it helps detect and localise defective parts. Pre-training feature extractors on large-scale datasets is a popular approach for this task. Stringent data security and privacy regulations and high costs and acquisition time hinder the availability and creation of such large datasets. While recent work in anomaly detection primarily focuses on the development of new methods built on such extractors, the importance of the data used for pre-training has not been studied. Therefore, we evaluated the performance of eight state-of-the-art methods pre-trained using dynamically generated fractal images on the famous benchmark datasets MVTec and VisA. In contrast to existing literature, which predominantly examines the transfer-learning capabilities of fractals, in this study, we compare models pre-trained with fractal images against those pre-trained with ImageNet, without subsequent fine-tuning. Although pre-training with ImageNet remains a clear winner, the results of fractals are promising considering that the anomaly detection task required features capable of discerning even minor visual variations. This opens up the possibility for a new research direction where feature extractors could be trained on synthetically generated abstract datasets reconciling the ever-increasing demand for data in machine learning while circumventing privacy and security concerns.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Spelling correction is the task of identifying spelling mistakes, typos, and grammatical mistakes in a given text and correcting them according to their context and grammatical structure. This work introduces "AraSpell," a framework for Arabic spelling correction using different seq2seq model architectures such as Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Transformer with artificial data generation for error injection, trained on more than 6.9 Million Arabic sentences. Thorough experimental studies provide empirical evidence of the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which achieved 4.8% and 1.11% word error rate (WER) and character error rate (CER), respectively, in comparison with labeled data of 29.72% WER and 5.03% CER. Our approach achieved 2.9% CER and 10.65% WER in comparison with labeled data of 10.02% CER and 50.94% WER. Both of these results are obtained on a test set of 100K sentences.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Temporal Point Processes (TPPs), especially Hawkes Process are commonly used for modeling asynchronous event sequences data such as financial transactions and user behaviors in social networks. Due to the strong fitting ability of neural networks, various neural Temporal Point Processes are proposed, among which the Neural Hawkes Processes based on self-attention such as Transformer Hawkes Process (THP) achieve distinct performance improvement. Although the THP has gained increasing studies, it still suffers from the {sequence prediction issue}, i.e., training on history sequences and inferencing about the future, which is a prevalent paradigm in realistic sequence analysis tasks. What's more, conventional THP and its variants simply adopt initial sinusoid embedding in transformers, which shows performance sensitivity to temporal change or noise in sequence data analysis by our empirical study. To deal with the problems, we propose a new Rotary Position Embedding-based THP (RoTHP) architecture in this paper. Notably, we show the translation invariance property and {sequence prediction flexibility} of our RoTHP induced by the {relative time embeddings} when coupled with Hawkes process theoretically. Furthermore, we demonstrate empirically that our RoTHP can be better generalized in sequence data scenarios with timestamp translations and in sequence prediction tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Conventional synchronous federated learning (SFL) frameworks suffer from performance degradation in heterogeneous systems due to imbalanced local data size and diverse computing power on the client side. To address this problem, asynchronous FL (AFL) and semi-asynchronous FL have been proposed to recover the performance loss by allowing asynchronous aggregation. However, asynchronous aggregation incurs a new problem of inconsistency between local updates and global updates. Motivated by the issues of conventional SFL and AFL, we first propose a time-driven SFL (T-SFL) framework for heterogeneous systems. The core idea of T-SFL is that the server aggregates the models from different clients, each with varying numbers of iterations, at regular time intervals. To evaluate the learning performance of T-SFL, we provide an upper bound on the global loss function. Further, we optimize the aggregation weights to minimize the developed upper bound. Then, we develop a discriminative model selection (DMS) algorithm that removes local models from clients whose number of iterations falls below a predetermined threshold. In particular, this algorithm ensures that each client's aggregation weight accurately reflects its true contribution to the global model update, thereby improving the efficiency and robustness of the system. To validate the effectiveness of T-SFL with the DMS algorithm, we conduct extensive experiments using several popular datasets including MNIST, Cifar-10, Fashion-MNIST, and SVHN. The experimental results demonstrate that T-SFL with the DMS algorithm can reduce the latency of conventional SFL by 50\%, while achieving an average 3\% improvement in learning accuracy over state-of-the-art AFL algorithms.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While nationality is a pivotal demographic element that enhances the performance of language models, it has received far less scrutiny regarding inherent biases. This study investigates nationality bias in ChatGPT (GPT-3.5), a large language model (LLM) designed for text generation. The research covers 195 countries, 4 temperature settings, and 3 distinct prompt types, generating 4,680 discourses about nationality descriptions in Chinese and English. Automated metrics were used to analyze the nationality bias, and expert annotators alongside ChatGPT itself evaluated the perceived bias. The results show that ChatGPT's generated discourses are predominantly positive, especially compared to its predecessor, GPT-2. However, when prompted with negative inclinations, it occasionally produces negative content. Despite ChatGPT considering its generated text as neutral, it shows consistent self-awareness about nationality bias when subjected to the same pair-wise comparison annotation framework used by human annotators. In conclusion, while ChatGPT's generated texts seem friendly and positive, they reflect the inherent nationality biases in the real world. This bias may vary across different language versions of ChatGPT, indicating diverse cultural perspectives. The study highlights the subtle and pervasive nature of biases within LLMs, emphasizing the need for further scrutiny.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, steal, data-free</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep reinforcement learning policies, which are integral to modern control systems, represent valuable intellectual property. The development of these policies demands considerable resources, such as domain expertise, simulation fidelity, and real-world validation. These policies are potentially vulnerable to model stealing attacks, which aim to replicate their functionality using only black-box access. In this paper, we propose Stealthy Imitation, the first attack designed to steal policies without access to the environment or knowledge of the input range. This setup has not been considered by previous model stealing methods. Lacking access to the victim's input states distribution, Stealthy Imitation fits a reward model that allows to approximate it. We show that the victim policy is harder to imitate when the distribution of the attack queries matches that of the victim. We evaluate our approach across diverse, high-dimensional control tasks and consistently outperform prior data-free approaches adapted for policy stealing. Lastly, we propose a countermeasure that significantly diminishes the effectiveness of the attack.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Group fairness for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which emphasizes algorithmic decisions neither favoring nor harming certain groups defined by sensitive attributes (e.g., race and gender), has gained considerable attention. In particular, the objective of group fairness is to ensure that the decisions made by GNNs are independent of the sensitive attribute. To achieve this objective, most existing approaches involve eliminating sensitive attribute information in node representations or algorithmic decisions. However, such ways may also eliminate task-related information due to its inherent correlation with the sensitive attribute, leading to a sacrifice in utility. In this work, we focus on improving the fairness of GNNs while preserving task-related information and propose a fair GNN framework named FairSAD. Instead of eliminating sensitive attribute information, FairSAD enhances the fairness of GNNs via Sensitive Attribute Disentanglement (SAD), which separates the sensitive attribute-related information into an independent component to mitigate its impact. Additionally, FairSAD utilizes a channel masking mechanism to adaptively identify the sensitive attribute-related component and subsequently decorrelates it. Overall, FairSAD minimizes the impact of the sensitive attribute on GNN outcomes rather than eliminating sensitive attributes, thereby preserving task-related information associated with the sensitive attribute. Furthermore, experiments conducted on several real-world datasets demonstrate that FairSAD outperforms other state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin in terms of both fairness and utility performance.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advancements in light field super-resolution (SR) have yielded impressive results. In practice, however, many existing methods are limited by assuming fixed degradation models, such as bicubic downsampling, which hinders their robustness in real-world scenarios with complex degradations. To address this limitation, we present LF-DEST, an effective blind Light Field SR method that incorporates explicit Degradation Estimation to handle various degradation types. LF-DEST consists of two primary components: degradation estimation and light field restoration. The former concurrently estimates blur kernels and noise maps from low-resolution degraded light fields, while the latter generates super-resolved light fields based on the estimated degradations. Notably, we introduce a modulated and selective fusion module that intelligently combines degradation representations with image information, allowing for effective handling of diverse degradation types. We conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, demonstrating that LF-DEST achieves superior performance across a variety of degradation scenarios in light field SR.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, attack, membership infer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recommender systems have been successfully applied in many applications. Nonetheless, recent studies demonstrate that recommender systems are vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIAs), leading to the leakage of users' membership privacy. However, existing MIAs relying on shadow training suffer a large performance drop when the attacker lacks knowledge of the training data distribution and the model architecture of the target recommender system. To better understand the privacy risks of recommender systems, we propose shadow-free MIAs that directly leverage a user's recommendations for membership inference. Without shadow training, the proposed attack can conduct MIAs efficiently and effectively under a practice scenario where the attacker is given only black-box access to the target recommender system. The proposed attack leverages an intuition that the recommender system personalizes a user's recommendations if his historical interactions are used by it. Thus, an attacker can infer membership privacy by determining whether the recommendations are more similar to the interactions or the general popular items. We conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets across various recommender systems. Remarkably, our attack achieves far better attack accuracy with low false positive rates than baselines while with a much lower computational cost.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose a novel Bayesian approach for the adaptive and online estimation of the frequency distribution of a finite number of categories under the local differential privacy (LDP) framework. The proposed algorithm performs Bayesian parameter estimation via posterior sampling and adapts the randomization mechanism for LDP based on the obtained posterior samples. We propose a randomized mechanism for LDP which uses a subset of categories as an input and whose performance depends on the selected subset and the true frequency distribution. By using the posterior sample as an estimate of the frequency distribution, the algorithm performs a computationally tractable subset selection step to maximize the utility of the privatized response of the next user. We propose several utility functions related to well-known information metrics, such as (but not limited to) Fisher information matrix, total variation distance, and information entropy. We compare each of these utility metrics in terms of their computational complexity. We employ stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics for posterior sampling, a computationally efficient approximate Markov chain Monte Carlo method. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that (i) the posterior distribution targeted by the algorithm converges to the true parameter even for approximate posterior sampling, and (ii) the algorithm selects the optimal subset with high probability if posterior sampling is performed exactly. We also provide numerical results that empirically demonstrate the estimation accuracy of our algorithm where we compare it with nonadaptive and semi-adaptive approaches under experimental settings with various combinations of privacy parameters and population distribution parameters.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The reliance on accurate camera poses is a significant barrier to the widespread deployment of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) models for 3D reconstruction and SLAM tasks. The existing method introduces monocular depth priors to jointly optimize the camera poses and NeRF, which fails to fully exploit the depth priors and neglects the impact of their inherent noise. In this paper, we propose Truncated Depth NeRF (TD-NeRF), a novel approach that enables training NeRF from unknown camera poses - by jointly optimizing learnable parameters of the radiance field and camera poses. Our approach explicitly utilizes monocular depth priors through three key advancements: 1) we propose a novel depth-based ray sampling strategy based on the truncated normal distribution, which improves the convergence speed and accuracy of pose estimation; 2) to circumvent local minima and refine depth geometry, we introduce a coarse-to-fine training strategy that progressively improves the depth precision; 3) we propose a more robust inter-frame point constraint that enhances robustness against depth noise during training. The experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that TD-NeRF achieves superior performance in the joint optimization of camera pose and NeRF, surpassing prior works, and generates more accurate depth geometry.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we show that transferring knowledge from other domains of video understanding combined with large-scale learning can improve robustness of Video Object Segmentation (VOS) under complex circumstances. Namely, we focus on integrating scene global motion knowledge to improve large-scale semi-supervised Video Object Segmentation. Prior works on VOS mostly rely on direct comparison of semantic and contextual features to perform dense matching between current and past frames, passing over actual motion structure. On the other hand, Optical Flow Estimation task aims to approximate the scene motion field, exposing global motion patterns which are typically undiscoverable during all pairs similarity search. We present WarpFormer, an architecture for semi-supervised Video Object Segmentation that exploits existing knowledge in motion understanding to conduct smoother propagation and more accurate matching. Our framework employs a generic pretrained Optical Flow Estimation network whose prediction is used to warp both past frames and instance segmentation masks to the current frame domain. Consequently, warped segmentation masks are refined and fused together aiming to inpaint occluded regions and eliminate artifacts caused by flow field imperfects. Additionally, we employ novel large-scale MOSE 2023 dataset to train model on various complex scenarios. Our method demonstrates strong performance on DAVIS 2016/2017 validation (93.0% and 85.9%), DAVIS 2017 test-dev (80.6%) and YouTube-VOS 2019 validation (83.8%) that is competitive with alternative state-of-the-art methods while using much simpler memory mechanism and instance understanding logic.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Remote sensing images captured by different platforms exhibit significant disparities in spatial resolution. Large scale factor super-resolution (SR) algorithms are vital for maximizing the utilization of low-resolution (LR) satellite data captured from orbit. However, existing methods confront challenges in recovering SR images with clear textures and correct ground objects. We introduce a novel framework, the Semantic Guided Diffusion Model (SGDM), designed for large scale factor remote sensing image super-resolution. The framework exploits a pre-trained generative model as a prior to generate perceptually plausible SR images. We further enhance the reconstruction by incorporating vector maps, which carry structural and semantic cues. Moreover, pixel-level inconsistencies in paired remote sensing images, stemming from sensor-specific imaging characteristics, may hinder the convergence of the model and diversity in generated results. To address this problem, we propose to extract the sensor-specific imaging characteristics and model the distribution of them, allowing diverse SR images generation based on imaging characteristics provided by reference images or sampled from the imaging characteristic probability distributions. To validate and evaluate our approach, we create the Cross-Modal Super-Resolution Dataset (CMSRD). Qualitative and quantitative experiments on CMSRD showcase the superiority and broad applicability of our method. Experimental results on downstream vision tasks also demonstrate the utilitarian of the generated SR images. The dataset and code will be publicly available at this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This work proposes a time series prediction method based on the kernel view of linear reservoirs. In particular, the time series motifs of the reservoir kernel are used as representational basis on which general readouts are constructed. We provide a geometric interpretation of our approach shedding light on how our approach is related to the core reservoir models and in what way the two approaches differ. Empirical experiments then compare predictive performances of our suggested model with those of recent state-of-art transformer based models, as well as the established recurrent network model - LSTM. The experiments are performed on both univariate and multivariate time series and with a variety of prediction horizons. Rather surprisingly we show that even when linear readout is employed, our method has the capacity to outperform transformer models on univariate time series and attain competitive results on multivariate benchmark datasets. We conclude that simple models with easily controllable capacity but capturing enough memory and subsequence structure can outperform potentially over-complicated deep learning models. This does not mean that reservoir motif based models are preferable to other more complex alternatives - rather, when introducing a new complex time series model one should employ as a sanity check simple, but potentially powerful alternatives/baselines such as reservoir models or the models introduced here.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Emerging unsupervised reconstruction techniques based on implicit neural representation (INR), such as NeRP, CoIL, and SCOPE, have shown unique capabilities in CT linear inverse imaging. In this work, we propose a novel unsupervised density neural representation (Diner) to tackle the challenging problem of CT metal artifacts when scanned objects contain metals. The drastic variation of linear attenuation coefficients (LACs) of metals over X-ray spectra leads to a nonlinear beam hardening effect (BHE) in CT measurements. Recovering CT images from metal-affected measurements therefore poses a complicated nonlinear inverse problem. Existing metal artifact reduction (MAR) techniques mostly formulate the MAR as an image inpainting task, which ignores the energy-induced BHE and produces suboptimal performance. Instead, our Diner introduces an energy-dependent polychromatic CT forward model to the INR framework, addressing the nonlinear nature of the MAR problem. Specifically, we decompose the energy-dependent LACs into energy-independent densities and energy-dependent mass attenuation coefficients (MACs) by fully considering the physical model of X-ray absorption. Using the densities as pivot variables and the MACs as known prior knowledge, the LACs can be accurately reconstructed from the raw measurements. Technically, we represent the unknown density map as an implicit function of coordinates. Combined with a novel differentiable forward model simulating the physical acquisition from the densities to the measurements, our Diner optimizes a multi-layer perception network to approximate the implicit function by minimizing predicted errors between the estimated and real measurements. Experimental results on simulated and real datasets confirm the superiority of our unsupervised Diner against popular supervised techniques in MAR performance and robustness.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Lengthy documents pose a unique challenge to neural language models due to substantial memory consumption. While existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models segment long texts into equal-length snippets (e.g., 128 tokens per snippet) or deploy sparse attention networks, these methods have new challenges of context fragmentation and generalizability due to sentence boundaries and varying text lengths. For example, our empirical analysis has shown that SOTA models consistently overfit one set of lengthy documents (e.g., 2000 tokens) while performing worse on texts with other lengths (e.g., 1000 or 4000). In this study, we propose a Length-Aware Multi-Kernel Transformer (LAMKIT) to address the new challenges for the long document classification. LAMKIT encodes lengthy documents by diverse transformer-based kernels for bridging context boundaries and vectorizes text length by the kernels to promote model robustness over varying document lengths. Experiments on five standard benchmarks from health and law domains show LAMKIT outperforms SOTA models up to an absolute 10.9% improvement. We conduct extensive ablation analyses to examine model robustness and effectiveness over varying document lengths.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Containerization has emerged as a revolutionary technology in the software development and deployment industry. Containers offer a portable and lightweight solution that allows for packaging applications and their dependencies systematically and efficiently. In addition, containers offer faster deployment and near-native performance with isolation and security drawbacks compared to Virtual Machines. To address the security issues, scanning tools that scan containers for preexisting vulnerabilities have been developed, but they suffer from false positives. Moreover, using different scanning tools to scan the same container provides different results, which leads to inconsistencies and confusion. Limited work has been done to address these issues. This paper provides a fully functional and extensible framework named LUCID that can reduce false positives and inconsistencies provided by multiple scanning tools. We use a database-centric approach and perform query-based analysis, to pinpoint the causes for inconsistencies. Our results show that our framework can reduce inconsistencies by 70%. The framework has been tested on both Intel64/AMD64 and ARM architecture. We also create a Dynamic Classification component that can successfully classify and predict the different severity levels with an accuracy of 84%. We believe this paper will raise awareness regarding security in container technologies and enable container scanning companies to improve their tool to provide better and more consistent results.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Chip design is about to be revolutionized by the integration of large language, multimodal, and circuit models (collectively LxMs). While exploring this exciting frontier with tremendous potential, the community must also carefully consider the related security risks and the need for building trust into using LxMs for chip design. First, we review the recent surge of using LxMs for chip design in general. We cover state-of-the-art works for the automation of hardware description language code generation and for scripting and guidance of essential but cumbersome tasks for electronic design automation tools, e.g., design-space exploration, tuning, or designer training. Second, we raise and provide initial answers to novel research questions on critical issues for security and trustworthiness of LxM-powered chip design from both the attack and defense perspectives.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advancements in the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) with physical sciences have led to significant progress in addressing complex phenomena governed by nonlinear partial differential equations (PDE). This paper explores the application of novel operator learning methodologies to unravel the intricate dynamics of flame instability, particularly focusing on hybrid instabilities arising from the coexistence of Darrieus-Landau (DL) and Diffusive-Thermal (DT) mechanisms. Training datasets encompass a wide range of parameter configurations, enabling the learning of parametric solution advancement operators using techniques such as parametric Fourier Neural Operator (pFNO), and parametric convolutional neural networks (pCNN). Results demonstrate the efficacy of these methods in accurately predicting short-term and long-term flame evolution across diverse parameter regimes, capturing the characteristic behaviors of pure and blended instabilities. Comparative analyses reveal pFNO as the most accurate model for learning short-term solutions, while all models exhibit robust performance in capturing the nuanced dynamics of flame evolution. This research contributes to the development of robust modeling frameworks for understanding and controlling complex physical processes governed by nonlinear PDE.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This research develops advanced methodologies for Large Language Models (LLMs) to better manage linguistic behaviors related to emotions and ethics. We introduce DIKE, an adversarial framework that enhances the LLMs' ability to internalize and reflect global human values, adapting to varied cultural contexts to promote transparency and trust among users. The methodology involves detailed modeling of emotions, classification of linguistic behaviors, and implementation of ethical guardrails. Our innovative approaches include mapping emotions and behaviors using self-supervised learning techniques, refining these guardrails through adversarial reviews, and systematically adjusting outputs to ensure ethical alignment. This framework establishes a robust foundation for AI systems to operate with ethical integrity and cultural sensitivity, paving the way for more responsible and context-aware AI interactions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Meta-learning methods typically learn tasks under the assumption that all tasks are equally important. However, this assumption is often not valid. In real-world applications, tasks can vary both in their importance during different training stages and in whether they contain noisy labeled data or not, making a uniform approach suboptimal. To address these issues, we propose the Data-Efficient and Robust Task Selection (DERTS) algorithm, which can be incorporated into both gradient and metric-based meta-learning algorithms. DERTS selects weighted subsets of tasks from task pools by minimizing the approximation error of the full gradient of task pools in the meta-training stage. The selected tasks are efficient for rapid training and robust towards noisy label scenarios. Unlike existing algorithms, DERTS does not require any architecture modification for training and can handle noisy label data in both the support and query sets. Analysis of DERTS shows that the algorithm follows similar training dynamics as learning on the full task pools. Experiments show that DERTS outperforms existing sampling strategies for meta-learning on both gradient-based and metric-based meta-learning algorithms in limited data budget and noisy task settings.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper explores the efficacy of diffusion-based generative models as neural operators for partial differential equations (PDEs). Neural operators are neural networks that learn a mapping from the parameter space to the solution space of PDEs from data, and they can also solve the inverse problem of estimating the parameter from the solution. Diffusion models excel in many domains, but their potential as neural operators has not been thoroughly explored. In this work, we show that diffusion-based generative models exhibit many properties favourable for neural operators, and they can effectively generate the solution of a PDE conditionally on the parameter or recover the unobserved parts of the system. We propose to train a single model adaptable to multiple tasks, by alternating between the tasks during training. In our experiments with multiple realistic dynamical systems, diffusion models outperform other neural operators. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the probabilistic diffusion model can elegantly deal with systems which are only partially identifiable, by producing samples corresponding to the different possible solutions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Semitic morphologically-rich languages (MRLs) are characterized by extreme word ambiguity. Because most vowels are omitted in standard texts, many of the words are homographs with multiple possible analyses, each with a different pronunciation and different morphosyntactic properties. This ambiguity goes beyond word-sense disambiguation (WSD), and may include token segmentation into multiple word units. Previous research on MRLs claimed that standardly trained pre-trained language models (PLMs) based on word-pieces may not sufficiently capture the internal structure of such tokens in order to distinguish between these analyses. Taking Hebrew as a case study, we investigate the extent to which Hebrew homographs can be disambiguated and analyzed using PLMs. We evaluate all existing models for contextualized Hebrew embeddings on a novel Hebrew homograph challenge sets that we deliver. Our empirical results demonstrate that contemporary Hebrew contextualized embeddings outperform non-contextualized embeddings; and that they are most effective for disambiguating segmentation and morphosyntactic features, less so regarding pure word-sense disambiguation. We show that these embeddings are more effective when the number of word-piece splits is limited, and they are more effective for 2-way and 3-way ambiguities than for 4-way ambiguity. We show that the embeddings are equally effective for homographs of both balanced and skewed distributions, whether calculated as masked or unmasked tokens. Finally, we show that these embeddings are as effective for homograph disambiguation with extensive supervised training as with a few-shot setup.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the pursuit of advancing natural language processing for the Italian language, we introduce a state-of-the-art Large Language Model (LLM) based on the novel Meta LLaMA-3 model: LLaMAntino-3-ANITA-8B-Inst-DPO-ITA. We fine-tuned the original 8B parameters instruction tuned model using the Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) technique on the English and Italian language datasets in order to improve the original performance. Consequently, a Dynamic Preference Optimization (DPO) process has been used to align preferences, avoid dangerous and inappropriate answers, and limit biases and prejudices. Our model leverages the efficiency of QLoRA to fine-tune the model on a smaller portion of the original model weights and then adapt the model specifically for the Italian linguistic structure, achieving significant improvements in both performance and computational efficiency. Concurrently, DPO is employed to refine the model's output, ensuring that generated content aligns with quality answers. The synergy between SFT, QLoRA's parameter efficiency and DPO's user-centric optimization results in a robust LLM that excels in a variety of tasks, including but not limited to text completion, zero-shot classification, and contextual understanding. The model has been extensively evaluated over standard benchmarks for the Italian and English languages, showing outstanding results. The model is freely available over the HuggingFace hub and, examples of use can be found in our GitHub repository. this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Ellipse estimation is an important topic in food image processing because it can be leveraged to parameterize plates and bowls, which in turn can be used to estimate camera view angles and food portion sizes. Automatically detecting the elliptical rim of plates and bowls and estimating their ellipse parameters for data "in-the-wild" is challenging: diverse camera angles and plate shapes could have been used for capture, noisy background, multiple non-uniform plates and bowls in the image could be present. Recent advancements in foundational models offer promising capabilities for zero-shot semantic understanding and object segmentation. However, the output mask boundaries for plates and bowls generated by these models often lack consistency and precision compared to traditional ellipse fitting methods. In this paper, we combine ellipse fitting with semantic information extracted by zero-shot foundational models and propose WildEllipseFit, a method to detect and estimate the elliptical rim for plate and bowl. Evaluation on the proposed Yummly-ellipse dataset demonstrates its efficacy and zero-shot capability in real-world scenarios.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have distinguished themselves with outstanding performance in complex language modeling tasks, yet they come with significant computational and storage challenges. This paper explores the potential of quantization to mitigate these challenges. We systematically study the combined application of two well-known post-training techniques, SmoothQuant and GPTQ, and provide a comprehensive analysis of their interactions and implications for advancing LLM quantization. We enhance the versatility of both techniques by enabling quantization to microscaling (MX) formats, expanding their applicability beyond their initial fixed-point format targets. We show that by applying GPTQ and SmoothQuant, and employing MX formats for quantizing models, we can achieve a significant reduction in the size of OPT models by up to 4x and LLaMA models by up to 3x with a negligible perplexity increase of 1-3%.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) is taking the world by storm with its unparalleled content creation ability. Large Language Models (LLMs) are at the forefront of this movement. However, the significant resource demands of LLMs often require cloud hosting, which raises issues regarding privacy, latency, and usage limitations. Although edge intelligence has long been utilized to solve these challenges by enabling real-time AI computation on ubiquitous edge resources close to data sources, most research has focused on traditional AI models and has left a gap in addressing the unique characteristics of LLM inference, such as considerable model size, auto-regressive processes, and self-attention mechanisms. In this paper, we present an edge intelligence optimization problem tailored for LLM inference. Specifically, with the deployment of the batching technique and model quantization on resource-limited edge devices, we formulate an inference model for transformer decoder-based LLMs. Furthermore, our approach aims to maximize the inference throughput via batch scheduling and joint allocation of communication and computation resources, while also considering edge resource constraints and varying user requirements of latency and accuracy. To address this NP-hard problem, we develop an optimal Depth-First Tree-Searching algorithm with online tree-Pruning (DFTSP) that operates within a feasible time complexity. Simulation results indicate that DFTSP surpasses other batching benchmarks in throughput across diverse user settings and quantization techniques, and it reduces time complexity by over 45% compared to the brute-force searching method.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Watermark has been widely deployed by industry to detect AI-generated images. A recent watermarking framework called \emph{Stable Signature} (proposed by Meta) roots watermark into the parameters of a diffusion model's decoder such that its generated images are inherently watermarked. Stable Signature makes it possible to watermark images generated by \emph{open-source} diffusion models and was claimed to be robust against removal attacks. In this work, we propose a new attack to remove the watermark from a diffusion model by fine-tuning it. Our results show that our attack can effectively remove the watermark from a diffusion model such that its generated images are non-watermarked, while maintaining the visual quality of the generated images. Our results highlight that Stable Signature is not as stable as previously thought.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In multi-modal learning, some modalities are more influential than others, and their absence can have a significant impact on classification/segmentation accuracy. Hence, an important research question is if it is possible for trained multi-modal models to have high accuracy even when influential modalities are absent from the input data. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Meta-learned Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation (MCKD) to address this research question. MCKD adaptively estimates the importance weight of each modality through a meta-learning process. These dynamically learned modality importance weights are used in a pairwise cross-modal knowledge distillation process to transfer the knowledge from the modalities with higher importance weight to the modalities with lower importance weight. This cross-modal knowledge distillation produces a highly accurate model even with the absence of influential modalities. Differently from previous methods in the field, our approach is designed to work in multiple tasks (e.g., segmentation and classification) with minimal adaptation. Experimental results on the Brain tumor Segmentation Dataset 2018 (BraTS2018) and the Audiovision-MNIST classification dataset demonstrate the superiority of MCKD over current state-of-the-art models. Particularly in BraTS2018, we achieve substantial improvements of 3.51\% for enhancing tumor, 2.19\% for tumor core, and 1.14\% for the whole tumor in terms of average segmentation Dice score.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Precision agriculture involves the application of advanced technologies to improve agricultural productivity, efficiency, and profitability while minimizing waste and environmental impact. Deep learning approaches enable automated decision-making for many visual tasks. However, in the agricultural domain, variability in growth stages and environmental conditions, such as weather and lighting, presents significant challenges to developing deep learning-based techniques that generalize across different conditions. The resource-intensive nature of creating extensive annotated datasets that capture these variabilities further hinders the widespread adoption of these approaches. To tackle these issues, we introduce a semi-self-supervised domain adaptation technique based on deep convolutional neural networks with a probabilistic diffusion process, requiring minimal manual data annotation. Using only three manually annotated images and a selection of video clips from wheat fields, we generated a large-scale computationally annotated dataset of image-mask pairs and a large dataset of unannotated images extracted from video frames. We developed a two-branch convolutional encoder-decoder model architecture that uses both synthesized image-mask pairs and unannotated images, enabling effective adaptation to real images. The proposed model achieved a Dice score of 80.7\% on an internal test dataset and a Dice score of 64.8\% on an external test set, composed of images from five countries and spanning 18 domains, indicating its potential to develop generalizable solutions that could encourage the wider adoption of advanced technologies in agriculture.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Pedestrian trajectory prediction plays a pivotal role in the realms of autonomous driving and smart cities. Despite extensive prior research employing sequence and generative models, the unpredictable nature of pedestrians, influenced by their social interactions and individual preferences, presents challenges marked by uncertainty and multimodality. In response, we propose the Energy Plan Denoising (EPD) model for stochastic trajectory prediction. EPD initially provides a coarse estimation of the distribution of future trajectories, termed the Plan, utilizing the Langevin Energy Model. Subsequently, it refines this estimation through denoising via the Probabilistic Diffusion Model. By initiating denoising with the Plan, EPD effectively reduces the need for iterative steps, thereby enhancing efficiency. Furthermore, EPD differs from conventional approaches by modeling the distribution of trajectories instead of individual trajectories. This allows for the explicit modeling of pedestrian intrinsic uncertainties and eliminates the need for multiple denoising operations. A single denoising operation produces a distribution from which multiple samples can be drawn, significantly enhancing efficiency. Moreover, EPD's fine-tuning of the Plan contributes to improved model performance. We validate EPD on two publicly available datasets, where it achieves state-of-the-art results. Additionally, ablation experiments underscore the contributions of individual modules, affirming the efficacy of the proposed approach.</li>

However, this processing is pivotal for extracting detailed object insights in areas ranging from autonomous vehicle navigation to medical imaging analyses. Our study introduces a framework aimed at mitigating these challenges by leveraging memory efficient patch based processing for high resolution images. It incorporates a global context representation alongside local patch information, enabling a comprehensive understanding of the image content. In contrast to traditional training methods which are limited by memory constraints, our method enables training of ultra high resolution images. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through superior performance on 7 different benchmarks across classification, object detection, and segmentation. Notably, the proposed method achieves strong performance even on resource-constrained devices like Jetson Nano. Our code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Online Test-Time Adaptation (OTTA) has emerged as an effective strategy to handle distributional shifts, allowing on-the-fly adaptation of pre-trained models to new target domains during inference, without the need for source data. We uncovered that the widely studied entropy minimization (EM) method for OTTA, suffers from noisy gradients due to ambiguity near decision boundaries and incorrect low-entropy predictions. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a novel cosine alignment optimization approach with a dual-objective loss function that refines the precision of class predictions and adaptability to novel domains. Specifically, our method optimizes the cosine similarity between feature vectors and class weight vectors, enhancing the precision of class predictions and the model's adaptability to novel domains. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques and sets a new benchmark in multiple datasets, including CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-100-C, ImageNet-C, Office-Home, and DomainNet datasets, demonstrating high accuracy and robustness against diverse corruptions and domain shifts.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In a fully managed serverless environment, the cloud service provider is responsible for securing the cloud infrastructure, thereby reducing the operational and maintenance efforts of application developers. However, this environment limits the use of existing cybersecurity frameworks and tools, which reduces observability and situational awareness capabilities (e.g., risk assessment, incident response). In addition, existing security frameworks for serverless applications do not generalize well to all application architectures and usually require adaptation, specialized expertise, etc. for use in fully managed serverless environments. In this paper, we introduce a three-layer security scheme for applications deployed in fully managed serverless environments. The first two layers involve a unique ontology based solely on serverless logs which is used to transform them into a unified application activity knowledge graph. In the third layer, we address the need for observability and situational awareness capabilities by implementing two situational awareness tools that utilizes the graph-based representation: 1) An incident response dashboard that leverages the ontology to visualize and examine application activity logs in the context of cybersecurity alerts. Our user study showed that the dashboard enabled participants to respond more accurately and quickly to new security alerts than the baseline tool. 2) A criticality of asset (CoA) risk assessment framework that enables efficient expert-based prioritization in cybersecurity contexts.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the ever-changing world of technology, continuous authentication and comprehensive access management are essential during user interactions with a device. Split Learning (SL) and Federated Learning (FL) have recently emerged as promising technologies for training a decentralized Machine Learning (ML) model. With the increasing use of smartphones and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, these distributed technologies enable users with limited resources to complete neural network model training with server assistance and collaboratively combine knowledge between different nodes. In this study, we propose combining these technologies to address the continuous authentication challenge while protecting user privacy and limiting device resource usage. However, the model's training is slowed due to SL sequential training and resource differences between IoT devices with different specifications. Therefore, we use a cluster-based approach to group devices with similar capabilities to mitigate the impact of slow devices while filtering out the devices incapable of training the model. In addition, we address the efficiency and robustness of training ML models by using SL and FL techniques to train the clients simultaneously while analyzing the overhead burden of the process. Following clustering, we select the best set of clients to participate in training through a Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimized on a carefully designed list of objectives. The performance of our proposed framework is compared to baseline methods, and the advantages are demonstrated using a real-life UMDAA-02-FD face detection dataset. The results show that CRSFL, our proposed approach, maintains high accuracy and reduces the overhead burden in continuous authentication scenarios while preserving user privacy.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In Federated Learning (FL), the limited accessibility of data from diverse locations and user types poses a significant challenge due to restricted user participation. Expanding client access and diversifying data enhance models by incorporating diverse perspectives, thereby enhancing adaptability. However, challenges arise in dynamic and mobile environments where certain devices may become inaccessible as FL clients, impacting data availability and client selection methods. To address this, we propose an On-Demand solution, deploying new clients using Docker Containers on-the-fly. Our On-Demand solution, employing Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), targets client availability and selection, while considering data shifts, and container deployment complexities. It employs an autonomous end-to-end solution for handling model deployment and client selection. The DRL strategy uses a Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework, with a Master Learner and a Joiner Learner. The designed cost functions represent the complexity of the dynamic client deployment and selection. Simulated tests show that our architecture can easily adjust to changes in the environment and respond to On-Demand requests. This underscores its ability to improve client availability, capability, accuracy, and learning efficiency, surpassing heuristic and tabular reinforcement learning solutions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Over the past few years, as large language models have ushered in an era of intelligence emergence, there has been an intensified focus on scaling networks. Currently, many network architectures are designed manually, often resulting in sub-optimal configurations. Although Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods have been proposed to automate this process, they suffer from low search efficiency. This study introduces Differentiable Model Scaling (DMS), increasing the efficiency for searching optimal width and depth in networks. DMS can model both width and depth in a direct and fully differentiable way, making it easy to optimize. We have evaluated our DMS across diverse tasks, ranging from vision tasks to NLP tasks and various network architectures, including CNNs and Transformers. Results consistently indicate that our DMS can find improved structures and outperforms state-of-the-art NAS methods. Specifically, for image classification on ImageNet, our DMS improves the top-1 accuracy of EfficientNet-B0 and Deit-Tiny by 1.4% and 0.6%, respectively, and outperforms the state-of-the-art zero-shot NAS method, ZiCo, by 1.3% while requiring only 0.4 GPU days for searching. For object detection on COCO, DMS improves the mAP of Yolo-v8-n by 2.0%. For language modeling, our pruned Llama-7B outperforms the prior method with lower perplexity and higher zero-shot classification accuracy. We will release our code in the future.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose InsightNet, a novel approach for the automated extraction of structured insights from customer reviews. Our end-to-end machine learning framework is designed to overcome the limitations of current solutions, including the absence of structure for identified topics, non-standard aspect names, and lack of abundant training data. The proposed solution builds a semi-supervised multi-level taxonomy from raw reviews, a semantic similarity heuristic approach to generate labelled data and employs a multi-task insight extraction architecture by fine-tuning an LLM. InsightNet identifies granular actionable topics with customer sentiments and verbatim for each topic. Evaluations on real-world customer review data show that InsightNet performs better than existing solutions in terms of structure, hierarchy and completeness. We empirically demonstrate that InsightNet outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods in multi-label topic classification, achieving an F1 score of 0.85, which is an improvement of 11% F1-score over the previous best results. Additionally, InsightNet generalises well for unseen aspects and suggests new topics to be added to the taxonomy.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>An effective pre-training framework with universal 3D representations is extremely desired in perceiving large-scale dynamic scenes. However, establishing such an ideal framework that is both task-generic and label-efficient poses a challenge in unifying the representation of the same primitive across diverse scenes. The current contrastive 3D pre-training methods typically follow a frame-level consistency, which focuses on the 2D-3D relationships in each detached image. Such inconsiderate consistency greatly hampers the promising path of reaching an universal pre-training framework: (1) The cross-scene semantic self-conflict, i.e., the intense collision between primitive segments of the same semantics from different scenes; (2) Lacking a globally unified bond that pushes the cross-scene semantic consistency into 3D representation learning. To address above challenges, we propose a CSC framework that puts a scene-level semantic consistency in the heart, bridging the connection of the similar semantic segments across various scenes. To achieve this goal, we combine the coherent semantic cues provided by the vision foundation model and the knowledge-rich cross-scene prototypes derived from the complementary multi-modality information. These allow us to train a universal 3D pre-training model that facilitates various downstream tasks with less fine-tuning efforts. Empirically, we achieve consistent improvements over SOTA pre-training approaches in semantic segmentation (+1.4% mIoU), object detection (+1.0% mAP), and panoptic segmentation (+3.0% PQ) using their task-specific 3D network on nuScenes.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Video-language pre-training is a typical and challenging problem that aims at learning visual and textual representations from large-scale data in a self-supervised way. Existing pre-training approaches either captured the correspondence of image-text pairs or utilized temporal ordering of frames. However, they do not explicitly explore the natural synchronization between audio and the other two modalities. In this work, we propose an enhanced framework for Video-Language pre-training with Synchronized Audio, termed as VLSA, that can learn tri-modal representations in a unified self-supervised transformer. Specifically, our VLSA jointly aggregates embeddings of local patches and global tokens for video, text, and audio. Furthermore, we utilize local-patch masked modeling to learn modality-aware features, and leverage global audio matching to capture audio-guided features for video and text. We conduct extensive experiments on retrieval across text, video, and audio. Our simple model pre-trained on only 0.9M data achieves improving results against state-of-the-art baselines. In addition, qualitative visualizations vividly showcase the superiority of our VLSA in learning discriminative visual-textual representations.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid rise of cyber-crime activities and the growing number of devices threatened by them place software security issues in the spotlight. As around 90% of all attacks exploit known types of security issues, finding vulnerable components and applying existing mitigation techniques is a viable practical approach for fighting against cyber-crime. In this paper, we investigate how the state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, including a popular deep learning algorithm, perform in predicting functions with possible security vulnerabilities in JavaScript programs. We applied 8 machine learning algorithms to build prediction models using a new dataset constructed for this research from the vulnerability information in public databases of the Node Security Project and the Snyk platform, and code fixing patches from GitHub. We used static source code metrics as predictors and an extensive grid-search algorithm to find the best performing models. We also examined the effect of various re-sampling strategies to handle the imbalanced nature of the dataset. The best performing algorithm was KNN, which created a model for the prediction of vulnerable functions with an F-measure of 0.76 (0.91 precision and 0.66 recall). Moreover, deep learning, tree and forest based classifiers, and SVM were competitive with F-measures over 0.70. Although the F-measures did not vary significantly with the re-sampling strategies, the distribution of precision and recall did change. No re-sampling seemed to produce models preferring high precision, while re-sampling strategies balanced the IR measures.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In Reinforcement Learning (RL), training a policy from scratch with online experiences can be inefficient because of the difficulties in exploration. Recently, offline RL provides a promising solution by giving an initialized offline policy, which can be refined through online interactions. However, existing approaches primarily perform offline and online learning in the same task, without considering the task generalization problem in offline-to-online adaptation. In real-world applications, it is common that we only have an offline dataset from a specific task while aiming for fast online-adaptation for several tasks. To address this problem, our work builds upon the investigation of successor representations for task generalization in online RL and extends the framework to incorporate offline-to-online learning. We demonstrate that the conventional paradigm using successor features cannot effectively utilize offline data and improve the performance for the new task by online fine-tuning. To mitigate this, we introduce a novel methodology that leverages offline data to acquire an ensemble of successor representations and subsequently constructs ensemble Q functions. This approach enables robust representation learning from datasets with different coverage and facilitates fast adaption of Q functions towards new tasks during the online fine-tuning phase. Extensive empirical evaluations provide compelling evidence showcasing the superior performance of our method in generalizing to diverse or even unseen tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are getting increasingly harmful to the Internet, showing no signs of slowing down. Developing an accurate detection mechanism to thwart DDoS attacks is still a big challenge due to the rich variety of these attacks and the emergence of new attack vectors. In this paper, we propose a new tree-based DDoS detection approach that operates on a flow as a stream structure, rather than the traditional fixed-size record structure containing aggregated flow statistics. Although aggregated flow records have gained popularity over the past decade, providing an effective means for flow-based intrusion detection by inspecting only a fraction of the total traffic volume, they are inherently constrained. Their detection precision is limited not only by the lack of packet payloads, but also by their structure, which is unable to model fine-grained inter-packet relations, such as packet order and temporal relations. Additionally, inferring aggregated flow statistics must wait for the complete flow to end. Here we show that considering flow inputs as variable-length streams composed of their associated packet headers, allows for very accurate and fast detection of malicious flows. We evaluate our proposed strategy on the CICDDoS2019 and CICIDS2017 datasets, which contain a comprehensive variety of DDoS attacks. Our approach matches or exceeds existing machine learning techniques' accuracy, including state-of-the-art deep learning methods. Furthermore, our method achieves significantly earlier detection, e.g., with CICDDoS2019 detection based on the first 2 packets, which corresponds to an average time-saving of 99.79% and uses only 4--6% of the traffic volume.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>protect</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Accurately reconstructing the global ocean deoxygenation over a century is crucial for assessing and protecting marine ecosystem. Existing expert-dominated numerical simulations fail to catch up with the dynamic variation caused by global warming and human activities. Besides, due to the high-cost data collection, the historical observations are severely sparse, leading to big challenge for precise reconstruction. In this work, we propose OxyGenerator, the first deep learning based model, to reconstruct the global ocean deoxygenation from 1920 to 2023. Specifically, to address the heterogeneity across large temporal and spatial scales, we propose zoning-varying graph message-passing to capture the complex oceanographic correlations between missing values and sparse observations. Additionally, to further calibrate the uncertainty, we incorporate inductive bias from dissolved oxygen (DO) variations and chemical effects. Compared with in-situ DO observations, OxyGenerator significantly outperforms CMIP6 numerical simulations, reducing MAPE by 38.77%, demonstrating a promising potential to understand the "breathless ocean" in data-driven manner.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recurrent Neural Networks excel at predicting and generating complex high-dimensional temporal patterns. Due to their inherent nonlinear dynamics and memory, they can learn unbounded temporal dependencies from data. In a Machine Learning setting, the network's parameters are adapted during a training phase to match the requirements of a given task/problem increasing its computational capabilities. After the training, the network parameters are kept fixed to exploit the learned computations. The static parameters thereby render the network unadaptive to changing conditions, such as external or internal perturbation. In this manuscript, we demonstrate how keeping parts of the network adaptive even after the training enhances its functionality and robustness. Here, we utilize the conceptor framework and conceptualize an adaptive control loop analyzing the network's behavior continuously and adjusting its time-varying internal representation to follow a desired target. We demonstrate how the added adaptivity of the network supports the computational functionality in three distinct tasks: interpolation of temporal patterns, stabilization against partial network degradation, and robustness against input distortion. Our results highlight the potential of adaptive networks in machine learning beyond training, enabling them to not only learn complex patterns but also dynamically adjust to changing environments, ultimately broadening their applicability.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The humanlike responses of large language models (LLMs) have prompted social scientists to investigate whether LLMs can be used to simulate human participants in experiments, opinion polls and surveys. Of central interest in this line of research has been mapping out the psychological profiles of LLMs by prompting them to respond to standardized questionnaires. The conflicting findings of this research are unsurprising given that mapping out underlying, or latent, traits from LLMs' text responses to questionnaires is no easy task. To address this, we use psychometrics, the science of psychological measurement. In this study, we prompt OpenAI's flagship models, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, to assume different personas and respond to a range of standardized measures of personality constructs. We used two kinds of persona descriptions: either generic (four or five random person descriptions) or specific (mostly demographics of actual humans from a large-scale human dataset). We found that the responses from GPT-4, but not GPT-3.5, using generic persona descriptions show promising, albeit not perfect, psychometric properties, similar to human norms, but the data from both LLMs when using specific demographic profiles, show poor psychometrics properties. We conclude that, currently, when LLMs are asked to simulate silicon personas, their responses are poor signals of potentially underlying latent traits. Thus, our work casts doubt on LLMs' ability to simulate individual-level human behaviour across multiple-choice question answering tasks.</li>

Unlike existing methods solely guided by classification loss, we propose a joint learning model combining self-supervised contrastive learning loss and supervised classification loss. This model optimizes both loss functions, capturing subtle EEG signal differences specific to emotion detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate SI-CLEER's robustness and superior accuracy on the SEED dataset compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we analyze electrode performance, highlighting the significance of central frontal and temporal brain region EEGs in emotion detection.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the advancement of video analysis technology, the multi-object tracking (MOT) problem in complex scenes involving pedestrians is gaining increasing importance. This challenge primarily involves two key tasks: pedestrian detection and re-identification. While significant progress has been achieved in pedestrian detection tasks in recent years, enhancing the effectiveness of re-identification tasks remains a persistent challenge. This difficulty arises from the large total number of pedestrian samples in multi-object tracking datasets and the scarcity of individual instance samples. Motivated by recent rapid advancements in meta-learning techniques, we introduce MAML MOT, a meta-learning-based training approach for multi-object tracking. This approach leverages the rapid learning capability of meta-learning to tackle the issue of sample scarcity in pedestrian re-identification tasks, aiming to improve the model's generalization performance and robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high accuracy on mainstream datasets in the MOT Challenge. This offers new perspectives and solutions for research in the field of pedestrian multi-object tracking.</li>

We show that these models can also be used to successfully cluster human-generated content, with success defined through the measures of distinctiveness and interpretability. This success is validated by both human reviewers and ChatGPT, providing an automated means to close the 'validation gap' that has challenged short-text clustering. Comparing the machine and human approaches we identify the biases inherent in each, and question the reliance on human-coding as the 'gold standard'. We apply our methodology to Twitter bios and find characteristic ways humans describe themselves, agreeing well with prior specialist work, but with interesting differences characteristic of the medium used to express identity.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present SLIP (SAM+CLIP), an enhanced architecture for zero-shot object segmentation. SLIP combines the Segment Anything Model (SAM) \cite{kirillov2023segment} with the Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) \cite{radford2021learning}. By incorporating text prompts into SAM using CLIP, SLIP enables object segmentation without prior training on specific classes or categories. We fine-tune CLIP on a Pokemon dataset, allowing it to learn meaningful image-text representations. SLIP demonstrates the ability to recognize and segment objects in images based on contextual information from text prompts, expanding the capabilities of SAM for versatile object segmentation. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the SLIP architecture in segmenting objects in images based on textual cues. The integration of CLIP's text-image understanding capabilities into SAM expands the capabilities of the original architecture and enables more versatile and context-aware object segmentation.</li>

As it is challenging to remove such data and retrain the models, methods for erasing specific concepts from pre-trained models have been investigated. We propose a novel concept-erasure method that updates the text encoder using few-shot unlearning in which a few real images are used. The discussion regarding the generated images after erasing a concept has been lacking. While there are methods for specifying the transition destination for concepts, the validity of the specified concepts is unclear. Our method implicitly achieves this by transitioning to the latent concepts inherent in the model or the images. Our method can erase a concept within 10 s, making concept erasure more accessible than ever before. Implicitly transitioning to related concepts leads to more natural concept erasure. We applied the proposed method to various concepts and confirmed that concept erasure can be achieved tens to hundreds of times faster than with current methods. By varying the parameters to be updated, we obtained results suggesting that, like previous research, knowledge is primarily accumulated in the feed-forward networks of the text encoder.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce the paradigm of validated decentralized learning for undirected networks with heterogeneous data and possible adversarial infiltration. We require (a) convergence to a global empirical loss minimizer when adversaries are absent, and (b) either detection of adversarial presence of convergence to an admissible consensus irrespective of the adversarial configuration. To this end, we propose the VALID protocol which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to achieve a validated learning guarantee. Moreover, VALID offers an O(1/T) convergence rate (under pertinent regularity assumptions), and computational and communication complexities comparable to non-adversarial distributed stochastic gradient descent. Remarkably, VALID retains optimal performance metrics in adversary-free environments, sidestepping the robustness penalties observed in prior byzantine-robust methods. A distinctive aspect of our study is a heterogeneity metric based on the norms of individual agents' gradients computed at the global empirical loss minimizer. This not only provides a natural statistic for detecting significant byzantine disruptions but also allows us to prove the optimality of VALID in wide generality. Lastly, our numerical results reveal that, in the absence of adversaries, VALID converges faster than state-of-the-art byzantine robust algorithms, while when adversaries are present, VALID terminates with each honest either converging to an admissible consensus of declaring adversarial presence in the network.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Animatable clothing transfer, aiming at dressing and animating garments across characters, is a challenging problem. Most human avatar works entangle the representations of the human body and clothing together, which leads to difficulties for virtual try-on across identities. What's worse, the entangled representations usually fail to exactly track the sliding motion of garments. To overcome these limitations, we present Layered Gaussian Avatars (LayGA), a new representation that formulates body and clothing as two separate layers for photorealistic animatable clothing transfer from multi-view videos. Our representation is built upon the Gaussian map-based avatar for its excellent representation power of garment details. However, the Gaussian map produces unstructured 3D Gaussians distributed around the actual surface. The absence of a smooth explicit surface raises challenges in accurate garment tracking and collision handling between body and garments. Therefore, we propose two-stage training involving single-layer reconstruction and multi-layer fitting. In the single-layer reconstruction stage, we propose a series of geometric constraints to reconstruct smooth surfaces and simultaneously obtain the segmentation between body and clothing. Next, in the multi-layer fitting stage, we train two separate models to represent body and clothing and utilize the reconstructed clothing geometries as 3D supervision for more accurate garment tracking. Furthermore, we propose geometry and rendering layers for both high-quality geometric reconstruction and high-fidelity rendering. Overall, the proposed LayGA realizes photorealistic animations and virtual try-on, and outperforms other baseline methods. Our project page is this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Numerous applications have resulted from the automation of agricultural disease segmentation using deep learning techniques. However, when applied to new conditions, these applications frequently face the difficulty of overfitting, resulting in lower segmentation performance. In the context of potato farming, where diseases have a large influence on yields, it is critical for the agricultural economy to quickly and properly identify these diseases. Traditional data augmentation approaches, such as rotation, flip, and translation, have limitations and frequently fail to provide strong generalization results. To address these issues, our research employs a novel approach termed as PotatoGANs. In this novel data augmentation approach, two types of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are utilized to generate synthetic potato disease images from healthy potato images. This approach not only expands the dataset but also adds variety, which helps to enhance model generalization. Using the Inception score as a measure, our experiments show the better quality and realisticness of the images created by PotatoGANs, emphasizing their capacity to resemble real disease images closely. The CycleGAN model outperforms the Pix2Pix GAN model in terms of image quality, as evidenced by its higher IS scores CycleGAN achieves higher Inception scores (IS) of 1.2001 and 1.0900 for black scurf and common scab, respectively. This synthetic data can significantly improve the training of large neural networks. It also reduces data collection costs while enhancing data diversity and generalization capabilities. Our work improves interpretability by combining three gradient-based Explainable AI algorithms (GradCAM, GradCAM++, and ScoreCAM) with three distinct CNN architectures (DenseNet169, Resnet152 V2, InceptionResNet V2) for potato disease classification.</li>

The benchmark comprises of questions of various medical concepts across different vocabularies: diagnoses, procedures, and drugs. The questions are categorized into three levels of difficulty: easy, medium, and hard. We conducted evaluations of the benchmark using various Large Language Models. Our findings show that pre-trained clinical Large Language Models achieved accuracy levels close to random guessing on this benchmark, despite being pre-trained on medical data. However, GPT-4 achieves an absolute average improvement of nearly 27%-37% (27% for zero-shot learning and 37% for few-shot learning) when compared to clinical Large Language Models. Our benchmark serves as a valuable resource for evaluating the understanding and reasoning of medical concepts by Large Language Models. Our benchmark is available at this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper introduces a value-driven cybersecurity innovation framework for the transportation and infrastructure sectors, as opposed to the traditional market-centric approaches that have dominated the field. Recontextualizing innovation categories into sustaining, incremental, disruptive, and transformative, we aim to foster a culture of self-innovation within organizations, enabling a strategic focus on cybersecurity measures that directly contribute to business value and strategic goals. This approach enhances operational effectiveness and efficiency of cyber defences primarily, while also aligns cybersecurity initiatives with mission-critical objectives. We detail a practical method for evaluating the business value of cybersecurity innovations and present a pragmatic approach for organizations to funnel innovative ideas in a structured and repeatable manner. The framework is designed to reinforce cybersecurity capabilities against an evolving cyber threat landscape while maintaining infrastructural integrity. Shifting the focus from general market appeal to sector-specific needs, our framework provides cybersecurity leaders with the strategic cyber-foresight necessary for prioritizing impactful initiatives, thereby making cybersecurity a core business enabler rather than a burden.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Accurate prediction of electricity day-ahead prices is essential in competitive electricity markets. Although stationary electricity-price forecasting techniques have received considerable attention, research on non-stationary methods is comparatively scarce, despite the common prevalence of non-stationary features in electricity markets. Specifically, existing non-stationary techniques will often aim to address individual non-stationary features in isolation, leaving aside the exploration of concurrent multiple non-stationary effects. Our overarching objective here is the formulation of a framework to systematically model and forecast non-stationary electricity-price time series, encompassing the broader scope of non-stationary behavior. For this purpose we develop a data-driven model that combines an N-dimensional Langevin equation (LE) with a neural-ordinary differential equation (NODE). The LE captures fine-grained details of the electricity-price behavior in stationary regimes but is inadequate for non-stationary conditions. To overcome this inherent limitation, we adopt a NODE approach to learn, and at the same time predict, the difference between the actual electricity-price time series and the simulated price trajectories generated by the LE. By learning this difference, the NODE reconstructs the non-stationary components of the time series that the LE is not able to capture. We exemplify the effectiveness of our framework using the Spanish electricity day-ahead market as a prototypical case study. Our findings reveal that the NODE nicely complements the LE, providing a comprehensive strategy to tackle both stationary and non-stationary electricity-price behavior. The framework's dependability and robustness is demonstrated through different non-stationary scenarios by comparing it against a range of basic naive methods.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In visual place recognition, accurately identifying and matching images of locations under varying environmental conditions and viewpoints remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we introduce a new technique, called Bag-of-Queries (BoQ), which learns a set of global queries designed to capture universal place-specific attributes. Unlike existing methods that employ self-attention and generate the queries directly from the input features, BoQ employs distinct learnable global queries, which probe the input features via cross-attention, ensuring consistent information aggregation. In addition, our technique provides an interpretable attention mechanism and integrates with both CNN and Vision Transformer backbones. The performance of BoQ is demonstrated through extensive experiments on 14 large-scale benchmarks. It consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques including NetVLAD, MixVPR and EigenPlaces. Moreover, as a global retrieval technique (one-stage), BoQ surpasses two-stage retrieval methods, such as Patch-NetVLAD, TransVPR and R2Former, all while being orders of magnitude faster and more efficient.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Discrimination and calibration represent two important properties of survival analysis, with the former assessing the model's ability to accurately rank subjects and the latter evaluating the alignment of predicted outcomes with actual events. With their distinct nature, it is hard for survival models to simultaneously optimize both of them especially as many previous results found improving calibration tends to diminish discrimination performance. This paper introduces a novel approach utilizing conformal regression that can improve a model's calibration without degrading discrimination. We provide theoretical guarantees for the above claim, and rigorously validate the efficiency of our approach across 11 real-world datasets, showcasing its practical applicability and robustness in diverse scenarios.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Structured output prediction problems are ubiquitous in machine learning. The prominent approach leverages neural networks as powerful feature extractors, otherwise assuming the independence of the outputs. These outputs, however, jointly encode an object, e.g. a path in a graph, and are therefore related through the structure underlying the output space. We discuss the semantic loss, which injects knowledge about such structure, defined symbolically, into training by minimizing the network's violation of such dependencies, steering the network towards predicting distributions satisfying the underlying structure. At the same time, it is agnostic to the arrangement of the symbols, and depends only on the semantics expressed thereby, while also enabling efficient end-to-end training and inference. We also discuss key improvements and applications of the semantic loss. One limitations of the semantic loss is that it does not exploit the association of every data point with certain features certifying its membership in a target class. We should therefore prefer minimum-entropy distributions over valid structures, which we obtain by additionally minimizing the neuro-symbolic entropy. We empirically demonstrate the benefits of this more refined formulation. Moreover, the semantic loss is designed to be modular and can be combined with both discriminative and generative neural models. This is illustrated by integrating it into generative adversarial networks, yielding constrained adversarial networks, a novel class of deep generative models able to efficiently synthesize complex objects obeying the structure of the underlying domain.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the growing adoption of machine learning (ML) systems in areas like law enforcement, criminal justice, finance, hiring, and admissions, it is increasingly critical to guarantee the fairness of decisions assisted by ML. In this paper, we study the tradeoff between fairness and accuracy under the statistical notion of equalized odds. We present a new upper bound on the accuracy (that holds for any classifier), as a function of the fairness budget. In addition, our bounds also exhibit dependence on the underlying statistics of the data, labels and the sensitive group attributes. We validate our theoretical upper bounds through empirical analysis on three real-world datasets: COMPAS, Adult, and Law School. Specifically, we compare our upper bound to the tradeoffs that are achieved by various existing fair classifiers in the literature. Our results show that achieving high accuracy subject to a low-bias could be fundamentally limited based on the statistical disparity across the groups.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Accurate weather forecasting is crucial in various sectors, impacting decision-making processes and societal events. Data-driven approaches based on machine learning models have recently emerged as a promising alternative to numerical weather prediction models given their potential to capture physics of different scales from historical data and the significantly lower computational cost during the prediction stage. Renowned for its state-of-the-art performance across diverse domains, the Transformer model has also gained popularity in machine learning weather prediction. Yet applying Transformer architectures to weather forecasting, particularly on a global scale is computationally challenging due to the quadratic complexity of attention and the quadratic increase in spatial points as resolution increases. In this work, we propose a factorized-attention-based model tailored for spherical geometries to mitigate this issue. More specifically, it utilizes multi-dimensional factorized kernels that convolve over different axes where the computational complexity of the kernel is only quadratic to the axial resolution instead of overall resolution. The deterministic forecasting accuracy of the proposed model on $1.5^\circ$ and 0-7 days' lead time is on par with state-of-the-art purely data-driven machine learning weather prediction models. We also showcase the proposed model holds great potential to push forward the Pareto front of accuracy-efficiency for Transformer weather models, where it can achieve better accuracy with less computational cost compared to Transformer based models with standard attention.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Exposure to poor indoor air quality poses significant health risks, necessitating thorough assessment to mitigate associated dangers. This study aims to predict hourly indoor fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations and investigate their correlation with outdoor PM2.5 levels across 24 distinct buildings in Australia. Indoor air quality data were gathered from 91 monitoring sensors in eight Australian cities spanning 2019 to 2022. Employing an innovative three-stage deep ensemble machine learning framework (DEML), comprising three base models (Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and eXtreme Gradient Boosting) and two meta-models (Random Forest and Generalized Linear Model), hourly indoor PM2.5 concentrations were predicted. The model's accuracy was evaluated using a rolling windows approach, comparing its performance against three benchmark algorithms (SVM, RF, and XGBoost). Additionally, a correlation analysis assessed the relationship between indoor and outdoor PM2.5 concentrations. Results indicate that the DEML model consistently outperformed benchmark models, achieving an R2 ranging from 0.63 to 0.99 and RMSE from 0.01 to 0.663 mg/m3 for most sensors. Notably, outdoor PM2.5 concentrations significantly impacted indoor air quality, particularly evident during events like bushfires. This study underscores the importance of accurate indoor air quality prediction, crucial for developing location-specific early warning systems and informing effective interventions. By promoting protective behaviors, these efforts contribute to enhanced public health outcomes.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As the right to be forgotten has been legislated worldwide, many studies attempt to design unlearning mechanisms to protect users' privacy when they want to leave machine learning service platforms. Specifically, machine unlearning is to make a trained model to remove the contribution of an erased subset of the training dataset. This survey aims to systematically classify a wide range of machine unlearning and discuss their differences, connections and open problems. We categorize current unlearning methods into four scenarios: centralized unlearning, distributed and irregular data unlearning, unlearning verification, and privacy and security issues in unlearning. Since centralized unlearning is the primary domain, we use two parts to introduce: firstly, we classify centralized unlearning into exact unlearning and approximate unlearning; secondly, we offer a detailed introduction to the techniques of these methods. Besides the centralized unlearning, we notice some studies about distributed and irregular data unlearning and introduce federated unlearning and graph unlearning as the two representative directions. After introducing unlearning methods, we review studies about unlearning verification. Moreover, we consider the privacy and security issues essential in machine unlearning and organize the latest related literature. Finally, we discuss the challenges of various unlearning scenarios and address the potential research directions.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the high-stakes world of baseball, every nuance of a pitcher's mechanics holds the key to maximizing performance and minimizing runs. Traditional analysis methods often rely on pre-recorded offline numerical data, hindering their application in the dynamic environment of live games. Broadcast video analysis, while seemingly ideal, faces significant challenges due to factors like motion blur and low resolution. To address these challenges, we introduce PitcherNet, an end-to-end automated system that analyzes pitcher kinematics directly from live broadcast video, thereby extracting valuable pitch statistics including velocity, release point, pitch position, and release extension. This system leverages three key components: (1) Player tracking and identification by decoupling actions from player kinematics; (2) Distribution and depth-aware 3D human modeling; and (3) Kinematic-driven pitch statistics. Experimental validation demonstrates that PitcherNet achieves robust analysis results with 96.82% accuracy in pitcher tracklet identification, reduced joint position error by 1.8mm and superior analytics compared to baseline methods. By enabling performance-critical kinematic analysis from broadcast video, PitcherNet paves the way for the future of baseball analytics by optimizing pitching strategies, preventing injuries, and unlocking a deeper understanding of pitcher mechanics, forever transforming the game.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Medical images are often more difficult to acquire than natural images due to the specialism of the equipment and technology, which leads to less medical image datasets. So it is hard to train a strong pretrained medical vision model. How to make the best of natural pretrained vision model and adapt in medical domain still pends. For image classification, a popular method is linear probe (LP). However, LP only considers the output after feature extraction. Yet, there exists a gap between input medical images and natural pretrained vision model. We introduce visual prompting (VP) to fill in the gap, and analyze the strategies of coupling between LP and VP. We design a joint learning loss function containing categorisation loss and discrepancy loss, which describe the variance of prompted and plain images, naming this joint training strategy MoVL (Mixture of Visual Prompting and Linear Probe). We experiment on 4 medical image classification datasets, with two mainstream architectures, ResNet and CLIP. Results shows that without changing the parameters and architecture of backbone model and with less parameters, there is potential for MoVL to achieve full finetune (FF) accuracy (on four medical datasets, average 90.91% for MoVL and 91.13% for FF). On out of distribution medical dataset, our method(90.33%) can outperform FF (85.15%) with absolute 5.18 % lead.</li>

Such problems are of significant interest in distributed optimization settings like federated learning and inventory management. A learner queries a stochastic oracle and incentivizes the oracle to obtain noisy gradient measurements and perform SG. The oracle probabilistically returns either a noisy gradient of the function} or a non-informative measurement, depending on the oracle state and incentive. The learner's query and incentive are visible to an eavesdropper who wishes to estimate the stationary point. This paper formulates the problem of the learner performing covert optimization by dynamically incentivizing the stochastic oracle and obfuscating the eavesdropper as a finite-horizon Markov decision process (MDP). Using conditions for interval-dominance on the cost and transition probability structure, we show that the optimal policy for the MDP has a monotone threshold structure. We propose searching for the optimal stationary policy with the threshold structure using a stochastic approximation algorithm and a multi-armed bandit approach. The effectiveness of our methods is numerically demonstrated on a covert federated learning hate-speech classification task.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Hand-drawn cartoon animation employs sketches and flat-color segments to create the illusion of motion. While recent advancements like CLIP, SVD, and Sora show impressive results in understanding and generating natural video by scaling large models with extensive datasets, they are not as effective for cartoons. Through our empirical experiments, we argue that this ineffectiveness stems from a notable bias in hand-drawn cartoons that diverges from the distribution of natural videos. Can we harness the success of the scaling paradigm to benefit cartoon research? Unfortunately, until now, there has not been a sizable cartoon dataset available for exploration. In this research, we propose the Sakuga-42M Dataset, the first large-scale cartoon animation dataset. Sakuga-42M comprises 42 million keyframes covering various artistic styles, regions, and years, with comprehensive semantic annotations including video-text description pairs, anime tags, content taxonomies, etc. We pioneer the benefits of such a large-scale cartoon dataset on comprehension and generation tasks by finetuning contemporary foundation models like Video CLIP, Video Mamba, and SVD, achieving outstanding performance on cartoon-related tasks. Our motivation is to introduce large-scaling to cartoon research and foster generalization and robustness in future cartoon applications. Dataset, Code, and Pretrained Models will be publicly available.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) perform well at a myriad of tasks, but explaining the processes behind this performance is a challenge. This paper investigates whether LLMs can give faithful high-level explanations of their own internal processes. To explore this, we introduce a dataset, ArticulateRules, of few-shot text-based classification tasks generated by simple rules. Each rule is associated with a simple natural-language explanation. We test whether models that have learned to classify inputs competently (both in- and out-of-distribution) are able to articulate freeform natural language explanations that match their classification behavior. Our dataset can be used for both in-context and finetuning evaluations. We evaluate a range of LLMs, demonstrating that articulation accuracy varies considerably between models, with a particularly sharp increase from GPT-3 to GPT-4. We then investigate whether we can improve GPT-3's articulation accuracy through a range of methods. GPT-3 completely fails to articulate 7/10 rules in our test, even after additional finetuning on correct explanations. We release our dataset, ArticulateRules, which can be used to test self-explanation for LLMs trained either in-context or by finetuning.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a pivotal innovation in natural language processing, enhancing generative models by incorporating external information retrieval. Evaluating RAG systems, however, poses distinct challenges due to their hybrid structure and reliance on dynamic knowledge sources. We consequently enhanced an extensive survey and proposed an analysis framework for benchmarks of RAG systems, RAGR (Retrieval, Generation, Additional Requirement), designed to systematically analyze RAG benchmarks by focusing on measurable outputs and established truths. Specifically, we scrutinize and contrast multiple quantifiable metrics of the Retrieval and Generation component, such as relevance, accuracy, and faithfulness, of the internal links within the current RAG evaluation methods, covering the possible output and ground truth pairs. We also analyze the integration of additional requirements of different works, discuss the limitations of current benchmarks, and propose potential directions for further research to address these shortcomings and advance the field of RAG evaluation. In conclusion, this paper collates the challenges associated with RAG evaluation. It presents a thorough analysis and examination of existing methodologies for RAG benchmark design based on the proposed RGAR framework.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Evaluating house prices is crucial for various stakeholders, including homeowners, investors, and policymakers. However, traditional spatial interpolation methods have limitations in capturing the complex spatial relationships that affect property values. To address these challenges, we have developed a new method called Multi-Head Gated Attention for spatial interpolation. Our approach builds upon attention-based interpolation models and incorporates multiple attention heads and gating mechanisms to capture spatial dependencies and contextual information better. Importantly, our model produces embeddings that reduce the dimensionality of the data, enabling simpler models like linear regression to outperform complex ensembling models. We conducted extensive experiments to compare our model with baseline methods and the original attention-based interpolation model. The results show a significant improvement in the accuracy of house price predictions, validating the effectiveness of our approach. This research advances the field of spatial interpolation and provides a robust tool for more precise house price evaluation. Our GitHub repository.contains the data and code for all datasets, which are available for researchers and practitioners interested in replicating or building upon our work.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text-based person retrieval (TPR) aims to retrieve images of a person from an extensive array of candidates based on a given textual description. The core challenge lies in mapping visual and textual data into a unified latent space. While existing TPR methods concentrate on recognizing explicit and positive characteristics, they often neglect the critical influence of negative descriptors, resulting in potential false positives that fulfill positive criteria but could be excluded by negative descriptors. To alleviate these issues, we introduce DualFocus, a unified framework for integrating positive and negative descriptors to enhance the interpretative accuracy of vision-language foundational models regarding textual queries. DualFocus employs Dual (Positive/Negative) Attribute Prompt Learning (DAPL), which integrates Dual Image-Attribute Contrastive (DIAC) Learning and Sensitive Image-Attributes Matching (SIAM) Learning. This way DualFocus enhances the detection of unseen attributes, thereby boosting retrieval precision. To further achieve a balance between coarse and fine-grained alignment of visual and textual embeddings, we propose the Dynamic Tokenwise Similarity (DTS) loss, which refines the representation of both matching and non-matching descriptions, thereby enhancing the matching process through a detailed and adaptable similarity assessment. By focusing on token-level comparisons, DualFocus significantly outperforms existing techniques in both precision and robustness. The experiment results highlight DualFocus's superior performance on CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReid.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Developing accurate machine learning models for oncology requires large-scale, high-quality multimodal datasets. However, creating such datasets remains challenging due to the complexity and heterogeneity of medical data. To address this challenge, we introduce HoneyBee, a scalable modular framework for building multimodal oncology datasets that leverages foundational models to generate representative embeddings. HoneyBee integrates various data modalities, including clinical records, imaging data, and patient outcomes. It employs data preprocessing techniques and transformer-based architectures to generate embeddings that capture the essential features and relationships within the raw medical data. The generated embeddings are stored in a structured format using Hugging Face datasets and PyTorch dataloaders for accessibility. Vector databases enable efficient querying and retrieval for machine learning applications. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HoneyBee through experiments assessing the quality and representativeness of the embeddings. The framework is designed to be extensible to other medical domains and aims to accelerate oncology research by providing high-quality, machine learning-ready datasets. HoneyBee is an ongoing open-source effort, and the code, datasets, and models are available at the project repository.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled in-context learning (ICL)-based methods that significantly outperform fine-tuning approaches for text-to-SQL tasks. However, their performance is still considerably lower than that of human experts on benchmarks that include complex schemas and queries, such as BIRD. This study considers the sensitivity of LLMs to the prompts and introduces a novel approach that leverages multiple prompts to explore a broader search space for possible answers and effectively aggregate them. Specifically, we robustly refine the database schema through schema linking using multiple prompts. Thereafter, we generate various candidate SQL queries based on the refined schema and diverse prompts. Finally, the candidate queries are filtered based on their confidence scores, and the optimal query is obtained through a multiple-choice selection that is presented to the LLM. When evaluated on the BIRD and Spider benchmarks, the proposed method achieved execution accuracies of 65.5\% and 89.6\%, respectively, significantly outperforming previous ICL-based methods. Moreover, we established a new SOTA performance on the BIRD in terms of both the accuracy and efficiency of the generated queries.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The increasing prominence of e-commerce has underscored the importance of Virtual Try-On (VTON). However, previous studies predominantly focus on the 2D realm and rely heavily on extensive data for training. Research on 3D VTON primarily centers on garment-body shape compatibility, a topic extensively covered in 2D VTON. Thanks to advances in 3D scene editing, a 2D diffusion model has now been adapted for 3D editing via multi-viewpoint editing. In this work, we propose GaussianVTON, an innovative 3D VTON pipeline integrating Gaussian Splatting (GS) editing with 2D VTON. To facilitate a seamless transition from 2D to 3D VTON, we propose, for the first time, the use of only images as editing prompts for 3D editing. To further address issues, e.g., face blurring, garment inaccuracy, and degraded viewpoint quality during editing, we devise a three-stage refinement strategy to gradually mitigate potential issues. Furthermore, we introduce a new editing strategy termed Edit Recall Reconstruction (ERR) to tackle the limitations of previous editing strategies in leading to complex geometric changes. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of GaussianVTON, offering a novel perspective on 3D VTON while also establishing a novel starting point for image-prompting 3D scene editing.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In Reinforcement Learning (RL), artificial agents are trained to maximize numerical rewards by performing tasks. Exploration is essential in RL because agents must discover information before exploiting it. Two rewards encouraging efficient exploration are the entropy of action policy and curiosity for information gain. Entropy is well-established in literature, promoting randomized action selection. Curiosity is defined in a broad variety of ways in literature, promoting discovery of novel experiences. One example, prediction error curiosity, rewards agents for discovering observations they cannot accurately predict. However, such agents may be distracted by unpredictable observational noises known as curiosity traps. Based on the Free Energy Principle (FEP), this paper proposes hidden state curiosity, which rewards agents by the KL divergence between the predictive prior and posterior probabilities of latent variables. We trained six types of agents to navigate mazes: baseline agents without rewards for entropy or curiosity, and agents rewarded for entropy and/or either prediction error curiosity or hidden state curiosity. We find entropy and curiosity result in efficient exploration, especially both employed together. Notably, agents with hidden state curiosity demonstrate resilience against curiosity traps, which hinder agents with prediction error curiosity. This suggests implementing the FEP may enhance the robustness and generalization of RL models, potentially aligning the learning processes of artificial and biological agents.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present a novel approach to predicting the pressure and flow rate of flexible electrohydrodynamic pumps using the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network. Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, KAN replaces fixed activation functions with learnable spline-based activation functions, enabling it to approximate complex nonlinear functions more effectively than traditional models like Multi-Layer Perceptron and Random Forest. We evaluated KAN on a dataset of flexible EHD pump parameters and compared its performance against RF, and MLP models. KAN achieved superior predictive accuracy, with Mean Squared Errors of 12.186 and 0.001 for pressure and flow rate predictions, respectively. The symbolic formulas extracted from KAN provided insights into the nonlinear relationships between input parameters and pump performance. These findings demonstrate that KAN offers exceptional accuracy and interpretability, making it a promising alternative for predictive modeling in electrohydrodynamic pumping.</li>

This study proposes a curriculum learning-inspired, data-centric training strategy that begins with simpler tasks and progresses to more complex ones, using criteria such as prompt length, attention scores, and loss values to structure the training data. Experiments with Mistral-7B (Jiang et al., 2023) and Gemma-7B (Team et al., 2024) models demonstrate that curriculum learning slightly improves performance compared to traditional random data shuffling. Notably, we observed that sorting data based on our proposed attention criteria generally led to better performance. This approach offers a sustainable method to enhance LLM performance without increasing model size or dataset volume, addressing scalability challenges in LLM training.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>There has been increasing interest in investigating the behaviours of large language models (LLMs) and LLM-powered chatbots by treating an LLM as a participant in a psychological experiment. We therefore developed an R package called "MacBehaviour" that aims to interact with more than 60 language models in one package (e.g., OpenAI's GPT family, the Claude family, Gemini, Llama family, and open-source models) and streamline the experimental process of LLMs behaviour experiments. The package offers a comprehensive set of functions designed for LLM experiments, covering experiment design, stimuli presentation, model behaviour manipulation, logging response and token probability. To demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of "MacBehaviour," we conducted three validation experiments on three LLMs (GPT-3.5, Llama-2 7B, and Vicuna-1.5 13B) to replicate sound-gender association in LLMs. The results consistently showed that they exhibit human-like tendencies to infer gender from novel personal names based on their phonology, as previously demonstrated (Cai et al., 2023). In summary, "MacBehaviour" is an R package for machine behaviour studies which offers a user-friendly interface and comprehensive features to simplify and standardize the experimental process.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>CAPTCHAs have become a ubiquitous tool in safeguarding applications from automated bots. Over time, the arms race between CAPTCHA development and evasion techniques has led to increasingly sophisticated and diverse designs. The latest iteration, reasoning CAPTCHAs, exploits tasks that are intuitively simple for humans but challenging for conventional AI technologies, thereby enhancing security measures. Driven by the evolving AI capabilities, particularly the advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), we investigate the potential of multimodal LLMs to solve modern reasoning CAPTCHAs. Our empirical analysis reveals that, despite their advanced reasoning capabilities, LLMs struggle to solve these CAPTCHAs effectively. In response, we introduce Oedipus, an innovative end-to-end framework for automated reasoning CAPTCHA solving. Central to this framework is a novel strategy that dissects the complex and human-easy-AI-hard tasks into a sequence of simpler and AI-easy steps. This is achieved through the development of a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for CAPTCHAs that guides LLMs in generating actionable sub-steps for each CAPTCHA challenge. The DSL is customized to ensure that each unit operation is a highly solvable subtask revealed in our previous empirical study. These sub-steps are then tackled sequentially using the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methodology. Our evaluation shows that Oedipus effectively resolves the studied CAPTCHAs, achieving an average success rate of 63.5\%. Remarkably, it also shows adaptability to the most recent CAPTCHA designs introduced in late 2023, which are not included in our initial study. This prompts a discussion on future strategies for designing reasoning CAPTCHAs that can effectively counter advanced AI solutions.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Anomaly detection in time series data is crucial across various domains. The scarcity of labeled data for such tasks has increased the attention towards unsupervised learning methods. These approaches, often relying solely on reconstruction error, typically fail to detect subtle anomalies in complex datasets. To address this, we introduce RESTAD, an adaptation of the Transformer model by incorporating a layer of Radial Basis Function (RBF) neurons within its architecture. This layer fits a non-parametric density in the latent representation, such that a high RBF output indicates similarity with predominantly normal training data. RESTAD integrates the RBF similarity scores with the reconstruction errors to increase sensitivity to anomalies. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that RESTAD outperforms various established baselines across multiple benchmark datasets.</li>

PeRFlow divides the sampling process of generative flows into several time windows and straightens the trajectories in each interval via the reflow operation, thereby approaching piecewise linear flows. PeRFlow achieves superior performance in a few-step generation. Moreover, through dedicated parameterizations, the obtained PeRFlow models show advantageous transfer ability, serving as universal plug-and-play accelerators that are compatible with various workflows based on the pre-trained diffusion models.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In recent years, deep learning based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has achieved remarkable success in many applications. However, their heavy reliance on extensive labeled data and limited generalization ability to unseen classes pose challenges to their suitability for medical image processing tasks. Few-shot learning, which utilizes a small amount of labeled data to generalize to unseen classes, has emerged as a critical research area, attracting substantial attention. Currently, most studies employ a prototype-based approach, in which prototypical networks are used to construct prototypes from the support set, guiding the processing of the query set to obtain the final results. While effective, this approach heavily relies on the support set while neglecting the query set, resulting in notable disparities within the model classes. To mitigate this drawback, we propose a novel Support-Query Prototype Fusion Network (SQPFNet). SQPFNet initially generates several support prototypes for the foreground areas of the support images, thus producing a coarse segmentation mask. Subsequently, a query prototype is constructed based on the coarse segmentation mask, additionally exploiting pattern information in the query set. Thus, SQPFNet constructs high-quality support-query fused prototypes, upon which the query image is segmented to obtain the final refined query mask. Evaluation results on two public datasets, SABS and CMR, show that SQPFNet achieves state-of-the-art performance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>High-quality images are crucial in remote sensing and UAV applications, but atmospheric haze can severely degrade image quality, making image dehazing a critical research area. Since the introduction of deep convolutional neural networks, numerous approaches have been proposed, and even more have emerged with the development of vision transformers and contrastive/few-shot learning. Simultaneously, papers describing dehazing architectures applicable to various Remote Sensing (RS) domains are also being published. This review goes beyond the traditional focus on benchmarked haze datasets, as we also explore the application of dehazing techniques to remote sensing and UAV datasets, providing a comprehensive overview of both deep learning and prior-based approaches in these domains. We identify key challenges, including the lack of large-scale RS datasets and the need for more robust evaluation metrics, and outline potential solutions and future research directions to address them. This review is the first, to our knowledge, to provide comprehensive discussions on both existing and very recent dehazing approaches (as of 2024) on benchmarked and RS datasets, including UAV-based imagery.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Colonoscopy is a common and practical method for detecting and treating polyps. Segmenting polyps from colonoscopy image is useful for diagnosis and surgery progress. Nevertheless, achieving excellent segmentation performance is still difficult because of polyp characteristics like shape, color, condition, and obvious non-distinction from the surrounding context. This work presents a new novel architecture namely Adaptation of Distinct Semantics for Uncertain Areas in Polyp Segmentation (ADSNet), which modifies misclassified details and recovers weak features having the ability to vanish and not be detected at the final stage. The architecture consists of a complementary trilateral decoder to produce an early global map. A continuous attention module modifies semantics of high-level features to analyze two separate semantics of the early global map. The suggested method is experienced on polyp benchmarks in learning ability and generalization ability, experimental results demonstrate the great correction and recovery ability leading to better segmentation performance compared to the other state of the art in the polyp image segmentation task. Especially, the proposed architecture could be experimented flexibly for other CNN-based encoders, Transformer-based encoders, and decoder backbones.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep image hashing aims to map input images into simple binary hash codes via deep neural networks and thus enable effective large-scale image retrieval. Recently, hybrid networks that combine convolution and Transformer have achieved superior performance on various computer tasks and have attracted extensive attention from researchers. Nevertheless, the potential benefits of such hybrid networks in image retrieval still need to be verified. To this end, we propose a hybrid convolutional and self-attention deep hashing method known as HybridHash. Specifically, we propose a backbone network with stage-wise architecture in which the block aggregation function is introduced to achieve the effect of local self-attention and reduce the computational complexity. The interaction module has been elaborately designed to promote the communication of information between image blocks and to enhance the visual representations. We have conducted comprehensive experiments on three widely used datasets: CIFAR-10, NUS-WIDE and IMAGENET. The experimental results demonstrate that the method proposed in this paper has superior performance with respect to state-of-the-art deep hashing methods.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, security, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Authentication in TLS is predominately carried out with X.509 digital certificates issued by certificate authorities (CA). The centralized nature of current public key infrastructures, however, comes along with severe risks, such as single points of failure and susceptibility to cyber-attacks, potentially undermining the security and trustworthiness of the entire system. With Decentralized Identifiers (DID) alongside distributed ledger technology, it becomes technically feasible to prove ownership of a unique identifier without requiring an attestation of the proof's public key by a centralized and therefore vulnerable CA. This article presents DID Connect, a novel authentication scheme for TLS 1.3 that empowers entities to authenticate in a TLS-compliant way with self-issued X.509 certificates that are equipped with ledger-anchored DIDs instead of CA-issued identifiers. It facilitates the exchange of tamper-proof and 3rd-party attested claims in the form of DID-bound Verifiable Credentials after the TLS handshake to complete the authentication with a full identification of the communication partner. A prototypical implementation shows comparable TLS handshake durations of DID Connect if verification material is cached and reasonable prolongations if it is obtained from a ledger. The significant speed improvement of the resulting TLS channel over a widely used, DID-based alternative transport protocol on the application layer demonstrates the potential of DID Connect to become a viable solution for the establishment of secure and trustful end-to-end communication links with decentrally managed digital identities.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Speculative decoding emerges as a pivotal technique for enhancing the inference speed of Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite recent research aiming to improve prediction efficiency, multi-sample speculative decoding has been overlooked due to varying numbers of accepted tokens within a batch in the verification phase. Vanilla method adds padding tokens in order to ensure that the number of new tokens remains consistent across samples. However, this increases the computational and memory access overhead, thereby reducing the speedup ratio. We propose a novel method that can resolve the issue of inconsistent tokens accepted by different samples without necessitating an increase in memory or computing overhead. Furthermore, our proposed method can handle the situation where the prediction tokens of different samples are inconsistent without the need to add padding tokens. Sufficient experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our method. Our code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The tool-use Large Language Models (LLMs) that integrate with external Python interpreters have significantly enhanced mathematical reasoning capabilities for open-source LLMs, while tool-free methods chose another track: augmenting math reasoning data. However, a great method to integrate the above two research paths and combine their advantages remains to be explored. In this work, we firstly include new math questions via multi-perspective data augmenting methods and then synthesize code-nested solutions to them. The open LLMs (i.e., Llama-2) are finetuned on the augmented dataset to get the resulting models, MuMath-Code ($\mu$-Math-Code). During the inference phase, our MuMath-Code generates code and interacts with the external python interpreter to get the execution results. Therefore, MuMath-Code leverages the advantages of both the external tool and data augmentation. To fully leverage the advantages of our augmented data, we propose a two-stage training strategy: In Stage-1, we finetune Llama-2 on pure CoT data to get an intermediate model, which then is trained on the code-nested data in Stage-2 to get the resulting MuMath-Code. Our MuMath-Code-7B achieves 83.8 on GSM8K and 52.4 on MATH, while MuMath-Code-70B model achieves new state-of-the-art performance among open methods -- achieving 90.7% on GSM8K and 55.1% on MATH. Extensive experiments validate the combination of tool use and data augmentation, as well as our two-stage training strategy. We release the proposed dataset along with the associated code for public use.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper investigates the feasibility of using pre-trained generative Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the assignment of ICD-10 codes to historical causes of death. Due to the complex narratives often found in historical causes of death, this task has traditionally been manually performed by coding experts. We evaluate the ability of GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Llama 2 LLMs to accurately assign ICD-10 codes on the HiCaD dataset that contains causes of death recorded in the civil death register entries of 19,361 individuals from Ipswich, Kilmarnock, and the Isle of Skye from the UK between 1861-1901. Our findings show that GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Llama 2 assign the correct code for 69%, 83%, and 40% of causes, respectively. However, we achieve a maximum accuracy of 89% by standard machine learning techniques. All LLMs performed better for causes of death that contained terms still in use today, compared to archaic terms. Also they perform better for short causes (1-2 words) compared to longer causes. LLMs therefore do not currently perform well enough for historical ICD-10 code assignment tasks. We suggest further fine-tuning or alternative frameworks to achieve adequate performance.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in tasks related to perception and control, there are still several unresolved concerns regarding the privacy of their training data, particularly in the context of vulnerability to Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs). In this paper, we explore a connection between the susceptibility to membership inference attacks and the vulnerability to distillation-based functionality stealing attacks. In particular, we propose {GLiRA}, a distillation-guided approach to membership inference attack on the black-box neural network. We observe that the knowledge distillation significantly improves the efficiency of likelihood ratio of membership inference attack, especially in the black-box setting, i.e., when the architecture of the target model is unknown to the attacker. We evaluate the proposed method across multiple image classification datasets and models and demonstrate that likelihood ratio attacks when guided by the knowledge distillation, outperform the current state-of-the-art membership inference attacks in the black-box setting.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Tattoos have been used effectively as soft biometrics to assist law enforcement in the identification of offenders and victims, as they contain discriminative information, and are a useful indicator to locate members of a criminal gang or organisation. Due to various privacy issues in the acquisition of images containing tattoos, only a limited number of databases exists. This lack of databases has delayed the development of new methods to effectively retrieve a potential suspect's tattoo images from a candidate gallery. To mitigate this issue, in our work, we use an unsupervised generative approach to create a balanced database consisting of 28,550 semi-synthetic images with tattooed subjects from 571 tattoo categories. Further, we introduce a novel Tattoo Template Reconstruction Network (TattTRN), which learns to map the input tattoo sample to its respective tattoo template to enhance the distinguishing attributes of the final feature embedding. Experimental results with real data, i.e., WebTattoo and BIVTatt databases, demonstrate the soundness of the presented approach: an accuracy of up to 99% is achieved for checking at most the first 20 entries of the candidate list.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Unveiling the real appearance of retouched faces to prevent malicious users from deceptive advertising and economic fraud has been an increasing concern in the era of digital economics. This article makes the first attempt to investigate the face retouching reversal (FRR) problem. We first collect an FRR dataset, named deepFRR, which contains 50,000 StyleGAN-generated high-resolution (1024*1024) facial images and their corresponding retouched ones by a commercial online API. To our best knowledge, deepFRR is the first FRR dataset tailored for training the deep FRR models. Then, we propose a novel diffusion-based FRR approach (FRRffusion) for the FRR task. Our FRRffusion consists of a coarse-to-fine two-stage network: A diffusion-based Facial Morpho-Architectonic Restorer (FMAR) is constructed to generate the basic contours of low-resolution faces in the first stage, while a Transformer-based Hyperrealistic Facial Detail Generator (HFDG) is designed to create high-resolution facial details in the second stage. Tested on deepFRR, our FRRffusion surpasses the GP-UNIT and Stable Diffusion methods by a large margin in four widespread quantitative metrics. Especially, the de-retouched images by our FRRffusion are visually much closer to the raw face images than both the retouched face images and those restored by the GP-UNIT and Stable Diffusion methods in terms of qualitative evaluation with 85 subjects. These results sufficiently validate the efficacy of our work, bridging the recently-standing gap between the FRR and generic image restoration tasks.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Automatic dependency parsing of Thai sentences has been underexplored, as evidenced by the lack of large Thai dependency treebanks with complete dependency structures and the lack of a published systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art models, especially transformer-based parsers. In this work, we address these problems by introducing Thai Universal Dependency Treebank (TUD), a new largest Thai treebank consisting of 3,627 trees annotated in accordance with the Universal Dependencies (UD) framework. We then benchmark dependency parsing models that incorporate pretrained transformers as encoders and train them on Thai-PUD and our TUD. The evaluation results show that most of our models can outperform other models reported in previous papers and provide insight into the optimal choices of components to include in Thai dependency parsers. The new treebank and every model's full prediction generated in our experiment are made available on a GitHub repository for further study.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Point cloud registration is a fundamental task for estimating rigid transformations between point clouds. Previous studies have used geometric information for extracting features, matching and estimating transformation. Recently, owing to the advancement of RGB-D sensors, researchers have attempted to utilize visual information to improve registration performance. However, these studies focused on extracting distinctive features by deep feature fusion, which cannot effectively solve the negative effects of each feature's weakness, and cannot sufficiently leverage the valid information. In this paper, we propose a new feature combination framework, which applies a looser but more effective fusion and can achieve better performance. An explicit filter based on transformation consistency is designed for the combination framework, which can overcome each feature's weakness. And an adaptive threshold determined by the error distribution is proposed to extract more valid information from the two types of features. Owing to the distinctive design, our proposed framework can estimate more accurate correspondences and is applicable to both hand-crafted and learning-based feature descriptors. Experiments on ScanNet show that our method achieves a state-of-the-art performance and the rotation accuracy of 99.1%.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Object detection techniques for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) rely on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), which are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Nonetheless, adversarial patches generated by existing algorithms in the UAV domain pay very little attention to the naturalness of adversarial patches. Moreover, imposing constraints directly on adversarial patches makes it difficult to generate patches that appear natural to the human eye while ensuring a high attack success rate. We notice that patches are natural looking when their overall color is consistent with the environment. Therefore, we propose a new method named Environmental Matching Attack(EMA) to address the issue of optimizing the adversarial patch under the constraints of color. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to consider natural patches in the domain of UAVs. The EMA method exploits strong prior knowledge of a pretrained stable diffusion to guide the optimization direction of the adversarial patch, where the text guidance can restrict the color of the patch. To better match the environment, the contrast and brightness of the patch are appropriately adjusted. Instead of optimizing the adversarial patch itself, we optimize an adversarial perturbation patch which initializes to zero so that the model can better trade off attacking performance and naturalness. Experiments conducted on the DroneVehicle and Carpk datasets have shown that our work can reach nearly the same attack performance in the digital attack(no greater than 2 in mAP$\%$), surpass the baseline method in the physical specific scenarios, and exhibit a significant advantage in terms of naturalness in visualization and color difference with the environment.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) empower low-footprint embedded devices for real-time on-device Machine Learning. While many acknowledge the potential benefits of TinyML, its practical implementation presents unique challenges. This study aims to bridge the gap between prototyping single TinyML models and developing reliable TinyML systems in production: (1) Embedded devices operate in dynamically changing conditions. Existing TinyML solutions primarily focus on inference, with models trained offline on powerful machines and deployed as static objects. However, static models may underperform in the real world due to evolving input data distributions. We propose online learning to enable training on constrained devices, adapting local models towards the latest field conditions. (2) Nevertheless, current on-device learning methods struggle with heterogeneous deployment conditions and the scarcity of labeled data when applied across numerous devices. We introduce federated meta-learning incorporating online learning to enhance model generalization, facilitating rapid learning. This approach ensures optimal performance among distributed devices by knowledge sharing. (3) Moreover, TinyML's pivotal advantage is widespread adoption. Embedded devices and TinyML models prioritize extreme efficiency, leading to diverse characteristics ranging from memory and sensors to model architectures. Given their diversity and non-standardized representations, managing these resources becomes challenging as TinyML systems scale up. We present semantic management for the joint management of models and devices at scale. We demonstrate our methods through a basic regression example and then assess them in three real-world TinyML applications: handwritten character image classification, keyword audio classification, and smart building presence detection, confirming our approaches' effectiveness.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Available training data for named entity recognition (NER) often contains a significant percentage of incorrect labels for entity types and entity boundaries. Such label noise poses challenges for supervised learning and may significantly deteriorate model quality. To address this, prior work proposed various noise-robust learning approaches capable of learning from data with partially incorrect labels. These approaches are typically evaluated using simulated noise where the labels in a clean dataset are automatically corrupted. However, as we show in this paper, this leads to unrealistic noise that is far easier to handle than real noise caused by human error or semi-automatic annotation. To enable the study of the impact of various types of real noise, we introduce NoiseBench, an NER benchmark consisting of clean training data corrupted with 6 types of real noise, including expert errors, crowdsourcing errors, automatic annotation errors and LLM errors. We present an analysis that shows that real noise is significantly more challenging than simulated noise, and show that current state-of-the-art models for noise-robust learning fall far short of their theoretically achievable upper bound. We release NoiseBench to the research community.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>For language model classification, would you prefer having only one workable class or having every class working? The latter makes more practical uses. Especially for large language models (LLMs), the fact that they achieve a fair overall accuracy by in-context learning (ICL) obscures a large difference in individual class accuracies. In this work, we uncover and tackle language models' imbalance in per-class prediction accuracy by reconceptualizing it as the Contextual Oddity Bias (COBias), and we are the first to engage nonlinear integer programming (NIP) to debias it. Briefly, COBias refers to the difference in accuracy by a class A compared to its ''odd'' class, which holds the majority wrong predictions of class A. With the COBias metric, we reveal that LLMs of varied scales and families exhibit large per-class accuracy differences. Then we propose Debiasing as Nonlinear Integer Programming (DNIP) to correct ICL per-class probabilities for lower bias and higher overall accuracy. Our optimization objective is directly based on the evaluation scores by COBias and accuracy metrics, solved by simulated annealing. Evaluations on three LLMs across seven NLP classification tasks show that DNIP simultaneously achieves significant COBias reduction ($-27\%$) and accuracy improvement ($+12\%$) over the conventional ICL approach, suggesting that modeling pairwise class accuracy differences is a direction in pushing forward more accurate, more reliable LLM predictions.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Detecting anomaly edges for dynamic graphs aims to identify edges significantly deviating from the normal pattern and can be applied in various domains, such as cybersecurity, financial transactions and AIOps. With the evolving of time, the types of anomaly edges are emerging and the labeled anomaly samples are few for each type. Current methods are either designed to detect randomly inserted edges or require sufficient labeled data for model training, which harms their applicability for real-world applications. In this paper, we study this problem by cooperating with the rich knowledge encoded in large language models(LLMs) and propose a method, namely AnomalyLLM. To align the dynamic graph with LLMs, AnomalyLLM pre-trains a dynamic-aware encoder to generate the representations of edges and reprograms the edges using the prototypes of word embeddings. Along with the encoder, we design an in-context learning framework that integrates the information of a few labeled samples to achieve few-shot anomaly detection. Experiments on four datasets reveal that AnomalyLLM can not only significantly improve the performance of few-shot anomaly detection, but also achieve superior results on new anomalies without any update of model parameters.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Hyperparameter optimization plays a pivotal role in enhancing the predictive performance and generalization capabilities of ML models. However, in many applications, we do not only care about predictive performance but also about objectives such as inference time, memory, or energy consumption. In such MOO scenarios, determining the importance of hyperparameters poses a significant challenge due to the complex interplay between the conflicting objectives. In this paper, we propose the first method for assessing the importance of hyperparameters in the context of multi-objective hyperparameter optimization. Our approach leverages surrogate-based hyperparameter importance (HPI) measures, i.e. fANOVA and ablation paths, to provide insights into the impact of hyperparameters on the optimization objectives. Specifically, we compute the a-priori scalarization of the objectives and determine the importance of the hyperparameters for different objective tradeoffs. Through extensive empirical evaluations on diverse benchmark datasets with three different objectives paired with accuracy, namely time, demographic parity, and energy consumption, we demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method. Our findings not only offer valuable guidance for hyperparameter tuning in MOO tasks but also contribute to advancing the understanding of HPI in complex optimization scenarios.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Existing Blind image Super-Resolution (BSR) methods focus on estimating either kernel or degradation information, but have long overlooked the essential content details. In this paper, we propose a novel BSR approach, Content-aware Degradation-driven Transformer (CDFormer), to capture both degradation and content representations. However, low-resolution images cannot provide enough content details, and thus we introduce a diffusion-based module $CDFormer_{diff}$ to first learn Content Degradation Prior (CDP) in both low- and high-resolution images, and then approximate the real distribution given only low-resolution information. Moreover, we apply an adaptive SR network $CDFormer_{SR}$ that effectively utilizes CDP to refine features. Compared to previous diffusion-based SR methods, we treat the diffusion model as an estimator that can overcome the limitations of expensive sampling time and excessive diversity. Experiments show that CDFormer can outperform existing methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks under blind settings.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) require large amounts of annotated training data for a good performance. Often this data is generated using manual labeling (error-prone and time-consuming) or rendering (requiring geometry and material information). Both approaches make it difficult or uneconomic to apply them to many small-scale applications. A fast and straightforward approach of acquiring the necessary training data would allow the adoption of deep learning to even the smallest of applications. Chroma keying is the process of replacing a color (usually blue or green) with another background. Instead of chroma keying, we propose luminance keying for fast and straightforward training image acquisition. We deploy a black screen with high light absorption (99.99\%) to record roughly 1-minute long videos of our target objects, circumventing typical problems of chroma keying, such as color bleeding or color overlap between background color and object color. Next we automatically mask our objects using simple brightness thresholding, saving the need for manual annotation. Finally, we automatically place the objects on random backgrounds and train a 2D object detector. We do extensive evaluation of the performance on the widely-used YCB-V object set and compare favourably to other conventional techniques such as rendering, without needing 3D meshes, materials or any other information of our target objects and in a fraction of the time needed for other approaches. Our work demonstrates highly accurate training data acquisition allowing to start training state-of-the-art networks within minutes.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Depth images and thermal images contain the spatial geometry information and surface temperature information, which can act as complementary information for the RGB modality. However, the quality of the depth and thermal images is often unreliable in some challenging scenarios, which will result in the performance degradation of the two-modal based salient object detection (SOD). Meanwhile, some researchers pay attention to the triple-modal SOD task, where they attempt to explore the complementarity of the RGB image, the depth image, and the thermal image. However, existing triple-modal SOD methods fail to perceive the quality of depth maps and thermal images, which leads to performance degradation when dealing with scenes with low-quality depth and thermal images. Therefore, we propose a quality-aware selective fusion network (QSF-Net) to conduct VDT salient object detection, which contains three subnets including the initial feature extraction subnet, the quality-aware region selection subnet, and the region-guided selective fusion subnet. Firstly, except for extracting features, the initial feature extraction subnet can generate a preliminary prediction map from each modality via a shrinkage pyramid architecture. Then, we design the weakly-supervised quality-aware region selection subnet to generate the quality-aware maps. Concretely, we first find the high-quality and low-quality regions by using the preliminary predictions, which further constitute the pseudo label that can be used to train this subnet. Finally, the region-guided selective fusion subnet purifies the initial features under the guidance of the quality-aware maps, and then fuses the triple-modal features and refines the edge details of prediction maps through the intra-modality and inter-modality attention (IIA) module and the edge refinement (ER) module, respectively. Extensive experiments are performed on VDT-2048</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, generative, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With rapid advances, generative large language models (LLMs) dominate various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks from understanding to reasoning. Yet, language models' inherent vulnerabilities may be exacerbated due to increased accessibility and unrestricted model training on massive textual data from the Internet. A malicious adversary may publish poisoned data online and conduct backdoor attacks on the victim LLMs pre-trained on the poisoned data. Backdoored LLMs behave innocuously for normal queries and generate harmful responses when the backdoor trigger is activated. Despite significant efforts paid to LLMs' safety issues, LLMs are still struggling against backdoor attacks. As Anthropic recently revealed, existing safety training strategies, including supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), fail to revoke the backdoors once the LLM is backdoored during the pre-training stage. In this paper, we present Simulate and Eliminate (SANDE) to erase the undesired backdoored mappings for generative LLMs. We initially propose Overwrite Supervised Fine-tuning (OSFT) for effective backdoor removal when the trigger is known. Then, to handle the scenarios where the trigger patterns are unknown, we integrate OSFT into our two-stage framework, SANDE. Unlike previous works that center on the identification of backdoors, our safety-enhanced LLMs are able to behave normally even when the exact triggers are activated. We conduct comprehensive experiments to show that our proposed SANDE is effective against backdoor attacks while bringing minimal harm to LLMs' powerful capability without any additional access to unbackdoored clean models. We will release the reproducible code.</li>

In this paper, we empirically investigate the translation robustness of Indonesian-Chinese translation in the face of various naturally occurring noise. To assess this, we create a robustness evaluation benchmark dataset for Indonesian-Chinese translation. This dataset is automatically translated into Chinese using four NLLB-200 models of different sizes. We conduct both automatic and human evaluations. Our in-depth analysis reveal the correlations between translation error types and the types of noise present, how these correlations change across different model sizes, and the relationships between automatic evaluation indicators and human evaluation indicators.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Autonomous driving systems require a quick and robust perception of the nearby environment to carry out their routines effectively. With the aim to avoid collisions and drive safely, autonomous driving systems rely heavily on object detection. However, 2D object detections alone are insufficient; more information, such as relative velocity and distance, is required for safer planning. Monocular 3D object detectors try to solve this problem by directly predicting 3D bounding boxes and object velocities given a camera image. Recent research estimates time-to-contact in a per-pixel manner and suggests that it is more effective measure than velocity and depth combined. However, per-pixel time-to-contact requires object detection to serve its purpose effectively and hence increases overall computational requirements as two different models need to run. To address this issue, we propose per-object time-to-contact estimation by extending object detection models to additionally predict the time-to-contact attribute for each object. We compare our proposed approach with existing time-to-contact methods and provide benchmarking results on well-known datasets. Our proposed approach achieves higher precision compared to prior art while using a single image.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Integrating the different data modalities of cancer patients can significantly improve the predictive performance of patient survival. However, most existing methods ignore the simultaneous utilization of rich semantic features at different scales in pathology images. When collecting multimodal data and extracting features, there is a likelihood of encountering intra-modality missing data, introducing noise into the multimodal data. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a new end-to-end framework, FORESEE, for robustly predicting patient survival by mining multimodal information. Specifically, the cross-fusion transformer effectively utilizes features at the cellular level, tissue level, and tumor heterogeneity level to correlate prognosis through a cross-scale feature cross-fusion method. This enhances the ability of pathological image feature representation. Secondly, the hybrid attention encoder (HAE) uses the denoising contextual attention module to obtain the contextual relationship features and local detail features of the molecular data. HAE's channel attention module obtains global features of molecular data. Furthermore, to address the issue of missing information within modalities, we propose an asymmetrically masked triplet masked autoencoder to reconstruct lost information within modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods on four benchmark datasets in both complete and missing settings.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, privacy, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Decentralized learning (DL) faces increased vulnerability to privacy breaches due to sophisticated attacks on machine learning (ML) models. Secure aggregation is a computationally efficient cryptographic technique that enables multiple parties to compute an aggregate of their private data while keeping their individual inputs concealed from each other and from any central aggregator. To enhance communication efficiency in DL, sparsification techniques are used, selectively sharing only the most crucial parameters or gradients in a model, thereby maintaining efficiency without notably compromising accuracy. However, applying secure aggregation to sparsified models in DL is challenging due to the transmission of disjoint parameter sets by distinct nodes, which can prevent masks from canceling out effectively. This paper introduces CESAR, a novel secure aggregation protocol for DL designed to be compatible with existing sparsification mechanisms. CESAR provably defends against honest-but-curious adversaries and can be formally adapted to counteract collusion between them. We provide a foundational understanding of the interaction between the sparsification carried out by the nodes and the proportion of the parameters shared under CESAR in both colluding and non-colluding environments, offering analytical insight into the working and applicability of the protocol. Experiments on a network with 48 nodes in a 3-regular topology show that with random subsampling, CESAR is always within 0.5% accuracy of decentralized parallel stochastic gradient descent (D-PSGD), while adding only 11% of data overhead. Moreover, it surpasses the accuracy on TopK by up to 0.3% on independent and identically distributed (IID) data.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Despite advancements in English-dominant generative large language models, further development is needed for low-resource languages to enhance global accessibility. The primary methods for representing these languages are monolingual and multilingual pretraining. Monolingual pretraining is expensive due to hardware requirements, and multilingual models often have uneven performance across languages. This study explores an alternative solution by adapting large language models, primarily trained on English, to low-resource languages. We assess various strategies, including continual training, instruction fine-tuning, task-specific fine-tuning, and vocabulary extension. The results show that continual training improves language comprehension, as reflected in perplexity scores, and task-specific tuning generally enhances performance of downstream tasks. However, extending the vocabulary shows no substantial benefits. Additionally, while larger models improve task performance with few-shot tuning, multilingual models perform worse than their monolingual counterparts when adapted.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Anomaly detection in distributed systems such as High-Performance Computing (HPC) clusters is vital for early fault detection, performance optimisation, security monitoring, reliability in general but also operational insights. Deep Neural Networks have seen successful use in detecting long-term anomalies in multidimensional data, originating for instance from industrial or medical systems, or weather prediction. A downside of such methods is that they require a static input size, or lose data through cropping, sampling, or other dimensionality reduction methods, making deployment on systems with variability on monitored data channels, such as computing clusters difficult. To address these problems, we present DeepHYDRA (Deep Hybrid DBSCAN/Reduction-Based Anomaly Detection) which combines DBSCAN and learning-based anomaly detection. DBSCAN clustering is used to find point anomalies in time-series data, mitigating the risk of missing outliers through loss of information when reducing input data to a fixed number of channels. A deep learning-based time-series anomaly detection method is then applied to the reduced data in order to identify long-term outliers. This hybrid approach reduces the chances of missing anomalies that might be made indistinguishable from normal data by the reduction process, and likewise enables the algorithm to be scalable and tolerate partial system failures while retaining its detection capabilities. Using a subset of the well-known SMD dataset family, a modified variant of the Eclipse dataset, as well as an in-house dataset with a large variability in active data channels, made publicly available with this work, we furthermore analyse computational intensity, memory footprint, and activation counts. DeepHYDRA is shown to reliably detect different types of anomalies in both large and complex datasets.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Equation discovery is aimed at directly extracting physical laws from data and has emerged as a pivotal research domain. Previous methods based on symbolic mathematics have achieved substantial advancements, but often require the design of implementation of complex algorithms. In this paper, we introduce a new framework that utilizes natural language-based prompts to guide large language models (LLMs) in automatically mining governing equations from data. Specifically, we first utilize the generation capability of LLMs to generate diverse equations in string form, and then evaluate the generated equations based on observations. In the optimization phase, we propose two alternately iterated strategies to optimize generated equations collaboratively. The first strategy is to take LLMs as a black-box optimizer and achieve equation self-improvement based on historical samples and their performance. The second strategy is to instruct LLMs to perform evolutionary operators for global search. Experiments are extensively conducted on both partial differential equations and ordinary differential equations. Results demonstrate that our framework can discover effective equations to reveal the underlying physical laws under various nonlinear dynamic systems. Further comparisons are made with state-of-the-art models, demonstrating good stability and usability. Our framework substantially lowers the barriers to learning and applying equation discovery techniques, demonstrating the application potential of LLMs in the field of knowledge discovery.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Expanding a dictionary of pre-selected keywords is crucial for tasks in information retrieval, such as database query and online data collection. Here we propose Local Graph-based Dictionary Expansion (LGDE), a method that uses tools from manifold learning and network science for the data-driven discovery of keywords starting from a seed dictionary. At the heart of LGDE lies the creation of a word similarity graph derived from word embeddings and the application of local community detection based on graph diffusion to discover semantic neighbourhoods of pre-defined seed keywords. The diffusion in the local graph manifold allows the exploration of the complex nonlinear geometry of word embeddings and can capture word similarities based on paths of semantic association. We validate our method on a corpus of hate speech-related posts from Reddit and Gab and show that LGDE enriches the list of keywords and achieves significantly better performance than threshold methods based on direct word similarities. We further demonstrate the potential of our method through a real-world use case from communication science, where LGDE is evaluated quantitatively on data collected and analysed by domain experts by expanding a conspiracy-related dictionary.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In recent years, diffusion models (DMs) have become a popular method for generating synthetic data. By achieving samples of higher quality, they quickly became superior to generative adversarial networks (GANs) and the current state-of-the-art method in generative modeling. However, their potential has not yet been exploited in radar, where the lack of available training data is a long-standing problem. In this work, a specific type of DMs, namely denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) is adapted to the SAR domain. We investigate the network choice and specific diffusion parameters for conditional and unconditional SAR image generation. In our experiments, we show that DDPM qualitatively and quantitatively outperforms state-of-the-art GAN-based methods for SAR image generation. Finally, we show that DDPM profits from pretraining on largescale clutter data, generating SAR images of even higher quality.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Mainstream approaches to spectral reconstruction (SR) primarily focus on designing Convolution- and Transformer-based architectures. However, CNN methods often face challenges in handling long-range dependencies, whereas Transformers are constrained by computational efficiency limitations. Recent breakthroughs in state-space model (e.g., Mamba) has attracted significant attention due to its near-linear computational efficiency and superior performance, prompting our investigation into its potential for SR problem. To this end, we propose the Gradient-guided Mamba for Spectral Reconstruction from RGB Images, dubbed GMSR-Net. GMSR-Net is a lightweight model characterized by a global receptive field and linear computational complexity. Its core comprises multiple stacked Gradient Mamba (GM) blocks, each featuring a tri-branch structure. In addition to benefiting from efficient global feature representation by Mamba block, we further innovatively introduce spatial gradient attention and spectral gradient attention to guide the reconstruction of spatial and spectral cues. GMSR-Net demonstrates a significant accuracy-efficiency trade-off, achieving state-of-the-art performance while markedly reducing the number of parameters and computational burdens. Compared to existing approaches, GMSR-Net slashes parameters and FLOPS by substantial margins of 10 times and 20 times, respectively. Code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generating human motions from textual descriptions has gained growing research interest due to its wide range of applications. However, only a few works consider human-scene interactions together with text conditions, which is crucial for visual and physical realism. This paper focuses on the task of generating human motions in 3D indoor scenes given text descriptions of the human-scene interactions. This task presents challenges due to the multi-modality nature of text, scene, and motion, as well as the need for spatial reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose a new approach that decomposes the complex problem into two more manageable sub-problems: (1) language grounding of the target object and (2) object-centric motion generation. For language grounding of the target object, we leverage the power of large language models. For motion generation, we design an object-centric scene representation for the generative model to focus on the target object, thereby reducing the scene complexity and facilitating the modeling of the relationship between human motions and the object. Experiments demonstrate the better motion quality of our approach compared to baselines and validate our design choices.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper undertakes an empirical study to revisit the latest advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs): Video Assistant. This study, namely FreeVA, aims to extend existing image-based MLLM to the video domain in a training-free manner. The study provides an essential, yet must-know baseline, and reveals several surprising findings: 1) FreeVA, leveraging only offline image-based MLLM without additional training, excels in zero-shot video question-answering (e.g., MSVD-QA, ActivityNet-QA, and MSRVTT-QA), even surpassing state-of-the-art methods that involve video instruction tuning. 2) While mainstream video-based MLLMs typically initialize with an image-based MLLM (e.g., LLaVA) and then fine-tune using video instruction tuning, the study indicates that utilizing the widely adopted VideoInstruct-100K for video instruction tuning doesn't actually lead to better performance compared to not training at all. 3) The commonly used evaluation metrics in existing works are significantly influenced by changes in the GPT API version over time. If ignored, this could affect the fairness and uniformity of comparisons between different methods and impact the analysis and judgment of researchers in the field. The advancement of MLLMs is currently thriving, drawing numerous researchers into the field. We aim for this work to serve as a plug-and-play, simple yet effective baseline, encouraging the direct evaluation of existing MLLMs in video domain while also standardizing the field of video conversational models to a certain extent. Also, we encourage researchers to reconsider: Have current video MLLM methods truly acquired knowledge beyond image MLLM? Code is available at this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Data imputation, the process of filling in missing feature elements for incomplete data sets, plays a crucial role in data-driven learning. A fundamental belief is that data imputation is helpful for learning performance, and it follows that the pursuit of better classification can guide the data imputation process. While some works consider using label information to assist in this task, their simplistic utilization of labels lacks flexibility and may rely on strict assumptions. In this paper, we propose a new framework that effectively leverages supervision information to complete missing data in a manner conducive to classification. Specifically, this framework operates in two stages. Firstly, it leverages labels to supervise the optimization of similarity relationships among data, represented by the kernel matrix, with the goal of enhancing classification accuracy. To mitigate overfitting that may occur during this process, a perturbation variable is introduced to improve the robustness of the framework. Secondly, the learned kernel matrix serves as additional supervision information to guide data imputation through regression, utilizing the block coordinate descent method. The superiority of the proposed method is evaluated on four real-world data sets by comparing it with state-of-the-art imputation methods. Remarkably, our algorithm significantly outperforms other methods when the data is missing more than 60\% of the features</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Object pose estimation is a fundamental computer vision problem with broad applications in augmented reality and robotics. Over the past decade, deep learning models, due to their superior accuracy and robustness, have increasingly supplanted conventional algorithms reliant on engineered point pair features. Nevertheless, several challenges persist in contemporary methods, including their dependency on labeled training data, model compactness, robustness under challenging conditions, and their ability to generalize to novel unseen objects. A recent survey discussing the progress made on different aspects of this area, outstanding challenges, and promising future directions, is missing. To fill this gap, we discuss the recent advances in deep learning-based object pose estimation, covering all three formulations of the problem, i.e., instance-level, category-level, and unseen object pose estimation. Our survey also covers multiple input data modalities, degrees-of-freedom of output poses, object properties, and downstream tasks, providing readers with a holistic understanding of this field. Additionally, it discusses training paradigms of different domains, inference modes, application areas, evaluation metrics, and benchmark datasets, as well as reports the performance of current state-of-the-art methods on these benchmarks, thereby facilitating readers in selecting the most suitable method for their application. Finally, the survey identifies key challenges, reviews prevailing trends along with their pros and cons, and identifies promising directions for future research.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Many aging individuals encounter challenges in effectively tracking their dietary intake, exacerbating their susceptibility to nutrition-related health complications. Self-reporting methods are often inaccurate and suffer from substantial bias; however, leveraging intelligent prediction methods can automate and enhance precision in this process. Recent work has explored using computer vision prediction systems to predict nutritional information from food images. Still, these methods are often tailored to specific situations, require other inputs in addition to a food image, or do not provide comprehensive nutritional information. This paper aims to enhance the efficacy of dietary intake estimation by leveraging various neural network architectures to directly predict a meal's nutritional content from its image. Through comprehensive experimentation and evaluation, we present NutritionVerse-Direct, a model utilizing a vision transformer base architecture with three fully connected layers that lead to five regression heads predicting calories (kcal), mass (g), protein (g), fat (g), and carbohydrates (g) present in a meal. NutritionVerse-Direct yields a combined mean average error score on the NutritionVerse-Real dataset of 412.6, an improvement of 25.5% over the Inception-ResNet model, demonstrating its potential for improving dietary intake estimation accuracy.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The ever-increasing use of generative models in various fields where tabular data is used highlights the need for robust and standardized validation metrics to assess the similarity between real and synthetic data. Current methods lack a unified framework and rely on diverse and often inconclusive statistical measures. Divergences, which quantify discrepancies between data distributions, offer a promising avenue for validation. However, traditional approaches calculate divergences independently for each feature due to the complexity of joint distribution modeling. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a novel approach that uses divergence estimation to overcome the limitations of marginal comparisons. Our core contribution lies in applying a divergence estimator to build a validation metric considering the joint distribution of real and synthetic data. We leverage a probabilistic classifier to approximate the density ratio between datasets, allowing the capture of complex relationships. We specifically calculate two divergences: the well-known Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and the Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence. KL divergence offers an established use in the field, while JS divergence is symmetric and bounded, providing a reliable metric. The efficacy of this approach is demonstrated through a series of experiments with varying distribution complexities. The initial phase involves comparing estimated divergences with analytical solutions for simple distributions, setting a benchmark for accuracy. Finally, we validate our method on a real-world dataset and its corresponding synthetic counterpart, showcasing its effectiveness in practical applications. This research offers a significant contribution with applicability beyond tabular data and the potential to improve synthetic data validation in various fields.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While machine learning algorithms hold promise for personalised medicine, their clinical adoption remains limited. One critical factor contributing to this restraint is sample selection bias (SSB) which refers to the study population being less representative of the target population, leading to biased and potentially harmful decisions. Despite being well-known in the literature, SSB remains scarcely studied in machine learning for healthcare. Moreover, the existing techniques try to correct the bias by balancing distributions between the study and the target populations, which may result in a loss of predictive performance. To address these problems, our study illustrates the potential risks associated with SSB by examining SSB's impact on the performance of machine learning algorithms. Most importantly, we propose a new research direction for addressing SSB, based on the target population identification rather than the bias correction. Specifically, we propose two independent networks (T-Net) and a multitasking network (MT-Net) for addressing SSB, where one network/task identifies the target subpopulation which is representative of the study population and the second makes predictions for the identified subpopulation. Our empirical results with synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets highlight that SSB can lead to a large drop in the performance of an algorithm for the target population as compared with the study population, as well as a substantial difference in the performance for the target subpopulations that are representative of the selected and the non-selected patients from the study population. Furthermore, our proposed techniques demonstrate robustness across various settings, including different dataset sizes, event rates, and selection rates, outperforming the existing bias correction techniques.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In driving scenarios, automobile active safety systems are increasingly incorporating deep learning technology. These systems typically need to handle multiple tasks simultaneously, such as detecting fatigue driving and recognizing the driver's identity. However, the traditional parallel-style approach of combining multiple single-task models tends to waste resources when dealing with similar tasks. Therefore, we propose a novel tree-style multi-task modeling approach for multi-task learning, which rooted at a shared backbone, more dedicated separate module branches are appended as the model pipeline goes deeper. Following the tree-style approach, we propose a multi-task learning model for simultaneously performing driver fatigue detection and face recognition for identifying a driver. This model shares a common feature extraction backbone module, with further separated feature extraction and classification module branches. The dedicated branches exploit and combine spatial and channel attention mechanisms to generate space-channel fused-attention enhanced features, leading to improved detection performance. As only single-task datasets are available, we introduce techniques including alternating updation and gradient accumulation for training our multi-task model using only the single-task datasets. The effectiveness of our tree-style multi-task learning model is verified through extensive validations.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We use positional-unigram byte models along with maximum likelihood for generalized TLS fingerprinting and empirically show that it is robust to cipher stunting. Our approach creates a set of positional-unigram byte models from client hello messages. Each positional-unigram byte model is a statistical model of TLS client hello traffic created by a client application or process. To fingerprint a TLS connection, we use its client hello, and compute the likelihood as a function of a statistical model. The statistical model that maximizes the likelihood function is the predicted client application for the given client hello. Our data driven approach does not use side-channel information and can be updated on-the-fly. We experimentally validate our method on an internal dataset and show that it is robust to cipher stunting by tracking an unbiased $f_{1}$ score as we synthetically increase randomization.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present the workflow of Online Iterative Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in this technical report, which is widely reported to outperform its offline counterpart by a large margin in the recent large language model (LLM) literature. However, existing open-source RLHF projects are still largely confined to the offline learning setting. In this technical report, we aim to fill in this gap and provide a detailed recipe that is easy to reproduce for online iterative RLHF. In particular, since online human feedback is usually infeasible for open-source communities with limited resources, we start by constructing preference models using a diverse set of open-source datasets and use the constructed proxy preference model to approximate human feedback. Then, we discuss the theoretical insights and algorithmic principles behind online iterative RLHF, followed by a detailed practical implementation. Our trained LLM, SFR-Iterative-DPO-LLaMA-3-8B-R, achieves impressive performance on LLM chatbot benchmarks, including AlpacaEval-2, Arena-Hard, and MT-Bench, as well as other academic benchmarks such as HumanEval and TruthfulQA. We have shown that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and iterative RLHF can obtain state-of-the-art performance with fully open-source datasets. Further, we have made our models, curated datasets, and comprehensive step-by-step code guidebooks publicly available.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The ever-designed Graph Neural Networks, though opening a promising path for the modeling of the graph-structure data, unfortunately introduce two daunting obstacles to their deployment on devices. (I) Most of existing GNNs are shallow, due mostly to the over-smoothing and gradient-vanish problem as they go deeper as convolutional architectures. (II) The vast majority of GNNs adhere to the homophily assumption, where the central node and its adjacent nodes share the same label. This assumption often poses challenges for many GNNs working with heterophilic graphs. Addressing the aforementioned issue has become a looming challenge in enhancing the robustness and scalability of GNN applications. In this paper, we take a comprehensive and systematic approach to overcoming the two aforementioned challenges for the first time. We propose a Node-Specific Layer Aggregation and Filtration architecture, termed NoSAF, a framework capable of filtering and processing information from each individual nodes. NoSAF introduces the concept of "All Nodes are Created Not Equal" into every layer of deep networks, aiming to provide a reliable information filter for each layer's nodes to sieve out information beneficial for the subsequent layer. By incorporating a dynamically updated codebank, NoSAF dynamically optimizes the optimal information outputted downwards at each layer. This effectively overcomes heterophilic issues and aids in deepening the network. To compensate for the information loss caused by the continuous filtering in NoSAF, we also propose NoSAF-D (Deep), which incorporates a compensation mechanism that replenishes information in every layer of the model, allowing NoSAF to perform meaningful computations even in very deep layers.</li>

To overcome these challenges, we proposed an interpretable multi-stage approach to flood detection, IMAFD has been proposed. It provides an automatic, efficient and interpretable solution suitable for large-scale remote sensing tasks and offers insight into the decision-making process. The proposed IMAFD approach combines the analysis of the dynamic time series image sequences to identify images with possible flooding with the static, within-image semantic segmentation. It combines anomaly detection (at both image and pixel level) with semantic segmentation. The flood detection problem is addressed through four stages: (1) at a sequence level: identifying the suspected images (2) at a multi-image level: detecting change within suspected images (3) at an image level: semantic segmentation of images into Land, Water or Cloud class (4) decision making. Our contributions are two folder. First, we efficiently reduced the number of frames to be processed for dense change detection by providing a multi-stage holistic approach to flood detection. Second, the proposed semantic change detection method (stage 3) provides human users with an interpretable decision-making process, while most of the explainable AI (XAI) methods provide post hoc explanations. The evaluation of the proposed IMAFD framework was performed on three datasets, WorldFloods, RavAEn and MediaEval. For all the above datasets, the proposed framework demonstrates a competitive performance compared to other methods offering also interpretability and insight.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Going beyond mere fine-tuning of vision-language models (VLMs), learnable prompt tuning has emerged as a promising, resource-efficient alternative. Despite their potential, effectively learning prompts faces the following challenges: (i) training in a low-shot scenario results in overfitting, limiting adaptability and yielding weaker performance on newer classes or datasets; (ii) prompt-tuning's efficacy heavily relies on the label space, with decreased performance in large class spaces, signaling potential gaps in bridging image and class concepts. In this work, we ask the question if better text semantics can help address these concerns. In particular, we introduce a prompt-tuning method that leverages class descriptions obtained from large language models (LLMs). Our approach constructs part-level description-guided views of both image and text features, which are subsequently aligned to learn more generalizable prompts. Our comprehensive experiments, conducted across 11 benchmark datasets, outperform established methods, demonstrating substantial improvements.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, federate, diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The proliferation of edge devices has brought Federated Learning (FL) to the forefront as a promising paradigm for decentralized and collaborative model training while preserving the privacy of clients' data. However, FL struggles with a significant performance reduction and poor convergence when confronted with Non-Independent and Identically Distributed (Non-IID) data distributions among participating clients. While previous efforts, such as client drift mitigation and advanced server-side model fusion techniques, have shown some success in addressing this challenge, they often overlook the root cause of the performance reduction - the absence of identical data accurately mirroring the global data distribution among clients. In this paper, we introduce Gen-FedSD, a novel approach that harnesses the powerful capability of state-of-the-art text-to-image foundation models to bridge the significant Non-IID performance gaps in FL. In Gen-FedSD, each client constructs textual prompts for each class label and leverages an off-the-shelf state-of-the-art pre-trained Stable Diffusion model to synthesize high-quality data samples. The generated synthetic data is tailored to each client's unique local data gaps and distribution disparities, effectively making the final augmented local data IID. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that Gen-FedSD achieves state-of-the-art performance and significant communication cost savings across various datasets and Non-IID settings.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) have shown success in many natural language processing tasks. Despite rigorous safety alignment processes, supposedly safety-aligned LLMs like Llama 2 and Claude 2 are still susceptible to jailbreaks, leading to security risks and abuse of the models. One option to mitigate such risks is to augment the LLM with a dedicated "safeguard", which checks the LLM's inputs or outputs for undesired behaviour. A promising approach is to use the LLM itself as the safeguard. Nonetheless, baseline methods, such as prompting the LLM to self-classify toxic content, demonstrate limited efficacy. We hypothesise that this is due to domain shift: the alignment training imparts a self-censoring behaviour to the model ("Sorry I can't do that"), while the self-classify approach shifts it to a classification format ("Is this prompt malicious"). In this work, we propose PARDEN, which avoids this domain shift by simply asking the model to repeat its own outputs. PARDEN neither requires finetuning nor white box access to the model. We empirically verify the effectiveness of our method and show that PARDEN significantly outperforms existing jailbreak detection baselines for Llama-2 and Claude-2. Code and data are available at this https URL. We find that PARDEN is particularly powerful in the relevant regime of high True Positive Rate (TPR) and low False Positive Rate (FPR). For instance, for Llama2-7B, at TPR equal to 90%, PARDEN accomplishes a roughly 11x reduction in the FPR from 24.8% to 2.0% on the harmful behaviours dataset.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we introduce EconLogicQA, a rigorous benchmark designed to assess the sequential reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) within the intricate realms of economics, business, and supply chain management. Diverging from traditional benchmarks that predict subsequent events individually, EconLogicQA poses a more challenging task: it requires models to discern and sequence multiple interconnected events, capturing the complexity of economic logics. EconLogicQA comprises an array of multi-event scenarios derived from economic articles, which necessitate an insightful understanding of both temporal and logical event relationships. Through comprehensive evaluations, we exhibit that EconLogicQA effectively gauges a LLM's proficiency in navigating the sequential complexities inherent in economic contexts. We provide a detailed description of EconLogicQA dataset and shows the outcomes from evaluating the benchmark across various leading-edge LLMs, thereby offering a thorough perspective on their sequential reasoning potential in economic contexts.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, robust, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Many commercial and open-source models claim to detect machine-generated text with very high accuracy (99\% or higher). However, very few of these detectors are evaluated on shared benchmark datasets and even when they are, the datasets used for evaluation are insufficiently challenging -- lacking variations in sampling strategy, adversarial attacks, and open-source generative models. In this work we present RAID: the largest and most challenging benchmark dataset for machine-generated text detection. RAID includes over 6 million generations spanning 11 models, 8 domains, 11 adversarial attacks and 4 decoding strategies. Using RAID, we evaluate the out-of-domain and adversarial robustness of 8 open- and 4 closed-source detectors and find that current detectors are easily fooled by adversarial attacks, variations in sampling strategies, repetition penalties, and unseen generative models. We release our dataset and tools to encourage further exploration into detector robustness.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, privacy</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Zero-knowledge proofs have emerged as a powerful tool for enhancing privacy and security in blockchain applications. However, the efficiency and scalability of proof systems remain a significant challenge, particularly in the context of Merkle tree inclusion proofs. Traditional proof aggregation techniques based on AND logic suffer from high verification complexity and data communication overhead, limiting their practicality for large-scale applications. In this paper, we propose a novel proof aggregation approach based on OR logic, which enables the generation of compact and universally verifiable proofs for Merkle tree inclusion. By aggregating proofs using OR logic, we achieve a proof size that is independent of the number of leaves in the tree, and verification can be performed using any single valid leaf hash. This represents a significant improvement over AND aggregation, which requires the verifier to process all leaf hashes. We formally define the OR aggregation logic, describe the process of generating universal proofs, and provide a comparative analysis demonstrating the advantages of our approach in terms of proof size, verification data, and universality. Furthermore, we discuss the potential of combining OR and AND aggregation logics to create complex acceptance functions, enabling the development of expressive and efficient proof systems for various blockchain applications. The proposed techniques have the potential to significantly enhance the scalability, efficiency, and flexibility of zero-knowledge proof systems, paving the way for more practical and adaptive solutions in the blockchain ecosystem.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advancements in imitation learning have been largely fueled by the integration of sequence models, which provide a structured flow of information to effectively mimic task behaviours. Currently, Decision Transformer (DT) and subsequently, the Hierarchical Decision Transformer (HDT), presented Transformer-based approaches to learn task policies. Recently, the Mamba architecture has shown to outperform Transformers across various task domains. In this work, we introduce two novel methods, Decision Mamba (DM) and Hierarchical Decision Mamba (HDM), aimed at enhancing the performance of the Transformer models. Through extensive experimentation across diverse environments such as OpenAI Gym and D4RL, leveraging varying demonstration data sets, we demonstrate the superiority of Mamba models over their Transformer counterparts in a majority of tasks. Results show that HDM outperforms other methods in most settings. The code can be found at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Place recognition is the foundation for enabling autonomous systems to achieve independent decision-making and safe operations. It is also crucial in tasks such as loop closure detection and global localization within SLAM. Previous methods utilize mundane point cloud representations as input and deep learning-based LiDAR-based Place Recognition (LPR) approaches employing different point cloud image inputs with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or transformer architectures. However, the recently proposed Mamba deep learning model, combined with state space models (SSMs), holds great potential for long sequence modeling. Therefore, we developed OverlapMamba, a novel network for place recognition, which represents input range views (RVs) as sequences. In a novel way, we employ a stochastic reconstruction approach to build shift state space models, compressing the visual representation. Evaluated on three different public datasets, our method effectively detects loop closures, showing robustness even when traversing previously visited locations from different directions. Relying on raw range view inputs, it outperforms typical LiDAR and multi-view combination methods in time complexity and speed, indicating strong place recognition capabilities and real-time efficiency.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Zero-shot anomaly segmentation using pre-trained foundation models is a promising approach that enables effective algorithms without expensive, domain-specific training or fine-tuning. Ensuring that these methods work across various environmental conditions and are robust to distribution shifts is an open problem. We investigate the performance of WinCLIP [14] zero-shot anomaly segmentation algorithm by perturbing test data using three semantic transformations: bounded angular rotations, bounded saturation shifts, and hue shifts. We empirically measure a lower performance bound by aggregating across per-sample worst-case perturbations and find that average performance drops by up to 20% in area under the ROC curve and 40% in area under the per-region overlap curve. We find that performance is consistently lowered on three CLIP backbones, regardless of model architecture or learning objective, demonstrating a need for careful performance evaluation.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Achieving expressive 3D motion reconstruction and automatic generation for isolated sign words can be challenging, due to the lack of real-world 3D sign-word data, the complex nuances of signing motions, and the cross-modal understanding of sign language semantics. To address these challenges, we introduce SignAvatar, a framework capable of both word-level sign language reconstruction and generation. SignAvatar employs a transformer-based conditional variational autoencoder architecture, effectively establishing relationships across different semantic modalities. Additionally, this approach incorporates a curriculum learning strategy to enhance the model's robustness and generalization, resulting in more realistic motions. Furthermore, we contribute the ASL3DWord dataset, composed of 3D joint rotation data for the body, hands, and face, for unique sign words. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SignAvatar through extensive experiments, showcasing its superior reconstruction and automatic generation capabilities.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Current medical artificial intelligence systems are often limited to narrow applications, hindering their widespread adoption in clinical practice. To address this limitation, we propose MedVersa, a generalist learner that enables flexible learning and tasking for medical image interpretation. By leveraging a large language model as a learnable orchestrator, MedVersa can learn from both visual and linguistic supervision, support multimodal inputs, and perform real-time task specification. This versatility allows MedVersa to adapt to various clinical scenarios and perform multifaceted medical image analysis. We introduce MedInterp, the largest multimodal dataset to date for medical image interpretation, consisting of over 13 million annotated instances spanning 11 tasks across 3 modalities, to support the development of MedVersa. Our experiments demonstrate that MedVersa achieves state-of-the-art performance in 9 tasks, sometimes outperforming specialist counterparts by over 10%. MedVersa is the first to showcase the viability of multimodal generative medical AI in implementing multimodal outputs, inputs, and dynamic task specification, highlighting its potential as a multifunctional system for comprehensive medical image analysis. This generalist approach to medical image interpretation paves the way for more adaptable and efficient AI-assisted clinical decision-making.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The remarkable progress of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has attracted significant attention due to their superior performance in visual contexts. However, their capabilities in turning visual figure to executable code, have not been evaluated thoroughly. To address this, we introduce Plot2Code, a comprehensive visual coding benchmark designed for a fair and in-depth assessment of MLLMs. We carefully collect 132 manually selected high-quality matplotlib plots across six plot types from publicly available matplotlib galleries. For each plot, we carefully offer its source code, and an descriptive instruction summarized by GPT-4. This approach enables Plot2Code to extensively evaluate MLLMs' code capabilities across various input modalities. Furthermore, we propose three automatic evaluation metrics, including code pass rate, text-match ratio, and GPT-4V overall rating, for a fine-grained assessment of the output code and rendered images. Instead of simply judging pass or fail, we employ GPT-4V to make an overall judgement between the generated and reference images, which has been shown to be consistent with human evaluation. The evaluation results, which include analyses of 14 MLLMs such as the proprietary GPT-4V, Gemini-Pro, and the open-sourced Mini-Gemini, highlight the substantial challenges presented by Plot2Code. With Plot2Code, we reveal that most existing MLLMs struggle with visual coding for text-dense plots, heavily relying on textual instruction. We hope that the evaluation results from Plot2Code on visual coding will guide the future development of MLLMs. All data involved with Plot2Code are available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Mamba, an architecture with RNN-like token mixer of state space model (SSM), was recently introduced to address the quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism and subsequently applied to vision tasks. Nevertheless, the performance of Mamba for vision is often underwhelming when compared with convolutional and attention-based models. In this paper, we delve into the essence of Mamba, and conceptually conclude that Mamba is ideally suited for tasks with long-sequence and autoregressive characteristics. For vision tasks, as image classification does not align with either characteristic, we hypothesize that Mamba is not necessary for this task; Detection and segmentation tasks are also not autoregressive, yet they adhere to the long-sequence characteristic, so we believe it is still worthwhile to explore Mamba's potential for these tasks. To empirically verify our hypotheses, we construct a series of models named \emph{MambaOut} through stacking Mamba blocks while removing their core token mixer, SSM. Experimental results strongly support our hypotheses. Specifically, our MambaOut model surpasses all visual Mamba models on ImageNet image classification, indicating that Mamba is indeed unnecessary for this task. As for detection and segmentation, MambaOut cannot match the performance of state-of-the-art visual Mamba models, demonstrating the potential of Mamba for long-sequence visual tasks.
