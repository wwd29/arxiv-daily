<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vision Language Models (VLMs), exemplified by GPT-4V, adeptly integrate text and vision modalities. This integration enhances Large Language Models' ability to mimic human perception, allowing them to process image inputs. Despite VLMs' advanced capabilities, however, there is a concern that VLMs inherit biases of both modalities in ways that make biases more pervasive and difficult to mitigate. Our study explores how VLMs perpetuate homogeneity bias and trait associations with regards to race and gender. When prompted to write stories based on images of human faces, GPT-4V describes subordinate racial and gender groups with greater homogeneity than dominant groups and relies on distinct, yet generally positive, stereotypes. Importantly, VLM stereotyping is driven by visual cues rather than group membership alone such that faces that are rated as more prototypically Black and feminine are subject to greater stereotyping. These findings suggest that VLMs may associate subtle visual cues related to racial and gender groups with stereotypes in ways that could be challenging to mitigate. We explore the underlying reasons behind this behavior and discuss its implications and emphasize the importance of addressing these biases as VLMs come to mirror human perception.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text-to-image generation models often struggle with key element loss or semantic confusion in tasks involving Chinese classical poetry.Addressing this issue through fine-tuning models needs considerable training costs. Additionally, manual prompts for re-diffusion adjustments need professional knowledge. To solve this problem, we propose Poetry2Image, an iterative correction framework for images generated from Chinese classical poetry. Utilizing an external poetry dataset, Poetry2Image establishes an automated feedback and correction loop, which enhances the alignment between poetry and image through image generation models and subsequent re-diffusion modifications suggested by large language models (LLM). Using a test set of 200 sentences of Chinese classical poetry, the proposed method--when integrated with five popular image generation models--achieves an average element completeness of 70.63%, representing an improvement of 25.56% over direct image generation. In tests of semantic correctness, our method attains an average semantic consistency of 80.09%. The study not only promotes the dissemination of ancient poetry culture but also offers a reference for similar non-fine-tuning methods to enhance LLM generation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) have garnered unprecedented advancements across diverse fields, ranging from natural language processing to computer vision and beyond. The prowess of LLMs is underpinned by their substantial model size, extensive and diverse datasets, and the vast computational power harnessed during training, all of which contribute to the emergent abilities of LLMs (e.g., in-context learning) that are not present in small models. Within this context, the mixture of experts (MoE) has emerged as an effective method for substantially scaling up model capacity with minimal computation overhead, gaining significant attention from academia and industry. Despite its growing prevalence, there lacks a systematic and comprehensive review of the literature on MoE. This survey seeks to bridge that gap, serving as an essential resource for researchers delving into the intricacies of MoE. We first briefly introduce the structure of the MoE layer, followed by proposing a new taxonomy of MoE. Next, we overview the core designs for various MoE models including both algorithmic and systemic aspects, alongside collections of available open-source implementations, hyperparameter configurations and empirical evaluations. Furthermore, we delineate the multifaceted applications of MoE in practice, and outline some potential directions for future research. To facilitate ongoing updates and the sharing of cutting-edge developments in MoE research, we have established a resource repository accessible at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this work, we describe a novel approach to building a neural PDE solver leveraging recent advances in transformer based neural network architectures. Our model can provide solutions for different values of PDE parameters without any need for retraining the network. The training is carried out in a self-supervised manner, similar to pretraining approaches applied in language and vision tasks. We hypothesize that the model is in effect learning a family of operators (for multiple parameters) mapping the initial condition to the solution of the PDE at any future time step t. We compare this approach with the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), and demonstrate that it can generalize over the space of PDE parameters, despite having a higher prediction error for individual parameter values compared to the FNO. We show that performance on a specific parameter can be improved by finetuning the model with very small amounts of data. We also demonstrate that the model scales with data as well as model size.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, attack, robust, extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The proliferation of malicious URLs has become a significant threat to internet security, encompassing SPAM, phishing, malware, and defacement attacks. Traditional detection methods struggle to keep pace with the evolving nature of these threats. Detecting malicious URLs in real-time requires advanced techniques capable of handling large datasets and identifying novel attack patterns. The challenge lies in developing a robust model that combines efficient feature extraction with accurate classification. We propose a hybrid machine learning approach combining Self-Organizing Map based Radial Movement Optimization (SOM-RMO) for feature extraction and Radial Basis Function Network (RBFN) based Tabu Search for classification. SOM-RMO effectively reduces dimensionality and highlights significant features, while RBFN, optimized with Tabu Search, classifies URLs with high precision. The proposed model demonstrates superior performance in detecting various malicious URL attacks. On a benchmark dataset, our approach achieved an accuracy of 96.5%, precision of 95.2%, recall of 94.8%, and an F1-score of 95.0%, outperforming traditional methods significantly.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we propose a novel approach to learning semantic contextual relationships in videos for semantic object segmentation. Our algorithm derives the semantic contexts from video object proposals which encode the key evolution of objects and the relationship among objects over the spatio-temporal domain. This semantic contexts are propagated across the video to estimate the pairwise contexts between all pairs of local superpixels which are integrated into a conditional random field in the form of pairwise potentials and infers the per-superpixel semantic labels. The experiments demonstrate that our contexts learning and propagation model effectively improves the robustness of resolving visual ambiguities in semantic video object segmentation compared with the state-of-the-art methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to synthesize and reason about source code. However, the static nature of these models' knowledge does not reflect the fact that libraries and API functions they invoke are continuously evolving, with functionality being added or changing. While numerous benchmarks evaluate how LLMs can generate code, no prior work has studied how an LLMs' knowledge about code API functions can be updated. To fill this gap, we present CodeUpdateArena, a benchmark for knowledge editing in the code domain. An instance in our benchmark consists of a synthetic API function update paired with a program synthesis example that uses the updated functionality; our goal is to update an LLM to be able to solve this program synthesis example without providing documentation of the update at inference time. Compared to knowledge editing for facts encoded in text, success here is more challenging: a code LLM must correctly reason about the semantics of the modified function rather than just reproduce its syntax. Our dataset is constructed by first prompting GPT-4 to generate atomic and executable function updates. Then, for each update, we generate program synthesis examples whose code solutions are prone to use the update. Our benchmark covers updates of various types to 54 functions from seven diverse Python packages, with a total of 670 program synthesis examples. Our experiments show that prepending documentation of the update to open-source code LLMs (i.e., DeepSeek, CodeLlama) does not allow them to incorporate changes for problem solving, and existing knowledge editing techniques also have substantial room for improvement. We hope our benchmark will inspire new methods for knowledge updating in code LLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair, diffusion, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Fairness is an important topic for medical image analysis, driven by the challenge of unbalanced training data among diverse target groups and the societal demand for equitable medical quality. In response to this issue, our research adopts a data-driven strategy-enhancing data balance by integrating synthetic images. However, in terms of generating synthetic images, previous works either lack paired labels or fail to precisely control the boundaries of synthetic images to be aligned with those labels. To address this, we formulate the problem in a joint optimization manner, in which three networks are optimized towards the goal of empirical risk minimization and fairness maximization. On the implementation side, our solution features an innovative Point-Image Diffusion architecture, which leverages 3D point clouds for improved control over mask boundaries through a point-mask-image synthesis pipeline. This method outperforms significantly existing techniques in synthesizing scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO) fundus images. By combining synthetic data with real data during the training phase using a proposed Equal Scale approach, our model achieves superior fairness segmentation performance compared to the state-of-the-art fairness learning models.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we introduce a new outlier removal method that fully leverages geometric and semantic information, to achieve robust registration. Current semantic-based registration methods only use semantics for point-to-point or instance semantic correspondence generation, which has two problems. First, these methods are highly dependent on the correctness of semantics. They perform poorly in scenarios with incorrect semantics and sparse semantics. Second, the use of semantics is limited only to the correspondence generation, resulting in bad performance in the weak geometry scene. To solve these problems, on the one hand, we propose secondary ground segmentation and loose semantic consistency based on regional voting. It improves the robustness to semantic correctness by reducing the dependence on single-point semantics. On the other hand, we propose semantic-geometric consistency for outlier removal, which makes full use of semantic information and significantly improves the quality of correspondences. In addition, a two-stage hypothesis verification is proposed, which solves the problem of incorrect transformation selection in the weak geometry scene. In the outdoor dataset, our method demonstrates superior performance, boosting a 22.5 percentage points improvement in registration recall and achieving better robustness under various conditions.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present a transfer learning approach using a self-supervised Vision Transformer (DINOv2) for the PlantCLEF 2024 competition, focusing on the multi-label plant species classification. Our method leverages both base and fine-tuned DINOv2 models to extract generalized feature embeddings. We train classifiers to predict multiple plant species within a single image using these rich embeddings. To address the computational challenges of the large-scale dataset, we employ Spark for distributed data processing, ensuring efficient memory management and processing across a cluster of workers. Our data processing pipeline transforms images into grids of tiles, classifying each tile, and aggregating these predictions into a consolidated set of probabilities. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of combining transfer learning with advanced data processing techniques for multi-label image classification tasks. Our code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Automated f ault detection and monitoring in engineering are critical but frequently difficult owing to the necessity for collecting and labeling large amounts of defective samples . We present an unsupervised method that uses the high end Segment Anything Model (SAM) and a moving window approach. SAM has gained recognition in AI image segmentation communities for its accuracy and versatility. However, its performance can be inconsistent when dealing with certain unexpected shapes , such as shadows and subtle surface irregularities. This limitation raise s concerns about its applicability for fault detection in real world scenarios We aim to overcome these challenges without requiring fine tun ing or labeled data. Our technique divides pictures into smaller windows, which are subsequently processed using SAM. This increases the accuracy of fault identification by focusing on localized details. We compute the sizes of the segmented sections and then us e a clustering technique to discover consistent fault areas while filtering out noise. To further improve the method's robustness , we propose adding the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) technique for continuous monitoring in industrial settings, which would improve the method's capacity to trace faults over time. We compare our method to various well established methods u sing a real case study where our model achieve s 0.96 accuracy compared to 0. 8 5 for the second best method. W e also compare our method us ing two open source datasets where our model attains a consistent 0. 86 accuracy across the datasets compared to 0.53 and 0.54 for second best model s.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Existing text-to-video diffusion models rely solely on text-only encoders for their pretraining. This limitation stems from the absence of large-scale multimodal prompt video datasets, resulting in a lack of visual grounding and restricting their versatility and application in multimodal integration. To address this, we construct a large-scale multimodal prompt dataset by employing retrieval methods to pair in-context examples with the given text prompts and then utilize a two-stage training strategy to enable diverse video generation tasks within the same model. In the first stage, we propose a multimodal conditional video generation framework for pretraining on these augmented datasets, establishing a foundational model for grounded video generation. Secondly, we finetune the model from the first stage on three video generation tasks, incorporating multi-modal instructions. This process further refines the model's ability to handle diverse inputs and tasks, ensuring seamless integration of multi-modal information. After this two-stage train-ing process, VIMI demonstrates multimodal understanding capabilities, producing contextually rich and personalized videos grounded in the provided inputs, as shown in Figure 1. Compared to previous visual grounded video generation methods, VIMI can synthesize consistent and temporally coherent videos with large motion while retaining the semantic control. Lastly, VIMI also achieves state-of-the-art text-to-video generation results on UCF101 benchmark.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Social media is heading toward personalization more and more, where individuals reveal their beliefs, interests, habits, and activities, simply offering glimpses into their personality traits. This study, explores the correlation between the use of Arabic language on twitter, personality traits and its impact on sentiment analysis. We indicated the personality traits of users based on the information extracted from their profile activities, and the content of their tweets. Our analysis incorporated linguistic features, profile statistics (including gender, age, bio, etc.), as well as additional features like emoticons. To obtain personality data, we crawled the timelines and profiles of users who took the 16personalities test in Arabic on this http URL. Our dataset comprised 3,250 users who shared their personality results on twitter. We implemented various machine learning techniques, to reveal personality traits and developed a dedicated model for this purpose, achieving a 74.86% accuracy rate with BERT, analysis of this dataset proved that linguistic features, profile features and derived model can be used to differentiate between different personality traits. Furthermore, our findings demonstrated that personality affect sentiment in social media. This research contributes to the ongoing efforts in developing robust understanding of the relation between human behaviour on social media and personality features for real-world applications, such as political discourse analysis, and public opinion tracking.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>defense, attack, robust, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>By reinterpreting a robust discriminative classifier as Energy-based Model (EBM), we offer a new take on the dynamics of adversarial training (AT). Our analysis of the energy landscape during AT reveals that untargeted attacks generate adversarial images much more in-distribution (lower energy) than the original data from the point of view of the model. Conversely, we observe the opposite for targeted attacks. On the ground of our thorough analysis, we present new theoretical and practical results that show how interpreting AT energy dynamics unlocks a better understanding: (1) AT dynamic is governed by three phases and robust overfitting occurs in the third phase with a drastic divergence between natural and adversarial energies (2) by rewriting the loss of TRadeoff-inspired Adversarial DEfense via Surrogate-loss minimization (TRADES) in terms of energies, we show that TRADES implicitly alleviates overfitting by means of aligning the natural energy with the adversarial one (3) we empirically show that all recent state-of-the-art robust classifiers are smoothing the energy landscape and we reconcile a variety of studies about understanding AT and weighting the loss function under the umbrella of EBMs. Motivated by rigorous evidence, we propose Weighted Energy Adversarial Training (WEAT), a novel sample weighting scheme that yields robust accuracy matching the state-of-the-art on multiple benchmarks such as CIFAR-10 and SVHN and going beyond in CIFAR-100 and Tiny-ImageNet. We further show that robust classifiers vary in the intensity and quality of their generative capabilities, and offer a simple method to push this capability, reaching a remarkable Inception Score (IS) and FID using a robust classifier without training for generative modeling.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) have convincing performance in a variety of downstream tasks. However, these systems are prone to generating undesirable outputs such as harmful and biased text. In order to remedy such generations, the development of guardrail (or detector) models has gained traction. Motivated by findings from developing a detector for social bias, we adopt the notion of a use-mention distinction - which we identified as the primary source of under-performance in the preliminary versions of our social bias detector. Armed with this information, we describe a fully extensible and reproducible synthetic data generation pipeline which leverages taxonomy-driven instructions to create targeted and labeled data. Using this pipeline, we generate over 300K unique contrastive samples and provide extensive experiments to systematically evaluate performance on a suite of open source datasets. We show that our method achieves competitive performance with a fraction of the cost in compute and offers insight into iteratively developing efficient and capable guardrail models. Warning: This paper contains examples of text which are toxic, biased, and potentially harmful.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We describe a family of architectures to support transductive inference by allowing memory to grow to a finite but a-priori unknown bound while making efficient use of finite resources for inference. Current architectures use such resources to represent data either eidetically over a finite span ("context" in Transformers), or fading over an infinite span (in State Space Models, or SSMs). Recent hybrid architectures have combined eidetic and fading memory, but with limitations that do not allow the designer or the learning process to seamlessly modulate the two, nor to extend the eidetic memory span. We leverage ideas from Stochastic Realization Theory to develop a class of models called B'MOJO to seamlessly combine eidetic and fading memory within an elementary composable module. The overall architecture can be used to implement models that can access short-term eidetic memory "in-context," permanent structural memory "in-weights," fading memory "in-state," and long-term eidetic memory "in-storage" by natively incorporating retrieval from an asynchronously updated memory. We show that Transformers, existing SSMs such as Mamba, and hybrid architectures such as Jamba are special cases of B'MOJO and describe a basic implementation, to be open sourced, that can be stacked and scaled efficiently in hardware. We test B'MOJO on transductive inference tasks, such as associative recall, where it outperforms existing SSMs and Hybrid models; as a baseline, we test ordinary language modeling where B'MOJO achieves perplexity comparable to similarly-sized Transformers and SSMs up to 1.4B parameters, while being up to 10% faster to train. Finally, we show that B'MOJO's ability to modulate eidetic and fading memory results in better inference on longer sequences tested up to 32K tokens, four-fold the length of the longest sequences seen during training.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multi-model Markov decision process (MMDP) is a promising framework for computing policies that are robust to parameter uncertainty in MDPs. MMDPs aim to find a policy that maximizes the expected return over a distribution of MDP models. Because MMDPs are NP-hard to solve, most methods resort to approximations. In this paper, we derive the policy gradient of MMDPs and propose CADP, which combines a coordinate ascent method and a dynamic programming algorithm for solving MMDPs. The main innovation of CADP compared with earlier algorithms is to take the coordinate ascent perspective to adjust model weights iteratively to guarantee monotone policy improvements to a local maximum. A theoretical analysis of CADP proves that it never performs worse than previous dynamic programming algorithms like WSU. Our numerical results indicate that CADP substantially outperforms existing methods on several benchmark problems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Subword tokens in Indian languages inherently carry meaning, and isolating them can enhance NLP tasks, making sub-word segmentation a crucial process. Segmenting Sanskrit and other Indian languages into subtokens is not straightforward, as it may include sandhi, which may lead to changes in the word boundaries. We propose a new approach of utilizing a Character-level Transformer model for Sanskrit Word Segmentation (CharSS). We perform experiments on three benchmark datasets to compare the performance of our method against existing methods. On the UoH+SandhiKosh dataset, our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art system by an absolute gain of 6.72 points in split prediction accuracy. On the hackathon dataset, our method achieves a gain of 2.27 points over the current SOTA system in terms of perfect match metric. We also propose a use-case of Sanskrit-based segments for a linguistically informed translation of technical terms to lexically similar low-resource Indian languages. In two separate experimental settings for this task, we achieve an average improvement of 8.46 and 6.79 chrF++ scores, respectively.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Although attention mechanisms have achieved considerable progress in Transformer-based architectures across various Artificial Intelligence (AI) domains, their inner workings remain to be explored. Existing explainable methods have different emphases but are rather one-sided. They primarily analyse the attention mechanisms or gradient-based attribution while neglecting the magnitudes of input feature values or the skip-connection module. Moreover, they inevitably bring spurious noisy pixel attributions unrelated to the model's decision, hindering humans' trust in the spotted visualization result. Hence, we propose an easy-to-implement but effective way to remedy this flaw: Smooth Noise Norm Attention (SNNA). We weigh the attention by the norm of the transformed value vector and guide the label-specific signal with the attention gradient, then randomly sample the input perturbations and average the corresponding gradients to produce noise-free attribution. Instead of evaluating the explanation method on the binary or multi-class classification tasks like in previous works, we explore the more complex multi-label classification scenario in this work, i.e., the driving action prediction task, and trained a model for it specifically. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluation results show the superiority of SNNA compared to other SOTA attention-based explainable methods in generating a clearer visual explanation map and ranking the input pixel importance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Blockchain adoption has surged with the rise of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications. However, the significant value of digital assets managed by DeFi protocols makes them prime targets for attacks. Current smart contract vulnerability detection tools struggle with DeFi protocols due to deep logical bugs arising from complex financial interactions between multiple smart contracts. These tools primarily analyze individual contracts and resort to brute-force methods for DeFi protocols crossing numerous smart contracts, leading to inefficiency. We introduce Foray, a highly effective attack synthesis framework against deep logical bugs in DeFi protocols. Foray proposes a novel attack sketch generation and completion framework. Specifically, instead of treating DeFis as regular programs, we design a domain-specific language (DSL) to lift the low-level smart contracts into their high-level financial operations. Based on our DSL, we first compile a given DeFi protocol into a token flow graph, our graphical representation of DeFi protocols. Then, we design an efficient sketch generation method to synthesize attack sketches for a certain attack goal (e.g., price manipulation, arbitrage, etc.). This algorithm strategically identifies candidate sketches by finding reachable paths in TFG, which is much more efficient than random enumeration. For each candidate sketch written in our DSL, Foray designs a domain-specific symbolic compilation to compile it into SMT constraints. Our compilation simplifies the constraints by removing redundant smart contract semantics. It maintains the usability of symbolic compilation, yet scales to problems orders of magnitude larger. Finally, the candidates are completed via existing solvers and are transformed into concrete attacks via direct syntax transformation.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper evaluates whether large language models (LLMs) exhibit cognitive fan effects, similar to those discovered by Anderson in humans, after being pre-trained on human textual data. We conduct two sets of in-context recall experiments designed to elicit fan effects. Consistent with human results, we find that LLM recall uncertainty, measured via token probability, is influenced by the fan effect. Our results show that removing uncertainty disrupts the observed effect. The experiments suggest the fan effect is consistent whether the fan value is induced in-context or in the pre-training data. Finally, these findings provide in-silico evidence that fan effects and typicality are expressions of the same phenomena.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>High-throughput phenotyping refers to the non-destructive and efficient evaluation of plant phenotypes. In recent years, it has been coupled with machine learning in order to improve the process of phenotyping plants by increasing efficiency in handling large datasets and developing methods for the extraction of specific traits. Previous studies have developed methods to advance these challenges through the application of deep neural networks in tandem with automated cameras; however, the datasets being studied often excluded physical labels. In this study, we used a dataset provided by Oak Ridge National Laboratory with 1,672 images of Populus Trichocarpa with white labels displaying treatment (control or drought), block, row, position, and genotype. Optical character recognition (OCR) was used to read these labels on the plants, image segmentation techniques in conjunction with machine learning algorithms were used for morphological classifications, machine learning models were used to predict treatment based on those classifications, and analyzed encoded EXIF tags were used for the purpose of finding leaf size and correlations between phenotypes. We found that our OCR model had an accuracy of 94.31% for non-null text extractions, allowing for the information to be accurately placed in a spreadsheet. Our classification models identified leaf shape, color, and level of brown splotches with an average accuracy of 62.82%, and plant treatment with an accuracy of 60.08%. Finally, we identified a few crucial pieces of information absent from the EXIF tags that prevented the assessment of the leaf size. There was also missing information that prevented the assessment of correlations between phenotypes and conditions. However, future studies could improve upon this to allow for the assessment of these features.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Acquiring annotations for whole slide images (WSIs)-based deep learning tasks, such as creating tissue segmentation masks or detecting mitotic figures, is a laborious process due to the extensive image size and the significant manual work involved in the annotation. This paper focuses on identifying and annotating specific image regions that optimize model training, given a limited annotation budget. While random sampling helps capture data variance by collecting annotation regions throughout the WSIs, insufficient data curation may result in an inadequate representation of minority classes. Recent studies proposed diversity sampling to select a set of regions that maximally represent unique characteristics of the WSIs. This is done by pretraining on unlabeled data through self-supervised learning and then clustering all regions in the latent space. However, establishing the optimal number of clusters can be difficult and not all clusters are task-relevant. This paper presents prototype sampling, a new method for annotation region selection. It discovers regions exhibiting typical characteristics of each task-specific class. The process entails recognizing class prototypes from extensive histopathology image-caption databases and detecting unlabeled image regions that resemble these prototypes. Our results show that prototype sampling is more effective than random and diversity sampling in identifying annotation regions with valuable training information, resulting in improved model performance in semantic segmentation and mitotic figure detection tasks.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The robustness of machine learning models has been questioned by the existence of adversarial examples. We examine the threat of adversarial examples in practical applications that require lightweight models for one-class classification. Building on Ilyas et al. (2019), we investigate the vulnerability of lightweight one-class classifiers to adversarial attacks and possible reasons for it. Our results show that lightweight one-class classifiers learn features that are not robust (e.g. texture) under stronger attacks. However, unlike in multi-class classification (Ilyas et al., 2019), these non-robust features are not always useful for the one-class task, suggesting that learning these unpredictive and non-robust features is an unwanted consequence of training.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Synthesizing NeRFs under arbitrary lighting has become a seminal problem in the last few years. Recent efforts tackle the problem via the extraction of physically-based parameters that can then be rendered under arbitrary lighting, but they are limited in the range of scenes they can handle, usually mishandling glossy scenes. We propose RRM, a method that can extract the materials, geometry, and environment lighting of a scene even in the presence of highly reflective objects. Our method consists of a physically-aware radiance field representation that informs physically-based parameters, and an expressive environment light structure based on a Laplacian Pyramid. We demonstrate that our contributions outperform the state-of-the-art on parameter retrieval tasks, leading to high-fidelity relighting and novel view synthesis on surfacic scenes.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) sometimes exhibit dangerous unintended behaviors. Finding and fixing these is challenging because the attack surface is massive -- it is not tractable to exhaustively search for all possible inputs that may elicit such behavior. One specific and particularly challenging case is that if data-poisoning-injected trojans, since there is no way to know what they are to search for them. To our knowledge, there is no generally applicable method to unlearn unknown trojans injected during pre-training. This work seeks to provide a general purpose recipe (filters) and a specific implementation (LoRA) filters that work in practice on small to medium sized models. The focus is primarily empirical, though some perplexing behavior opens the door to the fundamental question of how LLMs store and process information. Not unexpectedly, we find that our filters work best on the residual stream and the latest layers.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>To enhance Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities, multi-agent debates have been introduced, where multiple LLMs discuss solutions to a problem over several rounds of debate. However, LLMs often produce incorrect responses that appear deceptively confident, which can mislead other agents. This is partly because agents do not express their confidence levels during standard debates. To address this, we introduce DebUnc, a multi-agent debate framework that uses uncertainty metrics to assess agent confidence levels. We adapted the LLM attention mechanism to adjust token weights based on confidence levels and also explored using textual prompts to convey confidence. Our evaluations across various benchmarks show that attention-based methods are particularly effective, and that as uncertainty metrics evolve, performance will continue to increase.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The influence of Large Language Models (LLMs) is rapidly growing, automating more jobs over time. Assessing the fairness of LLMs is crucial due to their expanding impact. Studies reveal the reflection of societal norms and biases in LLMs, which creates a risk of propagating societal stereotypes in downstream tasks. Many studies on bias in LLMs focus on gender bias in various NLP applications. However, there's a gap in research on bias in emotional attributes, despite the close societal link between emotion and gender. This gap is even larger for low-resource languages like Bangla. Historically, women are associated with emotions like empathy, fear, and guilt, while men are linked to anger, bravado, and authority. This pattern reflects societal norms in Bangla-speaking regions. We offer the first thorough investigation of gendered emotion attribution in Bangla for both closed and open source LLMs in this work. Our aim is to elucidate the intricate societal relationship between gender and emotion specifically within the context of Bangla. We have been successful in showing the existence of gender bias in the context of emotions in Bangla through analytical methods and also show how emotion attribution changes on the basis of gendered role selection in LLMs. All of our resources including code and data are made publicly available to support future research on Bangla NLP. Warning: This paper contains explicit stereotypical statements that many may find offensive.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present SOLO, a single transformer for Scalable visiOn-Language mOdeling. Current large vision-language models (LVLMs) such as LLaVA mostly employ heterogeneous architectures that connect pre-trained visual encoders with large language models (LLMs) to facilitate visual recognition and complex reasoning. Although achieving remarkable performance with relatively lightweight training, we identify four primary scalability limitations: (1) The visual capacity is constrained by pre-trained visual encoders, which are typically an order of magnitude smaller than LLMs. (2) The heterogeneous architecture complicates the use of established hardware and software infrastructure. (3) Study of scaling laws on such architecture must consider three separate components - visual encoder, connector, and LLMs, which complicates the analysis. (4) The use of existing visual encoders typically requires following a pre-defined specification of image inputs pre-processing, for example, by reshaping inputs to fixed-resolution square images, which presents difficulties in processing and training on high-resolution images or those with unusual aspect ratio. A unified single Transformer architecture, like SOLO, effectively addresses these scalability concerns in LVLMs; however, its limited adoption in the modern context likely stems from the absence of reliable training recipes that balance both modalities and ensure stable training for billion-scale models. In this paper, we introduce the first open-source training recipe for developing SOLO, an open-source 7B LVLM using moderate academic resources. The training recipe involves initializing from LLMs, sequential pre-training on ImageNet and web-scale data, and instruction fine-tuning on our curated high-quality datasets. On extensive evaluation, SOLO demonstrates performance comparable to LLaVA-v1.5-7B, particularly excelling in visual mathematical reasoning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Developing a reliable vision system is a fundamental challenge for robotic technologies (e.g., indoor service robots and outdoor autonomous robots) which can ensure reliable navigation even in challenging environments such as adverse weather conditions (e.g., fog, rain), poor lighting conditions (e.g., over/under exposure), or sensor degradation (e.g., blurring, noise), and can guarantee high performance in safety-critical functions. Current solutions proposed to improve model robustness usually rely on generic data augmentation techniques or employ costly test-time adaptation methods. In addition, most approaches focus on addressing a single vision task (typically, image recognition) utilising synthetic data. In this paper, we introduce Per-corruption Adaptation of Normalization statistics (PAN) to enhance the model robustness of vision systems. Our approach entails three key components: (i) a corruption type identification module, (ii) dynamic adjustment of normalization layer statistics based on identified corruption type, and (iii) real-time update of these statistics according to input data. PAN can integrate seamlessly with any convolutional model for enhanced accuracy in several robot vision tasks. In our experiments, PAN obtains robust performance improvement on challenging real-world corrupted image datasets (e.g., OpenLoris, ExDark, ACDC), where most of the current solutions tend to fail. Moreover, PAN outperforms the baseline models by 20-30% on synthetic benchmarks in object recognition tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Language models (LMs) are trained on vast amounts of text data, which may include private and copyrighted content. Data owners may request the removal of their data from a trained model due to privacy or copyright concerns. However, exactly unlearning only these datapoints (i.e., retraining with the data removed) is intractable in modern-day models. This has led to the development of many approximate unlearning algorithms. The evaluation of the efficacy of these algorithms has traditionally been narrow in scope, failing to precisely quantify the success and practicality of the algorithm from the perspectives of both the model deployers and the data owners. We address this issue by proposing MUSE, a comprehensive machine unlearning evaluation benchmark that enumerates six diverse desirable properties for unlearned models: (1) no verbatim memorization, (2) no knowledge memorization, (3) no privacy leakage, (4) utility preservation on data not intended for removal, (5) scalability with respect to the size of removal requests, and (6) sustainability over sequential unlearning requests. Using these criteria, we benchmark how effectively eight popular unlearning algorithms on 7B-parameter LMs can unlearn Harry Potter books and news articles. Our results demonstrate that most algorithms can prevent verbatim memorization and knowledge memorization to varying degrees, but only one algorithm does not lead to severe privacy leakage. Furthermore, existing algorithms fail to meet deployer's expectations because they often degrade general model utility and also cannot sustainably accommodate successive unlearning requests or large-scale content removal. Our findings identify key issues with the practicality of existing unlearning algorithms on language models, and we release our benchmark to facilitate further evaluations: this http URL</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Due to the scarcity of labeled data, self-supervised learning (SSL) has gained much attention in 3D medical image segmentation, by extracting semantic representations from unlabeled data. Among SSL strategies, Masked image modeling (MIM) has shown effectiveness by reconstructing randomly masked images to learn detailed representations. However, conventional MIM methods require extensive training data to achieve good performance, which still poses a challenge for medical imaging. Since random masking uniformly samples all regions within medical images, it may overlook crucial anatomical regions and thus degrade the pretraining efficiency. We propose AnatoMask, a novel MIM method that leverages reconstruction loss to dynamically identify and mask out anatomically significant regions to improve pretraining efficacy. AnatoMask takes a self-distillation approach, where the model learns both how to find more significant regions to mask and how to reconstruct these masked regions. To avoid suboptimal learning, Anatomask adjusts the pretraining difficulty progressively using a masking dynamics function. We have evaluated our method on 4 public datasets with multiple imaging modalities (CT, MRI, and PET). AnatoMask demonstrates superior performance and scalability compared to existing SSL methods.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text-to-image models are showcasing the impressive ability to create high-quality and diverse generative images. Nevertheless, the transition from freehand sketches to complex scene images remains challenging using diffusion models. In this study, we propose a novel sketch-guided scene image generation framework, decomposing the task of scene image scene generation from sketch inputs into object-level cross-domain generation and scene-level image construction. We employ pre-trained diffusion models to convert each single object drawing into an image of the object, inferring additional details while maintaining the sparse sketch structure. In order to maintain the conceptual fidelity of the foreground during scene generation, we invert the visual features of object images into identity embeddings for scene generation. In scene-level image construction, we generate the latent representation of the scene image using the separated background prompts, and then blend the generated foreground objects according to the layout of the sketch input. To ensure the foreground objects' details remain unchanged while naturally composing the scene image, we infer the scene image on the blended latent representation using a global prompt that includes the trained identity tokens. Through qualitative and quantitative experiments, we demonstrate the ability of the proposed approach to generate scene images from hand-drawn sketches surpasses the state-of-the-art approaches.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated superior multi-task capabilities, understanding the learning mechanisms behind this is still a challenging problem. In this paper, we attempt to understand such mechanisms from the perspective of neurons. Specifically, we detect task-sensitive neurons in LLMs via gradient attribution on task-specific data. Through extensive deactivation and fine-tuning experiments, we demonstrate that the detected neurons are highly correlated with the given task, which we term as task-specific neurons. With these identified task-specific neurons, we delve into two common problems in multi-task learning and continuous learning: Generalization and Catastrophic Forgetting. We find that the overlap of task-specific neurons is strongly associated with generalization and specialization across tasks. Interestingly, at certain layers of LLMs, there is a high similarity in the parameters of different task-specific neurons, and such similarity is highly correlated with the generalization performance. Inspired by these findings, we propose a neuron-level continuous fine-tuning method that only fine-tunes the current task-specific neurons during continuous learning, and extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our study provides insights into the interpretability of LLMs in multi-task learning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Controlling the evolution of complex physical systems is a fundamental task across science and engineering. Classical techniques suffer from limited applicability or huge computational costs. On the other hand, recent deep learning and reinforcement learning-based approaches often struggle to optimize long-term control sequences under the constraints of system dynamics. In this work, we introduce Diffusion Physical systems Control (DiffPhyCon), a new class of method to address the physical systems control problem. DiffPhyCon excels by simultaneously minimizing both the learned generative energy function and the predefined control objectives across the entire trajectory and control sequence. Thus, it can explore globally and identify near-optimal control sequences. Moreover, we enhance DiffPhyCon with prior reweighting, enabling the discovery of control sequences that significantly deviate from the training distribution. We test our method in 1D Burgers' equation and 2D jellyfish movement control in a fluid environment. Our method outperforms widely applied classical approaches and state-of-the-art deep learning and reinforcement learning methods. Notably, DiffPhyCon unveils an intriguing fast-close-slow-open pattern observed in the jellyfish, aligning with established findings in the field of fluid dynamics.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) is a popular iterative algorithm used to train machine learning models while formally guaranteeing the privacy of users. However the privacy analysis of DP-SGD makes the unrealistic assumption that all intermediate iterates (aka internal state) of the algorithm are released since in practice, only the final trained model, i.e., the final iterate of the algorithm is released. In this hidden state setting, prior work has provided tighter analyses, albeit only when the loss function is constrained, e.g., strongly convex and smooth or linear. On the other hand, the privacy leakage observed empirically from hidden state DP-SGD, even when using non-convex loss functions suggest that there is in fact a gap between the theoretical privacy analysis and the privacy guarantees achieved in practice. Therefore, it remains an open question whether privacy amplification for DP-SGD is possible in the hidden state setting for general loss functions. Unfortunately, this work answers the aforementioned research question negatively. By carefully constructing a loss function for DP-SGD, we show that for specific loss functions, the final iterate of DP-SGD alone leaks as much information as the sequence of all iterates combined. Furthermore, we empirically verify this result by evaluating the privacy leakage from the final iterate of DP-SGD with our loss function and show that this matches the theoretical upper bound guaranteed by DP exactly. Therefore, we show that the current privacy analysis fo DP-SGD is tight for general loss functions and conclude that no privacy amplification is possible for DP-SGD in general for all (possibly non-convex) loss functions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Medical foundation models pre-trained on large-scale datasets have demonstrated powerful versatile capabilities for various tasks. However, due to the gap between pre-training tasks (or modalities) and downstream tasks (or modalities), the real-world computation and speed constraints, it might not be straightforward to apply medical foundation models in the downstream scenarios. Previous methods, such as parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods and knowledge distillation (KD) methods, are unable to simultaneously address the task (or modality) inconsistency and achieve personalized lightweight deployment under diverse real-world demands. To address the above issues, we propose a novel framework called Reprogramming Distillation (RD). On one hand, RD reprograms the original feature space of the foundation model so that it is more relevant to downstream scenarios, aligning tasks and modalities. On the other hand, through a co-training mechanism and a shared classifier, connections are established between the reprogrammed knowledge and the knowledge of student models, ensuring that the reprogrammed feature space can be smoothly mimic by the student model of different structures. Further, to reduce the randomness under different training conditions, we design a Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) distillation to promote robust knowledge transfer. Empirically, we show that on extensive datasets, RD consistently achieve superior performance compared with previous PEFT and KD methods.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the complexity of lunar exploration missions, the moon needs to have a higher level of autonomy. Environmental perception and navigation algorithms are the foundation for lunar rovers to achieve autonomous exploration. The development and verification of algorithms require highly reliable data support. Most of the existing lunar datasets are targeted at a single task, lacking diverse scenes and high-precision ground truth labels. To address this issue, we propose a multi-task, multi-scene, and multi-label lunar benchmark dataset LuSNAR. This dataset can be used for comprehensive evaluation of autonomous perception and navigation systems, including high-resolution stereo image pairs, panoramic semantic labels, dense depth maps, LiDAR point clouds, and the position of rover. In order to provide richer scene data, we built 9 lunar simulation scenes based on Unreal Engine. Each scene is divided according to topographic relief and the density of objects. To verify the usability of the dataset, we evaluated and analyzed the algorithms of semantic segmentation, 3D reconstruction, and autonomous navigation. The experiment results prove that the dataset proposed in this paper can be used for ground verification of tasks such as autonomous environment perception and navigation, and provides a lunar benchmark dataset for testing the accessibility of algorithm metrics. We make LuSNAR publicly available at: this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Computer vision tasks are crucial for aerospace missions as they help spacecraft to understand and interpret the space environment, such as estimating position and orientation, reconstructing 3D models, and recognizing objects, which have been extensively studied to successfully carry out the missions. However, traditional methods like Kalman Filtering, Structure from Motion, and Multi-View Stereo are not robust enough to handle harsh conditions, leading to unreliable results. In recent years, deep learning (DL)-based perception technologies have shown great potential and outperformed traditional methods, especially in terms of their robustness to changing environments. To further advance DL-based aerospace perception, various frameworks, datasets, and strategies have been proposed, indicating significant potential for future applications. In this survey, we aim to explore the promising techniques used in perception tasks and emphasize the importance of DL-based aerospace perception. We begin by providing an overview of aerospace perception, including classical space programs developed in recent years, commonly used sensors, and traditional perception methods. Subsequently, we delve into three fundamental perception tasks in aerospace missions: pose estimation, 3D reconstruction, and recognition, as they are basic and crucial for subsequent decision-making and control. Finally, we discuss the limitations and possibilities in current research and provide an outlook on future developments, including the challenges of working with limited datasets, the need for improved algorithms, and the potential benefits of multi-source information fusion.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, diffusion, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generating 3D vehicle assets from in-the-wild observations is crucial to autonomous driving. Existing image-to-3D methods cannot well address this problem because they learn generation merely from image RGB information without a deeper understanding of in-the-wild vehicles (such as car models, manufacturers, etc.). This leads to their poor zero-shot prediction capability to handle real-world observations with occlusion or tricky viewing angles. To solve this problem, in this work, we propose VQA-Diff, a novel framework that leverages in-the-wild vehicle images to create photorealistic 3D vehicle assets for autonomous driving. VQA-Diff exploits the real-world knowledge inherited from the Large Language Model in the Visual Question Answering (VQA) model for robust zero-shot prediction and the rich image prior knowledge in the Diffusion model for structure and appearance generation. In particular, we utilize a multi-expert Diffusion Models strategy to generate the structure information and employ a subject-driven structure-controlled generation mechanism to model appearance information. As a result, without the necessity to learn from a large-scale image-to-3D vehicle dataset collected from the real world, VQA-Diff still has a robust zero-shot image-to-novel-view generation ability. We conduct experiments on various datasets, including Pascal 3D+, Waymo, and Objaverse, to demonstrate that VQA-Diff outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent studies on motion estimation have advocated an optimized motion representation that is globally consistent across the entire video, preferably for every pixel. This is challenging as a uniform representation may not account for the complex and diverse motion and appearance of natural videos. We address this problem and propose a new test-time optimization method, named DecoMotion, for estimating per-pixel and long-range motion. DecoMotion explicitly decomposes video content into static scenes and dynamic objects, either of which uses a quasi-3D canonical volume to represent. DecoMotion separately coordinates the transformations between local and canonical spaces, facilitating an affine transformation for the static scene that corresponds to camera motion. For the dynamic volume, DecoMotion leverages discriminative and temporally consistent features to rectify the non-rigid transformation. The two volumes are finally fused to fully represent motion and appearance. This divide-and-conquer strategy leads to more robust tracking through occlusions and deformations and meanwhile obtains decomposed appearances. We conduct evaluations on the TAP-Vid benchmark. The results demonstrate our method boosts the point-tracking accuracy by a large margin and performs on par with some state-of-the-art dedicated point-tracking solutions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advancements in language modeling have shown promising results when applied to time series data. In particular, fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for time series classification tasks has achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on standard benchmarks. However, these LLM-based models have a significant drawback due to the large model size, with the number of trainable parameters in the millions. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach to leveraging the success of language modeling in the time series domain. Instead of fine-tuning LLMs, we utilize a language embedding model to embed time series and then pair the embeddings with a simple classification head composed of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and multilayer perceptron (MLP). We conducted extensive experiments on well-established time series classification benchmark datasets. We demonstrated LETS-C not only outperforms the current SOTA in classification accuracy but also offers a lightweight solution, using only 14.5% of the trainable parameters on average compared to the SOTA model. Our findings suggest that leveraging language encoders to embed time series data, combined with a simple yet effective classification head, offers a promising direction for achieving high-performance time series classification while maintaining a lightweight model architecture.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present GvSeg, a general video segmentation framework for addressing four different video segmentation tasks (i.e., instance, semantic, panoptic, and exemplar-guided) while maintaining an identical architectural design. Currently, there is a trend towards developing general video segmentation solutions that can be applied across multiple tasks. This streamlines research endeavors and simplifies deployment. However, such a highly homogenized framework in current design, where each element maintains uniformity, could overlook the inherent diversity among different tasks and lead to suboptimal performance. To tackle this, GvSeg: i) provides a holistic disentanglement and modeling for segment targets, thoroughly examining them from the perspective of appearance, position, and shape, and on this basis, ii) reformulates the query initialization, matching and sampling strategies in alignment with the task-specific requirement. These architecture-agnostic innovations empower GvSeg to effectively address each unique task by accommodating the specific properties that characterize them. Extensive experiments on seven gold-standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that GvSeg surpasses all existing specialized/general solutions by a significant margin on four different video segmentation tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In real-world applications, input data distributions are rarely static over a period of time, a phenomenon known as concept drift. Such concept drifts degrade the model's prediction performance, and therefore we require methods to overcome these issues. The initial step is to identify concept drifts and have a training method in place to recover the model's performance. Most concept drift detection methods work on detecting concept drifts and signalling the requirement to retrain the model. However, in real-world cases, there could be concept drifts that recur over a period of time. In this paper, we present an unsupervised method based on Generative Adversarial Networks(GAN) to detect concept drifts and identify whether a specific concept drift occurred in the past. Our method reduces the time and data the model requires to get up to speed for recurring drifts. Our key results indicate that our proposed model can outperform the current state-of-the-art models in most datasets. We also test our method on a real-world use case from astrophysics, where we detect the bow shock and magnetopause crossings with better results than the existing methods in the domain.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep learning-based models are widely deployed in autonomous driving areas, especially the increasingly noticed end-to-end solutions. However, the black-box property of these models raises concerns about their trustworthiness and safety for autonomous driving, and how to debug the causality has become a pressing concern. Despite some existing research on the explainability of autonomous driving, there is currently no systematic solution to help researchers debug and identify the key factors that lead to the final predicted action of end-to-end autonomous driving. In this work, we propose a comprehensive approach to explore and analyze the causality of end-to-end autonomous driving. First, we validate the essential information that the final planning depends on by using controlled variables and counterfactual interventions for qualitative analysis. Then, we quantitatively assess the factors influencing model decisions by visualizing and statistically analyzing the response of key model inputs. Finally, based on the comprehensive study of the multi-factorial end-to-end autonomous driving system, we have developed a strong baseline and a tool for exploring causality in the close-loop simulator CARLA. It leverages the essential input sources to obtain a well-designed model, resulting in highly competitive capabilities. As far as we know, our work is the first to unveil the mystery of end-to-end autonomous driving and turn the black box into a white one. Thorough close-loop experiments demonstrate that our method can be applied to end-to-end autonomous driving solutions for causality debugging. Code will be available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Employing Large Language Models (LLMs) to assess the quality of generated responses, such as prompting instruct-tuned models or fine-tuning judge models, has become a widely adopted evaluation method. It is also known that such evaluators are vulnerable to biases, such as favoring longer responses. While it is important to overcome this problem, the specifics of these biases remain under-explored. In this work, we qualitatively identify six types of biases inherent in various judge models. We propose EvalBiasBench as a meta-evaluation collection of hand-crafted test cases for each bias type. Additionally, we present de-biasing dataset construction methods and the associated preference dataset OffsetBias. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuning on our dataset significantly enhances the robustness of judge models against biases and improves performance across most evaluation scenarios. We release our datasets and the fine-tuned judge model to public.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, attack, robust, watermark</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent developments in Deep Neural Network (DNN) based watermarking techniques have shown remarkable performance. The state-of-the-art DNN-based techniques not only surpass the robustness of classical watermarking techniques but also show their robustness against many image manipulation techniques. In this paper, we performed a detailed security analysis of different DNN-based watermarking techniques. We propose a new class of attack called the Deep Learning-based OVErwriting (DLOVE) attack, which leverages adversarial machine learning and overwrites the original embedded watermark with a targeted watermark in a watermarked image. To the best of our knowledge, this attack is the first of its kind. We have considered scenarios where watermarks are used to devise and formulate an adversarial attack in white box and black box settings. To show adaptability and efficiency, we launch our DLOVE attack analysis on seven different watermarking techniques, HiDDeN, ReDMark, PIMoG, Stegastamp, Aparecium, Distortion Agostic Deep Watermarking and Hiding Images in an Image. All these techniques use different approaches to create imperceptible watermarked images. Our attack analysis on these watermarking techniques with various constraints highlights the vulnerabilities of DNN-based watermarking. Extensive experimental results validate the capabilities of DLOVE. We propose DLOVE as a benchmark security analysis tool to test the robustness of future deep learning-based watermarking techniques.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In recent years, Natural Language Processing (NLP) has played a significant role in various Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications such as chatbots, text generation, and language translation. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has greatly improved the performance of these applications, showing astonishing results in language understanding and generation. However, they still show some disadvantages, such as hallucinations and lack of domain-specific knowledge, that affect their performance in real-world tasks. These issues can be effectively mitigated by incorporating knowledge graphs (KGs), which organise information in structured formats that capture relationships between entities in a versatile and interpretable fashion. Likewise, the construction and validation of KGs present challenges that LLMs can help resolve. The complementary relationship between LLMs and KGs has led to a trend that combines these technologies to achieve trustworthy results. This work collected 28 papers outlining methods for KG-powered LLMs, LLM-based KGs, and LLM-KG hybrid approaches. We systematically analysed and compared these approaches to provide a comprehensive overview highlighting key trends, innovative techniques, and common challenges. This synthesis will benefit researchers new to the field and those seeking to deepen their understanding of how KGs and LLMs can be effectively combined to enhance AI applications capabilities.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep learning has significantly advanced automatic medical diagnostics and released the occupation of human resources to reduce clinical pressure, yet the persistent challenge of data scarcity in this area hampers its further improvements and applications. To address this gap, we introduce a novel ensemble framework called `Efficient Transfer and Self-supervised Learning based Ensemble Framework' (ETSEF). ETSEF leverages features from multiple pre-trained deep learning models to efficiently learn powerful representations from a limited number of data samples. To the best of our knowledge, ETSEF is the first strategy that combines two pre-training methodologies (Transfer Learning and Self-supervised Learning) with ensemble learning approaches. Various data enhancement techniques, including data augmentation, feature fusion, feature selection, and decision fusion, have also been deployed to maximise the efficiency and robustness of the ETSEF model. Five independent medical imaging tasks, including endoscopy, breast cancer, monkeypox, brain tumour, and glaucoma detection, were tested to demonstrate ETSEF's effectiveness and robustness. Facing limited sample numbers and challenging medical tasks, ETSEF has proved its effectiveness by improving diagnostics accuracies from 10\% to 13.3\% when compared to strong ensemble baseline models and up to 14.4\% improvements compared with published state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we emphasise the robustness and trustworthiness of the ETSEF method through various vision-explainable artificial intelligence techniques, including Grad-CAM, SHAP, and t-SNE. Compared to those large-scale deep learning models, ETSEF can be deployed flexibly and maintain superior performance for challenging medical imaging tasks, showing the potential to be applied to more areas that lack training data</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable potential in conducting complex tasks and are increasingly utilized in various financial applications. However, high-quality sequential financial investment decision-making remains challenging. These tasks require multiple interactions with a volatile environment for every decision, demanding sufficient intelligence to maximize returns and manage risks. Although LLMs have been used to develop agent systems that surpass human teams and yield impressive investment returns, opportunities to enhance multi-sourced information synthesis and optimize decision-making outcomes through timely experience refinement remain unexplored. Here, we introduce the FinCon, an LLM-based multi-agent framework with CONceptual verbal reinforcement tailored for diverse FINancial tasks. Inspired by effective real-world investment firm organizational structures, FinCon utilizes a manager-analyst communication hierarchy. This structure allows for synchronized cross-functional agent collaboration towards unified goals through natural language interactions and equips each agent with greater memory capacity than humans. Additionally, a risk-control component in FinCon enhances decision quality by episodically initiating a self-critiquing mechanism to update systematic investment beliefs. The conceptualized beliefs serve as verbal reinforcement for the future agent's behavior and can be selectively propagated to the appropriate node that requires knowledge updates. This feature significantly improves performance while reducing unnecessary peer-to-peer communication costs. Moreover, FinCon demonstrates strong generalization capabilities in various financial tasks, including single stock trading and portfolio management.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, privacy, protect, attack, robust, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Training state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning models requires a large amount of data. The visual information present in the training data can be misused, which creates a huge privacy concern. One of the prominent solutions for this issue is perceptual encryption, which converts images into an unrecognizable format to protect the sensitive visual information in the training data. This comes at the cost of a significant reduction in the accuracy of the models. Adversarial Visual Information Hiding (AV IH) overcomes this drawback to protect image privacy by attempting to create encrypted images that are unrecognizable to the human eye while keeping relevant features for the target model. In this paper, we introduce the Attack GAN (AGAN ) method, a new Generative Adversarial Network (GAN )-based attack that exposes multiple vulnerabilities in the AV IH method. To show the adaptability, the AGAN is extended to traditional perceptual encryption methods of Learnable encryption (LE) and Encryption-then-Compression (EtC). Extensive experiments were conducted on diverse image datasets and target models to validate the efficacy of our AGAN method. The results show that AGAN can successfully break perceptual encryption methods by reconstructing original images from their AV IH encrypted images. AGAN can be used as a benchmark tool to evaluate the robustness of encryption methods for privacy protection such as AV IH.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) are trained from vast repositories of text authored by millions of distinct authors, reflecting an enormous diversity of human traits. While these models bear the potential to be used as approximations of human subjects in behavioral studies, prior efforts have been limited in steering model responses to match individual human users. In this work, we introduce "Anthology", a method for conditioning LLMs to particular virtual personas by harnessing open-ended life narratives, which we refer to as "backstories." We show that our methodology enhances the consistency and reliability of experimental outcomes while ensuring better representation of diverse sub-populations. Across three nationally representative human surveys conducted as part of Pew Research Center's American Trends Panel (ATP), we demonstrate that Anthology achieves up to 18% improvement in matching the response distributions of human respondents and 27% improvement in consistency metrics.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Existing research on learning with noisy labels predominantly focuses on synthetic label noise. Although synthetic noise possesses well-defined structural properties, it often fails to accurately replicate real-world noise patterns. In recent years, there has been a concerted effort to construct generalizable and controllable instance-dependent noise datasets for image classification, significantly advancing the development of noise-robust learning in this area. However, studies on noisy label learning for text classification remain scarce. To better understand label noise in real-world text classification settings, we constructed the benchmark dataset NoisyAG-News through manual annotation. Initially, we analyzed the annotated data to gather observations about real-world noise. We qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrated that real-world noisy labels adhere to instance-dependent patterns. Subsequently, we conducted comprehensive learning experiments on NoisyAG-News and its corresponding synthetic noise datasets using pre-trained language models and noise-handling techniques. Our findings reveal that while pre-trained models are resilient to synthetic noise, they struggle against instance-dependent noise, with samples of varying confusion levels showing inconsistent performance during training and testing. These real-world noise patterns pose new, significant challenges, prompting a reevaluation of noisy label handling methods. We hope that NoisyAG-News will facilitate the development and evaluation of future solutions for learning with noisy labels.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We focus on the problem of Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (\uda) for breast cancer detection from mammograms (BCDM) problem. Recent advancements have shown that masked image modeling serves as a robust pretext task for UDA. However, when applied to cross-domain BCDM, these techniques struggle with breast abnormalities such as masses, asymmetries, and micro-calcifications, in part due to the typically much smaller size of region of interest in comparison to natural images. This often results in more false positives per image (FPI) and significant noise in pseudo-labels typically used to bootstrap such techniques. Recognizing these challenges, we introduce a transformer-based Domain-invariant Mask Annealed Student Teacher autoencoder (D-MASTER) framework. D-MASTER adaptively masks and reconstructs multi-scale feature maps, enhancing the model's ability to capture reliable target domain features. D-MASTER also includes adaptive confidence refinement to filter pseudo-labels, ensuring only high-quality detections are considered. We also provide a bounding box annotated subset of 1000 mammograms from the RSNA Breast Screening Dataset (referred to as RSNA-BSD1K) to support further research in BCDM. We evaluate D-MASTER on multiple BCDM datasets acquired from diverse domains. Experimental results show a significant improvement of 9% and 13% in sensitivity at 0.3 FPI over state-of-the-art UDA techniques on publicly available benchmark INBreast and DDSM datasets respectively. We also report an improvement of 11% and 17% on In-house and RSNA-BSD1K datasets respectively. The source code, pre-trained D-MASTER model, along with RSNA-BSD1K dataset annotations is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) have led to unprecedented achievements in the field, improving the robustness of this type of system in adverse, noisy environments. In most cases, this task has been addressed through the design of models composed of two independent encoders, each dedicated to a specific modality. However, while recent works have explored unified audio-visual encoders, determining the optimal cross-modal architecture remains an ongoing challenge. Furthermore, such approaches often rely on models comprising vast amounts of parameters and high computational cost training processes. In this paper, we aim to bridge this research gap by introducing a novel audio-visual framework. Our proposed method constitutes, to the best of our knowledge, the first attempt to harness the flexibility and interpretability offered by encoder architectures, such as the Branchformer, in the design of parameter-efficient AVSR systems. To be more precise, the proposed framework consists of two steps: first, estimating audio- and video-only systems, and then designing a tailored audio-visual unified encoder based on the layer-level branch scores provided by the modality-specific models. Extensive experiments on English and Spanish AVSR benchmarks covering multiple data conditions and scenarios demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed method. Results reflect how our tailored AVSR system is able to reach state-of-the-art recognition rates while significantly reducing the model complexity w.r.t. the prevalent approach in the field.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Inspired by the success of the text-to-image (T2I) generation task, many researchers are devoting themselves to the text-to-video (T2V) generation task. Most of the T2V frameworks usually inherit from the T2I model and add extra-temporal layers of training to generate dynamic videos, which can be viewed as a fine-tuning task. However, the traditional 3D-Unet is a serial mode and the temporal layers follow the spatial layers, which will result in high GPU memory and training time consumption according to its serial feature flow. We believe that this serial mode will bring more training costs with the large diffusion model and massive datasets, which are not environmentally friendly and not suitable for the development of the T2V. Therefore, we propose a highly efficient spatial-temporal parallel training paradigm for T2V tasks, named Mobius. In our 3D-Unet, the temporal layers and spatial layers are parallel, which optimizes the feature flow and backpropagation. The Mobius will save 24% GPU memory and 12% training time, which can greatly improve the T2V fine-tuning task and provide a novel insight for the AIGC community. We will release our codes in the future.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Compared with visual signals, Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) placed on human limbs can capture accurate motion signals while being robust to lighting variation and occlusion. While these characteristics are intuitively valuable to help egocentric action recognition, the potential of IMUs remains under-explored. In this work, we present a novel method for action recognition that integrates motion data from body-worn IMUs with egocentric video. Due to the scarcity of labeled multimodal data, we design an MAE-based self-supervised pretraining method, obtaining strong multi-modal representations via modeling the natural correlation between visual and motion signals. To model the complex relation of multiple IMU devices placed across the body, we exploit the collaborative dynamics in multiple IMU devices and propose to embed the relative motion features of human joints into a graph structure. Experiments show our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance on multiple public datasets. The effectiveness of our MAE-based pretraining and graph-based IMU modeling are further validated by experiments in more challenging scenarios, including partially missing IMU devices and video quality corruption, promoting more flexible usages in the real world.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability, diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (UAD) methods aim to identify anomalies in test samples comparing them with a normative distribution learned from a dataset known to be anomaly-free. Approaches based on generative models offer interpretability by generating anomaly-free versions of test images, but are typically unable to identify subtle anomalies. Alternatively, approaches using feature modelling or self-supervised methods, such as the ones relying on synthetically generated anomalies, do not provide out-of-the-box interpretability. In this work, we present a novel method that combines the strengths of both strategies: a generative cold-diffusion pipeline (i.e., a diffusion-like pipeline which uses corruptions not based on noise) that is trained with the objective of turning synthetically-corrupted images back to their normal, original appearance. To support our pipeline we introduce a novel synthetic anomaly generation procedure, called DAG, and a novel anomaly score which ensembles restorations conditioned with different degrees of abnormality. Our method surpasses the prior state-of-the art for unsupervised anomaly detection in three different Brain MRI datasets.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Personalized text-to-image models allow users to generate varied styles of images (specified with a sentence) for an object (specified with a set of reference images). While remarkable results have been achieved using diffusion-based generation models, the visual structure and details of the object are often unexpectedly changed during the diffusion process. One major reason is that these diffusion-based approaches typically adopt a simple reconstruction objective during training, which can hardly enforce appropriate structural consistency between the generated and the reference images. To this end, in this paper, we design a novel reinforcement learning framework by utilizing the deterministic policy gradient method for personalized text-to-image generation, with which various objectives, differential or even non-differential, can be easily incorporated to supervise the diffusion models to improve the quality of the generated images. Experimental results on personalized text-to-image generation benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on visual fidelity while maintaining text-alignment.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Data is the cornerstone of large language models (LLMs), but not all data is useful for model learning. Carefully selected data can better elicit the capabilities of LLMs with much less computational overhead. Most methods concentrate on evaluating the quality of individual samples in data selection, while the combinatorial effects among samples are neglected. Even if each sample is of perfect quality, their combinations may be suboptimal in teaching LLMs due to their intrinsic homogeneity or contradiction. In this paper, we aim to uncover the underlying relationships between LLM performance and data selection. Inspired by the information compression nature of LLMs, we uncover an ``entropy law'' that connects LLM performance with data compression ratio and first-epoch training loss, which reflect the information redundancy of a dataset and the mastery of inherent knowledge encoded in this dataset, respectively. Through both theoretical deduction and empirical evaluation, we find that model performance is negatively correlated to the compression ratio of training data, which usually yields a lower training loss. Based on the findings of the entropy law, we propose a quite efficient and universal data selection method named \textbf{ZIP} for training LLMs, which aim to prioritize data subsets exhibiting a low compression ratio. Based on a multi-stage algorithm that selects diverse data in a greedy manner, we can obtain a good data subset with satisfactory diversity. Extensive experiments have been conducted to validate the entropy law and the superiority of ZIP across different LLM backbones and alignment stages. We also present an interesting application of entropy law that can detect potential performance risks at the beginning of model training.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, attack, biometric</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Biometric data is pervasively captured and analyzed. Using modern machine learning approaches, identity and attribute inferences attacks have proven high accuracy. Anonymizations aim to mitigate such disclosures by modifying data in a way that prevents identification. However, the effectiveness of some anonymizations is unclear. Therefore, improvements of the corresponding evaluation methodology have been proposed recently. In this paper, we introduce SEBA, a framework for strong evaluation of biometric anonymizations. It combines and implements the state-of-the-art methodology in an easy-to-use and easy-to-expand software framework. This allows anonymization designers to easily test their techniques using a strong evaluation methodology. As part of this discourse, we introduce and discuss new metrics that allow for a more straightforward evaluation of the privacy-utility trade-off that is inherent to anonymization attempts. Finally, we report on a prototypical experiment to demonstrate SEBA's applicability.</li>

          Toward Motion Robustness: A masked attention regularization framework in remote photoplethysmography(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>There has been growing interest in facial video-based remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) measurement recently, with a focus on assessing various vital signs such as heart rate and heart rate variability. Despite previous efforts on static datasets, their approaches have been hindered by inaccurate region of interest (ROI) localization and motion issues, and have shown limited generalization in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel masked attention regularization (MAR-rPPG) framework that mitigates the impact of ROI localization and complex motion artifacts. Specifically, our approach first integrates a masked attention regularization mechanism into the rPPG field to capture the visual semantic consistency of facial clips, while it also employs a masking technique to prevent the model from overfitting on inaccurate ROIs and subsequently degrading its performance. Furthermore, we propose an enhanced rPPG expert aggregation (EREA) network as the backbone to obtain rPPG signals and attention maps simultaneously. Our EREA network is capable of discriminating divergent attentions from different facial areas and retaining the consistency of spatiotemporal attention maps. For motion robustness, a simple open source detector MediaPipe for data preprocessing is sufficient for our framework due to its superior capability of rPPG signal extraction and attention regularization. Exhaustive experiments on three benchmark datasets (UBFC-rPPG, PURE, and MMPD) substantiate the superiority of our proposed method, outperforming recent state-of-the-art works by a considerable margin.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) is often hindered by duplicated data in their extensive pre-training datasets. Current approaches primarily focus on detecting and removing duplicates, which risks the loss of valuable information and neglects the varying degrees of duplication. To address this, we propose a soft deduplication method that maintains dataset integrity while selectively reducing the sampling weight of data with high commonness. Central to our approach is the concept of "data commonness", a metric we introduce to quantify the degree of duplication by measuring the occurrence probabilities of samples using an n-gram model. Empirical analysis shows that this method significantly improves training efficiency, achieving comparable perplexity scores with at least a 26% reduction in required training steps. Additionally, it enhances average few-shot downstream accuracy by 1.77% when trained for an equivalent duration. Importantly, this approach consistently improves performance, even on rigorously deduplicated datasets, indicating its potential to complement existing methods and become a standard pre-training process for LLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Transformers have captured growing attention in computer vision, thanks to its large capacity and global processing capabilities. However, transformers are data hungry, and their ability to generalize is constrained compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets), especially when trained with limited data due to the absence of the built-in spatial inductive biases present in ConvNets. In this paper, we strive to optimally combine the strengths of both convolution and transformers for image classification tasks. Towards this end, we present a novel lightweight hybrid network that pairs Convolution with Transformers via Representation Learning Fusion and Multi-Level Feature Cross-Attention named CTRL-F. Our network comprises a convolution branch and a novel transformer module named multi-level feature cross-attention (MFCA). The MFCA module operates on multi-level feature representations obtained at different convolution stages. It processes small patch tokens and large patch tokens extracted from these multi-level feature representations via two separate transformer branches, where both branches communicate and exchange knowledge through cross-attention mechanism. We fuse the local responses acquired from the convolution path with the global responses acquired from the MFCA module using novel representation fusion techniques dubbed adaptive knowledge fusion (AKF) and collaborative knowledge fusion (CKF). Experiments demonstrate that our CTRL-F variants achieve state-of-the-art performance, whether trained from scratch on large data or even with low-data regime. For Instance, CTRL-F achieves top-1 accuracy of 82.24% and 99.91% when trained from scratch on Oxford-102 Flowers and PlantVillage datasets respectively, surpassing state-of-the-art models which showcase the robustness of our model on image classification tasks.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Is it always necessary to compute tokens from shallow to deep layers in Transformers? The continued success of vanilla Transformers and their variants suggests an undoubted "yes". In this work, however, we attempt to break the depth-ordered convention by proposing a novel architecture dubbed mixture-of-modules (MoM), which is motivated by an intuition that any layer, regardless of its position, can be used to compute a token as long as it possesses the needed processing capabilities. The construction of MoM starts from a finite set of modules defined by multi-head attention and feed-forward networks, each distinguished by its unique parameterization. Two routers then iteratively select attention modules and feed-forward modules from the set to process a token. The selection dynamically expands the computation graph in the forward pass of the token, culminating in an assembly of modules. We show that MoM provides not only a unified framework for Transformers and their numerous variants but also a flexible and learnable approach for reducing redundancy in Transformer parameterization. We pre-train various MoMs using OpenWebText. Empirical results demonstrate that MoMs, of different parameter counts, consistently outperform vanilla transformers on both GLUE and XSUM benchmarks. More interestingly, with a fixed parameter budget, MoM-large enables an over 38% increase in depth for computation graphs compared to GPT-2-large, resulting in absolute gains of 1.4 on GLUE and 1 on XSUM. On the other hand, MoM-large also enables an over 60% reduction in depth while involving more modules per layer, yielding a 16% reduction in TFLOPs and a 43% decrease in memory usage compared to GPT-2-large, while maintaining comparable performance.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the manufacturing process, sensor data collected from equipment is crucial for building predictive models to manage processes and improve productivity. However, in the field, it is challenging to gather sufficient data to build robust models. This study proposes a novel predictive model based on the Transformer, utilizing statistical feature embedding and window positional encoding. Statistical features provide an effective representation of sensor data, and the embedding enables the Transformer to learn both time- and sensor-related information. Window positional encoding captures precise time details from the feature embedding. The model's performance is evaluated in two problems: fault detection and virtual metrology, showing superior results compared to baseline models. This improvement is attributed to the efficient use of parameters, which is particularly beneficial for sensor data that often has limited sample sizes. The results support the model's applicability across various manufacturing industries, demonstrating its potential for enhancing process management and yield.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Object detectors have demonstrated vulnerability to adversarial examples crafted by small perturbations that can deceive the object detector. Existing adversarial attacks mainly focus on white-box attacks and are merely valid at a specific viewpoint, while the universal multi-view black-box attack is less explored, limiting their generalization in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel universal multi-view black-box attack against object detectors, which optimizes a universal adversarial UV texture constructed by multiple image stickers for a 3D object via the designed layout optimization algorithm. Specifically, we treat the placement of image stickers on the UV texture as a circle-based layout optimization problem, whose objective is to find the optimal circle layout filled with image stickers so that it can deceive the object detector under the multi-view scenario. To ensure reasonable placement of image stickers, two constraints are elaborately devised. To optimize the layout, we adopt the random search algorithm enhanced by the devised important-aware selection strategy to find the most appropriate image sticker for each circle from the image sticker pools. Extensive experiments conducted on four common object detectors suggested that the detection performance decreases by a large magnitude of 74.29% on average in multi-view scenarios. Additionally, a novel evaluation tool based on the photo-realistic simulator is designed to assess the texture-based attack fairly.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Many datasets have been developed to train and evaluate document-level relation extraction (RE) models. Most of these are constructed using real-world data. It has been shown that RE models trained on real-world data suffer from factual biases. To evaluate and address this issue, we present CovEReD, a counterfactual data generation approach for document-level relation extraction datasets using entity replacement. We first demonstrate that models trained on factual data exhibit inconsistent behavior: while they accurately extract triples from factual data, they fail to extract the same triples after counterfactual modification. This inconsistency suggests that models trained on factual data rely on spurious signals such as specific entities and external knowledge $\unicode{x2013}$ rather than on the input context $\unicode{x2013}$ to extract triples. We show that by generating document-level counterfactual data with CovEReD and training models on them, consistency is maintained with minimal impact on RE performance. We release our CovEReD pipeline as well as Re-DocRED-CF, a dataset of counterfactual RE documents, to assist in evaluating and addressing inconsistency in document-level RE.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Self-supervised learning (SSL) has revolutionized visual representation learning, but has not achieved the robustness of human vision. A reason for this could be that SSL does not leverage all the data available to humans during learning. When learning about an object, humans often purposefully turn or move around objects and research suggests that these interactions can substantially enhance their learning. Here we explore whether such object-related actions can boost SSL. For this, we extract the actions performed to change from one ego-centric view of an object to another in four video datasets. We then introduce a new loss function to learn visual and action embeddings by aligning the performed action with the representations of two images extracted from the same clip. This permits the performed actions to structure the latent visual representation. Our experiments show that our method consistently outperforms previous methods on downstream category recognition. In our analysis, we find that the observed improvement is associated with a better viewpoint-wise alignment of different objects from the same category. Overall, our work demonstrates that embodied interactions with objects can improve SSL of object categories.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Despite the success of input transformation-based attacks on boosting adversarial transferability, the performance is unsatisfying due to the ignorance of the discrepancy across models. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective feature augmentation attack (FAUG) method, which improves adversarial transferability without introducing extra computation costs. Specifically, we inject the random noise into the intermediate features of the model to enlarge the diversity of the attack gradient, thereby mitigating the risk of overfitting to the specific model and notably amplifying adversarial transferability. Moreover, our method can be combined with existing gradient attacks to augment their performance further. Extensive experiments conducted on the ImageNet dataset across CNN and transformer models corroborate the efficacy of our method, e.g., we achieve improvement of +26.22% and +5.57% on input transformation-based attacks and combination methods, respectively.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Visual place recognition (VPR) remains challenging due to significant viewpoint changes and appearance variations. Mainstream works tackle these challenges by developing various feature aggregation methods to transform deep features into robust and compact global representations. Unfortunately, satisfactory results cannot be achieved under challenging conditions. We start from a new perspective and attempt to build a discriminative global representations by fusing image data and text descriptions of the the visual scene. The motivation is twofold: (1) Current Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate extraordinary emergent capability in visual instruction following, and thus provide an efficient and flexible manner in generating text descriptions of images; (2) The text descriptions, which provide high-level scene understanding, show strong robustness against environment variations. Although promising, leveraging LVLMs to build multi-modal VPR solutions remains challenging in efficient multi-modal fusion. Furthermore, LVLMs will inevitably produces some inaccurate descriptions, making it even harder. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel multi-modal VPR solution. It first adapts pre-trained visual and language foundation models to VPR for extracting image and text features, which are then fed into the feature combiner to enhance each other. As the main component, the feature combiner first propose a token-wise attention block to adaptively recalibrate text tokens according to their relevance to the image data, and then develop an efficient cross-attention fusion module to propagate information across different modalities. The enhanced multi-modal features are compressed into the feature descriptor for performing retrieval. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin with significantly smaller image descriptor dimension.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Among the existing approaches for visual-based Recommender System (RS) explainability, utilizing user-uploaded item images as efficient, trustable explanations is a promising option. However, current models following this paradigm assume that, for any user, all images uploaded by other users can be considered negative training examples (i.e. bad explanatory images), an inadvertedly naive labelling assumption that contradicts the rationale of the approach. This work proposes a new explainer training pipeline by leveraging Positive-Unlabelled (PU) Learning techniques to train image-based explainer with refined subsets of reliable negative examples for each user selected through a novel user-personalized, two-step, similarity-based PU Learning algorithm. Computational experiments show this PU-based approach outperforms the state-of-the-art non-PU method in six popular real-world datasets, proving that an improvement of visual-based RS explainability can be achieved by maximizing training data quality rather than increasing model complexity.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Physical side-channel attacks represent a great challenge for today's chip design. Although attacks on CMOS dynamic power represent a class of state-of-the-art attacks, many other effects potentially affect the security of CMOS chips analogously by affecting mostly static behaviour of the chip, including aging, ionizing radiation, or non-ionizing illumination of the CMOS. Vulnerabilities exploiting data dependency in CMOS static power were already demonstrated in practice and the analogous vulnerability exploiting light-modulated static power was demonstrated by simulation. This work confirms the CMOS vulnerability related to the light-modulated data-dependent static power experimentally and discusses future work.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, protect</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Since its implementation in May 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has prompted businesses to revisit and revise their data handling practices to ensure compliance. The privacy policy, which serves as the primary means of informing users about their privacy rights and the data practices of companies, has been significantly updated by numerous businesses post-GDPR implementation. However, many privacy policies remain packed with technical jargon, lengthy explanations, and vague descriptions of data practices and user rights. This makes it a challenging task for users and regulatory authorities to manually verify the GDPR compliance of these privacy policies. In this study, we aim to address the challenge of compliance analysis between GDPR (Article 13) and privacy policies for 5G networks. We manually collected privacy policies from almost 70 different 5G MNOs, and we utilized an automated BERT-based model for classification. We show that an encouraging 51$\%$ of companies demonstrate a strong adherence to GDPR. In addition, we present the first study that provides current empirical evidence on the readability of privacy policies for 5G network. we adopted readability analysis toolset that incorporates various established readability metrics. The findings empirically show that the readability of the majority of current privacy policies remains a significant challenge. Hence, 5G providers need to invest considerable effort into revising these documents to enhance both their utility and the overall user experience.</li>

          CoLA: Conditional Dropout and Language-driven Robust Dual-modal Salient Object Detection(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The depth/thermal information is beneficial for detecting salient object with conventional RGB images. However, in dual-modal salient object detection (SOD) model, the robustness against noisy inputs and modality missing is crucial but rarely studied. To tackle this problem, we introduce \textbf{Co}nditional Dropout and \textbf{LA}nguage-driven(\textbf{CoLA}) framework comprising two core components. 1) Language-driven Quality Assessment (LQA): Leveraging a pretrained vision-language model with a prompt learner, the LQA recalibrates image contributions without requiring additional quality annotations. This approach effectively mitigates the impact of noisy inputs. 2) Conditional Dropout (CD): A learning method to strengthen the model's adaptability in scenarios with missing modalities, while preserving its performance under complete modalities. The CD serves as a plug-in training scheme that treats modality-missing as conditions, strengthening the overall robustness of various dual-modal SOD models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art dual-modal SOD models, under both modality-complete and modality-missing conditions. We will release source code upon acceptance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Post-training quantization (PTQ) for vision transformers (ViTs) has garnered significant attention due to its efficiency in compressing models. However, existing methods typically overlook the intricate interdependence between quantized weight and activation, leading to considerable quantization error. In this paper, we propose ERQ, a two-step PTQ approach meticulously crafted to sequentially reduce the quantization error arising from activation and weight quantization. ERQ first introduces Activation quantization error reduction (Aqer) that strategically formulates the minimization of activation quantization error as a Ridge Regression problem, tackling it by updating weights with full-precision. Subsequently, ERQ introduces Weight quantization error reduction (Wqer) that adopts an iterative approach to mitigate the quantization error induced by weight quantization. In each iteration, an empirically derived, efficient proxy is employed to refine the rounding directions of quantized weights, coupled with a Ridge Regression solver to curtail weight quantization error. Experimental results attest to the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, ERQ surpasses the state-of-the-art GPTQ by 22.36% in accuracy for W3A4 ViT-S.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The recently introduced Segment-Anything Model (SAM) has the potential to greatly accelerate the development of segmentation models. However, directly applying SAM to surgical images has key limitations including (1) the requirement of image-specific prompts at test-time, thereby preventing fully automated segmentation, and (2) ineffectiveness due to substantial domain gap between natural and surgical images. In this work, we propose CycleSAM, an approach for one-shot surgical scene segmentation that uses the training image-mask pair at test-time to automatically identify points in the test images that correspond to each object class, which can then be used to prompt SAM to produce object masks. To produce high-fidelity matches, we introduce a novel spatial cycle-consistency constraint that enforces point proposals in the test image to rematch to points within the object foreground region in the training image. Then, to address the domain gap, rather than directly using the visual features from SAM, we employ a ResNet50 encoder pretrained on surgical images in a self-supervised fashion, thereby maintaining high label-efficiency. We evaluate CycleSAM for one-shot segmentation on two diverse surgical semantic segmentation datasets, comprehensively outperforming baseline approaches and reaching up to 50% of fully-supervised performance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Traditional Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are constrained by the limitations of the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) formulation, particularly when utilizing simplistic, non-analytic, or unknown prior distributions. These limitations inhibit the VAE's ability to generate high-quality samples and provide clear, interpretable latent representations. This work introduces the Entropy Decomposed Variational Autoencoder (ED-VAE), a novel re-formulation of the ELBO that explicitly includes entropy and cross-entropy components. This reformulation significantly enhances model flexibility, allowing for the integration of complex and non-standard priors. By providing more detailed control over the encoding and regularization of latent spaces, ED-VAE not only improves interpretability but also effectively captures the complex interactions between latent variables and observed data, thus leading to better generative performance.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The prevalence of AI-generated imagery has raised concerns about the authenticity of astronomical images, especially with advanced text-to-image models like Stable Diffusion producing highly realistic synthetic samples. Existing detection methods, primarily based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or spectral analysis, have limitations when used independently. We present AstroSpy, a hybrid model that integrates both spectral and image features to distinguish real from synthetic astronomical images. Trained on a unique dataset of real NASA images and AI-generated fakes (approximately 18k samples), AstroSpy utilizes a dual-pathway architecture to fuse spatial and spectral information. This approach enables AstroSpy to achieve superior performance in identifying authentic astronomical images. Extensive evaluations demonstrate AstroSpy's effectiveness and robustness, significantly outperforming baseline models in both in-domain and cross-domain tasks, highlighting its potential to combat misinformation in astronomy.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As asynchronous event data is more frequently engaged in various vision tasks, the risk of backdoor attacks becomes more evident. However, research into the potential risk associated with backdoor attacks in asynchronous event data has been scarce, leaving related tasks vulnerable to potential threats. This paper has uncovered the possibility of directly poisoning event data streams by proposing Event Trojan framework, including two kinds of triggers, i.e., immutable and mutable triggers. Specifically, our two types of event triggers are based on a sequence of simulated event spikes, which can be easily incorporated into any event stream to initiate backdoor attacks. Additionally, for the mutable trigger, we design an adaptive learning mechanism to maximize its aggressiveness. To improve the stealthiness, we introduce a novel loss function that constrains the generated contents of mutable triggers, minimizing the difference between triggers and original events while maintaining effectiveness. Extensive experiments on public event datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed backdoor triggers. We hope that this paper can draw greater attention to the potential threats posed by backdoor attacks on event-based tasks. Our code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Change detection in remote sensing images is an essential tool for analyzing a region at different times. It finds varied applications in monitoring environmental changes, man-made changes as well as corresponding decision-making and prediction of future trends. Deep learning methods like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers have achieved remarkable success in detecting significant changes, given two images at different times. In this paper, we propose a Mamba-based Change Detector (M-CD) that segments out the regions of interest even better. Mamba-based architectures demonstrate linear-time training capabilities and an improved receptive field over transformers. Our experiments on four widely used change detection datasets demonstrate significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Hyperspectral target detection (HTD) identifies objects of interest from complex backgrounds at the pixel level, playing a vital role in Earth observation. However, HTD faces challenges due to limited prior knowledge and spectral variations, leading to underfitting models and unreliable performance. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an efficient self-supervised HTD method with a pyramid state space model (SSM), named HTD-Mamba, which employs spectrally contrastive learning to distinguish between target and background based on the similarity measurement of intrinsic features. Specifically, to obtain sufficient training samples and leverage spatial contextual information, we propose a spatial-encoded spectral augmentation technique that encodes all surrounding pixels within a patch into a transformed view of the central pixel. Additionally, to explore global band correlations, we divide pixels into continuous group-wise spectral embeddings and introduce Mamba to HTD for the first time to model long-range dependencies of the spectral sequence with linear complexity. Furthermore, to alleviate spectral variation and enhance robust representation, we propose a pyramid SSM as a backbone to capture and fuse multiresolution spectral-wise intrinsic features. Extensive experiments conducted on four public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent work on image content manipulation based on vision-language pre-training models has been effectively extended to text-driven 3D scene editing. However, existing schemes for 3D scene editing still exhibit certain shortcomings, hindering their further interactive design. Such schemes typically adhere to fixed input patterns, limiting users' flexibility in text input. Moreover, their editing capabilities are constrained by a single or a few 2D visual models and require intricate pipeline design to integrate these models into 3D reconstruction processes. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a dialogue-based 3D scene editing approach, termed CE3D, which is centered around a large language model that allows for arbitrary textual input from users and interprets their intentions, subsequently facilitating the autonomous invocation of the corresponding visual expert models. Furthermore, we design a scheme utilizing Hash-Atlas to represent 3D scene views, which transfers the editing of 3D scenes onto 2D atlas images. This design achieves complete decoupling between the 2D editing and 3D reconstruction processes, enabling CE3D to flexibly integrate a wide range of existing 2D or 3D visual models without necessitating intricate fusion designs. Experimental results demonstrate that CE3D effectively integrates multiple visual models to achieve diverse editing visual effects, possessing strong scene comprehension and multi-round dialog capabilities.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Modern visual recognition models often display overconfidence due to their reliance on complex deep neural networks and one-hot target supervision, resulting in unreliable confidence scores that necessitate calibration. While current confidence calibration techniques primarily address single-label scenarios, there is a lack of focus on more practical and generalizable multi-label contexts. This paper introduces the Multi-Label Confidence Calibration (MLCC) task, aiming to provide well-calibrated confidence scores in multi-label scenarios. Unlike single-label images, multi-label images contain multiple objects, leading to semantic confusion and further unreliability in confidence scores. Existing single-label calibration methods, based on label smoothing, fail to account for category correlations, which are crucial for addressing semantic confusion, thereby yielding sub-optimal performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Dynamic Correlation Learning and Regularization (DCLR) algorithm, which leverages multi-grained semantic correlations to better model semantic confusion for adaptive regularization. DCLR learns dynamic instance-level and prototype-level similarities specific to each category, using these to measure semantic correlations across different categories. With this understanding, we construct adaptive label vectors that assign higher values to categories with strong correlations, thereby facilitating more effective regularization. We establish an evaluation benchmark, re-implementing several advanced confidence calibration algorithms and applying them to leading multi-label recognition (MLR) models for fair comparison. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the superior performance of DCLR over existing methods in providing reliable confidence scores in multi-label scenarios.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Despite the impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various tasks, their vulnerability to unsafe prompts remains a critical issue. These prompts can lead LLMs to generate responses on illegal or sensitive topics, posing a significant threat to their safe and ethical use. Existing approaches attempt to address this issue using classification models, but they have several drawbacks. With the increasing complexity of unsafe prompts, similarity search-based techniques that identify specific features of unsafe prompts provide a more robust and effective solution to this evolving problem. This paper investigates the potential of sentence encoders to distinguish safe from unsafe prompts, and the ability to classify various unsafe prompts according to a safety taxonomy. We introduce new pairwise datasets and the Categorical Purity (CP) metric to measure this capability. Our findings reveal both the effectiveness and limitations of existing sentence encoders, proposing directions to improve sentence encoders to operate as more robust safety detectors.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Alzheimer's Dementia (AD) represents one of the most pressing challenges in the field of neurodegenerative disorders, with its progression analysis being crucial for understanding disease dynamics and developing targeted interventions. Recent advancements in deep learning and various representation learning strategies, including self-supervised learning (SSL), have shown significant promise in enhancing medical image analysis, providing innovative ways to extract meaningful patterns from complex data. Notably, the computer vision literature has demonstrated that incorporating supervisory signals into SSL can further augment model performance by guiding the learning process with additional relevant information. However, the application of such supervisory signals in the context of disease progression analysis remains largely unexplored. This gap is particularly pronounced given the inherent challenges of incorporating both event and time-to-event information into the learning paradigm. Addressing this, we propose a novel framework, Time and Even-aware SSL (TE-SSL), which integrates time-to-event and event data as supervisory signals to refine the learning process. Our comparative analysis with existing SSL-based methods in the downstream task of survival analysis shows superior performance across standard metrics.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Real-time Clock (RTC) has been widely used in various real-time systems to provide precise system time. In this paper, we reveal a new security vulnerability of the RTC circuit, where the internal storage time or timestamp can be arbitrarily modified forward or backward. The security threat of dynamic modifications of system time caused by this vulnerability is called TimeTravel. Based on acoustic resonance and piezoelectric effects, TimeTravel applies acoustic guide waves to the quartz crystal, thereby adjusting the characteristics of the oscillating signal transmitted into the RTC circuit. By manipulating the parameters of acoustic waves, TimeTravel can accelerate or decelerate the timing speed of system time at an adjustable rate, resulting in the relative drift of the timing, which can pose serious safety threats. To assess the severity of TimeTravel, we examine nine modules and two commercial devices under the RTC circuit. The experimental results show that TimeTravel can drift system time forward and backward at a chosen speed with a maximum 93% accuracy. Our analysis further shows that TimeTravel can maintain an attack success rate of no less than 77% under environments with typical obstacle items.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) transforms a discrete Knowledge Graph (KG) into a continuous vector space facilitating its use in various AI-driven applications like Semantic Search, Question Answering, or Recommenders. While KGE approaches are effective in these applications, most existing approaches assume that all information in the given KG is correct. This enables attackers to influence the output of these approaches, e.g., by perturbing the input. Consequently, the robustness of such KGE approaches has to be addressed. Recent work focused on adversarial attacks. However, non-adversarial attacks on all attack surfaces of these approaches have not been thoroughly examined. We close this gap by evaluating the impact of non-adversarial attacks on the performance of 5 state-of-the-art KGE algorithms on 5 datasets with respect to attacks on 3 attack surfaces-graph, parameter, and label perturbation. Our evaluation results suggest that label perturbation has a strong effect on the KGE performance, followed by parameter perturbation with a moderate and graph with a low effect.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Cross-view geo-localization confronts significant challenges due to large perspective changes, especially when the ground-view query image has a limited field of view with unknown orientation. To bridge the cross-view domain gap, we for the first time explore to learn a BEV representation directly from the ground query image. However, the unknown orientation between ground and aerial images combined with the absence of camera parameters led to ambiguity between BEV queries and ground references. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel Window-to-Window BEV representation learning method, termed W2W-BEV, which adaptively matches BEV queries to ground reference at window-scale. Specifically, predefined BEV embeddings and extracted ground features are segmented into a fixed number of windows, and then most similar ground window is chosen for each BEV feature based on the context-aware window matching strategy. Subsequently, the cross-attention is performed between the matched BEV and ground windows to learn the robust BEV representation. Additionally, we use ground features along with predicted depth information to initialize the BEV embeddings, helping learn more powerful BEV representations. Extensive experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate significant superiority of our W2W-BEV over previous state-of-the-art methods under challenging conditions of unknown orientation and limited FoV. Specifically, on the CVUSA dataset with limited Fov of 90 degree and unknown orientation, the W2W-BEV achieve an significant improvement from 47.24% to 64.73 %(+17.49%) in R@1 accuracy.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text-to-Image (T2I) models are being increasingly adopted in diverse global communities where they create visual representations of their unique cultures. Current T2I benchmarks primarily focus on faithfulness, aesthetics, and realism of generated images, overlooking the critical dimension of cultural competence. In this work, we introduce a framework to evaluate cultural competence of T2I models along two crucial dimensions: cultural awareness and cultural diversity, and present a scalable approach using a combination of structured knowledge bases and large language models to build a large dataset of cultural artifacts to enable this evaluation. In particular, we apply this approach to build CUBE (CUltural BEnchmark for Text-to-Image models), a first-of-its-kind benchmark to evaluate cultural competence of T2I models. CUBE covers cultural artifacts associated with 8 countries across different geo-cultural regions and along 3 concepts: cuisine, landmarks, and art. CUBE consists of 1) CUBE-1K, a set of high-quality prompts that enable the evaluation of cultural awareness, and 2) CUBE-CSpace, a larger dataset of cultural artifacts that serves as grounding to evaluate cultural diversity. We also introduce cultural diversity as a novel T2I evaluation component, leveraging quality-weighted Vendi score. Our evaluations reveal significant gaps in the cultural awareness of existing models across countries and provide valuable insights into the cultural diversity of T2I outputs for under-specified prompts. Our methodology is extendable to other cultural regions and concepts, and can facilitate the development of T2I models that better cater to the global population.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Image-to-video adaptation seeks to efficiently adapt image models for use in the video domain. Instead of finetuning the entire image backbone, many image-to-video adaptation paradigms use lightweight adapters for temporal modeling on top of the spatial module. However, these attempts are subject to limitations in efficiency and interpretability. In this paper, we propose a novel and efficient image-to-video adaptation strategy from the object-centric perspective. Inspired by human perception, which identifies objects as key components for video understanding, we integrate a proxy task of object discovery into image-to-video transfer learning. Specifically, we adopt slot attention with learnable queries to distill each frame into a compact set of object tokens. These object-centric tokens are then processed through object-time interaction layers to model object state changes across time. Integrated with two novel object-level losses, we demonstrate the feasibility of performing efficient temporal reasoning solely on the compressed object-centric representations for video downstream tasks. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer tunable parameters, only 5\% of fully finetuned models and 50\% of efficient tuning methods, on action recognition benchmarks. In addition, our model performs favorably in zero-shot video object segmentation without further retraining or object annotations, proving the effectiveness of object-centric video understanding.</li>

          Measuring Sustainability Intention of ESG Fund Disclosure using Few-Shot Learning(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Global sustainable fund universe encompasses open-end funds and exchange-traded funds (ETF) that, by prospectus or other regulatory filings, claim to focus on Environment, Social and Governance (ESG). Challengingly, the claims can only be confirmed by examining the textual disclosures to check if there is presence of intentionality and ESG focus on its investment strategy. Currently, there is no regulation to enforce sustainability in ESG products space. This paper proposes a unique method and system to classify and score the fund prospectuses in the sustainable universe regarding specificity and transparency of language. We aim to employ few-shot learners to identify specific, ambiguous, and generic sustainable investment-related language. Additionally, we construct a ratio metric to determine language score and rating to rank products and quantify sustainability claims for US sustainable universe. As a by-product, we publish manually annotated quality training dataset on Hugging Face (ESG-Prospectus-Clarity-Category under cc-by-nc-sa-4.0) of more than 1K ESG textual statements. The performance of the few-shot finetuning approach is compared with zero-shot models e.g., Llama-13B, GPT 3.5 Turbo etc. We found that prompting large language models are not accurate for domain specific tasks due to misalignment issues. The few-shot finetuning techniques outperform zero-shot models by large margins of more than absolute ~30% in precision, recall and F1 metrics on completely unseen ESG languages (test set). Overall, the paper attempts to establish a systematic and scalable approach to measure and rate sustainability intention quantitatively for sustainable funds using texts in prospectus. Regulatory bodies, investors, and advisors may utilize the findings of this research to reduce cognitive load in investigating or screening of ESG funds which accurately reflects the ESG intention.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Emotions play important epistemological and cognitive roles in our lives, revealing our values and guiding our actions. Previous work has shown that LLMs display biases in emotion attribution along gender lines. However, unlike gender, which says little about our values, religion, as a socio-cultural system, prescribes a set of beliefs and values for its followers. Religions, therefore, cultivate certain emotions. Moreover, these rules are explicitly laid out and interpreted by religious leaders. Using emotion attribution, we explore how different religions are represented in LLMs. We find that: Major religions in the US and European countries are represented with more nuance, displaying a more shaded model of their beliefs. Eastern religions like Hinduism and Buddhism are strongly stereotyped. Judaism and Islam are stigmatized -- the models' refusal skyrocket. We ascribe these to cultural bias in LLMs and the scarcity of NLP literature on religion. In the rare instances where religion is discussed, it is often in the context of toxic language, perpetuating the perception of these religions as inherently toxic. This finding underscores the urgent need to address and rectify these biases. Our research underscores the crucial role emotions play in our lives and how our values influence them.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we address the challenge of differential privacy in the context of graph cuts, specifically focusing on the minimum $k$-cut and multiway cut problems. We introduce edge-differentially private algorithms that achieve nearly optimal performance for these problems. For the multiway cut problem, we first provide a private algorithm with a multiplicative approximation ratio that matches the state-of-the-art non-private algorithm. We then present a tight information-theoretic lower bound on the additive error, demonstrating that our algorithm on weighted graphs is near-optimal for constant $k$. For the minimum $k$-cut problem, our algorithms leverage a known bound on the number of approximate $k$-cuts, resulting in a private algorithm with optimal additive error $O(k\log n)$ for fixed privacy parameter. We also establish a information-theoretic lower bound that matches this additive error. Additionally, we give an efficient private algorithm for $k$-cut even for non-constant $k$, including a polynomial-time 2-approximation with an additive error of $\widetilde{O}(k^{1.5})$.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to propagate and amplify harmful stereotypes, particularly those that disproportionately affect marginalised communities. To understand the effect of these stereotypes more comprehensively, we introduce GlobalBias, a dataset of 876k sentences incorporating 40 distinct gender-by-ethnicity groups alongside descriptors typically used in bias literature, which enables us to study a broad set of stereotypes from around the world. We use GlobalBias to directly probe a suite of LMs via perplexity, which we use as a proxy to determine how certain stereotypes are represented in the model's internal representations. Following this, we generate character profiles based on given names and evaluate the prevalence of stereotypes in model outputs. We find that the demographic groups associated with various stereotypes remain consistent across model likelihoods and model outputs. Furthermore, larger models consistently display higher levels of stereotypical outputs, even when explicitly instructed not to.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This work introduces a novel and efficient Bayesian federated learning algorithm, namely, the Federated Averaging stochastic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (FA-HMC), for parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification. We establish rigorous convergence guarantees of FA-HMC on non-iid distributed data sets, under the strong convexity and Hessian smoothness assumptions. Our analysis investigates the effects of parameter space dimension, noise on gradients and momentum, and the frequency of communication (between the central node and local nodes) on the convergence and communication costs of FA-HMC. Beyond that, we establish the tightness of our analysis by showing that the convergence rate cannot be improved even for continuous FA-HMC process. Moreover, extensive empirical studies demonstrate that FA-HMC outperforms the existing Federated Averaging-Langevin Monte Carlo (FA-LD) algorithm.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text-to-image diffusion models have significantly advanced in conditional image generation. However, these models usually struggle with accurately rendering images featuring humans, resulting in distorted limbs and other anomalies. This issue primarily stems from the insufficient recognition and evaluation of limb qualities in diffusion models. To address this issue, we introduce AbHuman, the first large-scale synthesized human benchmark focusing on anatomical anomalies. This benchmark consists of 56K synthesized human images, each annotated with detailed, bounding-box level labels identifying 147K human anomalies in 18 different categories. Based on this, the recognition of human anomalies can be established, which in turn enhances image generation through traditional techniques such as negative prompting and guidance. To further boost the improvement, we propose HumanRefiner, a novel plug-and-play approach for the coarse-to-fine refinement of human anomalies in text-to-image generation. Specifically, HumanRefiner utilizes a self-diagnostic procedure to detect and correct issues related to both coarse-grained abnormal human poses and fine-grained anomaly levels, facilitating pose-reversible diffusion generation. Experimental results on the AbHuman benchmark demonstrate that HumanRefiner significantly reduces generative discrepancies, achieving a 2.9x improvement in limb quality compared to the state-of-the-art open-source generator SDXL and a 1.4x improvement over DALL-E 3 in human evaluations.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present RodinHD, which can generate high-fidelity 3D avatars from a portrait image. Existing methods fail to capture intricate details such as hairstyles which we tackle in this paper. We first identify an overlooked problem of catastrophic forgetting that arises when fitting triplanes sequentially on many avatars, caused by the MLP decoder sharing scheme. To overcome this issue, we raise a novel data scheduling strategy and a weight consolidation regularization term, which improves the decoder's capability of rendering sharper details. Additionally, we optimize the guiding effect of the portrait image by computing a finer-grained hierarchical representation that captures rich 2D texture cues, and injecting them to the 3D diffusion model at multiple layers via cross-attention. When trained on 46K avatars with a noise schedule optimized for triplanes, the resulting model can generate 3D avatars with notably better details than previous methods and can generalize to in-the-wild portrait input.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>After three rounds of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) strict evaluations conducted by the national institute of standards and technology (NIST), CRYSTALS-Kyber has successfully been selected and drafted for standardization from the mid of 2022. It becomes urgent to further evaluate Kyber's physical security for the upcoming deployment phase. In this paper, we present an improved two-step attack on Kyber to quickly recover the full secret key, s, by using much fewer energy traces and less time. In the first step, we use the correlation power analysis (CPA) attack to obtain a portion of guess values of s with a small number of energy traces. The CPA attack is enhanced by utilizing both the Pearson and Kendall's rank correlation coefficients and modifying the leakage model to improve the accuracy. In the second step, we adopt the lattice attack to recover s based on the results of CPA. The success rate is largely built up by constructing a trail-and-error method. We implement the proposed attack for the reference implementation of Kyber512 (4 128-value groups of s) on ARM Cortex-M4 and successfully recover a 128-value group of s in about 9 minutes using a 16-core machine. Additionally, in that case, we only cost at most 60 CPA guess values for a group and 15 power traces for a guess.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>A rapidly growing number of applications rely on a small set of closed-source language models (LMs). This dependency might introduce novel security risks if LMs develop self-recognition capabilities. Inspired by human identity verification methods, we propose a novel approach for assessing self-recognition in LMs using model-generated "security questions". Our test can be externally administered to keep track of frontier models as it does not require access to internal model parameters or output probabilities. We use our test to examine self-recognition in ten of the most capable open- and closed-source LMs currently publicly available. Our extensive experiments found no empirical evidence of general or consistent self-recognition in any examined LM. Instead, our results suggest that given a set of alternatives, LMs seek to pick the "best" answer, regardless of its origin. Moreover, we find indications that preferences about which models produce the best answers are consistent across LMs. We additionally uncover novel insights on position bias considerations for LMs in multiple-choice settings.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In-context learning (ICL) is a recent advancement in the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). This feature allows users to perform a new task without updating the model. Concretely, users can address tasks during the inference time by conditioning on a few input-label pair demonstrations along with the test input. It is different than the conventional fine-tuning paradigm and offers more flexibility. However, this capability also introduces potential issues. For example, users may use the model on any data without restriction, such as performing tasks with improper or sensitive content, which might violate the model policy or conflict with the model owner's interests. As a model owner, it is crucial to establish a mechanism to control the model's behavior under ICL, depending on the model owner's requirements for various content. To this end, we introduce the concept of "applicability authorization" tailored for LLMs, particularly for ICL behavior, and propose a simple approach, ICLGuard. It is a fine-tuning framework designed to allow the model owner to regulate ICL behavior on different data. ICLGuard preserves the original LLM and fine-tunes only a minimal set of additional trainable parameters to "guard" the LLM. Empirical results show that the guarded LLM can deactivate its ICL ability on target data without affecting its ICL ability on other data and its general functionality across all data.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>3D instance segmentation is crucial for applications demanding comprehensive 3D scene understanding. In this paper, we introduce a novel method that simultaneously learns coefficients and prototypes. Employing an overcomplete sampling strategy, our method produces an overcomplete set of instance predictions, from which the optimal ones are selected through a Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) algorithm during inference. The obtained prototypes are visualizable and interpretable. Our method demonstrates superior performance on S3DIS-blocks, consistently outperforming existing methods in mRec and mPrec. Moreover, it operates 32.9% faster than the state-of-the-art. Notably, with only 0.8% of the total inference time, our method exhibits an over 20-fold reduction in the variance of inference time compared to existing methods. These attributes render our method well-suited for practical applications requiring both rapid inference and high reliability.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent works on parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) show the potential to adapt a pre-trained Vision Transformer to downstream recognition tasks with only a few learnable parameters. However, since they usually insert new structures into the pre-trained model, entire intermediate features of that model are changed and thus need to be stored to be involved in back-propagation, resulting in memory-heavy training. We solve this problem from a novel disentangled perspective, i.e., dividing PETL into two aspects: task-specific learning and pre-trained knowledge utilization. Specifically, we synthesize the task-specific query with a learnable and lightweight module, which is independent of the pre-trained model. The synthesized query equipped with task-specific knowledge serves to extract the useful features for downstream tasks from the intermediate representations of the pre-trained model in a query-only manner. Built upon these features, a customized classification head is proposed to make the prediction for the input sample. lightweight architecture and avoids the use of heavy intermediate features for running gradient descent, it demonstrates limited memory usage in training. Extensive experiments manifest that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance under memory constraints, showcasing its applicability in real-world situations.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Pre-trained large language models (LLM) are starting to be widely used in many applications. In this work, we explore the use of these models in interactive machine translation (IMT) environments. In particular, we have chosen mBART (multilingual Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformer) and mT5 (multilingual Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) as the LLMs to perform our experiments. The system generates perfect translations interactively using the feedback provided by the user at each iteration. The Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model generates a preliminary hypothesis with the feedback, and the user validates new correct segments and performs a word correction--repeating the process until the sentence is correctly translated. We compared the performance of mBART, mT5, and a state-of-the-art (SoTA) machine translation model on a benchmark dataset regarding user effort, Word Stroke Ratio (WSR), Key Stroke Ratio (KSR), and Mouse Action Ratio (MAR). The experimental results indicate that mBART performed comparably with SoTA models, suggesting that it is a viable option for this field of IMT. The implications of this finding extend to the development of new machine translation models for interactive environments, as it indicates that some novel pre-trained models exhibit SoTA performance in this domain, highlighting the potential benefits of adapting these models to specific needs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Serving large language models (LLMs) in production can incur substantial costs, which has prompted recent advances in inference system optimizations. Today, these systems are evaluated against conventional latency and throughput metrics (eg. TTFT, TBT, Normalised Latency and TPOT). However, these metrics fail to fully capture the nuances of LLM inference, leading to an incomplete assessment of user-facing performance crucial for real-time applications such as chat and translation. In this paper, we first identify the pitfalls of current performance metrics in evaluating LLM inference systems. We then propose Metron, a comprehensive performance evaluation framework that includes fluidity-index -- a novel metric designed to reflect the intricacies of the LLM inference process and its impact on real-time user experience. Finally, we evaluate various existing open-source platforms and model-as-a-service offerings using Metron, discussing their strengths and weaknesses. Metron is available at this https URL.</li>

          Empirical analysis of Biding Precedent efficiency in the Brazilian Supreme Court via Similar Case Retrieval(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>protect</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Binding precedents (Súmulas Vinculantes) constitute a juridical instrument unique to the Brazilian legal system and whose objectives include the protection of the Federal Supreme Court against repetitive demands. Studies of the effectiveness of these instruments in decreasing the Court's exposure to similar cases, however, indicate that they tend to fail in such a direction, with some of the binding precedents seemingly creating new demands. We empirically assess the legal impact of five binding precedents, 11, 14, 17, 26 and 37, at the highest court level through their effects on the legal subjects they address. This analysis is only possible through the comparison of the Court's ruling about the precedents' themes before they are created, which means that these decisions should be detected through techniques of Similar Case Retrieval. The contributions of this article are therefore twofold: on the mathematical side, we compare the uses of different methods of Natural Language Processing -- TF-IDF, LSTM, BERT, and regex -- for Similar Case Retrieval, whereas on the legal side, we contrast the inefficiency of these binding precedents with a set of hypotheses that may justify their repeated usage. We observe that the deep learning models performed significantly worse in the specific Similar Case Retrieval task and that the reasons for binding precedents to fail in responding to repetitive demand are heterogeneous and case-dependent, making it impossible to single out a specific cause.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) have shown a remarkable ability to learn and perform complex tasks through in-context learning (ICL). However, a comprehensive understanding of its internal mechanisms is still lacking. This paper explores the role of induction heads in a few-shot ICL setting. We analyse two state-of-the-art models, Llama-3-8B and InternLM2-20B on abstract pattern recognition and NLP tasks. Our results show that even a minimal ablation of induction heads leads to ICL performance decreases of up to ~32% for abstract pattern recognition tasks, bringing the performance close to random. For NLP tasks, this ablation substantially decreases the model's ability to benefit from examples, bringing few-shot ICL performance close to that of zero-shot prompts. We further use attention knockout to disable specific induction patterns, and present fine-grained evidence for the role that the induction mechanism plays in ICL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Knowing the effect of an intervention is critical for human decision-making, but current approaches for causal effect estimation rely on manual data collection and structuring, regardless of the causal assumptions. This increases both the cost and time-to-completion for studies. We show how large, diverse observational text data can be mined with large language models (LLMs) to produce inexpensive causal effect estimates under appropriate causal assumptions. We introduce NATURAL, a novel family of causal effect estimators built with LLMs that operate over datasets of unstructured text. Our estimators use LLM conditional distributions (over variables of interest, given the text data) to assist in the computation of classical estimators of causal effect. We overcome a number of technical challenges to realize this idea, such as automating data curation and using LLMs to impute missing information. We prepare six (two synthetic and four real) observational datasets, paired with corresponding ground truth in the form of randomized trials, which we used to systematically evaluate each step of our pipeline. NATURAL estimators demonstrate remarkable performance, yielding causal effect estimates that fall within 3 percentage points of their ground truth counterparts, including on real-world Phase 3/4 clinical trials. Our results suggest that unstructured text data is a rich source of causal effect information, and NATURAL is a first step towards an automated pipeline to tap this resource.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We explore using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate application code that automates health insurance processes from text-based policies. We target blockchain-based smart contracts as they offer immutability, verifiability, scalability, and a trustless setting: any number of parties can use the smart contracts, and they need not have previously established trust relationships with each other. Our methodology generates outputs at increasing levels of technical detail: (1) textual summaries, (2) declarative decision logic, and (3) smart contract code with unit tests. We ascertain LLMs are good at the task (1), and the structured output is useful to validate tasks (2) and (3). Declarative languages (task 2) are often used to formalize healthcare policies, but their execution on blockchain is non-trivial. Hence, task (3) attempts to directly automate the process using smart contracts. To assess the LLM output, we propose completeness, soundness, clarity, syntax, and functioning code as metrics. Our evaluation employs three health insurance policies (scenarios) with increasing difficulty from Medicare's official booklet. Our evaluation uses GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-3.5 Turbo 16K, GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo and CodeLLaMA. Our findings confirm that LLMs perform quite well in generating textual summaries. Although outputs from tasks (2)-(3) are useful starting points, they require human oversight: in multiple cases, even "runnable" code will not yield sound results; the popularity of the target language affects the output quality; and more complex scenarios still seem a bridge too far. Nevertheless, our experiments demonstrate the promise of LLMs for translating textual process descriptions into smart contracts.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The vast accessibility of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images through online portals has propelled the research across various fields. This widespread use and easy availability have unfortunately made SAR data susceptible to malicious alterations, such as local editing applied to the images for inserting or covering the presence of sensitive targets. Vulnerability is further emphasized by the fact that most SAR products, despite their original complex nature, are often released as amplitude-only information, allowing even inexperienced attackers to edit and easily alter the pixel content. To contrast malicious manipulations, in the last years the forensic community has begun to dig into the SAR manipulation issue, proposing detectors that effectively localize the tampering traces in amplitude images. Nonetheless, in this paper we demonstrate that an expert practitioner can exploit the complex nature of SAR data to obscure any signs of manipulation within a locally altered amplitude image. We refer to this approach as a counter-forensic attack. To achieve the concealment of manipulation traces, the attacker can simulate a re-acquisition of the manipulated scene by the SAR system that initially generated the pristine image. In doing so, the attacker can obscure any evidence of manipulation, making it appear as if the image was legitimately produced by the system. We assess the effectiveness of the proposed counter-forensic approach across diverse scenarios, examining various manipulation operations. The obtained results indicate that our devised attack successfully eliminates traces of manipulation, deceiving even the most advanced forensic detectors.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This work introduces a new framework, ProtoSAM, for one-shot medical image segmentation. It combines the use of prototypical networks, known for few-shot segmentation, with SAM - a natural image foundation model. The method proposed creates an initial coarse segmentation mask using the ALPnet prototypical network, augmented with a DINOv2 encoder. Following the extraction of an initial mask, prompts are extracted, such as points and bounding boxes, which are then input into the Segment Anything Model (SAM). State-of-the-art results are shown on several medical image datasets and demonstrate automated segmentation capabilities using a single image example (one shot) with no need for fine-tuning of the foundation model.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Although most current large multimodal models (LMMs) can already understand photos of natural scenes and portraits, their understanding of abstract images, e.g., charts, maps, or layouts, and visual reasoning capabilities remains quite rudimentary. They often struggle with simple daily tasks, such as reading time from a clock, understanding a flowchart, or planning a route using a road map. In light of this, we design a multi-modal self-instruct, utilizing large language models and their code capabilities to synthesize massive abstract images and visual reasoning instructions across daily scenarios. Our strategy effortlessly creates a multimodal benchmark with 11,193 instructions for eight visual scenarios: charts, tables, simulated maps, dashboards, flowcharts, relation graphs, floor plans, and visual puzzles. \textbf{This benchmark, constructed with simple lines and geometric elements, exposes the shortcomings of most advanced LMMs} like Claude-3.5-Sonnet and GPT-4o in abstract image understanding, spatial relations reasoning, and visual element induction. Besides, to verify the quality of our synthetic data, we fine-tune an LMM using 62,476 synthetic chart, table and road map instructions. The results demonstrate improved chart understanding and map navigation performance, and also demonstrate potential benefits for other visual reasoning tasks.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present the Differentially Private Blockchain-Based Vertical Federal Learning (DP-BBVFL) algorithm that provides verifiability and privacy guarantees for decentralized applications. DP-BBVFL uses a smart contract to aggregate the feature representations, i.e., the embeddings, from clients transparently. We apply local differential privacy to provide privacy for embeddings stored on a blockchain, hence protecting the original data. We provide the first prototype application of differential privacy with blockchain for vertical federated learning. Our experiments with medical data show that DP-BBVFL achieves high accuracy with a tradeoff in training time due to on-chain aggregation. This innovative fusion of differential privacy and blockchain technology in DP-BBVFL could herald a new era of collaborative and trustworthy machine learning applications across several decentralized application domains.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) has advanced with the surge in phone photography demand, yet many existing methods neglect compression, a crucial concern for resource-constrained phone photography. Most LLIE methods overlook this, hindering their effectiveness. In this study, we investigate the effects of JPEG compression on low-light images and reveal substantial information loss caused by JPEG due to widespread low pixel values in dark areas. Hence, we propose the Compression-Aware Pre-trained Transformer (CAPformer), employing a novel pre-training strategy to learn lossless information from uncompressed low-light images. Additionally, the proposed Brightness-Guided Self-Attention (BGSA) mechanism enhances rational information gathering. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach in mitigating compression effects on LLIE, showcasing its potential for improving LLIE in resource-constrained scenarios.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has paved the way for the development of highly capable autonomous agents. However, existing multi-agent frameworks often struggle with integrating diverse capable third-party agents due to reliance on agents defined within their own ecosystems. They also face challenges in simulating distributed environments, as most frameworks are limited to single-device setups. Furthermore, these frameworks often rely on hard-coded communication pipelines, limiting their adaptability to dynamic task requirements. Inspired by the concept of the Internet, we propose the Internet of Agents (IoA), a novel framework that addresses these limitations by providing a flexible and scalable platform for LLM-based multi-agent collaboration. IoA introduces an agent integration protocol, an instant-messaging-like architecture design, and dynamic mechanisms for agent teaming and conversation flow control. Through extensive experiments on general assistant tasks, embodied AI tasks, and retrieval-augmented generation benchmarks, we demonstrate that IoA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, showcasing its ability to facilitate effective collaboration among heterogeneous agents. IoA represents a step towards linking diverse agents in an Internet-like environment, where agents can seamlessly collaborate to achieve greater intelligence and capabilities.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, protect, attack, robust, explainability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In-situ sensing, in conjunction with learning models, presents a unique opportunity to address persistent defect issues in Additive Manufacturing (AM) processes. However, this integration introduces significant data privacy concerns, such as data leakage, sensor data compromise, and model inversion attacks, revealing critical details about part design, material composition, and machine parameters. Differential Privacy (DP) models, which inject noise into data under mathematical guarantees, offer a nuanced balance between data utility and privacy by obscuring traces of sensing data. However, the introduction of noise into learning models, often functioning as black boxes, complicates the prediction of how specific noise levels impact model accuracy. This study introduces the Differential Privacy-HyperDimensional computing (DP-HD) framework, leveraging the explainability of the vector symbolic paradigm to predict the noise impact on the accuracy of in-situ monitoring, safeguarding sensitive data while maintaining operational efficiency. Experimental results on real-world high-speed melt pool data of AM for detecting overhang anomalies demonstrate that DP-HD achieves superior operational efficiency, prediction accuracy, and robust privacy protection, outperforming state-of-the-art Machine Learning (ML) models. For example, when implementing the same level of privacy protection (with a privacy budget set at 1), our model achieved an accuracy of 94.43\%, surpassing the performance of traditional models such as ResNet50 (52.30\%), GoogLeNet (23.85\%), AlexNet (55.78\%), DenseNet201 (69.13\%), and EfficientNet B2 (40.81\%). Notably, DP-HD maintains high performance under substantial noise additions designed to enhance privacy, unlike current models that suffer significant accuracy declines under high privacy constraints.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>When asked to summarize articles or answer questions given a passage, large language models (LLMs) can hallucinate details and respond with unsubstantiated answers that are inaccurate with respect to the input context. This paper describes a simple approach for detecting such contextual hallucinations. We hypothesize that contextual hallucinations are related to the extent to which an LLM attends to information in the provided context versus its own generations. Based on this intuition, we propose a simple hallucination detection model whose input features are given by the ratio of attention weights on the context versus newly generated tokens (for each attention head). We find that a linear classifier based on these lookback ratio features is as effective as a richer detector that utilizes the entire hidden states of an LLM or a text-based entailment model. The lookback ratio-based detector -- Lookback Lens -- is found to transfer across tasks and even models, allowing a detector that is trained on a 7B model to be applied (without retraining) to a larger 13B model. We further apply this detector to mitigate contextual hallucinations, and find that a simple classifier-guided decoding approach is able to reduce the amount of hallucination, for example by 9.6% in the XSum summarization task.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While personalized text-to-image generation has enabled the learning of a single concept from multiple images, a more practical yet challenging scenario involves learning multiple concepts within a single image. However, existing works tackling this scenario heavily rely on extensive human annotations. In this paper, we introduce a novel task named Unsupervised Concept Extraction (UCE) that considers an unsupervised setting without any human knowledge of the concepts. Given an image that contains multiple concepts, the task aims to extract and recreate individual concepts solely relying on the existing knowledge from pretrained diffusion models. To achieve this, we present ConceptExpress that tackles UCE by unleashing the inherent capabilities of pretrained diffusion models in two aspects. Specifically, a concept localization approach automatically locates and disentangles salient concepts by leveraging spatial correspondence from diffusion self-attention; and based on the lookup association between a concept and a conceptual token, a concept-wise optimization process learns discriminative tokens that represent each individual concept. Finally, we establish an evaluation protocol tailored for the UCE task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConceptExpress is a promising solution to the UCE task.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Artificial intelligence has become a crucial tool for medical image analysis. As an advanced cerebral angiography technique, Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) poses a challenge where the radiation dose to humans is proportional to the image count. By reducing images and using AI interpolation instead, the radiation can be cut significantly. However, DSA images present more complex motion and structural features than natural scenes, making interpolation more challenging. We propose MoSt-DSA, the first work that uses deep learning for DSA frame interpolation. Unlike natural scene Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) methods that extract unclear or coarse-grained features, we devise a general module that models motion and structural context interactions between frames in an efficient full convolution manner by adjusting optimal context range and transforming contexts into linear functions. Benefiting from this, MoSt-DSA is also the first method that directly achieves any number of interpolations at any time steps with just one forward pass during both training and testing. We conduct extensive comparisons with 7 representative VFI models for interpolating 1 to 3 frames, MoSt-DSA demonstrates robust results across 470 DSA image sequences (each typically 152 images), with average SSIM over 0.93, average PSNR over 38 (standard deviations of less than 0.030 and 3.6, respectively), comprehensively achieving state-of-the-art performance in accuracy, speed, visual effect, and memory usage.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Training large language models (LLMs) in low-resource languages such as Hebrew poses unique challenges. In this paper, we introduce DictaLM2.0 and DictaLM2.0-Instruct, two LLMs derived from the Mistral model, trained on a substantial corpus of approximately 200 billion tokens in both Hebrew and English. Adapting a pre-trained model to a new language involves specialized techniques that differ significantly from training a model from scratch or further training existing models on well-resourced languages such as English. We outline these novel training methodologies, which facilitate effective learning and adaptation to the linguistic properties of Hebrew. Additionally, we fine-tuned DictaLM2.0-Instruct on a comprehensive instruct dataset to enhance its performance on task-specific instructions. To rigorously evaluate our models, we introduce a new benchmark suite for Hebrew LLM evaluation, covering a diverse set of tasks including Question Answering, Sentiment Analysis, Winograd Schema Challenge, Translation, and Summarization. Our work not only addresses the intricacies of training LLMs in low-resource languages but also proposes a framework that can be leveraged for adapting other LLMs to various non-English languages, contributing to the broader field of multilingual NLP.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In developing efficient optimization algorithms, it is crucial to account for communication constraints -- a significant challenge in modern federated learning settings. The best-known communication complexity among non-accelerated algorithms is achieved by DANE, a distributed proximal-point algorithm that solves local subproblems in each iteration and that can exploit second-order similarity among individual functions. However, to achieve such communication efficiency, the accuracy requirement for solving the local subproblems is slightly sub-optimal. Inspired by the hybrid projection-proximal point method, in this work, we i) propose a novel distributed algorithm S-DANE. This method adopts a more stabilized prox-center in the proximal step compared with DANE, and matches its deterministic communication complexity. Moreover, the accuracy condition of the subproblem is milder, leading to enhanced local computation efficiency. Furthermore, it supports partial client participation and arbitrary stochastic local solvers, making it more attractive in practice. We further ii) accelerate S-DANE, and show that the resulting algorithm achieves the best-known communication complexity among all existing methods for distributed convex optimization, with the same improved local computation efficiency as S-DANE.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>protect</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Evaluating the degree of reproduction of copyright-protected content by language models (LMs) is of significant interest to the AI and legal communities. Although both literal and non-literal similarities are considered by courts when assessing the degree of reproduction, prior research has focused only on literal similarities. To bridge this gap, we introduce CopyBench, a benchmark designed to measure both literal and non-literal copying in LM generations. Using copyrighted fiction books as text sources, we provide automatic evaluation protocols to assess literal and non-literal copying, balanced against the model utility in terms of the ability to recall facts from the copyrighted works and generate fluent completions. We find that, although literal copying is relatively rare, two types of non-literal copying -- event copying and character copying -- occur even in models as small as 7B parameters. Larger models demonstrate significantly more copying, with literal copying rates increasing from 0.2% to 10.5% and non-literal copying from 2.3% to 6.9% when comparing Llama3-8B and 70B models, respectively. We further evaluate the effectiveness of current strategies for mitigating copying and show that (1) training-time alignment can reduce literal copying but may increase non-literal copying, and (2) current inference-time mitigation methods primarily reduce literal but not non-literal copying.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This work presents a Fully BInarized Large Language Model (FBI-LLM), demonstrating for the first time how to train a large-scale binary language model from scratch (not the partial binary or ternary LLM like BitNet b1.58) to match the performance of its full-precision counterparts (e.g., FP16 or BF16) in transformer-based LLMs. It achieves this by employing an autoregressive distillation (AD) loss with maintaining equivalent model dimensions (130M, 1.3B, 7B) and training data volume as regular LLM pretraining, while delivering competitive results in terms of perplexity and task-specific effectiveness. Intriguingly, by analyzing the training trajectory, we find that the pretrained weight is not necessary for training binarized LLMs from scratch. This research encourages a new computational framework and may facilitate the future design of specialized hardware tailored for fully 1-bit LLMs. We make all models, code, and training dataset fully accessible and transparent to support further research (Code: this https URL.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The pervasive deployment of Large Language Models-LLMs in various sectors often neglects the nuanced requirements of individuals and small organizations, who benefit more from models precisely tailored to their specific business contexts rather than those with broadly superior general capabilities. This work introduces \textbf{AnyTaskTune}, a novel fine-tuning methodology coined as \textbf{Task-Fine-Tune}, specifically developed to elevate model performance on a diverse array of domain-specific tasks. This method involves a meticulous process to identify and define targeted sub-tasks within a domain, followed by the creation of specialized enhancement datasets for fine-tuning, thereby optimizing task-specific model performance. We conducted comprehensive fine-tuning experiments not only in the legal domain for tasks such as keyword extraction and sentence prediction but across over twenty different sub-tasks derived from the domains of finance, healthcare, law, psychology, consumer services, and human resources. To substantiate our approach and facilitate community engagement, we will open-source these bilingual task datasets. Our findings demonstrate that models fine-tuned using the \textbf{Task-Fine-Tune} methodology not only achieve superior performance on these specific tasks but also significantly outperform models with higher general capabilities in their respective domains.
