<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Concepts, both abstract and concrete, elicit a distribution of association strengths across perceptual color space, which influence aspects of visual cognition ranging from object recognition to interpretation of information visualizations. While prior work has hypothesized that color-concept associations may be learned from the cross-modal statistical structure of experience, it has been unclear whether natural environments possess such structure or, if so, whether learning systems are capable of discovering and exploiting it without strong prior constraints. We addressed these questions by investigating the ability of GPT-4, a multimodal large language model, to estimate human-like color-concept associations without any additional training. Starting with human color-concept association ratings for 71 color set spanning perceptual color space (\texttt{UW-71}) and concepts that varied in abstractness, we assessed how well association ratings generated by GPT-4 could predict human ratings. GPT-4 ratings were correlated with human ratings, with performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods for automatically estimating color-concept associations from images. Variability in GPT-4's performance across concepts could be explained by specificity of the concept's color-concept association distribution. This study suggests that high-order covariances between language and perception, as expressed in the natural environment of the internet, contain sufficient information to support learning of human-like color-concept associations, and provides an existence proof that a learning system can encode such associations without initial constraints. The work further shows that GPT-4 can be used to efficiently estimate distributions of color associations for a broad range of concepts, potentially serving as a critical tool for designing effective and intuitive information visualizations.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a key element in their continuous improvement process and many benchmarks have been developed to assess the performance of LLMs in different tasks and topics. As LLMs become adopted worldwide, evaluating them in languages other than English is increasingly important. However, most LLM benchmarks are simply translated using an automated tool and then run in the target language. This means that the results depend not only on the LLM performance in that language but also on the quality of the translation. In this paper, we consider the case of the well-known Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark. Selected categories of the benchmark are translated into Spanish using Azure Translator and ChatGPT4 and run on ChatGPT4. Next, the results are processed to identify the test items that produce different answers in Spanish and English. Those are then analyzed manually to understand if the automatic translation caused the change. The results show that a significant fraction of the failing items can be attributed to mistakes in the translation of the benchmark. These results make a strong case for improving benchmarks in languages other than English by at least revising the translations of the items and preferably by adapting the tests to the target language by experts.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Cyberbullying is a significant concern intricately linked to technology that can find resolution through technological means. Despite its prevalence, technology also provides solutions to mitigate cyberbullying. To address growing concerns regarding the adverse impact of cyberbullying on individuals' online experiences, various online platforms and researchers are actively adopting measures to enhance the safety of digital environments. While researchers persist in crafting detection models to counteract or minimize cyberbullying, malicious actors are deploying adversarial techniques to circumvent these detection methods. This paper focuses on detecting cyberbullying in adversarial attack content within social networking site text data, specifically emphasizing hate speech. Utilizing a deep learning-based approach with a correction algorithm, this paper yielded significant results. An LSTM model with a fixed epoch of 100 demonstrated remarkable performance, achieving high accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC scores of 87.57%, 88.73%, 87.57%, 88.15%, and 91% respectively. Additionally, the LSTM model's performance surpassed that of previous studies.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In computer animation, driving a simulated character with lifelike motion is challenging. Current generative models, though able to generalize to diverse motions, often pose challenges to the responsiveness of end-user control. To address these issues, we introduce RACon: Retrieval-Augmented Simulated Character Locomotion Control. Our end-to-end hierarchical reinforcement learning method utilizes a retriever and a motion controller. The retriever searches motion experts from a user-specified database in a task-oriented fashion, which boosts the responsiveness to the user's control. The selected motion experts and the manipulation signal are then transferred to the controller to drive the simulated character. In addition, a retrieval-augmented discriminator is designed to stabilize the training process. Our method surpasses existing techniques in both quality and quantity in locomotion control, as demonstrated in our empirical study. Moreover, by switching extensive databases for retrieval, it can adapt to distinctive motion types at run time.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Utilizing user profiles to personalize Large Language Models (LLMs) has been shown to enhance the performance on a wide range of tasks. However, the precise role of user profiles and their effect mechanism on LLMs remains unclear. This study first confirms that the effectiveness of user profiles is primarily due to personalization information rather than semantic information. Furthermore, we investigate how user profiles affect the personalization of LLMs. Within the user profile, we reveal that it is the historical personalized response produced or approved by users that plays a pivotal role in personalizing LLMs. This discovery unlocks the potential of LLMs to incorporate a greater number of user profiles within the constraints of limited input length. As for the position of user profiles, we observe that user profiles integrated into different positions of the input context do not contribute equally to personalization. Instead, where the user profile that is closer to the beginning affects more on the personalization of LLMs. Our findings reveal the role of user profiles for the personalization of LLMs, and showcase how incorporating user profiles impacts performance providing insight to leverage user profiles effectively.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advancements in large language models have revolutionized information access, as these models harness data available on the web to address complex queries, becoming the preferred information source for many users. In certain cases, queries are about publicly available data, which can be effectively answered with data visualizations. In this paper, we investigate the ability of large language models to provide accurate data and relevant visualizations in response to such queries. Specifically, we investigate the ability of GPT-3 and GPT-4 to generate visualizations with dataless prompts, where no data accompanies the query. We evaluate the results of the models by comparing them to visualization cheat sheets created by visualization experts.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Humans are prone to cognitive distortions -- biased thinking patterns that lead to exaggerated responses to specific stimuli, albeit in very different contexts. This paper demonstrates that advanced Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) exhibit similar tendencies. While these models are designed to respond queries under safety mechanism, they sometimes reject harmless queries in the presence of certain visual stimuli, disregarding the benign nature of their contexts. As the initial step in investigating this behavior, we identify three types of stimuli that trigger the oversensitivity of existing MLLMs: Exaggerated Risk, Negated Harm, and Counterintuitive Interpretation. To systematically evaluate MLLMs' oversensitivity to these stimuli, we propose the Multimodal OverSenSitivity Benchmark (MOSSBench). This toolkit consists of 300 manually collected benign multimodal queries, cross-verified by third-party reviewers (AMT). Empirical studies using MOSSBench on 20 MLLMs reveal several insights: (1). Oversensitivity is prevalent among SOTA MLLMs, with refusal rates reaching up to 76% for harmless queries. (2). Safer models are more oversensitive: increasing safety may inadvertently raise caution and conservatism in the model's responses. (3). Different types of stimuli tend to cause errors at specific stages -- perception, intent reasoning, and safety judgement -- in the response process of MLLMs. These findings highlight the need for refined safety mechanisms that balance caution with contextually appropriate responses, improving the reliability of MLLMs in real-world applications.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have unlocked the potential for generating high-quality game commentary. However, producing insightful and engaging commentary for complex games with incomplete information remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we introduce a novel commentary method that combine Reinforcement Learning (RL) and LLMs, tailored specifically for the Chinese card game \textit{Guandan}. Our system leverages RL to generate intricate card-playing scenarios and employs LLMs to generate corresponding commentary text, effectively emulating the strategic analysis and narrative prowess of professional commentators. The framework comprises a state commentary guide, a Theory of Mind (ToM)-based strategy analyzer, and a style retrieval module, which seamlessly collaborate to deliver detailed and context-relevant game commentary in the Chinese language environment. We empower LLMs with ToM capabilities and refine both retrieval and information filtering mechanisms. This facilitates the generation of personalized commentary content. Our experimental results showcase the substantial enhancement in performance achieved by the proposed commentary framework when applied to open-source LLMs, surpassing the performance of GPT-4 across multiple evaluation metrics.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The context window within a transformer provides a form of active memory for the current task, which can be useful for few-shot learning and conditional generation, both which depend heavily on previous context tokens. However, as the context length grows, the computational cost increases quadratically. Recent works have shown that saving a few initial tokens along with a fixed-sized sliding window leads to stable streaming generation with linear complexity in transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs). However, they make suboptimal use of the fixed window by naively evicting all tokens unconditionally from the key-value (KV) cache once they reach the end of the window, resulting in tokens being forgotten and no longer able to affect subsequent predictions. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel mechanism for storing longer sliding window contexts with the same total cache size by keeping separate cascading sub-cache buffers whereby each subsequent buffer conditionally accepts a fraction of the relatively more important tokens evicted from the previous buffer. Our method results in a dynamic KV cache that can store tokens from the more distant past than a fixed, static sliding window approach. Our experiments show improvements of 5.6% on long context generation (LongBench), 1.2% in streaming perplexity (PG19), and 0.6% in language understanding (MMLU STEM) using LLMs given the same fixed cache size. Additionally, we provide an efficient implementation that improves the KV cache latency from 1.33ms per caching operation to 0.54ms, a 59% speedup over previous work.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Concept Drift is a phenomenon in which the underlying data distribution and statistical properties of a target domain change over time, leading to a degradation of the model's performance. Consequently, models deployed in production require continuous monitoring through drift detection techniques. Most drift detection methods to date are supervised, i.e., based on ground-truth labels. However, true labels are usually not available in many real-world scenarios. Although recent efforts have been made to develop unsupervised methods, they often lack the required accuracy, have a complexity that makes real-time implementation in production environments difficult, or are unable to effectively characterize drift. To address these challenges, we propose DriftLens, an unsupervised real-time concept drift detection framework. It works on unstructured data by exploiting the distribution distances of deep learning representations. DriftLens can also provide drift characterization by analyzing each label separately. A comprehensive experimental evaluation is presented with multiple deep learning classifiers for text, image, and speech. Results show that (i) DriftLens performs better than previous methods in detecting drift in $11/13$ use cases; (ii) it runs at least 5 times faster; (iii) its detected drift value is very coherent with the amount of drift (correlation $\geq 0.85$); (iv) it is robust to parameter changes.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Visual attention modeling, important for interpreting and prioritizing visual stimuli, plays a significant role in applications such as marketing, multimedia, and robotics. Traditional saliency prediction models, especially those based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Transformers, achieve notable success by leveraging large-scale annotated datasets. However, the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models that use Transformers are computationally expensive. Additionally, separate models are often required for each image type, lacking a unified approach. In this paper, we propose Saliency Unification through Mamba (SUM), a novel approach that integrates the efficient long-range dependency modeling of Mamba with U-Net to provide a unified model for diverse image types. Using a novel Conditional Visual State Space (C-VSS) block, SUM dynamically adapts to various image types, including natural scenes, web pages, and commercial imagery, ensuring universal applicability across different data types. Our comprehensive evaluations across five benchmarks demonstrate that SUM seamlessly adapts to different visual characteristics and consistently outperforms existing models. These results position SUM as a versatile and powerful tool for advancing visual attention modeling, offering a robust solution universally applicable across different types of visual content.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Active Voltage Control (AVC) on the Power Distribution Networks (PDNs) aims to stabilize the voltage levels to ensure efficient and reliable operation of power systems. With the increasing integration of distributed energy resources, recent efforts have explored employing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) techniques to realize effective AVC. Existing methods mainly focus on the acquisition of short-term AVC strategies, i.e., only learning AVC within the short-term training trajectories of a singular diurnal cycle. However, due to the dynamic nature of load demands and renewable energy, the operation states of real-world PDNs may exhibit significant distribution shifts across varying timescales (e.g., daily and seasonal changes). This can render those short-term strategies suboptimal or even obsolete when performing continuous AVC over extended periods. In this paper, we propose a novel temporal prototype-aware learning method, abbreviated as TPA, to learn time-adaptive AVC under short-term training trajectories. At the heart of TPA are two complementary components, namely multi-scale dynamic encoder and temporal prototype-aware policy, that can be readily incorporated into various MARL methods. The former component integrates a stacked transformer network to learn underlying temporal dependencies at different timescales of the PDNs, while the latter implements a learnable prototype matching mechanism to construct a dedicated AVC policy that can dynamically adapt to the evolving operation states. Experimental results on the AVC benchmark with different PDN sizes demonstrate that the proposed TPA surpasses the state-of-the-art counterparts not only in terms of control performance but also by offering model transferability.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Science and technology have a growing need for effective mechanisms that ensure reliable, controlled performance from black-box machine learning algorithms. These performance guarantees should ideally hold conditionally on the input-that is the performance guarantees should hold, at least approximately, no matter what the input. However, beyond stylized discrete groupings such as ethnicity and gender, the right notion of conditioning can be difficult to define. For example, in problems such as image segmentation, we want the uncertainty to reflect the intrinsic difficulty of the test sample, but this may be difficult to capture via a conditioning event. Building on the recent work of Gibbs et al. [2023], we propose a methodology for achieving approximate conditional control of statistical risks-the expected value of loss functions-by adapting to the difficulty of test samples. Our framework goes beyond traditional conditional risk control based on user-provided conditioning events to the algorithmic, data-driven determination of appropriate function classes for conditioning. We apply this framework to various regression and segmentation tasks, enabling finer-grained control over model performance and demonstrating that by continuously monitoring and adjusting these parameters, we can achieve superior precision compared to conventional risk-control methods.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Objectives: The objectives of this narrative review are to summarize the current state of AI applications in neuroimaging for early Alzheimer's disease (AD) prediction and to highlight the potential of AI techniques in improving early AD diagnosis, prognosis, and management. Methods: We conducted a narrative review of studies using AI techniques applied to neuroimaging data for early AD prediction. We examined single-modality studies using structural MRI and PET imaging, as well as multi-modality studies integrating multiple neuroimaging techniques and biomarkers. Furthermore, they reviewed longitudinal studies that model AD progression and identify individuals at risk of rapid decline. Results: Single-modality studies using structural MRI and PET imaging have demonstrated high accuracy in classifying AD and predicting progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD. Multi-modality studies, integrating multiple neuroimaging techniques and biomarkers, have shown improved performance and robustness compared to single-modality approaches. Longitudinal studies have highlighted the value of AI in modeling AD progression and identifying individuals at risk of rapid decline. However, challenges remain in data standardization, model interpretability, generalizability, clinical integration, and ethical considerations. Conclusion: AI techniques applied to neuroimaging data have the potential to improve early AD diagnosis, prognosis, and management. Addressing challenges related to data standardization, model interpretability, generalizability, clinical integration, and ethical considerations is crucial for realizing the full potential of AI in AD research and clinical practice. Collaborative efforts among researchers, clinicians, and regulatory agencies are needed to develop reliable, robust, and ethical AI tools that can benefit AD patients and society.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) provide a fast alternative to traditional gradient-based learning in neural networks, offering rapid training and robust generalization capabilities. Its theoretical basis shows its universal approximation capability. We explore the application of ELMs for the task of Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction, which is largely unexplored by ELMs due to the high dimensionality of the problem. We introduce an ELM-based model enhanced with embedding layers to improve the performance on CTR tasks, which is a novel addition to the field. Experimental results on benchmark datasets, including Avazu and Criteo, demonstrate that our proposed ELM with embeddings achieves competitive F1 results while significantly reducing training time compared to state-of-the-art models such as Masknet. Our findings show that ELMs can be useful for CTR prediction, especially when fast training is needed.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Symbolic regression (SR) methods attempt to learn mathematical expressions that approximate the behavior of an observed system. However, when dealing with multivariate systems, they often fail to identify the functional form that explains the relationship between each variable and the system's response. To begin to address this, we propose an explainable neural SR method that generates univariate symbolic skeletons that aim to explain how each variable influences the system's response. By analyzing multiple sets of data generated artificially, where one input variable varies while others are fixed, relationships are modeled separately for each input variable. The response of such artificial data sets is estimated using a regression neural network (NN). Finally, the multiple sets of input-response pairs are processed by a pre-trained Multi-Set Transformer that solves a problem we termed Multi-Set Skeleton Prediction and outputs a univariate symbolic skeleton. Thus, such skeletons represent explanations of the function approximated by the regression NN. Experimental results demonstrate that this method learns skeleton expressions matching the underlying functions and outperforms two GP-based and two neural SR methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent works have shown that transformers can solve contextual reasoning tasks by internally executing computational graphs called circuits. Circuits often use attention to logically match information from subspaces of the representation, e.g. using position-in-sequence to identify the previous token. In this work, we consider a semantic subspace to be any independent subspace of the latent representation that can fully determine an attention distribution. We show that Pre-Norm, the placement of normalisation layer used by state-of-the-art transformers, violates this ability unless the model learns a strict representation structure of orthogonal spheres. This is because it causes linear subspaces to interfere through their common normalisation factor. Theoretically, we analyse circuit stability by modelling this interference as random noise on the $L_2$-norms of the query/key/value vectors, predicting a phenomenon of circuit collapse when sparse-attention shifts to a different token. Empirically, we investigate the sensitivity of real-world models trained for mathematical addition, observing a 1% rate of circuit collapse when the norms are artificially perturbed by $\lesssim$10%. We contrast Pre-Norm with QKV-Norm, which places normalisation after the attention head's linear operators. Theoretically this relaxes the representational constraints. Empirically we observe comparable in-distribution but worse out-of-distribution performance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The emergence of large-scale pre-trained models has heightened their application in various downstream tasks, yet deployment is a challenge in environments with limited computational resources. Knowledge distillation has emerged as a solution in such scenarios, whereby knowledge from large teacher models is transferred into smaller student' models, but this is a non-trivial process that traditionally requires technical expertise in AI/ML. To address these challenges, this paper presents InFiConD, a novel framework that leverages visual concepts to implement the knowledge distillation process and enable subsequent no-code fine-tuning of student models. We develop a novel knowledge distillation pipeline based on extracting text-aligned visual concepts from a concept corpus using multimodal models, and construct highly interpretable linear student models based on visual concepts that mimic a teacher model in a response-based manner. InFiConD's interface allows users to interactively fine-tune the student model by manipulating concept influences directly in the user interface. We validate InFiConD via a robust usage scenario and user study. Our findings indicate that InFiConD's human-in-the-loop and visualization-driven approach enables users to effectively create and analyze student models, understand how knowledge is transferred, and efficiently perform fine-tuning operations. We discuss how this work highlights the potential of interactive and visual methods in making knowledge distillation and subsequent no-code fine-tuning more accessible and adaptable to a wider range of users with domain-specific demands.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Current representations used in reasoning steps of large language models can mostly be categorized into two main types: (1) natural language, which is difficult to verify; and (2) non-natural language, usually programming code, which is difficult for people who are unfamiliar with coding to read. In this paper, we propose to use a semi-structured form to represent reasoning steps of large language models. Specifically, we use relation tuples, which are not only human-readable but also machine-friendly and easier to verify than natural language. We implement a framework that includes three main components: (1) introducing relation tuples into the reasoning steps of large language models; (2) implementing an automatic verification process of reasoning steps with a local code interpreter based on relation tuples; and (3) integrating a simple and effective dynamic feedback mechanism, which we found helpful for self-improvement of large language models. The experimental results on various arithmetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in improving the arithmetic reasoning ability of large language models.

In this paper, we explore the balance between preserving data usefulness and ensuring robust privacy safeguards, since regulations like the European GDPR shape how personal information must be handled. We share our method for manually pseudonymizing a multilingual radicalization dataset, ensuring performance comparable to the original data. Furthermore, we highlight the importance of establishing comprehensive guidelines for processing sensitive NLP data by sharing our complete pseudonymization process, our guidelines, the challenges we encountered as well as the resulting dataset.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Video Moment Retrieval (VMR) aims to localize a specific temporal segment within an untrimmed long video given a natural language query. Existing methods often suffer from inadequate training annotations, i.e., the sentence typically matches with a fraction of the prominent video content in the foreground with limited wording diversity. This intrinsic modality imbalance leaves a considerable portion of visual information remaining unaligned with text. It confines the cross-modal alignment knowledge within the scope of a limited text corpus, thereby leading to sub-optimal visual-textual modeling and poor generalizability. By leveraging the visual-textual understanding capability of multi-modal large language models (MLLM), in this work, we take an MLLM as a video narrator to generate plausible textual descriptions of the video, thereby mitigating the modality imbalance and boosting the temporal localization. To effectively maintain temporal sensibility for localization, we design to get text narratives for each certain video timestamp and construct a structured text paragraph with time information, which is temporally aligned with the visual content. Then we perform cross-modal feature merging between the temporal-aware narratives and corresponding video temporal features to produce semantic-enhanced video representation sequences for query localization. Subsequently, we introduce a uni-modal narrative-query matching mechanism, which encourages the model to extract complementary information from contextual cohesive descriptions for improved retrieval. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks show the effectiveness and generalizability of our proposed method.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, explainability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In Explainable AI, rule extraction translates model knowledge into logical rules, such as IF-THEN statements, crucial for understanding patterns learned by black-box models. This could significantly aid in fields like disease diagnosis, disease progression estimation, or drug discovery. However, such application domains often contain imbalanced data, with the class of interest underrepresented. Existing methods inevitably compromise the performance of rules for the minor class to maximise the overall performance. As the first attempt in this field, we propose a model-agnostic approach for extracting rules from specific subgroups of data, featuring automatic rule generation for numerical features. This method enhances the regional explainability of machine learning models and offers wider applicability compared to existing methods. We additionally introduce a new method for selecting features to compose rules, reducing computational costs in high-dimensional spaces. Experiments across various datasets and models demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this work, we propose a federated dynamical low-rank training (FeDLRT) scheme to reduce client compute and communication costs - two significant performance bottlenecks in horizontal federated learning. Our method builds upon dynamical low-rank splitting schemes for manifold-constrained optimization to create a global low-rank basis of network weights, which enables client training on a small coefficient matrix. A consistent global low-rank basis allows us to incorporate a variance correction scheme and prove global loss descent and convergence to a stationary point. Dynamic augmentation and truncation of the low-rank bases automatically optimizes computing and communication resource utilization. We demonstrate the efficiency of FeDLRT in an array of computer vision benchmarks and show a reduction of client compute and communication costs by up to an order of magnitude with minimal impacts on global accuracy.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>CTBench is introduced as a benchmark to assess language models (LMs) in aiding clinical study design. Given study-specific metadata, CTBench evaluates AI models' ability to determine the baseline features of a clinical trial (CT), which include demographic and relevant features collected at the trial's start from all participants. These baseline features, typically presented in CT publications (often as Table 1), are crucial for characterizing study cohorts and validating results. Baseline features, including confounders and covariates, are also necessary for accurate treatment effect estimation in studies involving observational data. CTBench consists of two datasets: "CT-Repo," containing baseline features from 1,690 clinical trials sourced from this http URL, and "CT-Pub," a subset of 100 trials with more comprehensive baseline features gathered from relevant publications. Two LM-based evaluation methods are developed to compare the actual baseline feature lists against LM-generated responses. "ListMatch-LM" and "ListMatch-BERT" use GPT-4o and BERT scores (at various thresholds), respectively, for evaluation. To establish baseline results, advanced prompt engineering techniques using LLaMa3-70B-Instruct and GPT-4o in zero-shot and three-shot learning settings are applied to generate potential baseline features. The performance of GPT-4o as an evaluator is validated through human-in-the-loop evaluations on the CT-Pub dataset, where clinical experts confirm matches between actual and LM-generated features. The results highlight a promising direction with significant potential for improvement, positioning CTBench as a useful tool for advancing research on AI in CT design and potentially enhancing the efficacy and robustness of CTs.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) is a machine learning paradigm for learning from vertically partitioned data (i.e. features for each input are distributed across multiple "guest" clients and an aggregating "host" server owns labels) without communicating raw data. Traditionally, VFL involves an "entity resolution" phase where the host identifies and serializes the unique entities known to all guests. This is followed by private set intersection to find common entities, and an "entity alignment" step to ensure all guests are always processing the same entity's data. However, using only data of entities from the intersection means guests discard potentially useful data. Besides, the effect on privacy is dubious and these operations are computationally expensive. We propose a novel approach that eliminates the need for set intersection and entity alignment in categorical tasks. Our Entity Augmentation technique generates meaningful labels for activations sent to the host, regardless of their originating entity, enabling efficient VFL without explicit entity alignment. With limited overlap between training data, this approach performs substantially better (e.g. with 5% overlap, 48.1% vs 69.48% test accuracy on CIFAR-10). In fact, thanks to the regularizing effect, our model performs marginally better even with 100% overlap.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we describe the extraction of all the location entries from a prominent Swedish encyclopedia from the early 20th century, the \textit{Nordisk Familjebok} `Nordic Family Book.' We focused on the second edition called \textit{Uggleupplagan}, which comprises 38 volumes and over 182,000 articles. This makes it one of the most extensive Swedish encyclopedias. Using a classifier, we first determined the category of the entries. We found that approximately 22 percent of them were locations. We applied a named entity recognition to these entries and we linked them to Wikidata. Wikidata enabled us to extract their precise geographic locations resulting in almost 18,000 valid coordinates. We then analyzed the distribution of these locations and the entry selection process. It showed a higher density within Sweden, Germany, and the United Kingdom. The paper sheds light on the selection and representation of geographic information in the \textit{Nordisk Familjebok}, providing insights into historical and societal perspectives. It also paves the way for future investigations into entry selection in different time periods and comparative analyses among various encyclopedias.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Radiology Report Generation (RRG) has achieved significant progress with the advancements of multimodal generative models. However, the evaluation in the domain suffers from a lack of fair and robust metrics. We reveal that, high performance on RRG with existing lexical-based metrics (e.g. BLEU) might be more of a mirage - a model can get a high BLEU only by learning the template of reports. This has become an urgent problem for RRG due to the highly patternized nature of these reports. In this work, we un-intuitively approach this problem by proposing the Layman's RRG framework, a layman's terms-based dataset, evaluation and training framework that systematically improves RRG with day-to-day language. We first contribute the translated Layman's terms dataset. Building upon the dataset, we then propose a semantics-based evaluation method, which is proved to mitigate the inflated numbers of BLEU and provides fairer evaluation. Last, we show that training on the layman's terms dataset encourages models to focus on the semantics of the reports, as opposed to overfitting to learning the report templates. We reveal a promising scaling law between the number of training examples and semantics gain provided by our dataset, compared to the inverse pattern brought by the original formats.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Dental panoramic radiographs offer vast diagnostic opportunities, but training supervised deep learning networks for automatic analysis of those radiology images is hampered by a shortage of labeled data. Here, a different perspective on this problem is introduced. A semi-supervised learning framework is proposed to classify thirteen dental conditions on panoramic radiographs, with a particular emphasis on teeth. Large language models were explored to annotate the most common dental conditions based on dental reports. Additionally, a masked autoencoder was employed to pre-train the classification neural network, and a Vision Transformer was used to leverage the unlabeled data. The analyses were validated using two of the most extensive datasets in the literature, comprising 8,795 panoramic radiographs and 8,029 paired reports and images. Encouragingly, the results consistently met or surpassed the baseline metrics for the Matthews correlation coefficient. A comparison of the proposed solution with human practitioners, supported by statistical analysis, highlighted its effectiveness and performance limitations; based on the degree of agreement among specialists, the solution demonstrated an accuracy level comparable to that of a junior specialist.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable abilities in diverse natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The LLMs generally undergo supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by preference alignment to be usable in downstream applications. However, this sequential training pipeline leads to alignment tax that degrades the LLM performance. This paper introduces PAFT, a new PArallel training paradigm for effective LLM Fine-Tuning, which independently performs SFT and preference alignment (e.g., DPO and ORPO, etc.) with the same pre-trained model on respective datasets. The model produced by SFT and the model from preference alignment are then merged into a final model by parameter fusing for use in downstream applications. This work reveals important findings that preference alignment like DPO naturally results in a sparse model while SFT leads to a natural dense model which needs to be sparsified for effective model merging. This paper introduces an effective interference resolution which reduces the redundancy by sparsifying the delta parameters. The LLM resulted from the new training paradigm achieved Rank #1 on the HuggingFace Open LLM Leaderboard. Comprehensive evaluation shows the effectiveness of the parallel training paradigm.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As an emerging interpretable technique, Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) adopt neural networks to individually learn non-linear functions for each feature, which are then combined through a linear model for final predictions. Although GAMs can explain deep neural networks (DNNs) at the feature level, they require large numbers of model parameters and are prone to overfitting, making them hard to train and scale. Additionally, in real-world datasets with many features, the interpretability of feature-based explanations diminishes for humans. To tackle these issues, recent research has shifted towards concept-based interpretable methods. These approaches try to integrate concept learning as an intermediate step before making predictions, explaining the predictions in terms of human-understandable concepts. However, these methods require domain experts to extensively label concepts with relevant names and their ground-truth values. In response, we propose CAT, a novel interpretable Concept-bAsed Taylor additive model to simply this process. CAT does not have to require domain experts to annotate concepts and their ground-truth values. Instead, it only requires users to simply categorize input features into broad groups, which can be easily accomplished through a quick metadata review. Specifically, CAT first embeds each group of input features into one-dimensional high-level concept representation, and then feeds the concept representations into a new white-box Taylor Neural Network (TaylorNet). The TaylorNet aims to learn the non-linear relationship between the inputs and outputs using polynomials. Evaluation results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that CAT can outperform or compete with the baselines while reducing the need of extensive model parameters. Importantly, it can explain model predictions through high-level concepts that human can understand.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Machine learning models are only as good as the data to which they are fit. As such, it is always preferable to use as much data as possible in training models. What data can be used for fitting a model depends a lot on the formulation of the task. We introduce Hot-Distance, a novel segmentation target that incorporates the strength of signed boundary distance prediction with the flexibility of one-hot encoding, to increase the amount of usable training data for segmentation of subcellular structures in focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM).</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated learning offers a compelling solution to the challenges of networking and data privacy within aerial and space networks by utilizing vast private edge data and computing capabilities accessible through drones, balloons, and satellites. While current research has focused on optimizing the learning process, computing efficiency, and minimizing communication overhead, the issue of heterogeneity and class imbalance remains a significant barrier to rapid model convergence. In our study, we explore the influence of heterogeneity on class imbalance, which diminishes performance in ASN-based federated learning. We illustrate the correlation between heterogeneity and class imbalance within grouped data and show how constraints such as battery life exacerbate the class imbalance challenge. Our findings indicate that ASN-based FL faces heightened class imbalance issues even with similar levels of heterogeneity compared to other scenarios. Finally, we analyze the impact of varying degrees of heterogeneity on FL training and evaluate the efficacy of current state-of-the-art algorithms under these conditions. Our results reveal that the heterogeneity challenge is more pronounced in ASN-based federated learning and that prevailing algorithms often fail to effectively address high levels of heterogeneity.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in parsing textual data and generating code. However, their performance in tasks involving tabular data, especially those requiring symbolic reasoning, faces challenges due to the structural variance and inconsistency in table cell values often found in web tables. In this paper, we introduce NormTab, a novel framework aimed at enhancing the symbolic reasoning performance of LLMs by normalizing web tables. We study table normalization as a stand-alone, one-time preprocessing step using LLMs to support symbolic reasoning on tabular data. Our experimental evaluation, conducted on challenging web table datasets such as WikiTableQuestion and TabFact, demonstrates that leveraging NormTab significantly improves symbolic reasoning performance, showcasing the importance and effectiveness of web table normalization for enhancing LLM-based symbolic reasoning tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) possess the remarkable capability to understand human instructions and generate high-quality text, enabling them to act as agents that simulate human behaviours. This capability allows LLMs to emulate human beings in a more advanced manner, beyond merely replicating simple human behaviours. However, there is a lack of exploring into leveraging LLMs to craft characters from several aspects. In this work, we introduce the Customisable Conversation Agent Framework, which employs LLMs to simulate real-world characters that can be freely customised according to different user preferences. The customisable framework is helpful for designing customisable characters and role-playing agents according to human's preferences. We first propose the SimsConv dataset, which comprises 68 different customised characters, 1,360 multi-turn role-playing dialogues, and encompasses 13,971 interaction dialogues in total. The characters are created from several real-world elements, such as career, aspiration, trait, and skill. Building on these foundations, we present SimsChat, a freely customisable role-playing agent. It incorporates different real-world scenes and topic-specific character interaction dialogues, simulating characters' life experiences in various scenarios and topic-specific interactions with specific emotions. Experimental results show that our proposed framework achieves desirable performance and provides helpful guideline for building better simulacra of human beings in the future.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We developed DyGETViz, a novel framework for effectively visualizing dynamic graphs (DGs) that are ubiquitous across diverse real-world systems. This framework leverages recent advancements in discrete-time dynamic graph (DTDG) models to adeptly handle the temporal dynamics inherent in dynamic graphs. DyGETViz effectively captures both micro- and macro-level structural shifts within these graphs, offering a robust method for representing complex and massive dynamic graphs. The application of DyGETViz extends to a diverse array of domains, including ethology, epidemiology, finance, genetics, linguistics, communication studies, social studies, and international relations. Through its implementation, DyGETViz has revealed or confirmed various critical insights. These include the diversity of content sharing patterns and the degree of specialization within online communities, the chronological evolution of lexicons across decades, and the distinct trajectories exhibited by aging-related and non-related genes. Importantly, DyGETViz enhances the accessibility of scientific findings to non-domain experts by simplifying the complexities of dynamic graphs. Our framework is released as an open-source Python package for use across diverse disciplines. Our work not only addresses the ongoing challenges in visualizing and analyzing DTDG models but also establishes a foundational framework for future investigations into dynamic graph representation and analysis across various disciplines.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has significantly improved the generation of fluent and convincing text, raising concerns about their misuse on social media platforms. We present a methodology using Twitter datasets to examine the generative capabilities of four LLMs: Llama 3, Mistral, Qwen2, and GPT4o. We evaluate 7B and 8B parameter base-instruction models of the three open-source LLMs and validate the impact of further fine-tuning and "uncensored" versions. Our findings show that "uncensored" models with additional in-domain fine-tuning dramatically reduce the effectiveness of automated detection methods. This study addresses a gap by exploring smaller open-source models and the effects of "uncensoring," providing insights into how fine-tuning and content moderation influence machine-generated text detection.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>To better interpret the intrinsic mechanism of large language models (LLMs), recent studies focus on monosemanticity on its basic units. A monosemantic neuron is dedicated to a single and specific concept, which forms a one-to-one correlation between neurons and concepts. Despite extensive research in monosemanticity probing, it remains unclear whether monosemanticity is beneficial or harmful to model capacity. To explore this question, we revisit monosemanticity from the feature decorrelation perspective and advocate for its encouragement. We experimentally observe that the current conclusion by wang2024learning, which suggests that decreasing monosemanticity enhances model performance, does not hold when the model changes. Instead, we demonstrate that monosemanticity consistently exhibits a positive correlation with model capacity, in the preference alignment process. Consequently, we apply feature correlation as a proxy for monosemanticity and incorporate a feature decorrelation regularizer into the dynamic preference optimization process. The experiments show that our method not only enhances representation diversity and activation sparsity but also improves preference alignment performance.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Many empirical studies of labor market questions rely on estimating relatively simple predictive models using small, carefully constructed longitudinal survey datasets based on hand-engineered features. Large Language Models (LLMs), trained on massive datasets, encode vast quantities of world knowledge and can be used for the next job prediction problem. However, while an off-the-shelf LLM produces plausible career trajectories when prompted, the probability with which an LLM predicts a particular job transition conditional on career history will not, in general, align with the true conditional probability in a given population. Recently, Vafa et al. (2024) introduced a transformer-based "foundation model", CAREER, trained using a large, unrepresentative resume dataset, that predicts transitions between jobs; it further demonstrated how transfer learning techniques can be used to leverage the foundation model to build better predictive models of both transitions and wages that reflect conditional transition probabilities found in nationally representative survey datasets. This paper considers an alternative where the fine-tuning of the CAREER foundation model is replaced by fine-tuning LLMs. For the task of next job prediction, we demonstrate that models trained with our approach outperform several alternatives in terms of predictive performance on the survey data, including traditional econometric models, CAREER, and LLMs with in-context learning, even though the LLM can in principle predict job titles that are not allowed in the survey data. Further, we show that our fine-tuned LLM-based models' predictions are more representative of the career trajectories of various workforce subpopulations than off-the-shelf LLM models and CAREER. We conduct experiments and analyses that highlight the sources of the gains in the performance of our models for representative predictions.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have recently achieved significant progress, demonstrating strong capabilities in open-world visual understanding. However, it is not yet clear how LVLMs address demographic biases in real life, especially the disparities across attributes such as gender, skin tone, and age. In this paper, we empirically investigate \emph{visual fairness} in several mainstream LVLMs and audit their performance disparities across sensitive demographic attributes, based on public fairness benchmark datasets (e.g., FACET). To disclose the visual bias in LVLMs, we design a fairness evaluation framework with direct questions and single-choice question-instructed prompts on visual question-answering/classification tasks. The zero-shot prompting results indicate that, despite enhancements in visual understanding, both open-source and closed-source LVLMs exhibit prevalent fairness issues across different instruct prompts and demographic attributes.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) are often trained on vast amounts of undisclosed data, motivating the development of post-hoc Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) to gain insight into their training data composition. However, in this paper, we identify inherent challenges in post-hoc MIA evaluation due to potential distribution shifts between collected member and non-member datasets. Using a simple bag-of-words classifier, we demonstrate that datasets used in recent post-hoc MIAs suffer from significant distribution shifts, in some cases achieving near-perfect distinction between members and non-members. This implies that previously reported high MIA performance may be largely attributable to these shifts rather than model memorization. We confirm that randomized, controlled setups eliminate such shifts and thus enable the development and fair evaluation of new MIAs. However, we note that such randomized setups are rarely available for the latest LLMs, making post-hoc data collection still required to infer membership for real-world LLMs. As a potential solution, we propose a Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) approach for post-hoc data collection, which substantially mitigates distribution shifts. Evaluating various MIA methods on this RDD setup yields performance barely above random guessing, in stark contrast to previously reported results. Overall, our findings highlight the challenges in accurately measuring LLM memorization and the need for careful experimental design in (post-hoc) membership inference tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Dialogue systems have been used as conversation partners in English learning, but few have studied whether these systems improve learning outcomes. Student passion and perseverance, or grit, has been associated with language learning success. Recent work establishes that as students perceive their English teachers to be more supportive, their grit improves. Hypothesizing that the same pattern applies to English-teaching chatbots, we create EDEN, a robust open-domain chatbot for spoken conversation practice that provides empathetic feedback. To construct EDEN, we first train a specialized spoken utterance grammar correction model and a high-quality social chit-chat conversation model. We then conduct a preliminary user study with a variety of strategies for empathetic feedback. Our experiment suggests that using adaptive empathetic feedback leads to higher perceived affective support, which, in turn, predicts increased student grit.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI has revolutionized natural language applications across various domains. However, high-stakes decision-making tasks in fields such as medical, legal and finance require a level of precision, comprehensiveness, and logical consistency that pure LLM or Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG) approaches often fail to deliver. At Elemental Cognition (EC), we have developed a neuro-symbolic AI platform to tackle these problems. The platform integrates fine-tuned LLMs for knowledge extraction and alignment with a robust symbolic reasoning engine for logical inference, planning and interactive constraint solving. We describe Cora, a Collaborative Research Assistant built on this platform, that is designed to perform complex research and discovery tasks in high-stakes domains. This paper discusses the multi-step inference challenges inherent in such domains, critiques the limitations of existing LLM-based methods, and demonstrates how Cora's neuro-symbolic approach effectively addresses these issues. We provide an overview of the system architecture, key algorithms for knowledge extraction and formal reasoning, and present preliminary evaluation results that highlight Cora's superior performance compared to well-known LLM and RAG baselines.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Reconstructing 3D hand-face interactions with deformations from a single image is a challenging yet crucial task with broad applications in AR, VR, and gaming. The challenges stem from self-occlusions during single-view hand-face interactions, diverse spatial relationships between hands and face, complex deformations, and the ambiguity of the single-view setting. The first and only method for hand-face interaction recovery, Decaf, introduces a global fitting optimization guided by contact and deformation estimation networks trained on studio-collected data with 3D annotations. However, Decaf suffers from a time-consuming optimization process and limited generalization capability due to its reliance on 3D annotations of hand-face interaction data. To address these issues, we present DICE, the first end-to-end method for Deformation-aware hand-face Interaction reCovEry from a single image. DICE estimates the poses of hands and faces, contacts, and deformations simultaneously using a Transformer-based architecture. It features disentangling the regression of local deformation fields and global mesh vertex locations into two network branches, enhancing deformation and contact estimation for precise and robust hand-face mesh recovery. To improve generalizability, we propose a weakly-supervised training approach that augments the training set using in-the-wild images without 3D ground-truth annotations, employing the depths of 2D keypoints estimated by off-the-shelf models and adversarial priors of poses for supervision. Our experiments demonstrate that DICE achieves state-of-the-art performance on a standard benchmark and in-the-wild data in terms of accuracy and physical plausibility. Additionally, our method operates at an interactive rate (20 fps) on an Nvidia 4090 GPU, whereas Decaf requires more than 15 seconds for a single image. Our code will be publicly available upon publication.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>A core component present in many successful neural network architectures, is an MLP block of two fully connected layers with a non-linear activation in between. An intriguing phenomenon observed empirically, including in transformer architectures, is that, after training, the activations in the hidden layer of this MLP block tend to be extremely sparse on any given input. Unlike traditional forms of sparsity, where there are neurons/weights which can be deleted from the network, this form of {\em dynamic} activation sparsity appears to be harder to exploit to get more efficient networks. Motivated by this we initiate a formal study of PAC learnability of MLP layers that exhibit activation sparsity. We present a variety of results showing that such classes of functions do lead to provable computational and statistical advantages over their non-sparse counterparts. Our hope is that a better theoretical understanding of {\em sparsely activated} networks would lead to methods that can exploit activation sparsity in practice.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Question Answer Generation (QAG) is an effective data augmentation technique to improve the accuracy of question answering systems, especially in low-resource domains. While recent pretrained and large language model-based QAG methods have made substantial progress, they face the critical issue of redundant QA pair generation, affecting downstream QA systems. Implicit diversity techniques such as sampling and diverse beam search are proven effective solutions but often yield smaller diversity. We present explicit diversity conditions for QAG, focusing on spatial aspects, question types, and entities, substantially increasing diversity in QA generation. Our work emphasizes the need of explicit diversity conditions for generating diverse question-answer synthetic data by showing significant improvements in downstream QA task over existing widely adopted implicit diversity techniques. In particular, generated QA pairs from explicit diversity conditions when used to train the downstream QA model results in an average 4.1% exact match and 4.5% F1 improvement over QAG from implicit sampling techniques on SQuADDU. Our work emphasizes the need for explicit diversity conditions even more in low-resource datasets (SubjQA), where average downstream QA performance improvements are around 12% EM.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Despite recent advancements in detecting disinformation generated by large language models (LLMs), current efforts overlook the ever-evolving nature of this disinformation. In this work, we investigate a challenging yet practical research problem of detecting evolving LLM-generated disinformation. Disinformation evolves constantly through the rapid development of LLMs and their variants. As a consequence, the detection model faces significant challenges. First, it is inefficient to train separate models for each disinformation generator. Second, the performance decreases in scenarios when evolving LLM-generated disinformation is encountered in sequential order. To address this problem, we propose DELD (Detecting Evolving LLM-generated Disinformation), a parameter-efficient approach that jointly leverages the general fact-checking capabilities of pre-trained language models (PLM) and the independent disinformation generation characteristics of various LLMs. In particular, the learned characteristics are concatenated sequentially to facilitate knowledge accumulation and transformation. DELD addresses the issue of label scarcity by integrating the semantic embeddings of disinformation with trainable soft prompts to elicit model-specific knowledge. Our experiments show that \textit{DELD} significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, our method provides critical insights into the unique patterns of disinformation generation across different LLMs, offering valuable perspectives in this line of research.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Our understanding of the temporal dynamics of the Earth's surface has been advanced by deep vision models, which often require lots of labeled multi-temporal images for training. However, collecting, preprocessing, and annotating multi-temporal remote sensing images at scale is non-trivial since it is expensive and knowledge-intensive. In this paper, we present change data generators based on generative models, which are cheap and automatic, alleviating these data problems. Our main idea is to simulate a stochastic change process over time. We describe the stochastic change process as a probabilistic graphical model (GPCM), which factorizes the complex simulation problem into two more tractable sub-problems, i.e., change event simulation and semantic change synthesis. To solve these two problems, we present Changen2, a GPCM with a resolution-scalable diffusion transformer which can generate time series of images and their semantic and change labels from labeled or unlabeled single-temporal images. Changen2 is a generative change foundation model that can be trained at scale via self-supervision, and can produce change supervisory signals from unlabeled single-temporal images. Unlike existing foundation models, Changen2 synthesizes change data to train task-specific foundation models for change detection. The resulting model possesses inherent zero-shot change detection capabilities and excellent transferability. Experiments suggest Changen2 has superior spatiotemporal scalability, e.g., Changen2 model trained on 256$^2$ pixel single-temporal images can yield time series of any length and resolutions of 1,024$^2$ pixels. Changen2 pre-trained models exhibit superior zero-shot performance (narrowing the performance gap to 3% on LEVIR-CD and approximately 10% on both S2Looking and SECOND, compared to fully supervised counterparts) and transferability across multiple types of change tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>How can sLLMs efficiently utilize the supervision of LLMs to improve their generative quality? This question has been well studied in scenarios where there is no restriction on the number of LLM supervisions one can use, giving birth to many decoding algorithms that utilize supervision without further training. However, it is still unclear what is an effective strategy under the limited supervision scenario, where we assume that no more than a few tokens can be generated by LLMs. To this end, we develop an algorithm to effectively aggregate the sLLM and LLM predictions on initial tokens so that the generated tokens can more accurately condition the subsequent token generation by sLLM only. Critically, we find that it is essential to adaptively overtrust or disregard the LLM prediction based on the confidence of the sLLM. Through our experiments on a wide range of models and datasets, we demonstrate that our method provides a consistent improvement over conventional decoding strategies.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The inspection and monitoring of infrastructure assets typically requires identifying visual anomalies in scenes periodically photographed over time. Images collected manually or with robots such as unmanned aerial vehicles from the same scene at different instances in time are typically not perfectly aligned. Supervised segmentation methods can be applied to identify known problems, but unsupervised anomaly detection approaches are required when unknown anomalies occur. Current unsupervised pixel-level anomaly detection methods have mainly been developed for industrial settings where the camera position is known and constant. However, we find that these methods fail to generalize to the case when images are not perfectly aligned. We term the problem of unsupervised anomaly detection between two such imperfectly aligned sets of images as Scene Anomaly Detection (Scene AD). We present a novel network termed OmniAD to address the Scene AD problem posed. Specifically, we refine the anomaly detection method reverse distillation to achieve a 40% increase in pixel-level anomaly detection performance. The network's performance is further demonstrated to improve with two new data augmentation strategies proposed that leverage novel view synthesis and camera localization to improve generalization. We validate our approach with qualitative and quantitative results on a new dataset, ToyCity, the first Scene AD dataset with multiple objects, as well as on the established single object-centric dataset, MAD. this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The extraction of lung lesion information from clinical and medical imaging reports is crucial for research on and clinical care of lung-related diseases. Large language models (LLMs) can be effective at interpreting unstructured text in reports, but they often hallucinate due to a lack of domain-specific knowledge, leading to reduced accuracy and posing challenges for use in clinical settings. To address this, we propose a novel framework that aligns generated internal knowledge with external knowledge through in-context learning (ICL). Our framework employs a retriever to identify relevant units of internal or external knowledge and a grader to evaluate the truthfulness and helpfulness of the retrieved internal-knowledge rules, to align and update the knowledge bases. Our knowledge-conditioned approach also improves the accuracy and reliability of LLM outputs by addressing the extraction task in two stages: (i) lung lesion finding detection and primary structured field parsing, followed by (ii) further parsing of lesion description text into additional structured fields. Experiments with expert-curated test datasets demonstrate that this ICL approach can increase the F1 score for key fields (lesion size, margin and solidity) by an average of 12.9% over existing ICL methods.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we present a decentralized network protocol, Space Network Protocol, based on Communication Satellite Services. The protocol outlines a method for distributing information about the status of satellite communication services across the entire blockchain network, facilitating fairness and transparency in all communication services. Our primary objective is to standardize the services delivered by all satellite networks under the communication satellite protocol. This standard remains intact regardless of potential unreliability associated with the satellites or the terminal hardware. We proposed PoD (Proof of Distribution) to verify if the communication satellites are online and PoF (Proof of Flow) to authenticate the actual data flow provided by the communication satellites. In addition, we also proposed PoM (Proof of Mesh) to verify if the communication satellites have successfully meshed together. Utilizing zero-knowledge proof and multi-party cryptographic computations, we can evaluate the service provisioning parameters of each satellite, even in the presence of potential terminal or network node fraud. This method offers technical support for the modeling of distributed network services.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The recent success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has had a significant impact on the healthcare field, providing patients with medical advice, diagnostic information, and more. However, due to a lack of professional medical knowledge, patients are easily misled by generated erroneous information from LLMs, which may result in serious medical problems. To address this issue, we focus on tuning the LLMs to be medical assistants who collaborate with more experienced doctors. We first conduct a two-stage survey by inspiration-feedback to gain a broad understanding of the real needs of doctors for medical assistants. Based on this, we construct a Chinese medical dataset called DoctorFLAN to support the entire workflow of doctors, which includes 92K Q\&A samples from 22 tasks and 27 specialists. Moreover, we evaluate LLMs in doctor-oriented scenarios by constructing the DoctorFLAN-\textit{test} containing 550 single-turn Q\&A and DotaBench containing 74 multi-turn conversations. The evaluation results indicate that being a medical assistant still poses challenges for existing open-source models, but DoctorFLAN can help them significantly. It demonstrates that the doctor-oriented dataset and benchmarks we construct can complement existing patient-oriented work and better promote medical LLMs research.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, diffusion, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The ability to learn sequentially from different data sites is crucial for a deep network in solving practical medical image diagnosis problems due to privacy restrictions and storage limitations. However, adapting on incoming site leads to catastrophic forgetting on past sites and decreases generalizablity on unseen sites. Existing Continual Learning (CL) and Domain Generalization (DG) methods have been proposed to solve these two challenges respectively, but none of them can address both simultaneously. Recognizing this limitation, this paper proposes a novel training paradigm, learning towards Synchronous Memorizability and Generalizability (SMG-Learning). To achieve this, we create the orientational gradient alignment to ensure memorizability on previous sites, and arbitrary gradient alignment to enhance generalizability on unseen sites. This approach is named as Parallel Gradient Alignment (PGA). Furthermore, we approximate the PGA as dual meta-objectives using the first-order Taylor expansion to reduce computational cost of aligning gradients. Considering that performing gradient alignments, especially for previous sites, is not feasible due to the privacy constraints, we design a Site-Modulated Diffusion (SMD) model to generate images with site-specific learnable prompts, replaying images have similar data distributions as previous sites. We evaluate our method on two medical image segmentation tasks, where data from different sites arrive sequentially. Experimental results show that our method efficiently enhances both memorizability and generalizablity better than other state-of-the-art methods, delivering satisfactory performance across all sites.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized Natural Language Processing (NLP) by by minimizing the need for complex feature engineering. However, the application of LLMs in specialized domains like biopharmaceuticals and chemistry remains largely unexplored. These fields are characterized by intricate terminologies, specialized knowledge, and a high demand for precision areas where general purpose LLMs often fall short. In this study, we introduce PharmGPT, a suite of multilingual LLMs with 13 billion and 70 billion parameters, specifically trained on a comprehensive corpus of hundreds of billions of tokens tailored to the Bio-Pharmaceutical and Chemical sectors. Our evaluation shows that PharmGPT matches or surpasses existing general models on key benchmarks, such as NAPLEX, demonstrating its exceptional capability in domain-specific tasks. This advancement establishes a new benchmark for LLMs in the Bio-Pharmaceutical and Chemical fields, addressing the existing gap in specialized language modeling. Furthermore, this suggests a promising path for enhanced research and development in these specialized areas, paving the way for more precise and effective applications of NLP in specialized domains.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Adverse event (AE) extraction following COVID-19 vaccines from text data is crucial for monitoring and analyzing the safety profiles of immunizations. Traditional deep learning models are adept at learning intricate feature representations and dependencies in sequential data, but often require extensive labeled data. In contrast, large language models (LLMs) excel in understanding contextual information, but exhibit unstable performance on named entity recognition tasks, possibly due to their broad but unspecific training. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs and traditional deep learning models in AE extraction, and to assess the impact of ensembling these models on performance. In this study, we utilized reports and posts from the VAERS (n=621), Twitter (n=9,133), and Reddit (n=131) as our corpora. Our goal was to extract three types of entities: "vaccine", "shot", and "ae". We explored and fine-tuned (except GPT-4) multiple LLMs, including GPT-2, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Llama-2, as well as traditional deep learning models like RNN and BioBERT. To enhance performance, we created ensembles of the three models with the best performance. For evaluation, we used strict and relaxed F1 scores to evaluate the performance for each entity type, and micro-average F1 was used to assess the overall performance. The ensemble model achieved the highest performance in "vaccine", "shot", and "ae" with strict F1-scores of 0.878, 0.930, and 0.925, respectively, along with a micro-average score of 0.903. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the effectiveness and robustness of ensembling fine-tuned traditional deep learning models and LLMs, for extracting AE-related information. This study contributes to the advancement of biomedical natural language processing, providing valuable insights into improving AE extraction from text data for pharmacovigilance and public health surveillance.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved remarkable performance in various image classification tasks by leveraging the attention mechanism to process image patches as tokens. However, the high computational and memory demands of ViTs pose significant challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments. This paper introduces ViT-1.58b, a novel 1.58-bit quantized ViT model designed to drastically reduce memory and computational overhead while preserving competitive performance. ViT-1.58b employs ternary quantization, which refines the balance between efficiency and accuracy by constraining weights to {-1, 0, 1} and quantizing activations to 8-bit precision. Our approach ensures efficient scaling in terms of both memory and computation. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1k demonstrate that ViT-1.58b maintains comparable accuracy to full-precision Vit, with significant reductions in memory usage and computational costs. This paper highlights the potential of extreme quantization techniques in developing sustainable AI solutions and contributes to the broader discourse on efficient model deployment in practical applications.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) addresses complex long-horizon tasks by skillfully decomposing them into subgoals. Therefore, the effectiveness of HRL is greatly influenced by subgoal reachability. Typical HRL methods only consider subgoal reachability from the unilateral level, where a dominant level enforces compliance to the subordinate level. However, we observe that when the dominant level becomes trapped in local exploration or generates unattainable subgoals, the subordinate level is negatively affected and cannot follow the dominant level's actions. This can potentially make both levels stuck in local optima, ultimately hindering subsequent subgoal reachability. Allowing real-time bilateral information sharing and error correction would be a natural cure for this issue, which motivates us to propose a mutual response mechanism. Based on this, we propose the Bidirectional-reachable Hierarchical Policy Optimization (BrHPO)--a simple yet effective algorithm that also enjoys computation efficiency. Experiment results on a variety of long-horizon tasks showcase that BrHPO outperforms other state-of-the-art HRL baselines, coupled with a significantly higher exploration efficiency and robustness.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) has achieved remarkable performance across various natural language processing tasks, yet it demands more and more memory as model sizes keep growing. To address this issue, the recently proposed Memory-efficient Zeroth-order (MeZO) methods attempt to fine-tune LLMs using only forward passes, thereby avoiding the need for a backpropagation graph. However, significant performance drops and a high risk of divergence have limited their widespread adoption. In this paper, we propose the Adaptive Zeroth-order Tensor-Train Adaption (AdaZeta) framework, specifically designed to improve the performance and convergence of the ZO methods. To enhance dimension-dependent ZO estimation accuracy, we introduce a fast-forward, low-parameter tensorized adapter. To tackle the frequently observed divergence issue in large-scale ZO fine-tuning tasks, we propose an adaptive query number schedule that guarantees convergence. Detailed theoretical analysis and extensive experimental results on Roberta-Large and Llama-2-7B models substantiate the efficacy of our AdaZeta framework in terms of accuracy, memory efficiency, and convergence speed.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Robustness remains a paramount concern in deep reinforcement learning (DRL), with randomized smoothing emerging as a key technique for enhancing this attribute. However, a notable gap exists in the performance of current smoothed DRL agents, often characterized by significantly low clean rewards and weak robustness. In response to this challenge, our study introduces innovative algorithms aimed at training effective smoothed robust DRL agents. We propose S-DQN and S-PPO, novel approaches that demonstrate remarkable improvements in clean rewards, empirical robustness, and robustness guarantee across standard RL benchmarks. Notably, our S-DQN and S-PPO agents not only significantly outperform existing smoothed agents by an average factor of $2.16\times$ under the strongest attack, but also surpass previous robustly-trained agents by an average factor of $2.13\times$. This represents a significant leap forward in the field. Furthermore, we introduce Smoothed Attack, which is $1.89\times$ more effective in decreasing the rewards of smoothed agents than existing adversarial attacks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present a comprehensive evaluation of answer quality in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications using vRAG-Eval, a novel grading system that is designed to assess correctness, completeness, and honesty. We further map the grading of quality aspects aforementioned into a binary score, indicating an accept or reject decision, mirroring the intuitive "thumbs-up" or "thumbs-down" gesture commonly used in chat applications. This approach suits factual business settings where a clear decision opinion is essential. Our assessment applies vRAG-Eval to two Large Language Models (LLMs), evaluating the quality of answers generated by a vanilla RAG application. We compare these evaluations with human expert judgments and find a substantial alignment between GPT-4's assessments and those of human experts, reaching 83% agreement on accept or reject decisions. This study highlights the potential of LLMs as reliable evaluators in closed-domain, closed-ended settings, particularly when human evaluations require significant resources.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The diverse nature of dialects presents challenges for models trained on specific linguistic patterns, rendering them susceptible to errors when confronted with unseen or out-of-distribution (OOD) data. This study introduces a novel margin-enhanced joint energy model (MEJEM) tailored specifically for OOD detection in dialects. By integrating a generative model and the energy margin loss, our approach aims to enhance the robustness of dialect identification systems. Furthermore, we explore two OOD scores for OOD dialect detection, and our findings conclusively demonstrate that the energy score outperforms the softmax score. Leveraging Sharpness-Aware Minimization to optimize the training process of the joint model, we enhance model generalization by minimizing both loss and sharpness. Experiments conducted on dialect identification tasks validate the efficacy of Energy-Based Models and provide valuable insights into their performance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Few-shot Semantic Segmentation (FSS) aims to adapt a pretrained model to new classes with as few as a single labelled training sample per class. Despite the prototype based approaches have achieved substantial success, existing models are limited to the imaging scenarios with considerably distinct objects and not highly complex background, e.g., natural images. This makes such models suboptimal for medical imaging with both conditions invalid. To address this problem, we propose a novel Detail Self-refined Prototype Network (DSPNet) to constructing high-fidelity prototypes representing the object foreground and the background more comprehensively. Specifically, to construct global semantics while maintaining the captured detail semantics, we learn the foreground prototypes by modelling the multi-modal structures with clustering and then fusing each in a channel-wise manner. Considering that the background often has no apparent semantic relation in the spatial dimensions, we integrate channel-specific structural information under sparse channel-aware regulation. Extensive experiments on three challenging medical image benchmarks show the superiority of DSPNet over previous state-of-the-art methods.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Aspect Sentiment Quad Prediction (ASQP) aims to predict all quads (aspect term, aspect category, opinion term, sentiment polarity) for a given review, which is the most representative and challenging task in aspect-based sentiment analysis. A key challenge in the ASQP task is the scarcity of labeled data, which limits the performance of existing methods. To tackle this issue, we propose a self-training framework with a pseudo-label scorer, wherein a scorer assesses the match between reviews and their pseudo-labels, aiming to filter out mismatches and thereby enhance the effectiveness of self-training. We highlight two critical aspects to ensure the scorer's effectiveness and reliability: the quality of the training dataset and its model architecture. To this end, we create a human-annotated comparison dataset and train a generative model on it using ranking-based objectives. Extensive experiments on public ASQP datasets reveal that using our scorer can greatly and consistently improve the effectiveness of self-training. Moreover, we explore the possibility of replacing humans with large language models for comparison dataset annotation, and experiments demonstrate its feasibility.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>When light is scattered or reflected accidentally in the lens, flare artifacts may appear in the captured photos, affecting the photos' visual quality. The main challenge in flare removal is to eliminate various flare artifacts while preserving the original content of the image. To address this challenge, we propose a lightweight Multi-Frequency Deflare Network (MFDNet) based on the Laplacian Pyramid. Our network decomposes the flare-corrupted image into low and high-frequency bands, effectively separating the illumination and content information in the image. The low-frequency part typically contains illumination information, while the high-frequency part contains detailed content information. So our MFDNet consists of two main modules: the Low-Frequency Flare Perception Module (LFFPM) to remove flare in the low-frequency part and the Hierarchical Fusion Reconstruction Module (HFRM) to reconstruct the flare-free image. Specifically, to perceive flare from a global perspective while retaining detailed information for image restoration, LFFPM utilizes Transformer to extract global information while utilizing a convolutional neural network to capture detailed local features. Then HFRM gradually fuses the outputs of LFFPM with the high-frequency component of the image through feature aggregation. Moreover, our MFDNet can reduce the computational cost by processing in multiple frequency bands instead of directly removing the flare on the input image. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in removing nighttime flare on real-world and synthetic images from the Flare7K dataset. Furthermore, the computational complexity of our model is remarkably low.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multilingual Knowledge Graph Completion (mKGC) aim at solving queries like (h, r, ?) in different languages by reasoning a tail entity t thus improving multilingual knowledge graphs. Previous studies leverage multilingual pretrained language models (PLMs) and the generative paradigm to achieve mKGC. Although multilingual pretrained language models contain extensive knowledge of different languages, its pretraining tasks cannot be directly aligned with the mKGC tasks. Moreover, the majority of KGs and PLMs currently available exhibit a pronounced English-centric bias. This makes it difficult for mKGC to achieve good results, particularly in the context of low-resource languages. To overcome previous problems, this paper introduces global and local knowledge constraints for mKGC. The former is used to constrain the reasoning of answer entities, while the latter is used to enhance the representation of query contexts. The proposed method makes the pretrained model better adapt to the mKGC task. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the previous SOTA on Hits@1 and Hits@10 by an average of 12.32% and 16.03%, which indicates that our proposed method has significant enhancement on mKGC.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Opinion Expression Identification (OEI) is essential in NLP for applications ranging from voice assistants to depression diagnosis. This study extends OEI to encompass multimodal inputs, underlining the significance of auditory cues in delivering emotional subtleties beyond the capabilities of text. We introduce a novel multimodal OEI (MOEI) task, integrating text and speech to mirror real-world scenarios. Utilizing CMU MOSEI and IEMOCAP datasets, we construct the CI-MOEI dataset. Additionally, Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology is applied to the MPQA dataset to obtain the CIM-OEI dataset. We design a template for the OEI task to take full advantage of the generative power of large language models (LLMs). Advancing further, we propose an LLM-driven method STOEI, which combines speech and text modal to identify opinion expressions. Our experiments demonstrate that MOEI significantly improves the performance while our method outperforms existing methods by 9.20\% and obtains SOTA results.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent studies have shown promising results in utilizing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for computer vision tasks such as object detection and semantic segmentation. However, many challenging video tasks remain under-explored. Video-language tasks necessitate spatial and temporal comprehension and require significant compute. Therefore, prior works have developed complex, highly specialized architectures or leveraged additional input signals such as video transcripts to best encode contextual and temporal information, which limits their generality and can be impractical. One particularly challenging task is video moment retrieval, which requires precise temporal and contextual grounding. This work demonstrates the surprising effectiveness of leveraging image-text pretrained MLLMs for moment retrieval. We introduce Mr. BLIP (Mr. as in Moment Retrieval), a multimodal, single-stage model that requires no expensive video-language pretraining, no additional input signal (e.g., no transcript or audio), and has a simpler and more versatile design than prior state-of-the-art methods. We achieve a new state-of-the-art in moment retrieval on the widely used benchmarks Charades-STA, QVHighlights, and ActivityNet Captions and illustrate our method's versatility with a new state-of-the-art in temporal action localization on ActivityNet. Notably, we attain over 9% (absolute) higher Recall (at 0.5 and 0.7 IoU) on the challenging long-video multi-moment QVHighlights benchmark. Our code is publicly available.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Badminton enjoys widespread popularity, and reports on matches generally include details such as player names, game scores, and ball types, providing audiences with a comprehensive view of the games. However, writing these reports can be a time-consuming task. This challenge led us to explore whether a Large Language Model (LLM) could automate the generation and evaluation of badminton reports. We introduce a novel framework named BADGE, designed for this purpose using LLM. Our method consists of two main phases: Report Generation and Report Evaluation. Initially, badminton-related data is processed by the LLM, which then generates a detailed report of the match. We tested different Input Data Types, In-Context Learning (ICL), and LLM, finding that GPT-4 performs best when using CSV data type and the Chain of Thought prompting. Following report generation, the LLM evaluates and scores the reports to assess their quality. Our comparisons between the scores evaluated by GPT-4 and human judges show a tendency to prefer GPT-4 generated reports. Since the application of LLM in badminton reporting remains largely unexplored, our research serves as a foundational step for future advancements in this area. Moreover, our method can be extended to other sports games, thereby enhancing sports promotion. For more details, please refer to this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, security, defense, attack, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As the development of large language models (LLMs) rapidly advances, securing these models effectively without compromising their utility has become a pivotal area of research. However, current defense strategies against jailbreak attacks (i.e., efforts to bypass security protocols) often suffer from limited adaptability, restricted general capability, and high cost. To address these challenges, we introduce SafeAligner, a methodology implemented at the decoding stage to fortify defenses against jailbreak attacks. We begin by developing two specialized models: the Sentinel Model, which is trained to foster safety, and the Intruder Model, designed to generate riskier responses. SafeAligner leverages the disparity in security levels between the responses from these models to differentiate between harmful and beneficial tokens, effectively guiding the safety alignment by altering the output token distribution of the target model. Extensive experiments show that SafeAligner can increase the likelihood of beneficial tokens, while reducing the occurrence of harmful ones, thereby ensuring secure alignment with minimal loss to generality.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Disruptions to personnel rosters caused by absenteeism often necessitate last-minute adjustments to the employees' working hours. A common strategy to mitigate the impact of such changes is to assign employees to reserve shifts: special on-call duties during which an employee can be called in to cover for an absent employee. To maximize roster robustness, we assume a predict-then-optimize approach that uses absence predictions from a machine learning model to schedule an adequate number of reserve shifts. In this paper we propose a methodology to evaluate the robustness of rosters generated by the predict-then-optimize approach, assuming the machine learning model will make predictions at a predetermined prediction performance level. Instead of training and testing machine learning models, our methodology simulates the predictions based on a characterization of model performance. We show how this methodology can be applied to identify the minimum performance level needed for the model to outperform simple non-data-driven robust rostering policies. In a computational study on a nurse rostering problem, we demonstrate how the predict-then-optimize approach outperforms non-data-driven policies under reasonable performance requirements, particularly when employees possess interchangeable skills.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Motivated by the widespread increase in the phenomenon of code-switching between Egyptian Arabic and English in recent times, this paper explores the intricacies of machine translation (MT) and automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems, focusing on translating code-switched Egyptian Arabic-English to either English or Egyptian Arabic. Our goal is to present the methodologies employed in developing these systems, utilizing large language models such as LLama and Gemma. In the field of ASR, we explore the utilization of the Whisper model for code-switched Egyptian Arabic recognition, detailing our experimental procedures including data preprocessing and training techniques. Through the implementation of a consecutive speech-to-text translation system that integrates ASR with MT, we aim to overcome challenges posed by limited resources and the unique characteristics of the Egyptian Arabic dialect. Evaluation against established metrics showcases promising results, with our methodologies yielding a significant improvement of $56\%$ in English translation over the state-of-the-art and $9.3\%$ in Arabic translation. Since code-switching is deeply inherent in spoken languages, it is crucial that ASR systems can effectively handle this phenomenon. This capability is crucial for enabling seamless interaction in various domains, including business negotiations, cultural exchanges, and academic discourse.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, attack, robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the development of natural language processing (NLP), large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly popular. LLMs are integrating more into everyday life, raising public concerns about their security vulnerabilities. Consequently, the security of large language models is becoming critically important. Currently, the techniques for attacking and defending against LLMs are continuously evolving. One significant method type of attack is the jailbreak attack, which designed to evade model safety mechanisms and induce the generation of inappropriate content. Existing jailbreak attacks primarily rely on crafting inducement prompts for direct jailbreaks, which are less effective against large models with robust filtering and high comprehension abilities. Given the increasing demand for real-time capabilities in large language models, real-time updates and iterations of new knowledge have become essential. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), an advanced technique to compensate for the model's lack of new knowledge, is gradually becoming mainstream. As RAG enables the model to utilize external knowledge bases, it provides a new avenue for jailbreak attacks. In this paper, we conduct the first work to propose the concept of indirect jailbreak and achieve Retrieval-Augmented Generation via LangChain. Building on this, we further design a novel method of indirect jailbreak attack, termed Poisoned-LangChain (PLC), which leverages a poisoned external knowledge base to interact with large language models, thereby causing the large models to generate malicious non-compliant dialogues.We tested this method on six different large language models across three major categories of jailbreak issues. The experiments demonstrate that PLC successfully implemented indirect jailbreak attacks under three different scenarios, achieving success rates of 88.56%, 79.04%, and 82.69% respectively.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The increasing reliance on online recruitment platforms coupled with the adoption of AI technologies has highlighted the critical need for efficient resume classification methods. However, challenges such as small datasets, lack of standardized resume templates, and privacy concerns hinder the accuracy and effectiveness of existing classification models. In this work, we address these challenges by presenting a comprehensive approach to resume classification. We curated a large-scale dataset of 13,389 resumes from diverse sources and employed Large Language Models (LLMs) such as BERT and Gemma1.1 2B for classification. Our results demonstrate significant improvements over traditional machine learning approaches, with our best model achieving a top-1 accuracy of 92\% and a top-5 accuracy of 97.5\%. These findings underscore the importance of dataset quality and advanced model architectures in enhancing the accuracy and robustness of resume classification systems, thus advancing the field of online recruitment practices.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present ConvoCache, a conversational caching system that solves the problem of slow and expensive generative AI models in spoken chatbots. ConvoCache finds a semantically similar prompt in the past and reuses the response. In this paper we evaluate ConvoCache on the DailyDialog dataset. We find that ConvoCache can apply a UniEval coherence threshold of 90% and respond to 89% of prompts using the cache with an average latency of 214ms, replacing LLM and voice synthesis that can take over 1s. To further reduce latency we test prefetching and find limited usefulness. Prefetching with 80% of a request leads to a 63% hit rate, and a drop in overall coherence. ConvoCache can be used with any chatbot to reduce costs by reducing usage of generative AI by up to 89%.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Retrieval-augmented generation has gained popularity as a framework to enhance large language models with external knowledge. However, its effectiveness hinges on the retrieval robustness of the model. If the model lacks retrieval robustness, its performance is constrained by the accuracy of the retriever, resulting in significant compromises when the retrieved context is irrelevant. In this paper, we evaluate the "implicit" retrieval robustness of various large language models, instructing them to directly output the final answer without explicitly judging the relevance of the retrieved context. Our findings reveal that fine-tuning on a mix of gold and distracting context significantly enhances the model's robustness to retrieval inaccuracies, while still maintaining its ability to extract correct answers when retrieval is accurate. This suggests that large language models can implicitly handle relevant or irrelevant retrieved context by learning solely from the supervision of the final answer in an end-to-end manner. Introducing an additional process for explicit relevance judgment can be unnecessary and disrupts the end-to-end approach.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Long-context Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demand substantial computational resources for inference as the growth of their multimodal Key-Value (KV) cache, in response to increasing input lengths, challenges memory and time efficiency. Unlike single-modality LLMs that manage only textual contexts, the KV cache of long-context MLLMs includes representations from multiple images with temporal and spatial relationships and related textual contexts. The predominance of image tokens means traditional optimizations for LLMs' KV caches are unsuitable for multimodal long-context settings, and no prior works have addressed this challenge. In this work, we introduce LOOK-M, a pioneering, fine-tuning-free approach that efficiently reduces the multimodal KV cache size while maintaining performance comparable to a full cache. We observe that during prompt prefill, the model prioritizes more textual attention over image features, and based on the multimodal interaction observation, a new proposed text-prior method is explored to compress the KV cache. Furthermore, to mitigate the degradation of image contextual information, we propose several compensatory strategies using KV pairs merging. LOOK-M demonstrates that with a significant reduction in KV Cache memory usage, such as reducing it by 80% in some cases, it not only achieves up to 1.5x faster decoding but also maintains or even enhances performance across a variety of long context multimodal tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As a promising field in open-world learning, \textit{Novel Class Discovery} (NCD) is usually a task to cluster unseen novel classes in an unlabeled set based on the prior knowledge of labeled data within the same domain. However, the performance of existing NCD methods could be severely compromised when novel classes are sampled from a different distribution with the labeled ones. In this paper, we explore and establish the solvability of NCD in cross domain setting with the necessary condition that style information must be removed. Based on the theoretical analysis, we introduce an exclusive style removal module for extracting style information that is distinctive from the baseline features, thereby facilitating inference. Moreover, this module is easy to integrate with other NCD methods, acting as a plug-in to improve performance on novel classes with different distributions compared to the seen labeled set. Additionally, recognizing the non-negligible influence of different backbones and pre-training strategies on the performance of the NCD methods, we build a fair benchmark for future NCD research. Extensive experiments on three common datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed module.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Insect production for food and feed presents a promising supplement to ensure food safety and address the adverse impacts of agriculture on climate and environment in the future. However, optimisation is required for insect production to realise its full potential. This can be by targeted improvement of traits of interest through selective breeding, an approach which has so far been underexplored and underutilised in insect farming. Here we present a comprehensive review of the selective breeding framework in the context of insect production. We systematically evaluate adjustments of selective breeding techniques to the realm of insects and highlight the essential components integral to the breeding process. The discussion covers every step of a conventional breeding scheme, such as formulation of breeding objectives, phenotyping, estimation of genetic parameters and breeding values, selection of appropriate breeding strategies, and mitigation of issues associated with genetic diversity depletion and inbreeding. This review combines knowledge from diverse disciplines, bridging the gap between animal breeding, quantitative genetics, evolutionary biology, and entomology, offering an integrated view of the insect breeding research area and uniting knowledge which has previously remained scattered across diverse fields of expertise.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The shuffle model of differential privacy (DP) has recently emerged as a powerful one for decentralized computation without fully trustable parties. Since it anonymizes and permutes messages from clients through a shuffler, the privacy can be amplified and utility can be improved. However, the shuffling procedure in turn restricts its applications only to statistical tasks that are permutation-invariant. This work explores the feasibility of shuffle privacy amplification for prevalent non-statistical computations: spatial crowdsourcing, combinatorial optimization, location-based social systems, and federated learning with incentives, which suffer either computationally intractability or intolerable utility loss in existing approaches (e.g., secure MPC and local DP). We proposes a new paradigm of shuffle model that can provide critical security functionalities like message authorization and result access control, meanwhile maintaining the most of privacy amplification effects. It incurs almost the same computation/communication costs as the non-private setting, and permits the server to run arbitrary algorithms on (noisy) client information in plaintext. Our novel technique is introducing statistically random identity into DP and force identical random distribution on all clients, so as to support secure functionalities even after message shuffling and to maintain privacy amplification simultaneously. Given that existing DP randomizers fails in the new shuffle model, we also propose a new mechanism and prove its optimality therein. Experimental results on spatial crowdsourcing, location-based social system, and federated learning with incentives, show that our paradigm and mechanism is fast as non-private settings, while reducing up to 90% error and increasing utility performance indicates by 100%-300% relatively, and can be practical under reasonable privacy budget.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the rapid development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), especially their capabilities in visual chat through refer and ground functionalities, their significance is increasingly recognized. However, the biomedical field currently exhibits a substantial gap in this area, primarily due to the absence of a dedicated refer and ground dataset for biomedical images. To address this challenge, we devised the Med-GRIT-270k dataset. It comprises 270k question-and-answer pairs and spans eight distinct medical imaging modalities. Most importantly, it is the first dedicated to the biomedical domain and integrating refer and ground conversations. The key idea is to sample large-scale biomedical image-mask pairs from medical segmentation datasets and generate instruction datasets from text using chatGPT. Additionally, we introduce a Refer-and-Ground Multimodal Large Language Model for Biomedicine (BiRD) by using this dataset and multi-task instruction learning. Extensive experiments have corroborated the efficacy of the Med-GRIT-270k dataset and the multi-modal, fine-grained interactive capabilities of the BiRD model. This holds significant reference value for the exploration and development of intelligent biomedical assistants.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, protect, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated learning (FL) is a powerful machine learning paradigm which leverages the data as well as the computational resources of clients, while protecting clients' data privacy. However, the substantial model size and frequent aggregation between the server and clients result in significant communication overhead, making it challenging to deploy FL in resource-limited wireless networks. In this work, we aim to mitigate the communication overhead by using quantization. Previous research on quantization has primarily focused on the uplink communication, employing either fixed-bit quantization or adaptive quantization methods. In this work, we introduce a holistic approach by joint uplink and downlink adaptive quantization to reduce the communication overhead. In particular, we optimize the learning convergence by determining the optimal uplink and downlink quantization bit-length, with a communication energy constraint. Theoretical analysis shows that the optimal quantization levels depend on the range of model gradients or weights. Based on this insight, we propose a decreasing-trend quantization for the uplink and an increasing-trend quantization for the downlink, which aligns with the change of the model parameters during the training process. Experimental results show that, the proposed joint uplink and downlink adaptive quantization strategy can save up to 66.7% energy compared with the existing schemes.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generating 3D scenes from human motion sequences supports numerous applications, including virtual reality and architectural design. However, previous auto-regression-based human-aware 3D scene generation methods have struggled to accurately capture the joint distribution of multiple objects and input humans, often resulting in overlapping object generation in the same space. To address this limitation, we explore the potential of diffusion models that simultaneously consider all input humans and the floor plan to generate plausible 3D scenes. Our approach not only satisfies all input human interactions but also adheres to spatial constraints with the floor plan. Furthermore, we introduce two spatial collision guidance mechanisms: human-object collision avoidance and object-room boundary constraints. These mechanisms help avoid generating scenes that conflict with human motions while respecting layout constraints. To enhance the diversity and accuracy of human-guided scene generation, we have developed an automated pipeline that improves the variety and plausibility of human-object interactions in the existing 3D FRONT HUMAN dataset. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework can generate more natural and plausible 3D scenes with precise human-scene interactions, while significantly reducing human-object collisions compared to previous state-of-the-art methods. Our code and data will be made publicly available upon publication of this work.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Managing long texts is challenging for large language models (LLMs) due to limited context window sizes. This study introduces UIO-LLMs, an unbiased incremental optimization approach for memory-enhanced transformers under long-context settings. We initially conceptualize the process as a streamlined encoder-decoder framework where the weights-shared encoder and decoder respectively encapsulate a context segment into memories and leverage these memories to predict outputs of the subsequent segment. Subsequently, by treating our memory-enhanced transformers as fully-connected recurrent neural networks (RNNs), we refine the training process using the Truncated Backpropagation Through Time (TBPTT) algorithm, which incorporates innovative incremental optimization techniques. These techniques not only diminish time complexity but also address the bias in gradient computation through an unbiased optimization process. UIO-LLMs successfully handle long context, such as extending the context window of Llama2-7b-chat from 4K to 100K tokens with minimal 2% additional parameters, while keeping the inference cost nearly linear as context length increases.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With climate extremes' rising frequency and intensity, robust analytical tools are crucial to predict their impacts on terrestrial ecosystems. Machine learning techniques show promise but require well-structured, high-quality, and curated analysis-ready datasets. Earth observation datasets comprehensively monitor ecosystem dynamics and responses to climatic extremes, yet the data complexity can challenge the effectiveness of machine learning models. Despite recent progress in deep learning to ecosystem monitoring, there is a need for datasets specifically designed to analyse compound heatwave and drought extreme impact. Here, we introduce the DeepExtremeCubes database, tailored to map around these extremes, focusing on persistent natural vegetation. It comprises over 40,000 spatially sampled small data cubes (i.e. minicubes) globally, with a spatial coverage of 2.5 by 2.5 km. Each minicube includes (i) Sentinel-2 L2A images, (ii) ERA5-Land variables and generated extreme event cube covering 2016 to 2022, and (iii) ancillary land cover and topography maps. The paper aims to (1) streamline data accessibility, structuring, pre-processing, and enhance scientific reproducibility, and (2) facilitate biosphere dynamics forecasting in response to compound extremes.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In conversational AI, personalizing dialogues with persona profiles and contextual understanding is essential. Despite large language models' (LLMs) improved response coherence, effective persona integration remains a challenge. In this work, we first study two common approaches for personalizing LLMs: textual prompting and direct fine-tuning. We observed that textual prompting often struggles to yield responses that are similar to the ground truths in datasets, while direct fine-tuning tends to produce repetitive or overly generic replies. To alleviate those issues, we propose \textbf{S}elective \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{T}uning (SPT), which softly prompts LLMs for personalized conversations in a selective way. Concretely, SPT initializes a set of soft prompts and uses a trainable dense retriever to adaptively select suitable soft prompts for LLMs according to different input contexts, where the prompt retriever is dynamically updated through feedback from the LLMs. Additionally, we propose context-prompt contrastive learning and prompt fusion learning to encourage the SPT to enhance the diversity of personalized conversations. Experiments on the CONVAI2 dataset demonstrate that SPT significantly enhances response diversity by up to 90\%, along with improvements in other critical performance indicators. Those results highlight the efficacy of SPT in fostering engaging and personalized dialogue generation. The SPT model code (this https URL) is publicly available for further exploration.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid growth of large language models(LLMs) has emerged as a prominent trend in the field of artificial intelligence. However, current state-of-the-art LLMs are predominantly based on English. They encounter limitations when directly applied to tasks in specific cultural domains, due to deficiencies in domain-specific knowledge and misunderstandings caused by differences in cultural values. To address this challenge, our paper proposes a rapid adaptation method for large models in specific cultural contexts, which leverages instruction-tuning based on specific cultural knowledge and safety values data. Taking Chinese as the specific cultural context and utilizing the LLaMA3-8B as the experimental English LLM, the evaluation results demonstrate that the adapted LLM significantly enhances its capabilities in domain-specific knowledge and adaptability to safety values, while maintaining its original expertise advantages.</li>

We focus on three key design insights: (i) Integrating Visual Capabilities while Maintaining Complex Language Understanding: In addition to the vision encoder, we incorporated the Visual Attention Experts into the LLM to enhance its visual capabilities. (ii) Extending Context Window for High-Resolution and Long-Duration Visual Feature: We explore the Visual Merger Module to effectively reduce the token number of high-resolution images and incorporated frame position ids to avoid position interpolation. (iii) High-Quality Bilingual Datasets: We meticulously curated and filtered a high-quality bilingual multimodal dataset to reduce visual hallucinations. With above recipe we build MammothModa that consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art models, e.g., LLaVA-series, across main real-world visual language benchmarks without bells and whistles.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) are highly adaptable to various downstream tasks through few-shot learning, making prompt-based anomaly detection a promising approach. Traditional methods depend on human-crafted prompts that require prior knowledge of specific anomaly types. Our goal is to develop a human-free prompt-based anomaly detection framework that optimally learns prompts through data-driven methods, eliminating the need for human intervention. The primary challenge in this approach is the lack of anomalous samples during the training phase. Additionally, the Vision Transformer (ViT)-based image encoder in VLMs is not ideal for pixel-wise anomaly segmentation due to a locality feature mismatch between the original image and the output feature map. To tackle the first challenge, we have developed the Object-Attention Anomaly Generation Module (OAGM) to synthesize anomaly samples for training. Furthermore, our Meta-Guiding Prompt-Tuning Scheme (MPTS) iteratively adjusts the gradient-based optimization direction of learnable prompts to avoid overfitting to the synthesized anomalies. For the second challenge, we propose Locality-Aware Attention, which ensures that each local patch feature attends only to nearby patch features, preserving the locality features corresponding to their original locations. This framework allows for the optimal prompt embeddings by searching in the continuous latent space via backpropagation, free from human semantic constraints. Additionally, the modified locality-aware attention improves the precision of pixel-wise anomaly segmentation.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Dynamic Gaussian splatting has led to impressive scene reconstruction and image synthesis advances in novel views. Existing methods, however, heavily rely on pre-computed poses and Gaussian initialization by Structure from Motion (SfM) algorithms or expensive sensors. For the first time, this paper addresses this issue by integrating self-supervised VO into our pose-free dynamic Gaussian method (VDG) to boost pose and depth initialization and static-dynamic decomposition. Moreover, VDG can work with only RGB image input and construct dynamic scenes at a faster speed and larger scenes compared with the pose-free dynamic view-synthesis method. We demonstrate the robustness of our approach via extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments. Our results show favorable performance over the state-of-the-art dynamic view synthesis methods.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The 3D Gaussian Splatting technique has significantly advanced the construction of radiance fields from multi-view images, enabling real-time rendering. While point-based rasterization effectively reduces computational demands for rendering, it often struggles to accurately reconstruct the geometry of the target object, especially under strong lighting. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel approach that combines octree-based implicit surface representations with Gaussian splatting. Our method consists of four stages. Initially, it reconstructs a signed distance field (SDF) and a radiance field through volume rendering, encoding them in a low-resolution octree. The initial SDF represents the coarse geometry of the target object. Subsequently, it introduces 3D Gaussians as additional degrees of freedom, which are guided by the SDF. In the third stage, the optimized Gaussians further improve the accuracy of the SDF, allowing it to recover finer geometric details compared to the initial SDF obtained in the first stage. Finally, it adopts the refined SDF to further optimize the 3D Gaussians via splatting, eliminating those that contribute little to visual appearance. Experimental results show that our method, which leverages the distribution of 3D Gaussians with SDFs, reconstructs more accurate geometry, particularly in images with specular highlights caused by strong lighting.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable emergent abilities across various tasks, yet fall short of complex reasoning and planning tasks. The tree-search-based reasoning methods address this by surpassing the capabilities of chain-of-thought prompting, encouraging exploration of intermediate steps. However, such methods introduce significant inference latency due to the systematic exploration and evaluation of multiple thought paths. This paper introduces SeeD, a novel and efficient inference framework to optimize runtime speed and GPU memory management concurrently. By employing a scheduled speculative execution, SeeD efficiently handles multiple iterations for the thought generation and the state evaluation, leveraging a rounds-scheduled strategy to manage draft model dispatching. Extensive experimental evaluations on three reasoning datasets demonstrate superior speedup performance of SeeD, providing a viable path for batched inference in training-free speculative decoding.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Mixture-of-experts (MoE) is gaining increasing attention due to its unique properties and remarkable performance, especially for language tasks. By sparsely activating a subset of parameters for each token, MoE architecture could increase the model size without sacrificing computational efficiency, achieving a better trade-off between performance and training costs. However, the underlying mechanism of MoE still lacks further exploration, and its modularization degree remains questionable. In this paper, we make an initial attempt to understand the inner workings of MoE-based large language models. Concretely, we comprehensively study the parametric and behavioral features of three recent MoE-based models and reveal some intriguing observations, including (1) Neurons act like fine-grained experts. (2) The router of MoE usually selects experts with larger output norms. (3) The expert diversity increases as the layer increases, while the last layer is an outlier. Based on the observations, we also provide suggestions for a broad spectrum of MoE practitioners, such as router design and expert allocation. We hope this work could shed light on future research on the MoE framework and other modular architectures. Code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful tools with extensive applications, but their tendency to memorize private information raises significant concerns as private data leakage can easily happen. In this paper, we introduce Private Association Editing (PAE), a novel defense approach for private data leakage. PAE is designed to effectively remove Personally Identifiable Information (PII) without retraining the model. Our approach consists of a four-step procedure: detecting memorized PII, applying PAE cards to mitigate memorization of private data, verifying resilience to targeted data extraction (TDE) attacks, and ensuring consistency in the post-edit LLMs. The versatility and efficiency of PAE, which allows for batch modifications, significantly enhance data privacy in LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of PAE in mitigating private data leakage. We believe PAE will serve as a critical tool in the ongoing effort to protect data privacy in LLMs, encouraging the development of safer models for real-world applications.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The advent of end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) messaging and backup services has brought new challenges for usable authentication. Compared to regular web services, the nature of E2EE implies that the provider cannot recover data for users who have forgotten passwords or lost devices. Therefore, new forms of robustness and recoverability are required, leading to a plethora of solutions ranging from randomly-generated recovery codes to threshold-based social verification. These implications also spread to new forms of authentication and legacy web services: passwordless authentication ("passkeys") has become a promising candidate to replace passwords altogether, but are inherently device-bound. However, users expect that they can login from multiple devices and recover their passwords in case of device loss--prompting providers to sync credentials to cloud storage using E2EE, resulting in the very same authentication challenges of regular E2EE services. Hence, E2EE authentication quickly becomes relevant not only for a niche group of dedicated E2EE enthusiasts but for the general public using the passwordless authentication techniques promoted by their device vendors. In this paper we systematize existing research literature and industry practice relating to security, privacy, usability, and recoverability of E2EE authentication. We investigate authentication and recovery schemes in all widely-used E2EE web services and survey passwordless authentication deployment in the top-200 most popular websites. Finally, we present concrete research directions based on observed gaps between industry deployment and academic literature.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Herein, we present CoDA, the Coral Dendroid structure Analyzer, a visual analytics suite that allows for the first time to investigate the ontogenetic morphological development of complex dendroid coral colonies, exemplified on three important framework-forming dendroid cold-water corals: Lophelia pertusa (Linnaeus, 1758), Madrepora oculata (Linnaeus, 1758), and Goniocorella dumosa (Alcock, 1902). Input to CoDA is an initial instance segmentation of the coral polyp cavities (calices), from which it estimates the skeleton tree of the colony and extracts classical morphological measurements and advanced shape features of the individual corallites. CoDA also works as a proofreading and error correction tool by helping to identify wrong parts in the skeleton tree and providing tools to quickly correct these errors. The final skeleton tree enables the derivation of additional information about the calices/corallite instances that otherwise could not be obtained, including their ontogenetic generation and branching patterns - the basis of a fully quantitative statistical analysis of the coral colony morphology. Part of CoDA is CoDAGraph, a feature-rich link-and-brush user interface for visualizing the extracted features and 2D graph layouts of the skeleton tree, enabling the real-time exploration of complex coral colonies and their building blocks, the individual corallites and branches. In the future, we expect CoDA to greatly facilitate the analysis of large stony corals of different species and morphotypes, as well as other dendroid structures, enabling new insights into the influence of genetic and environmental factors on their ontogenetic morphological development.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper introduces ConStyle v2, a strong plug-and-play prompter designed to output clean visual prompts and assist U-Net Image Restoration models in handling multiple degradations. The joint training process of IRConStyle, an Image Restoration framework consisting of ConStyle and a general restoration network, is divided into two stages: first, pre-training ConStyle alone, and then freezing its weights to guide the training of the general restoration network. Three improvements are proposed in the pre-training stage to train ConStyle: unsupervised pre-training, adding a pretext task (i.e. classification), and adopting knowledge distillation. Without bells and whistles, we can get ConStyle v2, a strong prompter for all-in-one Image Restoration, in less than two GPU days and doesn't require any fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on Restormer (transformer-based), NAFNet (CNN-based), MAXIM-1S (MLP-based), and a vanilla CNN network demonstrate that ConStyle v2 can enhance any U-Net style Image Restoration models to all-in-one Image Restoration models. Furthermore, models guided by the well-trained ConStyle v2 exhibit superior performance in some specific degradation compared to ConStyle.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The inherent ambiguity of cause and effect boundaries poses a challenge in evaluating causal event extraction tasks. Traditional metrics like Exact Match and BertScore poorly reflect model performance, so we trained evaluation models to approximate human evaluation, achieving high agreement. We used them to perform Reinforcement Learning with extraction models to align them with human preference, prioritising semantic understanding. We successfully explored our approach through multiple datasets, including transferring an evaluator trained on one dataset to another as a way to decrease the reliance on human-annotated data. In that vein, we also propose a weak-to-strong supervision method that uses a fraction of the annotated data to train an evaluation model while still achieving high performance in training an RL model.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical diagnostics represents a significant advancement in managing upper gastrointestinal (GI) cancer, a major cause of global cancer mortality. Specifically for gastric cancer (GC), chronic inflammation causes changes in the mucosa such as atrophy, intestinal metaplasia (IM), dysplasia and ultimately cancer. Early detection through endoscopic regular surveillance is essential for better outcomes. Foundation models (FM), which are machine or deep learning models trained on diverse data and applicable to broad use cases, offer a promising solution to enhance the accuracy of endoscopy and its subsequent pathology image analysis. This review explores the recent advancements, applications, and challenges associated with FM in endoscopy and pathology imaging. We started by elucidating the core principles and architectures underlying these models, including their training methodologies and the pivotal role of large-scale data in developing their predictive capabilities. Moreover, this work discusses emerging trends and future research directions, emphasizing the integration of multimodal data, the development of more robust and equitable models, and the potential for real-time diagnostic support. This review aims to provide a roadmap for researchers and practitioners in navigating the complexities of incorporating FM into clinical practice for prevention/management of GC cases, thereby improving patient outcomes.</li>

The result is a discourse parser, LLaMIPa (LLaMA Incremental Parser), which is able to more fully exploit discourse context, leading to substantial performance gains over approaches that use encoder-only models to provide local, context-sensitive representations of discourse units. Furthermore, it is able to process discourse data incrementally, which is essential for the eventual use of discourse information in downstream tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>explainability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As LLMs rapidly advance, increasing concerns arise regarding risks about actual authorship of texts we see online and in real world. The task of distinguishing LLM-authored texts is complicated by the nuanced and overlapping behaviors of both machines and humans. In this paper, we challenge the current practice of considering LLM-generated text detection a binary classification task of differentiating human from AI. Instead, we introduce a novel ternary text classification scheme, adding an "undecided" category for texts that could be attributed to either source, and we show that this new category is crucial to understand how to make the detection result more explainable to lay users. This research shifts the paradigm from merely classifying to explaining machine-generated texts, emphasizing need for detectors to provide clear and understandable explanations to users. Our study involves creating four new datasets comprised of texts from various LLMs and human authors. Based on new datasets, we performed binary classification tests to ascertain the most effective SOTA detection methods and identified SOTA LLMs capable of producing harder-to-detect texts. We constructed a new dataset of texts generated by two top-performing LLMs and human authors, and asked three human annotators to produce ternary labels with explanation notes. This dataset was used to investigate how three top-performing SOTA detectors behave in new ternary classification context. Our results highlight why "undecided" category is much needed from the viewpoint of explainability. Additionally, we conducted an analysis of explainability of the three best-performing detectors and the explanation notes of the human annotators, revealing insights about the complexity of explainable detection of machine-generated texts. Finally, we propose guidelines for developing future detection systems with improved explanatory power.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) is a metabolic disorder where an individual's pancreas stops producing insulin. To compensate, they inject synthetic insulin. Computer systems, called automated insulin delivery systems, exist that inject insulin automatically. However, insulin is a dangerous hormone, where too much insulin can kill people in a matter of hours and too little insulin can kill people in a matter of days. In this paper, we take on the challenge of building a new trustworthy automated insulin delivery system, called GlucOS. In our design, we apply separation principles to keep our implementation simple, we use formal methods to prove correct the most critical parts of the system, and we design novel security mechanisms and policies to withstand malicious components and attacks on the system. We report on real world use for one individual for 6 months using GlucOS. Our data shows that for this individual, our ML-based algorithm runs safely and manages their T1D effectively. We also run our system on 21 virtual humans using simulations and show that our security and safety mechanisms enable ML to improve their core T1D measures of metabolic health by 4.3\% on average. Finally, we show that our security and safety mechanisms maintain recommended levels of control over T1D even in the face of active attacks that would have otherwise led to death. GlucOS is open source and our code is available on GitHub.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved almost human-like performance on various tasks. While some LLMs have been trained on multilingual data, most of the training data is in English; hence, their performance in English greatly exceeds other languages. To our knowledge, we are the first to collect and translate a large collection of texts, instructions, and benchmarks and train, evaluate, and release open-source LLMs tailored for Romanian. We evaluate our methods on four different categories, including academic benchmarks, MT-Bench (manually translated), and a professionally built historical, cultural, and social benchmark adapted to Romanian. We argue for the usefulness and high performance of RoLLMs by obtaining state-of-the-art results across the board. We publicly release all resources (i.e., data, training and evaluation code, models) to support and encourage research on Romanian LLMs while concurrently creating a generalizable recipe, adequate for other low or less-resourced languages.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The landscape of fake media creation changed with the introduction of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN s). Fake media creation has been on the rise with the rapid advances in generation technology, leading to new challenges in Detecting fake media. A fundamental characteristic of GAN s is their sensitivity to parameter initialization, known as seeds. Each distinct seed utilized during training leads to the creation of unique model instances, resulting in divergent image outputs despite employing the same architecture. This means that even if we have one GAN architecture, it can produce countless variations of GAN models depending on the seed used. Existing methods for attributing deepfakes work well only if they have seen the specific GAN model during training. If the GAN architectures are retrained with a different seed, these methods struggle to attribute the fakes. This seed dependency issue made it difficult to attribute deepfakes with existing methods. We proposed a generalized deepfake attribution network (GDA-N et) to attribute fake images to their respective GAN architectures, even if they are generated from a retrained version of the GAN architecture with a different seed (cross-seed) or from the fine-tuned version of the existing GAN model. Extensive experiments on cross-seed and fine-tuned data of GAN models show that our method is highly effective compared to existing methods. We have provided the source code to validate our results.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Confidence assessments of semantic segmentation algorithms in remote sensing are important. It is a desirable property of models to a priori know if they produce an incorrect output. Evaluations of the confidence assigned to the estimates of models for the task of classification in Earth Observation (EO) are crucial as they can be used to achieve improved semantic segmentation performance and prevent high error rates during inference and deployment. The model we develop, the Confidence Assessments of classification algorithms for Semantic segmentation (CAS) model, performs confidence evaluations at both the segment and pixel levels, and outputs both labels and confidence. The outcome of this work has important applications. The main application is the evaluation of EO Foundation Models on semantic segmentation downstream tasks, in particular land cover classification using satellite Copernicus Sentinel-2 data. The evaluation shows that the proposed model is effective and outperforms other alternative baseline models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Person-generic audio-driven face generation is a challenging task in computer vision. Previous methods have achieved remarkable progress in audio-visual synchronization, but there is still a significant gap between current results and practical applications. The challenges are two-fold: 1) Preserving unique individual traits for achieving high-precision lip synchronization. 2) Generating high-quality facial renderings in real-time performance. In this paper, we propose a novel generalized audio-driven framework RealTalk, which consists of an audio-to-expression transformer and a high-fidelity expression-to-face renderer. In the first component, we consider both identity and intra-personal variation features related to speaking lip movements. By incorporating cross-modal attention on the enriched facial priors, we can effectively align lip movements with audio, thus attaining greater precision in expression prediction. In the second component, we design a lightweight facial identity alignment (FIA) module which includes a lip-shape control structure and a face texture reference structure. This novel design allows us to generate fine details in real-time, without depending on sophisticated and inefficient feature alignment modules. Our experimental results, both quantitative and qualitative, on public datasets demonstrate the clear advantages of our method in terms of lip-speech synchronization and generation quality. Furthermore, our method is efficient and requires fewer computational resources, making it well-suited to meet the needs of practical applications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Some recently developed code large language models (Code LLMs) have been pre-trained on repository-level code data (Repo-Code LLMs), enabling these models to recognize repository structures and utilize cross-file information for code completion. However, in real-world development scenarios, simply concatenating the entire code repository often exceeds the context window limits of these Repo-Code LLMs, leading to significant performance degradation. In this study, we conducted extensive preliminary experiments and analyses on six Repo-Code LLMs. The results indicate that maintaining the topological dependencies of files and increasing the code file content in the completion prompts can improve completion accuracy; pruning the specific implementations of functions in all dependent files does not significantly reduce the accuracy of completions. Based on these findings, we proposed a strategy named Hierarchical Context Pruning (HCP) to construct completion prompts with high informational code content. The HCP models the code repository at the function level, maintaining the topological dependencies between code files while removing a large amount of irrelevant code content, significantly reduces the input length for repository-level code completion. We applied the HCP strategy in experiments with six Repo-Code LLMs, and the results demonstrate that our proposed method can significantly enhance completion accuracy while substantially reducing the length of input.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>When we are primarily interested in solving several problems jointly with a given prescribed high performance accuracy for each target application, then Foundation Models should for most cases be used rather than problem-specific models. We focus on the specific Computer Vision application of Foundation Models for Earth Observation (EO) and geospatial AI. These models can solve important problems we are tackling, including for example land cover classification, crop type mapping, flood segmentation, building density estimation, and road regression segmentation. In this paper, we show that for a limited number of labelled data, Foundation Models achieve improved performance compared to problem-specific models. In this work, we also present our proposed evaluation benchmark for Foundation Models for EO. Benchmarking the generalization performance of Foundation Models is important as it has become difficult to standardize a fair comparison across the many different models that have been proposed recently. We present the results using our evaluation benchmark for EO Foundation Models and show that Foundation Models are label efficient in the downstream tasks and help us solve problems we are tackling in EO and remote sensing.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid dissemination of information through social media and the Internet has posed a significant challenge for fact-checking, among others in identifying check-worthy claims that fact-checkers should pay attention to, i.e. filtering claims needing fact-checking from a large pool of sentences. This challenge has stressed the need to focus on determining the priority of claims, specifically which claims are worth to be fact-checked. Despite advancements in this area in recent years, the application of large language models (LLMs), such as GPT, has only recently drawn attention in studies. However, many open-source LLMs remain underexplored. Therefore, this study investigates the application of eight prominent open-source LLMs with fine-tuning and prompt engineering to identify check-worthy statements from political transcriptions. Further, we propose a two-step data pruning approach to automatically identify high-quality training data instances for effective learning. The efficiency of our approach is demonstrated through evaluations on the English language dataset as part of the check-worthiness estimation task of CheckThat! 2024. Further, the experiments conducted with data pruning demonstrate that competitive performance can be achieved with only about 44\% of the training data. Our team ranked first in the check-worthiness estimation task in the English language.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Acute Leukemia is the most common hematologic malignancy in children and adolescents. A key methodology in the diagnostic evaluation of this malignancy is immunophenotyping based on Multiparameter Flow Cytometry (FCM). However, this approach is manual, and thus time-consuming and subjective. To alleviate this situation, we propose in this paper the FCM-Former, a machine learning, self-attention based FCM-diagnostic tool, automating the immunophenotyping assessment in Childhood Acute Leukemia. The FCM-Former is trained in a supervised manner, by directly using flow cytometric data. Our FCM-Former achieves an accuracy of 96.5% assigning lineage to each sample among 960 cases of either acute B-cell, T-cell lymphoblastic, and acute myeloid leukemia (B-ALL, T-ALL, AML). To the best of our knowledge, the FCM-Former is the first work that automates the immunophenotyping assessment with FCM data in diagnosing pediatric Acute Leukemia.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the world with the sparks of artificial general intelligence (AGI). One opinion, especially from some startups working on LLMs, argues that an LLM with nearly unlimited context length can realize AGI. However, they might be too optimistic about the long-context capability of (existing) LLMs -- (1) Recent literature has shown that their effective context length is significantly smaller than their claimed context length; and (2) Our reasoning-in-a-haystack experiments further demonstrate that simultaneously finding the relevant information from a long context and conducting (simple) reasoning is nearly impossible. In this paper, we envision a pathway from LLMs to AGI through the integration of \emph{memory}. We believe that AGI should be a system where LLMs serve as core processors. In addition to raw data, the memory in this system would store a large number of important conclusions derived from reasoning processes. Compared with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) that merely processing raw data, this approach not only connects semantically related information closer, but also simplifies complex inferences at the time of querying. As an intermediate stage, the memory will likely be in the form of natural language descriptions, which can be directly consumed by users too. Ultimately, every agent/person should have its own large personal model, a deep neural network model (thus \emph{AI-native}) that parameterizes and compresses all types of memory, even the ones cannot be described by natural languages. Finally, we discuss the significant potential of AI-native memory as the transformative infrastructure for (proactive) engagement, personalization, distribution, and social in the AGI era, as well as the incurred privacy and security challenges with preliminary solutions.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced natural language understanding and demonstrated strong problem-solving abilities. Despite these successes, most LLMs still struggle with solving mathematical problems due to the intricate reasoning required. This paper investigates the mathematical problem-solving capabilities of LLMs using the newly developed "MathOdyssey" dataset. The dataset includes diverse mathematical problems at high school and university levels, created by experts from notable institutions to rigorously test LLMs in advanced problem-solving scenarios and cover a wider range of subject areas. By providing the MathOdyssey dataset as a resource to the AI community, we aim to contribute to the understanding and improvement of AI capabilities in complex mathematical problem-solving. We conduct benchmarking on open-source models, such as Llama-3 and DBRX-Instruct, and closed-source models from the GPT series and Gemini models. Our results indicate that while LLMs perform well on routine and moderately difficult tasks, they face significant challenges with Olympiad-level problems and complex university-level questions. Our analysis shows a narrowing performance gap between open-source and closed-source models, yet substantial challenges remain, particularly with the most demanding problems. This study highlights the ongoing need for research to enhance the mathematical reasoning of LLMs. The dataset, results, and code are publicly available.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) are known to be trained on vast amounts of data, which may unintentionally or intentionally include data from commonly used benchmarks. This inclusion can lead to cheatingly high scores on model leaderboards, yet result in disappointing performance in real-world applications. To address this benchmark contamination problem, we first propose a set of requirements that practical contamination detection methods should follow. Following these proposed requirements, we introduce PaCoST, a Paired Confidence Significance Testing to effectively detect benchmark contamination in LLMs. Our method constructs a counterpart for each piece of data with the same distribution, and performs statistical analysis of the corresponding confidence to test whether the model is significantly more confident under the original benchmark. We validate the effectiveness of PaCoST and apply it on popular open-source models and benchmarks. We find that almost all models and benchmarks we tested are suspected contaminated more or less. We finally call for new LLM evaluation methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Machine learning approaches to Structure-Based Drug Design (SBDD) have proven quite fertile over the last few years. In particular, diffusion-based approaches to SBDD have shown great promise. We present a technique which expands on this diffusion approach in two crucial ways. First, we address the size disparity between the drug molecule and the target/receptor, which makes learning more challenging and inference slower. We do so through the notion of a Virtual Receptor, which is a compressed version of the receptor; it is learned so as to preserve key aspects of the structural information of the original receptor, while respecting the relevant group equivariance. Second, we incorporate a protein language embedding used originally in the context of protein folding. We experimentally demonstrate the contributions of both the virtual receptors and the protein embeddings: in practice, they lead to both better performance, as well as significantly faster computations.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Many continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) studies adopt transformer-based architectures for sequence modeling due to their powerful capacity for capturing global contexts. Nevertheless, vanilla self-attention, which serves as the core module of the transformer, calculates a weighted average over all time steps; therefore, the local temporal semantics of sign videos may not be fully exploited. In this study, we introduce a novel module in sign language recognition studies, called intra-inter gloss attention module, to leverage the relationships among frames within glosses and the semantic and grammatical dependencies between glosses in the video. In the intra-gloss attention module, the video is divided into equally sized chunks and a self-attention mechanism is applied within each chunk. This localized self-attention significantly reduces complexity and eliminates noise introduced by considering non-relative frames. In the inter-gloss attention module, we first aggregate the chunk-level features within each gloss chunk by average pooling along the temporal dimension. Subsequently, multi-head self-attention is applied to all chunk-level features. Given the non-significance of the signer-environment interaction, we utilize segmentation to remove the background of the videos. This enables the proposed model to direct its focus toward the signer. Experimental results on the PHOENIX-2014 benchmark dataset demonstrate that our method can effectively extract sign language features in an end-to-end manner without any prior knowledge, improve the accuracy of CSLR, and achieve the word error rate (WER) of 20.4 on the test set which is a competitive result compare to the state-of-the-art which uses additional supervisions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Integrating prior knowledge of neurophysiology into neural network architecture enhances the performance of emotion decoding. While numerous techniques emphasize learning spatial and short-term temporal patterns, there has been limited emphasis on capturing the vital long-term contextual information associated with emotional cognitive processes. In order to address this discrepancy, we introduce a novel transformer model called emotion transformer (EmT). EmT is designed to excel in both generalized cross-subject EEG emotion classification and regression tasks. In EmT, EEG signals are transformed into a temporal graph format, creating a sequence of EEG feature graphs using a temporal graph construction module (TGC). A novel residual multi-view pyramid GCN module (RMPG) is then proposed to learn dynamic graph representations for each EEG feature graph within the series, and the learned representations of each graph are fused into one token. Furthermore, we design a temporal contextual transformer module (TCT) with two types of token mixers to learn the temporal contextual information. Finally, the task-specific output module (TSO) generates the desired outputs. Experiments on four publicly available datasets show that EmT achieves higher results than the baseline methods for both EEG emotion classification and regression tasks.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Graph neural networks (GNNs) excel in learning from network-like data but often lack interpretability, making their application challenging in domains requiring transparent decision-making. We propose the Graph Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (GKAN), a novel GNN model leveraging spline-based activation functions on edges to enhance both accuracy and interpretability. Our experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that GKAN outperforms state-of-the-art GNN models in node classification, link prediction, and graph classification tasks. In addition to the improved accuracy, GKAN's design inherently provides clear insights into the model's decision-making process, eliminating the need for post-hoc explainability techniques. This paper discusses the methodology, performance, and interpretability of GKAN, highlighting its potential for applications in domains where interpretability is crucial.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models have demonstrated their effectiveness across various generative tasks. However, when applied to medical image segmentation, these models encounter several challenges, including significant resource and time requirements. They also necessitate a multi-step reverse process and multiple samples to produce reliable predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce the first latent diffusion segmentation model, named SDSeg, built upon stable diffusion (SD). SDSeg incorporates a straightforward latent estimation strategy to facilitate a single-step reverse process and utilizes latent fusion concatenation to remove the necessity for multiple samples. Extensive experiments indicate that SDSeg surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods on five benchmark datasets featuring diverse imaging modalities. Remarkably, SDSeg is capable of generating stable predictions with a solitary reverse step and sample, epitomizing the model's stability as implied by its name.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the continuous advancement of artificial intelligence, natural language processing technology has become widely utilized in various fields. At the same time, there are many challenges in creating Chinese news summaries. First of all, the semantics of Chinese news is complex, and the amount of information is enormous. Extracting critical information from Chinese news presents a significant challenge. Second, the news summary should be concise and clear, focusing on the main content and avoiding redundancy. In addition, the particularity of the Chinese language, such as polysemy, word segmentation, etc., makes it challenging to generate Chinese news summaries. Based on the above, this paper studies the information extraction method of the LCSTS dataset based on an improved BERTSum-LSTM model. We improve the BERTSum-LSTM model to make it perform better in generating Chinese news summaries. The experimental results show that the proposed method has a good effect on creating news summaries, which is of great importance to the construction of news summaries.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The evaluation of natural language generation (NLG) tasks is a significant and longstanding research issue. With the recent emergence of powerful large language models (LLMs), some studies have turned to LLM-based automatic evaluation methods, which demonstrate great potential to become a new evaluation paradigm following traditional string-based and model-based metrics. However, despite the improved performance of existing methods, they still possess some deficiencies, such as dependency on references and limited evaluation flexibility. Therefore, in this paper, we meticulously construct a large-scale NLG evaluation corpus NLG-Eval with human and GPT-4 annotations to alleviate the lack of relevant data in this field. Furthermore, we propose Themis, an LLM dedicated to NLG evaluation, which has been trained with our designed multi-perspective consistency and rating-oriented preference alignment methods. Themis can conduct flexible and interpretable evaluations without references, and it exhibits superior evaluation performance on various NLG tasks, simultaneously generalizing well to unseen tasks and surpassing other evaluation models, including GPT-4.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>AI-based diagnoses have demonstrated dermatologist-level performance in classifying skin cancer. However, such systems are prone to under-performing when tested on data from minority groups that lack sufficient representation in the training sets. Although data collection and annotation offer the best means for promoting minority groups, these processes are costly and time-consuming. Prior works have suggested that data from majority groups may serve as a valuable information source to supplement the training of diagnosis tools for minority groups. In this work, we propose an effective diffusion-based augmentation framework that maximizes the use of rich information from majority groups to benefit minority groups. Using groups with different skin types as a case study, our results show that the proposed framework can generate synthetic images that improve diagnostic results for the minority groups, even when there is little or no reference data from these target groups. The practical value of our work is evident in medical imaging analysis, where under-diagnosis persists as a problem for certain groups due to insufficient representation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Binary malware summarization aims to automatically generate human-readable descriptions of malware behaviors from executable files, facilitating tasks like malware cracking and detection. Previous methods based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great promise. However, they still face significant issues, including poor usability, inaccurate explanations, and incomplete summaries, primarily due to the obscure pseudocode structure and the lack of malware training summaries. Further, calling relationships between functions, which involve the rich interactions within a binary malware, remain largely underexplored. To this end, we propose MALSIGHT, a novel code summarization framework that can iteratively generate descriptions of binary malware by exploring malicious source code and benign pseudocode. Specifically, we construct the first malware summaries, MalS and MalP, using an LLM and manually refine this dataset with human effort. At the training stage, we tune our proposed MalT5, a novel LLM-based code model, on the MalS dataset and a benign pseudocode dataset. Then, at the test stage, we iteratively feed the pseudocode functions into MalT5 to obtain the summary. Such a procedure facilitates the understanding of pseudocode structure and captures the intricate interactions between functions, thereby benefiting the usability, accuracy, and completeness of summaries. Additionally, we propose a novel evaluation benchmark, BLEURT-sum, to measure the quality of summaries. Experiments on three datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed MALSIGHT. Notably, our proposed MalT5, with only 0.77B parameters, delivers comparable performance to much larger ChatGPT3.5.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in applications where the model selects from competing third-party content, such as in LLM-powered search engines or chatbot plugins. In this paper, we introduce Preference Manipulation Attacks, a new class of attacks that manipulate an LLM's selections to favor the attacker. We demonstrate that carefully crafted website content or plugin documentations can trick an LLM to promote the attacker products and discredit competitors, thereby increasing user traffic and monetization. We show this leads to a prisoner's dilemma, where all parties are incentivized to launch attacks, but the collective effect degrades the LLM's outputs for everyone. We demonstrate our attacks on production LLM search engines (Bing and Perplexity) and plugin APIs (for GPT-4 and Claude). As LLMs are increasingly used to rank third-party content, we expect Preference Manipulation Attacks to emerge as a significant threat.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the development of precise positioning technology, a growing number of location-based services (LBSs) facilitate people's life. Most LBSs require proof of location (PoL) to prove that the user satisfies the service requirement, which exposes the user's privacy. In this paper, we propose a zero-knowledge proof of location (zk-PoL) protocol to better protect the user's privacy. With the zk-PoL protocol, the user can choose necessary information to expose to the server, so that hierarchical privacy protection can be achieved. The evaluation shows that the zk-PoL has excellent security to resist main attacks, moreover the computational efficiency is independent of input parameters and the zk-PoL is appropriate to delay-tolerant LBSs.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have the capacity to store and recall facts. Through experimentation with open-source models, we observe that this ability to retrieve facts can be easily manipulated by changing contexts, even without altering their factual meanings. These findings highlight that LLMs might behave like an associative memory model where certain tokens in the contexts serve as clues to retrieving facts. We mathematically explore this property by studying how transformers, the building blocks of LLMs, can complete such memory tasks. We study a simple latent concept association problem with a one-layer transformer and we show theoretically and empirically that the transformer gathers information using self-attention and uses the value matrix for associative memory.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>It is widely acknowledged that large language models (LLMs) encode a vast reservoir of knowledge after being trained on mass data. Recent studies disclose knowledge conflicts in LLM generation, wherein outdated or incorrect parametric knowledge (i.e., encoded knowledge) contradicts new knowledge provided in the context. To mitigate such knowledge conflicts, we propose a novel framework, IRCAN (Identifying and Reweighting Context-Aware Neurons) to capitalize on neurons that are crucial in processing contextual cues. Specifically, IRCAN first identifies neurons that significantly contribute to context processing, utilizing a context-aware attribution score derived from integrated gradients. Subsequently, the identified context-aware neurons are strengthened via reweighting. In doing so, we steer LLMs to generate context-sensitive outputs with respect to the new knowledge provided in the context. Extensive experiments conducted across a variety of models and tasks demonstrate that IRCAN not only achieves remarkable improvements in handling knowledge conflicts but also offers a scalable, plug-andplay solution that can be integrated seamlessly with existing models.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We make the first steps towards diffusion models for unconditional generation of multivariate and Arctic-wide sea-ice states. While targeting to reduce the computational costs by diffusion in latent space, latent diffusion models also offer the possibility to integrate physical knowledge into the generation process. We tailor latent diffusion models to sea-ice physics with a censored Gaussian distribution in data space to generate data that follows the physical bounds of the modelled variables. Our latent diffusion models reach similar scores as the diffusion model trained in data space, but they smooth the generated fields as caused by the latent mapping. While enforcing physical bounds cannot reduce the smoothing, it improves the representation of the marginal ice zone. Therefore, for large-scale Earth system modelling, latent diffusion models can have many advantages compared to diffusion in data space if the significant barrier of smoothing can be resolved.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper investigates a 2D to 3D image translation method with a straightforward technique, enabling correlated 2D X-ray to 3D CT-like reconstruction. We observe that existing approaches, which integrate information across multiple 2D views in the latent space, lose valuable signal information during latent encoding. Instead, we simply repeat and concatenate the 2D views into higher-channel 3D volumes and approach the 3D reconstruction challenge as a straightforward 3D to 3D generative modeling problem, sidestepping several complex modeling issues. This method enables the reconstructed 3D volume to retain valuable information from the 2D inputs, which are passed between channel states in a Swin UNETR backbone. Our approach applies neural optimal transport, which is fast and stable to train, effectively integrating signal information across multiple views without the requirement for precise alignment; it produces non-collapsed reconstructions that are highly faithful to the 2D views, even after limited training. We demonstrate correlated results, both qualitatively and quantitatively, having trained our model on a single dataset and evaluated its generalization ability across six datasets, including out-of-distribution samples.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we focus on training an open-set object detector under the condition of scarce training samples, which should distinguish the known and unknown categories. Under this challenging scenario, the decision boundaries of unknowns are difficult to learn and often ambiguous. To mitigate this issue, we develop a novel open-set object detection framework, which delves into conditional evidence decoupling for the unknown rejection. Specifically, we select pseudo-unknown samples by leveraging the discrepancy in attribution gradients between known and unknown classes, alleviating the inadequate unknown distribution coverage of training data. Subsequently, we propose a Conditional Evidence Decoupling Loss (CEDL) based on Evidential Deep Learning (EDL) theory, which decouples known and unknown properties in pseudo-unknown samples to learn distinct knowledge, enhancing separability between knowns and unknowns. Additionally, we propose an Abnormality Calibration Loss (ACL), which serves as a regularization term to adjust the output probability distribution, establishing robust decision boundaries for the unknown rejection. Our method has achieved the superiority performance over previous state-of-the-art approaches, improving the mean recall of unknown class by 7.24% across all shots in VOC10-5-5 dataset settings and 1.38% in VOC-COCO dataset settings.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generating event graphs from long documents is challenging due to the inherent complexity of multiple tasks involved such as detecting events, identifying their relationships, and reconciling unstructured input with structured graphs. Recent studies typically consider all events with equal importance, failing to distinguish salient events crucial for understanding narratives. This paper presents CALLMSAE, a CAscading Large Language Model framework for SAlient Event graph generation, which leverages the capabilities of LLMs and eliminates the need for costly human annotations. We first identify salient events by prompting LLMs to generate summaries, from which salient events are identified. Next, we develop an iterative code refinement prompting strategy to generate event relation graphs, removing hallucinated relations and recovering missing edges. Fine-tuning contextualised graph generation models on the LLM-generated graphs outperforms the models trained on CAEVO-generated data.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Despite extensive research on adversarial training strategies to improve robustness, the decisions of even the most robust deep learning models can still be quite sensitive to imperceptible perturbations, creating serious risks when deploying them for high-stakes real-world applications. While detecting such cases may be critical, evaluating a model's vulnerability at a per-instance level using adversarial attacks is computationally too intensive and unsuitable for real-time deployment scenarios. The input space margin is the exact score to detect non-robust samples and is intractable for deep neural networks. This paper introduces the concept of margin consistency -- a property that links the input space margins and the logit margins in robust models -- for efficient detection of vulnerable samples. First, we establish that margin consistency is a necessary and sufficient condition to use a model's logit margin as a score for identifying non-robust samples. Next, through comprehensive empirical analysis of various robustly trained models on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets, we show that they indicate strong margin consistency with a strong correlation between their input space margins and the logit margins. Then, we show that we can effectively use the logit margin to confidently detect brittle decisions with such models and accurately estimate robust accuracy on an arbitrarily large test set by estimating the input margins only on a small subset. Finally, we address cases where the model is not sufficiently margin-consistent by learning a pseudo-margin from the feature representation. Our findings highlight the potential of leveraging deep representations to efficiently assess adversarial vulnerability in deployment scenarios.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent surge in large-scale generative models has spurred the development of vast fields in computer vision. In particular, text-to-image diffusion models have garnered widespread adoption across diverse domain due to their potential for high-fidelity image generation. Nonetheless, existing large-scale diffusion models are confined to generate images of up to 1K resolution, which is far from meeting the demands of contemporary commercial applications. Directly sampling higher-resolution images often yields results marred by artifacts such as object repetition and distorted shapes. Addressing the aforementioned issues typically necessitates training or fine-tuning models on higher resolution datasets. However, this undertaking poses a formidable challenge due to the difficulty in collecting large-scale high-resolution contents and substantial computational resources. While several preceding works have proposed alternatives, they often fail to produce convincing results. In this work, we probe the generative ability of diffusion models at higher resolution beyond its original capability and propose a novel progressive approach that fully utilizes generated low-resolution image to guide the generation of higher resolution image. Our method obviates the need for additional training or fine-tuning which significantly lowers the burden of computational costs. Extensive experiments and results validate the efficiency and efficacy of our method.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recently, various methods have been proposed to create open-domain conversational agents with Large Language Models (LLMs). These models are able to answer user queries, but in a one-way Q&A format rather than a true conversation. Fine-tuning on particular datasets is the usual way to modify their style to increase conversational ability, but this is expensive and usually only available in a few languages. In this study, we explore role-play zero-shot prompting as an efficient and cost-effective solution for open-domain conversation, using capable multilingual LLMs (Beeching et al., 2023) trained to obey instructions. We design a prompting system that, when combined with an instruction-following model - here Vicuna (Chiang et al., 2023) - produces conversational agents that match and even surpass fine-tuned models in human evaluation in French in two different tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Surgical phase recognition is a key task in computer-assisted surgery, aiming to automatically identify and categorize the different phases within a surgical procedure. Despite substantial advancements, most current approaches rely on fully supervised training, requiring expensive and time-consuming frame-level annotations. Timestamp supervision has recently emerged as a promising alternative, significantly reducing annotation costs while maintaining competitive performance. However, models trained on timestamp annotations can be negatively impacted by missing phase annotations, leading to a potential drawback in real-world scenarios. In this work, we address this issue by proposing a robust method for surgical phase recognition that can handle missing phase annotations effectively. Furthermore, we introduce the SkipTag@K annotation approach to the surgical domain, enabling a flexible balance between annotation effort and model performance. Our method achieves competitive results on two challenging datasets, demonstrating its efficacy in handling missing phase annotations and its potential for reducing annotation costs. Specifically, we achieve an accuracy of 85.1\% on the MultiBypass140 dataset using only 3 annotated frames per video, showcasing the effectiveness of our method and the potential of the SkipTag@K setup. We perform extensive experiments to validate the robustness of our method and provide valuable insights to guide future research in surgical phase recognition. Our work contributes to the advancement of surgical workflow recognition and paves the way for more efficient and reliable surgical phase recognition systems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, attack, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated learning (FL), a novel branch of distributed machine learning (ML), develops global models through a private procedure without direct access to local datasets. However, it is still possible to access the model updates (gradient updates of deep neural networks) transferred between clients and servers, potentially revealing sensitive local information to adversaries using model inversion attacks. Differential privacy (DP) offers a promising approach to addressing this issue by adding noise to the parameters. On the other hand, heterogeneities in data structure, storage, communication, and computational capabilities of devices can cause convergence problems and delays in developing the global model. A personalized weighted averaging of local parameters based on the resources of each device can yield a better aggregated model in each round. In this paper, to efficiently preserve privacy, we propose a personalized DP framework that injects noise based on clients' relative impact factors and aggregates parameters while considering heterogeneities and adjusting properties. To fulfill the DP requirements, we first analyze the convergence boundary of the FL algorithm when impact factors are personalized and fixed throughout the learning process. We then further study the convergence property considering time-varying (adaptive) impact factors.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce WildGuard -- an open, light-weight moderation tool for LLM safety that achieves three goals: (1) identifying malicious intent in user prompts, (2) detecting safety risks of model responses, and (3) determining model refusal rate. Together, WildGuard serves the increasing needs for automatic safety moderation and evaluation of LLM interactions, providing a one-stop tool with enhanced accuracy and broad coverage across 13 risk categories. While existing open moderation tools such as Llama-Guard2 score reasonably well in classifying straightforward model interactions, they lag far behind a prompted GPT-4, especially in identifying adversarial jailbreaks and in evaluating models' refusals, a key measure for evaluating safety behaviors in model responses. To address these challenges, we construct WildGuardMix, a large-scale and carefully balanced multi-task safety moderation dataset with 92K labeled examples that cover vanilla (direct) prompts and adversarial jailbreaks, paired with various refusal and compliance responses. WildGuardMix is a combination of WildGuardTrain, the training data of WildGuard, and WildGuardTest, a high-quality human-annotated moderation test set with 5K labeled items covering broad risk scenarios. Through extensive evaluations on WildGuardTest and ten existing public benchmarks, we show that WildGuard establishes state-of-the-art performance in open-source safety moderation across all the three tasks compared to ten strong existing open-source moderation models (e.g., up to 26.4% improvement on refusal detection). Importantly, WildGuard matches and sometimes exceeds GPT-4 performance (e.g., up to 3.9% improvement on prompt harmfulness identification). WildGuard serves as a highly effective safety moderator in an LLM interface, reducing the success rate of jailbreak attacks from 79.8% to 2.4%.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) have shown the emergent capability of in-context learning (ICL). One line of research has explained ICL as functionally performing gradient descent. In this paper, we introduce a new way of diagnosing whether ICL is functionally equivalent to gradient-based learning. Our approach is based on the inverse frequency effect (IFE) -- a phenomenon in which an error-driven learner is expected to show larger updates when trained on infrequent examples than frequent ones. The IFE has previously been studied in psycholinguistics because humans show this effect in the context of structural priming (the tendency for people to produce sentence structures they have encountered recently); the IFE has been used as evidence that human structural priming must involve error-driven learning mechanisms. In our experiments, we simulated structural priming within ICL and found that LLMs display the IFE, with the effect being stronger in larger models. We conclude that ICL is indeed a type of gradient-based learning, supporting the hypothesis that a gradient component is implicitly computed in the forward pass during ICL. Our results suggest that both humans and LLMs make use of gradient-based, error-driven processing mechanisms.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Can emergent language models faithfully model the intelligence of decision-making agents? Though modern language models exhibit already some reasoning ability, and theoretically can potentially express any probable distribution over tokens, it remains underexplored how the world knowledge these pretrained models have memorized can be utilized to comprehend an agent's behaviour in the physical world. This study empirically examines, for the first time, how well large language models (LLMs) can build a mental model of agents, termed agent mental modelling, by reasoning about an agent's behaviour and its effect on states from agent interaction history. This research may unveil the potential of leveraging LLMs for elucidating RL agent behaviour, addressing a key challenge in eXplainable reinforcement learning (XRL). To this end, we propose specific evaluation metrics and test them on selected RL task datasets of varying complexity, reporting findings on agent mental model establishment. Our results disclose that LLMs are not yet capable of fully mental modelling agents through inference alone without further innovations. This work thus provides new insights into the capabilities and limitations of modern LLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce WildTeaming, an automatic LLM safety red-teaming framework that mines in-the-wild user-chatbot interactions to discover 5.7K unique clusters of novel jailbreak tactics, and then composes multiple tactics for systematic exploration of novel jailbreaks. Compared to prior work that performed red-teaming via recruited human workers, gradient-based optimization, or iterative revision with LLMs, our work investigates jailbreaks from chatbot users who were not specifically instructed to break the system. WildTeaming reveals previously unidentified vulnerabilities of frontier LLMs, resulting in up to 4.6x more diverse and successful adversarial attacks compared to state-of-the-art jailbreak methods. While many datasets exist for jailbreak evaluation, very few open-source datasets exist for jailbreak training, as safety training data has been closed even when model weights are open. With WildTeaming we create WildJailbreak, a large-scale open-source synthetic safety dataset with 262K vanilla (direct request) and adversarial (complex jailbreak) prompt-response pairs. To mitigate exaggerated safety behaviors, WildJailbreak provides two contrastive types of queries: 1) harmful queries (vanilla & adversarial) and 2) benign queries that resemble harmful queries in form but contain no harm. As WildJailbreak considerably upgrades the quality and scale of existing safety resources, it uniquely enables us to examine the scaling effects of data and the interplay of data properties and model capabilities during safety training. Through extensive experiments, we identify the training properties that enable an ideal balance of safety behaviors: appropriate safeguarding without over-refusal, effective handling of vanilla and adversarial queries, and minimal, if any, decrease in general capabilities. All components of WildJailbeak contribute to achieving balanced safety behaviors of models.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Explanations form the foundation of knowledge sharing and build upon communication principles, social dynamics, and learning theories. We focus specifically on conversational approaches for explanations because the context is highly adaptive and interactive. Our research leverages previous work on explanatory acts, a framework for understanding the different strategies that explainers and explainees employ in a conversation to both explain, understand, and engage with the other party. We use the 5-Levels dataset was constructed from the WIRED YouTube series by Wachsmuth et al., and later annotated by Booshehri et al. with explanatory acts. These annotations provide a framework for understanding how explainers and explainees structure their response when crafting a response. With the rise of generative AI in the past year, we hope to better understand the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and how they can augment expert explainer's capabilities in conversational settings. To achieve this goal, the 5-Levels dataset (We use Booshehri et al.'s 2023 annotated dataset with explanatory acts.) allows us to audit the ability of LLMs in engaging in explanation dialogues. To evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in generating explainer responses, we compared 3 different strategies, we asked human annotators to evaluate 3 different strategies: human explainer response, GPT4 standard response, GPT4 response with Explanation Moves.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Although deep learning-based image restoration methods have made significant progress, they still struggle with limited generalization to real-world scenarios due to the substantial domain gap caused by training on synthetic data. Existing methods address this issue by improving data synthesis pipelines, estimating degradation kernels, employing deep internal learning, and performing domain adaptation and regularization. Previous domain adaptation methods have sought to bridge the domain gap by learning domain-invariant knowledge in either feature or pixel space. However, these techniques often struggle to extend to low-level vision tasks within a stable and compact framework. In this paper, we show that it is possible to perform domain adaptation via the noise-space using diffusion models. In particular, by leveraging the unique property of how the multi-step denoising process is influenced by auxiliary conditional inputs, we obtain meaningful gradients from noise prediction to gradually align the restored results of both synthetic and real-world data to a common clean distribution. We refer to this method as denoising as adaptation. To prevent shortcuts during training, we present useful techniques such as channel shuffling and residual-swapping contrastive learning. Experimental results on three classical image restoration tasks, namely denoising, deblurring, and deraining, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Chart understanding plays a pivotal role when applying Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to real-world tasks such as analyzing scientific papers or financial reports. However, existing datasets often focus on oversimplified and homogeneous charts with template-based questions, leading to an over-optimistic measure of progress. We demonstrate that although open-source models can appear to outperform strong proprietary models on these benchmarks, a simple stress test with slightly different charts or questions can deteriorate performance by up to 34.5%. In this work, we propose CharXiv, a comprehensive evaluation suite involving 2,323 natural, challenging, and diverse charts from arXiv papers. CharXiv includes two types of questions: 1) descriptive questions about examining basic chart elements and 2) reasoning questions that require synthesizing information across complex visual elements in the chart. To ensure quality, all charts and questions are handpicked, curated, and verified by human experts. Our results reveal a substantial, previously underestimated gap between the reasoning skills of the strongest proprietary model (i.e., GPT-4o), which achieves 47.1% accuracy, and the strongest open-source model (i.e., InternVL Chat V1.5), which achieves 29.2%. All models lag far behind human performance of 80.5%, underscoring weaknesses in the chart understanding capabilities of existing MLLMs. We hope CharXiv facilitates future research on MLLM chart understanding by providing a more realistic and faithful measure of progress.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce MultiDiff, a novel approach for consistent novel view synthesis of scenes from a single RGB image. The task of synthesizing novel views from a single reference image is highly ill-posed by nature, as there exist multiple, plausible explanations for unobserved areas. To address this issue, we incorporate strong priors in form of monocular depth predictors and video-diffusion models. Monocular depth enables us to condition our model on warped reference images for the target views, increasing geometric stability. The video-diffusion prior provides a strong proxy for 3D scenes, allowing the model to learn continuous and pixel-accurate correspondences across generated images. In contrast to approaches relying on autoregressive image generation that are prone to drifts and error accumulation, MultiDiff jointly synthesizes a sequence of frames yielding high-quality and multi-view consistent results -- even for long-term scene generation with large camera movements, while reducing inference time by an order of magnitude. For additional consistency and image quality improvements, we introduce a novel, structured noise distribution. Our experimental results demonstrate that MultiDiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the challenging, real-world datasets RealEstate10K and ScanNet. Finally, our model naturally supports multi-view consistent editing without the need for further tuning.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of NLP. Notably, their in-context learning capabilities also enable their use as evaluation metrics for natural language generation, making them particularly advantageous in low-resource scenarios and time-restricted applications. In this work, we introduce PrExMe, a large-scale prompt exploration for metrics, where we evaluate more than 720 prompt templates for open-source LLM-based metrics on machine translation (MT) and summarization datasets, totalling over 6.6M evaluations. This extensive comparison (1) serves as a benchmark of the performance of recent open-source LLMs as metrics and (2) explores the stability and variability of different prompting strategies. We discover that, on the one hand, there are scenarios for which prompts are stable. For instance, some LLMs show idiosyncratic preferences and favor to grade generated texts with textual labels while others prefer to return numeric scores. On the other hand, the stability of prompts and model rankings can be susceptible to seemingly innocuous changes. For example, changing the requested output format from "0 to 100" to "-1 to +1" can strongly affect the rankings in our evaluation. Our study contributes to understanding the impact of different prompting approaches on LLM-based metrics for MT and summarization evaluation, highlighting the most stable prompting patterns and potential limitations.</li>

While language agents have demonstrated impressive capabilities for many real-world tasks, a fundamental limitation of current language agents research is that they are model-centric, or engineering-centric. That's to say, the progress on prompts, tools, and pipelines of language agents requires substantial manual engineering efforts from human experts rather than automatically learning from data. We believe the transition from model-centric, or engineering-centric, to data-centric, i.e., the ability of language agents to autonomously learn and evolve in environments, is the key for them to possibly achieve AGI. In this work, we introduce agent symbolic learning, a systematic framework that enables language agents to optimize themselves on their own in a data-centric way using symbolic optimizers. Specifically, we consider agents as symbolic networks where learnable weights are defined by prompts, tools, and the way they are stacked together. Agent symbolic learning is designed to optimize the symbolic network within language agents by mimicking two fundamental algorithms in connectionist learning: back-propagation and gradient descent. Instead of dealing with numeric weights, agent symbolic learning works with natural language simulacrums of weights, loss, and gradients. We conduct proof-of-concept experiments on both standard benchmarks and complex real-world tasks and show that agent symbolic learning enables language agents to update themselves after being created and deployed in the wild, resulting in "self-evolving agents".</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Concept-based interpretability methods offer a lens into the internals of foundation models by decomposing their embeddings into high-level concepts. These concept representations are most useful when they are compositional, meaning that the individual concepts compose to explain the full sample. We show that existing unsupervised concept extraction methods find concepts which are not compositional. To automatically discover compositional concept representations, we identify two salient properties of such representations, and propose Compositional Concept Extraction (CCE) for finding concepts which obey these properties. We evaluate CCE on five different datasets over image and text data. Our evaluation shows that CCE finds more compositional concept representations than baselines and yields better accuracy on four downstream classification tasks.
