<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Although semantic communication (SC) has shown its potential in efficiently transmitting multi-modal data such as text, speeches and images, SC for videos has focused primarily on pixel-level reconstruction. However, these SC systems may be suboptimal for downstream intelligent tasks. Moreover, SC systems without pixel-level video reconstruction present advantages by achieving higher bandwidth efficiency and real-time performance of various intelligent tasks. The difficulty in such system design lies in the extraction of task-related compact semantic representations and their accurate delivery over noisy channels. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end SC system for video question answering (VideoQA) tasks called VideoQA-SC. Our goal is to accomplish VideoQA tasks directly based on video semantics over noisy or fading wireless channels, bypassing the need for video reconstruction at the receiver. To this end, we develop a spatiotemporal semantic encoder for effective video semantic extraction, and a learning-based bandwidth-adaptive deep joint source-channel coding (DJSCC) scheme for efficient and robust video semantic transmission. Experiments demonstrate that VideoQA-SC outperforms traditional and advanced DJSCC-based SC systems that rely on video reconstruction at the receiver under a wide range of channel conditions and bandwidth constraints. In particular, when the signal-to-noise ratio is low, VideoQA-SC can improve the answer accuracy by 5.17% while saving almost 99.5% of the bandwidth at the same time, compared with the advanced DJSCC-based SC system. Our results show the great potential of task-oriented SC system design for video applications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The recent success of pre-trained diffusion models unlocks the possibility of the automatic generation of textures for arbitrary 3D meshes in the wild. However, these models are trained in the screen space, while converting them to a multi-view consistent texture image poses a major obstacle to the output quality. In this paper, we propose a novel method to enforce multi-view consistency. Our method is based on the observation that latent space in a pre-trained diffusion model is noised separately for each camera view, making it difficult to achieve multi-view consistency by directly manipulating the latent codes. Based on the celebrated Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) scheme, we propose to use an optimization-based color-fusion to enforce consistency and indirectly modify the latent codes by gradient back-propagation. Our method further relaxes the sequential dependency assumption among the camera views. By evaluating on a series of general 3D models, we find our simple approach improves consistency and overall quality of the generated textures as compared to competing state-of-the-arts.

          Fully Exploiting Every Real Sample: SuperPixel Sample Gradient Model Stealing(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>defense, steal, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Model stealing (MS) involves querying and observing the output of a machine learning model to steal its capabilities. The quality of queried data is crucial, yet obtaining a large amount of real data for MS is often challenging. Recent works have reduced reliance on real data by using generative models. However, when high-dimensional query data is required, these methods are impractical due to the high costs of querying and the risk of model collapse. In this work, we propose using sample gradients (SG) to enhance the utility of each real sample, as SG provides crucial guidance on the decision boundaries of the victim model. However, utilizing SG in the model stealing scenario faces two challenges: 1. Pixel-level gradient estimation requires extensive query volume and is susceptible to defenses. 2. The estimation of sample gradients has a significant variance. This paper proposes Superpixel Sample Gradient stealing (SPSG) for model stealing under the constraint of limited real samples. With the basic idea of imitating the victim model's low-variance patch-level gradients instead of pixel-level gradients, SPSG achieves efficient sample gradient estimation through two steps. First, we perform patch-wise perturbations on query images to estimate the average gradient in different regions of the image. Then, we filter the gradients through a threshold strategy to reduce variance. Exhaustive experiments demonstrate that, with the same number of real samples, SPSG achieves accuracy, agreements, and adversarial success rate significantly surpassing the current state-of-the-art MS methods.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In recent years, point cloud normal estimation, as a classical and foundational algorithm, has garnered extensive attention in the field of 3D geometric processing. Despite the remarkable performance achieved by current Neural Network-based methods, their robustness is still influenced by the quality of training data and the models' performance. In this study, we designed a fundamental framework for normal estimation, enhancing existing model through the incorporation of global information and various constraint mechanisms. Additionally, we employed a confidence-based strategy to select the reasonable samples for fair and robust network training. The introduced sample confidence can be integrated into the loss function to balance the influence of different samples on model training. Finally, we utilized existing orientation methods to correct estimated non-oriented normals, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both oriented and non-oriented tasks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method works well on the widely used benchmarks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Integrated sensing and communications is a key enabler for the 6G wireless communication systems. The multiple sensing modalities will allow the base station to have a more accurate representation of the environment, leading to context-aware communications. Some widely equipped sensors such as cameras and RADAR sensors can provide some environmental perceptions. However, they are not enough to generate precise environmental representations, especially in adverse weather conditions. On the other hand, the LiDAR sensors provide more accurate representations, however, their widespread adoption is hindered by their high cost. This paper proposes a novel approach to enhance the wireless communication systems by synthesizing LiDAR point clouds from images and RADAR data. Specifically, it uses a multimodal transformer architecture and pre-trained encoding models to enable an accurate LiDAR generation. The proposed framework is evaluated on the DeepSense 6G dataset, which is a real-world dataset curated for context-aware wireless applications. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in accurately generating LiDAR point clouds. We achieve a modified mean squared error of 10.3931. Visual examination of the images indicates that our model can successfully capture the majority of structures present in the LiDAR point cloud for diverse environments. This will enable the base stations to achieve more precise environmental sensing. By integrating LiDAR synthesis with existing sensing modalities, our method can enhance the performance of various wireless applications, including beam and blockage prediction.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Feature extraction is a critical technology to realize the automatic transmission of feature information throughout product life cycles. As CAD models primarily capture the 3D geometry of products, feature extraction heavily relies on geometric information. However, existing feature extraction methods often yield inaccurate outcomes due to the diverse interpretations of geometric information. This report presents a set-based feature extraction approach to address this uncertainty issue. Unlike existing methods that seek accurate feature results, our approach aims to transform the uncertainty of geometric information into a set of feature subgraphs. First, we define the convexity of basic geometric entities and introduce the concept of two-level attributed adjacency graphs. Second, a feature extraction workflow is designed to determine feature boundaries and identify feature subgraphs from CAD models. This set of feature subgraphs can be used for further feature recognition. A feature extraction system is programmed using C++ and UG/Open to demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed approach.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Ubiquitous applications of Deep neural networks (DNNs) in different artificial intelligence systems have led to their adoption in solving challenging visualization problems in recent years. While sophisticated DNNs offer an impressive generalization, it is imperative to comprehend the quality, confidence, robustness, and uncertainty associated with their prediction. A thorough understanding of these quantities produces actionable insights that help application scientists make informed decisions. Unfortunately, the intrinsic design principles of the DNNs cannot beget prediction uncertainty, necessitating separate formulations for robust uncertainty-aware models for diverse visualization applications. To that end, this contribution demonstrates how the prediction uncertainty and sensitivity of DNNs can be estimated efficiently using various methods and then interactively compared and contrasted for deep image synthesis tasks. Our inspection suggests that uncertainty-aware deep visualization models generate illustrations of informative and superior quality and diversity. Furthermore, prediction uncertainty improves the robustness and interpretability of deep visualization models, making them practical and convenient for various scientific domains that thrive on visual analyses.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper introduces an innovative multi-modal fusion deep learning approach to overcome the drawbacks of traditional single-modal recognition techniques. These drawbacks include incomplete information and limited diagnostic accuracy. During the feature extraction stage, cutting-edge deep learning models including convolutional neural networks (CNN), recurrent neural networks (RNN), and transformers are applied to distill advanced features from image-based, temporal, and structured data sources. The fusion strategy component seeks to determine the optimal fusion mode tailored to the specific disease recognition task. In the experimental section, a comparison is made between the performance of the proposed multi-mode fusion model and existing single-mode recognition methods. The findings demonstrate significant advantages of the multimodal fusion model across multiple evaluation metrics.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>protect</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Protecting and restoring forest ecosystems is critical for biodiversity conservation and carbon sequestration. Forest monitoring on a global scale is essential for prioritizing and assessing conservation efforts. Satellite-based remote sensing is the only viable solution for providing global coverage, but to date, large-scale forest monitoring is limited to single modalities and single time points. In this paper, we present a dataset consisting of data from five public satellites for recognizing forest plantations and planted tree species across the globe. Each satellite modality consists of a multi-year time series. The dataset, named \PlantD, includes over 2M examples of 64 tree label classes (46 genera and 40 species), distributed among 41 countries. This dataset is released to foster research in forest monitoring using multimodal, multi-scale, multi-temporal data sources. Additionally, we present initial baseline results and evaluate modality fusion and data augmentation approaches for this dataset.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>How to extract instance-level masks without instance-level supervision is the main challenge of weakly supervised instance segmentation (WSIS). Popular WSIS methods estimate a displacement field (DF) via learning inter-pixel relations and perform clustering to identify instances. However, the resulting instance centroids are inherently unstable and vary significantly across different clustering algorithms. In this paper, we propose Boundary-Assisted Instance Segmentation (BAISeg), which is a novel paradigm for WSIS that realizes instance segmentation with pixel-level annotations. BAISeg comprises an instance-aware boundary detection (IABD) branch and a semantic segmentation branch. The IABD branch identifies instances by predicting class-agnostic instance boundaries rather than instance centroids, therefore, it is different from previous DF-based approaches. In particular, we proposed the Cascade Fusion Module (CFM) and the Deep Mutual Attention (DMA) in the IABD branch to obtain rich contextual information and capture instance boundaries with weak responses. During the training phase, we employed Pixel-to-Pixel Contrast to enhance the discriminative capacity of the IABD branch. This further strengthens the continuity and closedness of the instance boundaries. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, and we achieve considerable performance with only pixel-level annotations.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, attack, robust, extraction, diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large-scale text-to-image diffusion models excel in generating high-quality images from textual inputs, yet concerns arise as research indicates their tendency to memorize and replicate training data, raising We also addressed the issue of memorization in diffusion models, where models tend to replicate exact training samples raising copyright infringement and privacy issues. Efforts within the text-to-image community to address memorization explore causes such as data duplication, replicated captions, or trigger tokens, proposing per-prompt inference-time or training-time mitigation strategies. In this paper, we focus on the feed-forward layers and begin by contrasting neuron activations of a set of memorized and non-memorized prompts. Experiments reveal a surprising finding: many different sets of memorized prompts significantly activate a common subspace in the model, demonstrating, for the first time, that memorization in the diffusion models lies in a special subspace. Subsequently, we introduce a novel post-hoc method for editing pre-trained models, whereby memorization is mitigated through the straightforward pruning of weights in specialized subspaces, avoiding the need to disrupt the training or inference process as seen in prior research. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness of the pruned model against training data extraction attacks, thereby unveiling new avenues for a practical and one-for-all solution to memorization.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) severity is determined by the presence and ratios of blast cells (abnormal white blood cells) in both bone marrow and peripheral blood. Manual diagnosis of this disease is a tedious and time-consuming operation, making it difficult for professionals to accurately examine blast cell characteristics. To address this difficulty, researchers use deep learning and machine learning. In this paper, a ResNet-based feature extractor is utilized to detect ALL, along with a variety of feature selectors and classifiers. To get the best results, a variety of transfer learning models, including the Resnet, VGG, EfficientNet, and DensNet families, are used as deep feature extractors. Following extraction, different feature selectors are used, including Genetic algorithm, PCA, ANOVA, Random Forest, Univariate, Mutual information, Lasso, XGB, Variance, and Binary ant colony. After feature qualification, a variety of classifiers are used, with MLP outperforming the others. The recommended technique is used to categorize ALL and HEM in the selected dataset which is C-NMC 2019. This technique got an impressive 90.71% accuracy and 95.76% sensitivity for the relevant classifications, and its metrics on this dataset outperformed others.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors are widely employed for Human Activity Recognition (HAR) due to their portability, energy efficiency, and growing research interest. However, a significant challenge for IMU-HAR models is achieving robust generalization performance across diverse users. This limitation stems from substantial variations in data distribution among individual users. One primary reason for this distribution disparity lies in the representation of IMU sensor data in the local coordinate system, which is susceptible to subtle user variations during IMU wearing. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach that extracts a global view representation based on the characteristics of IMU data, effectively alleviating the data distribution discrepancies induced by wearing styles. To validate the efficacy of the global view representation, we fed both global and local view data into model for experiments. The results demonstrate that global view data significantly outperforms local view data in cross-user experiments. Furthermore, we propose a Multi-view Supervised Network (MVFNet) based on Shuffling to effectively fuse local view and global view data. It supervises the feature extraction of each view through view division and view shuffling, so as to avoid the model ignoring important features as much as possible. Extensive experiments conducted on OPPORTUNITY and PAMAP2 datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods in cross-user HAR.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative diffusion models, notable for their large parameter count (exceeding 100 million) and operation within high-dimensional image spaces, pose significant challenges for traditional uncertainty estimation methods due to computational demands. In this work, we introduce an innovative framework, Diffusion Ensembles for Capturing Uncertainty (DECU), designed for estimating epistemic uncertainty for diffusion models. The DECU framework introduces a novel method that efficiently trains ensembles of conditional diffusion models by incorporating a static set of pre-trained parameters, drastically reducing the computational burden and the number of parameters that require training. Additionally, DECU employs Pairwise-Distance Estimators (PaiDEs) to accurately measure epistemic uncertainty by evaluating the mutual information between model outputs and weights in high-dimensional spaces. The effectiveness of this framework is demonstrated through experiments on the ImageNet dataset, highlighting its capability to capture epistemic uncertainty, specifically in under-sampled image classes.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present Canonical Consolidation Fields (CanFields): a method for reconstructing a time series of independently-sampled point clouds into a single deforming coherent shape. Such input often comes from motion capture. Existing methods either couple the geometry and the deformation, where by doing so they smooth fine details and lose the ability to track moving points, or they track the deformation explicitly, but introduce topological and geometric artifacts. Our novelty lies in the consolidation of the point clouds into a single canonical shape in a way that reduces the effect of noise and outliers, and enables us to overcome missing regions. We simultaneously reconstruct the velocity fields that guide the deformation. This consolidation allows us to retain the high-frequency details of the geometry, while faithfully reproducing the low-frequency deformation. Our architecture comprises simple components, and fits any single input shape without using datasets. We demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of our methods on a diverse benchmark of dynamic point clouds, including missing regions, sparse frames, and noise.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, transformer, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Lumina-T2X is a nascent family of Flow-based Large Diffusion Transformers that establishes a unified framework for transforming noise into various modalities, such as images and videos, conditioned on text instructions. Despite its promising capabilities, Lumina-T2X still encounters challenges including training instability, slow inference, and extrapolation artifacts. In this paper, we present Lumina-Next, an improved version of Lumina-T2X, showcasing stronger generation performance with increased training and inference efficiency. We begin with a comprehensive analysis of the Flag-DiT architecture and identify several suboptimal components, which we address by introducing the Next-DiT architecture with 3D RoPE and sandwich normalizations. To enable better resolution extrapolation, we thoroughly compare different context extrapolation methods applied to text-to-image generation with 3D RoPE, and propose Frequency- and Time-Aware Scaled RoPE tailored for diffusion transformers. Additionally, we introduced a sigmoid time discretization schedule to reduce sampling steps in solving the Flow ODE and the Context Drop method to merge redundant visual tokens for faster network evaluation, effectively boosting the overall sampling speed. Thanks to these improvements, Lumina-Next not only improves the quality and efficiency of basic text-to-image generation but also demonstrates superior resolution extrapolation capabilities and multilingual generation using decoder-based LLMs as the text encoder, all in a zero-shot manner. To further validate Lumina-Next as a versatile generative framework, we instantiate it on diverse tasks including visual recognition, multi-view, audio, music, and point cloud generation, showcasing strong performance across these domains. By releasing all codes and model weights, we aim to advance the development of next-generation generative AI capable of universal modeling.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep generative models learn the data distribution, which is concentrated on a low-dimensional manifold. The geometric analysis of distribution transformation provides a better understanding of data structure and enables a variety of applications. In this paper, we study the geometric properties of the diffusion model, whose forward diffusion process and reverse generation process construct a series of distributions on manifolds which vary over time. Our key contribution is the introduction of generation rate, which corresponds to the local deformation of manifold over time around an image component. We show that the generation rate is highly correlated with intuitive visual properties, such as visual saliency, of the image component. Further, we propose an efficient and differentiable scheme to estimate the generation rate for a given image component over time, giving rise to a generation curve. The differentiable nature of our scheme allows us to control the shape of the generation curve via optimization. Using different loss functions, our generation curve matching algorithm provides a unified framework for a range of image manipulation tasks, including semantic transfer, object removal, saliency manipulation, image blending, etc. We conduct comprehensive analytical evaluations to support our findings and evaluate our framework on various manipulation tasks. The results show that our method consistently leads to better manipulation results, compared to recent baselines.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce a pioneering unified library that leverages depth anything, segment anything models to augment neural comprehension in language-vision model zero-shot understanding. This library synergizes the capabilities of the Depth Anything Model (DAM), Segment Anything Model (SAM), and GPT-4V, enhancing multimodal tasks such as vision-question-answering (VQA) and composition reasoning.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Cryo-Electron Tomography (cryo-ET) is a 3D imaging technology facilitating the study of macromolecular structures at near-atomic resolution. Recent volumetric segmentation approaches on cryo-ET images have drawn widespread interest in biological sector. However, existing methods heavily rely on manually labeled data, which requires highly professional skills, thereby hindering the adoption of fully-supervised approaches for cryo-ET images. Some unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) approaches have been designed to enhance the segmentation network performance using unlabeled data. However, applying these methods directly to cryo-ET images segmentation tasks remains challenging due to two main issues: 1) the source data, usually obtained through simulation, contain a certain level of noise, while the target data, directly collected from raw-data from real-world scenario, have unpredictable noise levels. 2) the source data used for training typically consists of known macromoleculars, while the target domain data are often unknown, causing the model's segmenter to be biased towards these known macromolecules, leading to a domain shift problem. To address these challenges, in this work, we introduce the first voxel-wise unsupervised domain adaptation approach, termed Vox-UDA, specifically for cryo-ET subtomogram segmentation. Vox-UDA incorporates a noise generation module to simulate target-like noises in the source dataset for cross-noise level adaptation. Additionally, we propose a denoised pseudo-labeling strategy based on improved Bilateral Filter to alleviate the domain shift problem. Experimental results on both simulated and real cryo-ET subtomogram datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach compared to state-of-the-art UDA methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Mathematical reasoning presents a significant challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs) due to the extensive and precise chain of reasoning required for accuracy. Ensuring the correctness of each reasoning step is critical. To address this, we aim to enhance the robustness and factuality of LLMs by learning from human feedback. However, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has shown limited benefits for long-chain mathematical reasoning, as models employing DPO struggle to identify detailed errors in incorrect answers. This limitation stems from a lack of fine-grained process supervision. We propose a simple, effective, and data-efficient method called Step-DPO, which treats individual reasoning steps as units for preference optimization rather than evaluating answers holistically. Additionally, we have developed a data construction pipeline for Step-DPO, enabling the creation of a high-quality dataset containing 10K step-wise preference pairs. We also observe that in DPO, self-generated data is more effective than data generated by humans or GPT-4, due to the latter's out-of-distribution nature. Our findings demonstrate that as few as 10K preference data pairs and fewer than 500 Step-DPO training steps can yield a nearly 3% gain in accuracy on MATH for models with over 70B parameters. Notably, Step-DPO, when applied to Qwen2-72B-Instruct, achieves scores of 70.8% and 94.0% on the test sets of MATH and GSM8K, respectively, surpassing a series of closed-source models, including GPT-4-1106, Claude-3-Opus, and Gemini-1.5-Pro.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Language models (LMs) derive their capabilities from extensive training on diverse data, including potentially copyrighted material. These models can memorize and generate content similar to their training data, posing potential concerns. Therefore, model creators are motivated to develop mitigation methods that prevent generating protected content. We term this procedure as copyright takedowns for LMs, noting the conceptual similarity to (but legal distinction from) the DMCA takedown This paper introduces the first evaluation of the feasibility and side effects of copyright takedowns for LMs. We propose CoTaEval, an evaluation framework to assess the effectiveness of copyright takedown methods, the impact on the model's ability to retain uncopyrightable factual knowledge from the training data whose recitation is embargoed, and how well the model maintains its general utility and efficiency. We examine several strategies, including adding system prompts, decoding-time filtering interventions, and unlearning approaches. Our findings indicate that no tested method excels across all metrics, showing significant room for research in this unique problem setting and indicating potential unresolved challenges for live policy proposals.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities across a wide range of tasks, yet the choice of which model to use often involves a trade-off between performance and cost. More powerful models, though effective, come with higher expenses, while less capable models are more cost-effective. To address this dilemma, we propose several efficient router models that dynamically select between a stronger and a weaker LLM during inference, aiming to optimize the balance between cost and response quality. We develop a training framework for these routers leveraging human preference data and data augmentation techniques to enhance performance. Our evaluation on widely-recognized benchmarks shows that our approach significantly reduces costs-by over 2 times in certain cases-without compromising the quality of responses. Interestingly, our router models also demonstrate significant transfer learning capabilities, maintaining their performance even when the strong and weak models are changed at test time. This highlights the potential of these routers to provide a cost-effective yet high-performance solution for deploying LLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Location data is frequently collected from populations and shared in aggregate form to guide policy and decision making. However, the prevalence of aggregated data also raises the privacy concern of membership inference attacks (MIAs). MIAs infer whether an individual's data contributed to the aggregate release. Although effective MIAs have been developed for aggregate location data, these require access to an extensive auxiliary dataset of individual traces over the same locations, which are collected from a similar population. This assumption is often impractical given common privacy practices surrounding location data. To measure the risk of an MIA performed by a realistic adversary, we develop the first Zero Auxiliary Knowledge (ZK) MIA on aggregate location data, which eliminates the need for an auxiliary dataset of real individual traces. Instead, we develop a novel synthetic approach, such that suitable synthetic traces are generated from the released aggregate. We also develop methods to correct for bias and noise, to show that our synthetic-based attack is still applicable when privacy mechanisms are applied prior to release. Using two large-scale location datasets, we demonstrate that our ZK MIA matches the state-of-the-art Knock-Knock (KK) MIA across a wide range of settings, including popular implementations of differential privacy (DP) and suppression of small counts. Furthermore, we show that ZK MIA remains highly effective even when the adversary only knows a small fraction (10%) of their target's location history. This demonstrates that effective MIAs can be performed by realistic adversaries, highlighting the need for strong DP protection.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has demonstrated effectiveness in mitigating the hallucination problem of large language models (LLMs). However, the difficulty of aligning the retriever with the diverse LLMs' knowledge preferences inevitably poses an inevitable challenge in developing a reliable RAG system. To address this issue, we propose DPA-RAG, a universal framework designed to align diverse knowledge preferences within RAG systems. Specifically, we initially introduce a preference knowledge construction pipline and incorporate five novel query augmentation strategies to alleviate preference data scarcity. Based on preference data, DPA-RAG accomplishes both external and internal preference alignment: 1) It jointly integrate pair-wise, point-wise, and contrastive preference alignment abilities into the reranker, achieving external preference alignment among RAG components. 2) It further introduces a pre-aligned stage before vanilla Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT), enabling LLMs to implicitly capture knowledge aligned with their reasoning preferences, achieving LLMs' internal alignment. Experimental results across four knowledge-intensive QA datasets demonstrate that DPA-RAG outperforms all baselines and seamlessly integrates both black-box and open-sourced LLM readers. Further qualitative analysis and discussions also provide empirical guidance for achieving reliable RAG systems. Our code is publicly available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As the diversity of users increases, the capability of providing personalized responses by large language models (LLMs) has become increasingly important. Existing approaches have only limited successes in LLM personalization, due to the absence of personalized learning or the reliance on shared personal data. This paper proposes a new approach for a few-shot personalization of LLMs with their mis-aligned responses (Fermi). Our key idea is to learn a set of personalized prompts for each user by progressively improving the prompts using LLMs, based on user profile (e.g., demographic information) and a few examples of previous opinions. During an iterative process of prompt improvement, we incorporate the contexts of mis-aligned responses by LLMs, which are especially crucial for the effective personalization of LLMs. In addition, we develop an effective inference method to further leverage the context of the test query and the personalized prompts. Our experimental results demonstrate that Fermi significantly improves performance across various benchmarks, compared to the best-performing baselines.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In recent years, Joint Communication and Sensing (JC&S), has demonstrated significant success, particularly in utilizing sub-6 GHz frequencies with commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) Wi-Fi devices for applications such as localization, gesture recognition, and pose classification. Deep learning and the existence of large public datasets has been pivotal in achieving such results. However, at mmWave frequencies (30-300 GHz), which has shown potential for more accurate sensing performance, there is a noticeable lack of research in the domain of COTS Wi-Fi sensing. Challenges such as limited research hardware, the absence of large datasets, limited functionality in COTS hardware, and the complexities of data collection present obstacles to a comprehensive exploration of this field. In this work, we aim to address these challenges by developing a method that can generate synthetic mmWave channel state information (CSI) samples. In particular, we use a generative adversarial network (GAN) on an existing dataset, to generate 30,000 additional CSI samples. The augmented samples exhibit a remarkable degree of consistency with the original data, as indicated by the notably high GAN-train and GAN-test scores. Furthermore, we integrate the augmented samples in training a pose classification model. We observe that the augmented samples complement the real data and improve the generalization of the classification model.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Cameras are essential vision instruments to capture images for pattern detection and measurement. Human-object interaction (HOI) detection is one of the most popular pattern detection approaches for captured human-centric visual scenes. Recently, Transformer-based models have become the dominant approach for HOI detection due to their advanced network architectures and thus promising results. However, most of them follow the one-stage design of vanilla Transformer, leaving rich geometric priors under-exploited and leading to compromised performance especially when occlusion occurs. Given that geometric features tend to outperform visual ones in occluded scenarios and offer information that complements visual cues, we propose a novel end-to-end Transformer-style HOI detection model, i.e., geometric features enhanced HOI detector (GeoHOI). One key part of the model is a new unified self-supervised keypoint learning method named UniPointNet that bridges the gap of consistent keypoint representation across diverse object categories, including humans. GeoHOI effectively upgrades a Transformer-based HOI detector benefiting from the keypoints similarities measuring the likelihood of human-object interactions as well as local keypoint patches to enhance interaction query representation, so as to boost HOI predictions. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art models on V-COCO and achieves competitive performance on HICO-DET. Case study results on the post-disaster rescue with vision-based instruments showcase the applicability of the proposed GeoHOI in real-world applications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>An open challenge in recent machine learning is about how to improve the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) in a black-box setting, i.e., without access to detailed information such as output token probabilities. Existing approaches either rely on accessibility (which is often unrealistic) or involve significantly increased train- and inference-time costs. This paper addresses those limitations or shortcomings by proposing a novel approach, namely CoBB (Correct for improving QA reasoning of Black-Box LLMs). It uses a trained adaptation model to perform a seq2seq mapping from the often-imperfect reasonings of the original black-box LLM to the correct or improved reasonings. Specifically, the adaptation model is initialized with a relatively small open-source LLM and adapted over a collection of sub-sampled training pairs. To select the representative pairs of correct and incorrect reasonings, we formulated the dataset construction as an optimization problem that minimizes the statistical divergence between the sampled subset and the entire collection, and solved it via a genetic algorithm. We then train the adaptation model over the sampled pairs by contrasting the likelihoods of correct and incorrect reasonings. Our experimental results demonstrate that CoBB significantly improves reasoning accuracy across various QA benchmarks, compared to the best-performing adaptation baselines.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This study identifies the potential vulnerabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to 'jailbreak' attacks, specifically focusing on the Arabic language and its various forms. While most research has concentrated on English-based prompt manipulation, our investigation broadens the scope to investigate the Arabic language. We initially tested the AdvBench benchmark in Standardized Arabic, finding that even with prompt manipulation techniques like prefix injection, it was insufficient to provoke LLMs into generating unsafe content. However, when using Arabic transliteration and chatspeak (or arabizi), we found that unsafe content could be produced on platforms like OpenAI GPT-4 and Anthropic Claude 3 Sonnet. Our findings suggest that using Arabic and its various forms could expose information that might remain hidden, potentially increasing the risk of jailbreak attacks. We hypothesize that this exposure could be due to the model's learned connection to specific words, highlighting the need for more comprehensive safety training across all language forms.</li>

          Re-Ranking Step by Step: Investigating Pre-Filtering for Re-Ranking with Large Language Models(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have been revolutionizing a myriad of natural language processing tasks with their diverse zero-shot capabilities. Indeed, existing work has shown that LLMs can be used to great effect for many tasks, such as information retrieval (IR), and passage ranking. However, current state-of-the-art results heavily lean on the capabilities of the LLM being used. Currently, proprietary, and very large LLMs such as GPT-4 are the highest performing passage re-rankers. Hence, users without the resources to leverage top of the line LLMs, or ones that are closed source, are at a disadvantage. In this paper, we investigate the use of a pre-filtering step before passage re-ranking in IR. Our experiments show that by using a small number of human generated relevance scores, coupled with LLM relevance scoring, it is effectively possible to filter out irrelevant passages before re-ranking. Our experiments also show that this pre-filtering then allows the LLM to perform significantly better at the re-ranking task. Indeed, our results show that smaller models such as Mixtral can become competitive with much larger proprietary models (e.g., ChatGPT and GPT-4).</li>

          3D Feature Distillation with Object-Centric Priors(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Grounding natural language to the physical world is a ubiquitous topic with a wide range of applications in computer vision and robotics. Recently, 2D vision-language models such as CLIP have been widely popularized, due to their impressive capabilities for open-vocabulary grounding in 2D images. Recent works aim to elevate 2D CLIP features to 3D via feature distillation, but either learn neural fields that are scene-specific and hence lack generalization, or focus on indoor room scan data that require access to multiple camera views, which is not practical in robot manipulation scenarios. Additionally, related methods typically fuse features at pixel-level and assume that all camera views are equally informative. In this work, we show that this approach leads to sub-optimal 3D features, both in terms of grounding accuracy, as well as segmentation crispness. To alleviate this, we propose a multi-view feature fusion strategy that employs object-centric priors to eliminate uninformative views based on semantic information, and fuse features at object-level via instance segmentation masks. To distill our object-centric 3D features, we generate a large-scale synthetic multi-view dataset of cluttered tabletop scenes, spawning 15k scenes from over 3300 unique object instances, which we make publicly available. We show that our method reconstructs 3D CLIP features with improved grounding capacity and spatial consistency, while doing so from single-view RGB-D, thus departing from the assumption of multiple camera views at test time. Finally, we show that our approach can generalize to novel tabletop domains and be re-purposed for 3D instance segmentation without fine-tuning, and demonstrate its utility for language-guided robotic grasping in clutter</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, privacy, attack, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated learning enables the training of machine learning models on distributed data without compromising user privacy, as data remains on personal devices and only model updates, such as gradients, are shared with a central coordinator. However, recent research has shown that the central entity can perfectly reconstruct private data from shared model updates by maliciously initializing the model's parameters. In this paper, we propose QBI, a novel bias initialization method that significantly enhances reconstruction capabilities. This is accomplished by directly solving for bias values yielding sparse activation patterns. Further, we propose PAIRS, an algorithm that builds on QBI. PAIRS can be deployed when a separate dataset from the target domain is available to further increase the percentage of data that can be fully recovered. Measured by the percentage of samples that can be perfectly reconstructed from batches of various sizes, our approach achieves significant improvements over previous methods with gains of up to 50% on ImageNet and up to 60% on the IMDB sentiment analysis text dataset. Furthermore, we establish theoretical limits for attacks leveraging stochastic gradient sparsity, providing a foundation for understanding the fundamental constraints of these attacks. We empirically assess these limits using synthetic datasets. Finally, we propose and evaluate AGGP, a defensive framework designed to prevent gradient sparsity attacks, contributing to the development of more secure and private federated learning systems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the online knapsack problem, the goal is to pack items arriving online with different values and weights into a capacity-limited knapsack to maximize the total value of the accepted items. We study \textit{learning-augmented} algorithms for this problem, which aim to use machine-learned predictions to move beyond pessimistic worst-case guarantees. Existing learning-augmented algorithms for online knapsack consider relatively complicated prediction models that give an algorithm substantial information about the input, such as the total weight of items at each value. In practice, such predictions can be error-sensitive and difficult to learn. Motivated by this limitation, we introduce a family of learning-augmented algorithms for online knapsack that use \emph{succinct predictions}. In particular, the machine-learned prediction given to the algorithm is just a single value or interval that estimates the minimum value of any item accepted by an offline optimal solution. By leveraging a relaxation to online \emph{fractional} knapsack, we design algorithms that can leverage such succinct predictions in both the trusted setting (i.e., with perfect prediction) and the untrusted setting, where we prove that a simple meta-algorithm achieves a nearly optimal consistency-robustness trade-off. Empirically, we show that our algorithms significantly outperform baselines that do not use predictions and often outperform algorithms based on more complex prediction models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>There have been a huge number of benchmarks proposed to evaluate how large language models (LLMs) behave for logic inference tasks. However, it remains an open question how to properly evaluate this ability. In this paper, we provide a systematic overview of prior works on the logical reasoning ability of LLMs for analyzing categorical syllogisms. We first investigate all the possible variations for the categorical syllogisms from a purely logical perspective and then examine the underlying configurations (i.e., mood and figure) tested by the existing datasets. Our results indicate that compared to template-based synthetic datasets, crowdsourcing approaches normally sacrifice the coverage of configurations (i.e., mood and figure) of categorical syllogisms for more language variations, thus bringing challenges to fully testing LLMs under different situations. We then proceed to summarize the findings and observations for the performances of LLMs to infer the validity of syllogisms from the current literature. The error rate breakdown analyses suggest that the interpretation of the quantifiers seems to be the current bottleneck that limits the performances of the LLMs and is thus worth more attention. Finally, we discuss several points that might be worth considering when researchers plan on the future release of categorical syllogism datasets. We hope our work will not only provide a timely review of the current literature regarding categorical syllogisms, but also motivate more interdisciplinary research between communities, specifically computational linguists and logicians.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in diverse tasks, yet their applications in high-stakes domains are often hampered by unreliable predictions. Although numerous uncertainty quantification methods have been proposed to address this limitation, they often lack \textit{rigorous} uncertainty estimates. This work makes the first attempt to introduce a distribution-free and model-agnostic uncertainty quantification approach to construct a predictive interval with a statistical guarantee for GNN-based link prediction. We term it as \textit{conformalized link prediction.} Our approach builds upon conformal prediction (CP), a framework that promises to construct statistically robust prediction sets or intervals. We first theoretically and empirically establish a permutation invariance condition for the application of CP in link prediction tasks, along with an exact test-time coverage. Leveraging the important structural information in graphs, we then identify a novel and crucial connection between a graph's adherence to the power law distribution and the efficiency of CP. This insight leads to the development of a simple yet effective sampling-based method to align the graph structure with a power law distribution prior to the standard CP procedure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that for conformalized link prediction, our approach achieves the desired marginal coverage while significantly improving the efficiency of CP compared to baseline methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Analog circuit design requires substantial human expertise and involvement, which is a significant roadblock to design productivity. Bayesian Optimization (BO), a popular machine learning based optimization strategy, has been leveraged to automate analog design given its applicability across various circuit topologies and technologies. Traditional BO methods employ black box Gaussian Process surrogate models and optimized labeled data queries to find optimization solutions by trading off between exploration and exploitation. However, the search for the optimal design solution in BO can be expensive from both a computational and data usage point of view, particularly for high dimensional optimization problems. This paper presents ADO-LLM, the first work integrating large language models (LLMs) with Bayesian Optimization for analog design optimization. ADO-LLM leverages the LLM's ability to infuse domain knowledge to rapidly generate viable design points to remedy BO's inefficiency in finding high value design areas specifically under the limited design space coverage of the BO's probabilistic surrogate model. In the meantime, sampling of design points evaluated in the iterative BO process provides quality demonstrations for the LLM to generate high quality design points while leveraging infused broad design knowledge. Furthermore, the diversity brought by BO's exploration enriches the contextual understanding of the LLM and allows it to more broadly search in the design space and prevent repetitive and redundant suggestions. We evaluate the proposed framework on two different types of analog circuits and demonstrate notable improvements in design efficiency and effectiveness.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Despite attempts to make Large Language Models multi-lingual, many of the world's languages are still severely under-resourced. This widens the performance gap between NLP and AI applications aimed at well-financed, and those aimed at less-resourced languages. In this paper, we focus on Nigerian Pidgin (NP), which is spoken by nearly 100 million people, but has comparatively very few NLP resources and corpora. We address the task of Implicit Discourse Relation Classification (IDRC) and systematically compare an approach translating NP data to English and then using a well-resourced IDRC tool and back-projecting the labels versus creating a synthetic discourse corpus for NP, in which we translate PDTB and project PDTB labels, and then train an NP IDR classifier. The latter approach of learning a "native" NP classifier outperforms our baseline by 13.27\% and 33.98\% in f$_{1}$ score for 4-way and 11-way classification, respectively.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>AI model alignment is crucial due to inadvertent biases in training data and the underspecified pipeline in modern machine learning, where numerous models with excellent test set metrics can be produced, yet they may not meet end-user requirements. Recent advances demonstrate that post-training model alignment via human feedback can address some of these challenges. However, these methods are often confined to settings (such as generative AI) where humans can interpret model outputs and provide feedback. In traditional non-generative settings, where model outputs are numerical values or classes, detecting misalignment through single-sample outputs is highly challenging. In this paper we consider an alternative strategy. We propose interpreting model alignment through property testing, defining an aligned model $f$ as one belonging to a subset $\mathcal{P}$ of functions that exhibit specific desired behaviors. We focus on post-processing a pre-trained model $f$ to better align with $\mathcal{P}$ using conformal risk control. Specifically, we develop a general procedure for converting queries for a given property $\mathcal{P}$ to a collection of loss functions suitable for use in a conformal risk control algorithm. We prove a probabilistic guarantee that the resulting conformal interval around $f$ contains a function approximately satisfying $\mathcal{P}$. Given the capabilities of modern AI models with extensive parameters and training data, one might assume alignment issues will resolve naturally. However, increasing training data or parameters in a random feature model doesn't eliminate the need for alignment techniques when pre-training data is biased. We demonstrate our alignment methodology on supervised learning datasets for properties like monotonicity and concavity. Our flexible procedure can be applied to various desired properties.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We train a model to generate images from multimodal prompts of interleaved text and images such as "a <picture of a man> man and his <picture of a dog> dog in an <picture of a cartoon> animated style." We bootstrap a multimodal dataset by extracting semantically meaningful image crops corresponding to words in the image captions of synthetically generated and publicly available text-image data. Our model, MUMU, is composed of a vision-language model encoder with a diffusion decoder and is trained on a single 8xH100 GPU node. Despite being only trained on crops from the same image, MUMU learns to compose inputs from different images into a coherent output. For example, an input of a realistic person and a cartoon will output the same person in the cartoon style, and an input of a standing subject and a scooter will output the subject riding the scooter. As a result, our model generalizes to tasks such as style transfer and character consistency. Our results show the promise of using multimodal models as general purpose controllers for image generation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The last mile of unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for semantic segmentation is the challenge of solving the syn-to-real domain gap. Recent UDA methods have progressed significantly, yet they often rely on strategies customized for synthetic single-source datasets (e.g., GTA5), which limits their generalisation to multi-source datasets. Conversely, synthetic multi-source datasets hold promise for advancing the last mile of UDA but remain underutilized in current research. Thus, we propose DEC, a flexible UDA framework for multi-source datasets. Following a divide-and-conquer strategy, DEC simplifies the task by categorizing semantic classes, training models for each category, and fusing their outputs by an ensemble model trained exclusively on synthetic datasets to obtain the final segmentation mask. DEC can integrate with existing UDA methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance on Cityscapes, BDD100K, and Mapillary Vistas, significantly narrowing the syn-to-real domain gap.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, security</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>IoT application providers increasingly use MicroService Architecture (MSA) to develop applications that convert IoT data into valuable information. The independently deployable and scalable nature of microservices enables dynamic utilization of edge and cloud resources provided by various service providers, thus improving performance. However, IoT data security should be ensured during multi-domain data processing and transmission among distributed and dynamically composed microservices. The ability to implement granular security controls at the microservices level has the potential to solve this. To this end, edge-cloud environments require intricate and scalable security frameworks that operate across multi-domain environments to enforce various security policies during the management of microservices (i.e., initial placement, scaling, migration, and dynamic composition), considering the sensitivity of the IoT data. To address the lack of such a framework, we propose an architectural framework that uses Policy-as-Code to ensure secure microservice management within multi-domain edge-cloud environments. The proposed framework contains a "control plane" to intelligently and dynamically utilise and configure cloud-native (i.e., container orchestrators and service mesh) technologies to enforce security policies. We implement a prototype of the proposed framework using open-source cloud-native technologies such as Docker, Kubernetes, Istio, and Open Policy Agent to validate the framework. Evaluations verify our proposed framework's ability to enforce security policies for distributed microservices management, thus harvesting the MSA characteristics to ensure IoT application security needs.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the context of escalating safety concerns across various domains, the tasks of Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) and Video Anomaly Recognition (VAR) have emerged as critically important for applications in intelligent surveillance, evidence investigation, violence alerting, etc. These tasks, aimed at identifying and classifying deviations from normal behavior in video data, face significant challenges due to the rarity of anomalies which leads to extremely imbalanced data and the impracticality of extensive frame-level data annotation for supervised learning. This paper introduces a novel hierarchical graph neural network (GNN) based model MissionGNN that addresses these challenges by leveraging a state-of-the-art large language model and a comprehensive knowledge graph for efficient weakly supervised learning in VAR. Our approach circumvents the limitations of previous methods by avoiding heavy gradient computations on large multimodal models and enabling fully frame-level training without fixed video segmentation. Utilizing automated, mission-specific knowledge graph generation, our model provides a practical and efficient solution for real-time video analysis without the constraints of previous segmentation-based or multimodal approaches. Experimental validation on benchmark datasets demonstrates our model's performance in VAD and VAR, highlighting its potential to redefine the landscape of anomaly detection and recognition in video surveillance systems.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper presents a novel non-rigid point set registration method that is inspired by unsupervised clustering analysis. Unlike previous approaches that treat the source and target point sets as separate entities, we develop a holistic framework where they are formulated as clustering centroids and clustering members, separately. We then adopt Tikhonov regularization with an $\ell_1$-induced Laplacian kernel instead of the commonly used Gaussian kernel to ensure smooth and more robust displacement fields. Our formulation delivers closed-form solutions, theoretical guarantees, independence from dimensions, and the ability to handle large deformations. Subsequently, we introduce a clustering-improved Nyström method to effectively reduce the computational complexity and storage of the Gram matrix to linear, while providing a rigorous bound for the low-rank approximation. Our method achieves high accuracy results across various scenarios and surpasses competitors by a significant margin, particularly on shapes with substantial deformations. Additionally, we demonstrate the versatility of our method in challenging tasks such as shape transfer and medical registration.</li>

          OutlierTune: Efficient Channel-Wise Quantization for Large Language Models(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Quantizing the activations of large language models (LLMs) has been a significant challenge due to the presence of structured outliers. Most existing methods focus on the per-token or per-tensor quantization of activations, making it difficult to achieve both accuracy and hardware efficiency. To address this problem, we propose OutlierTune, an efficient per-channel post-training quantization (PTQ) method for the activations of LLMs. OutlierTune consists of two components: pre-execution of dequantization and symmetrization. The pre-execution of dequantization updates the model weights by the activation scaling factors, avoiding the internal scaling and costly additional computational overheads brought by the per-channel activation quantization. The symmetrization further reduces the quantization differences arising from the weight updates by ensuring the balanced numerical ranges across different activation channels. OutlierTune is easy to implement and hardware-efficient, introducing almost no additional computational overheads during the inference. Extensive experiments show that the proposed framework outperforms existing methods across multiple different tasks. Demonstrating better generalization, this framework improves the Int6 quantization of the instruction-tuning LLMs, such as OPT-IML, to the same level as half-precision (FP16). Moreover, we have shown that the proposed framework is 1.48x faster than the FP16 implementation while reducing approximately 2x memory usage.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Motion segmentation from a single moving camera presents a significant challenge in the field of computer vision. This challenge is compounded by the unknown camera movements and the lack of depth information of the scene. While deep learning has shown impressive capabilities in addressing these issues, supervised models require extensive training on massive annotated datasets, and unsupervised models also require training on large volumes of unannotated data, presenting significant barriers for both. In contrast, traditional methods based on optical flow do not require training data, however, they often fail to capture object-level information, leading to over-segmentation or under-segmentation. In addition, they also struggle in complex scenes with substantial depth variations and non-rigid motion, due to the overreliance of optical flow. To overcome these challenges, we propose an innovative hybrid approach that leverages the advantages of both deep learning methods and traditional optical flow based methods to perform dense motion segmentation without requiring any training. Our method initiates by automatically generating object proposals for each frame using foundation models. These proposals are then clustered into distinct motion groups using both optical flow and relative depth maps as motion cues. The integration of depth maps derived from state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation models significantly enhances the motion cues provided by optical flow, particularly in handling motion parallax issues. Our method is evaluated on the DAVIS-Moving and YTVOS-Moving datasets, and the results demonstrate that our method outperforms the best unsupervised method and closely matches with the state-of-theart supervised methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Instruction tuning enhances large vision-language models (LVLMs) but raises security risks through potential backdoor attacks due to their openness. Previous backdoor studies focus on enclosed scenarios with consistent training and testing instructions, neglecting the practical domain gaps that could affect attack effectiveness. This paper empirically examines the generalizability of backdoor attacks during the instruction tuning of LVLMs for the first time, revealing certain limitations of most backdoor strategies in practical scenarios. We quantitatively evaluate the generalizability of six typical backdoor attacks on image caption benchmarks across multiple LVLMs, considering both visual and textual domain offsets. Our findings indicate that attack generalizability is positively correlated with the backdoor trigger's irrelevance to specific images/models and the preferential correlation of the trigger pattern. Additionally, we modify existing backdoor attacks based on the above key observations, demonstrating significant improvements in cross-domain scenario generalizability (+86% attack success rate). Notably, even without access to the instruction datasets, a multimodal instruction set can be successfully poisoned with a very low poisoning rate (0.2%), achieving an attack success rate of over 97%. This paper underscores that even simple traditional backdoor strategies pose a serious threat to LVLMs, necessitating more attention and in-depth research.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Existing event stream-based pattern recognition models usually represent the event stream as the point cloud, voxel, image, etc., and design various deep neural networks to learn their features. Although considerable results can be achieved in simple cases, however, the model performance may be limited by monotonous modality expressions, sub-optimal fusion, and readout mechanisms. In this paper, we propose a novel dual-stream framework for event stream-based pattern recognition via differentiated fusion, termed EFV++. It models two common event representations simultaneously, i.e., event images and event voxels. The spatial and three-dimensional stereo information can be learned separately by utilizing Transformer and Graph Neural Network (GNN). We believe the features of each representation still contain both efficient and redundant features and a sub-optimal solution may be obtained if we directly fuse them without differentiation. Thus, we divide each feature into three levels and retain high-quality features, blend medium-quality features, and exchange low-quality features. The enhanced dual features will be fed into the fusion Transformer together with bottleneck features. In addition, we introduce a novel hybrid interaction readout mechanism to enhance the diversity of features as final representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple widely used event stream-based classification datasets. Specifically, we achieve new state-of-the-art performance on the Bullying10k dataset, i.e., $90.51\%$, which exceeds the second place by $+2.21\%$.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Currently many benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate the perception ability of the Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). However, most benchmarks conduct questions by selecting images from existing datasets, resulting in the potential data leakage. Besides, these benchmarks merely focus on evaluating LVLMs on the realistic style images and clean scenarios, leaving the multi-stylized images and noisy scenarios unexplored. In response to these challenges, we propose a dynamic and scalable benchmark named Dysca for evaluating LVLMs by leveraging synthesis images. Specifically, we leverage Stable Diffusion and design a rule-based method to dynamically generate novel images, questions and the corresponding answers. We consider 51 kinds of image styles and evaluate the perception capability in 20 subtasks. Moreover, we conduct evaluations under 4 scenarios (i.e., Clean, Corruption, Print Attacking and Adversarial Attacking) and 3 question types (i.e., Multi-choices, True-or-false and Free-form). Thanks to the generative paradigm, Dysca serves as a scalable benchmark for easily adding new subtasks and scenarios. A total of 8 advanced open-source LVLMs with 10 checkpoints are evaluated on Dysca, revealing the drawbacks of current LVLMs. The benchmark is released in \url{this https URL}.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Optimizing black-box functions is a fundamental problem in science and engineering. To solve this problem, many approaches learn a surrogate function that estimates the underlying objective from limited historical evaluations. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their strong pattern-matching capabilities via pretraining on vast amounts of data, stand out as a potential candidate for surrogate modeling. However, directly prompting a pretrained language model to produce predictions is not feasible in many scientific domains due to the scarcity of domain-specific data in the pretraining corpora and the challenges of articulating complex problems in natural language. In this work, we introduce LICO, a general-purpose model that extends arbitrary base LLMs for black-box optimization, with a particular application to the molecular domain. To achieve this, we equip the language model with a separate embedding layer and prediction layer, and train the model to perform in-context predictions on a diverse set of functions defined over the domain. Once trained, LICO can generalize to unseen molecule properties simply via in-context prompting. LICO achieves state-of-the-art performance on PMO, a challenging molecular optimization benchmark comprising over 20 objective functions.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have stunningly advanced the field of machine translation, though their effectiveness within the financial domain remains largely underexplored. To probe this issue, we constructed a fine-grained Chinese-English parallel corpus of financial news called FFN. We acquired financial news articles spanning between January 1st, 2014, to December 31, 2023, from mainstream media websites such as CNN, FOX, and China Daily. The dataset consists of 1,013 main text and 809 titles, all of which have been manually corrected. We measured the translation quality of two LLMs -- ChatGPT and ERNIE-bot, utilizing BLEU, TER and chrF scores as the evaluation metrics. For comparison, we also trained an OpenNMT model based on our dataset. We detail problems of LLMs and provide in-depth analysis, intending to stimulate further research and solutions in this largely uncharted territory. Our research underlines the need to optimize LLMs within the specific field of financial translation to ensure accuracy and quality.</li>

This study explores the suitability of large language models in automatically generating those simplifications. We examine the usefulness of chain-of-thought and self-correction prompting mechanisms in this domain. We also propose a new evaluation protocol that employs radiologists and laypeople, where radiologists verify the factual correctness of simplifications, and laypeople assess simplicity and comprehension. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of self-correction prompting in producing high-quality simplifications.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recently, very large language models (LLMs) have shown exceptional performance on several English NLP tasks with just in-context learning (ICL), but their utility in other languages is still underexplored. We investigate their effectiveness for NLP tasks in low-resource languages (LRLs), especially in the setting of zero-labelled cross-lingual transfer (0-CLT), where no labelled training data for the target language is available -- however training data from one or more related medium-resource languages (MRLs) is utilized, alongside the available unlabeled test data for a target language. We introduce Self-Supervised Prompting (SSP), a novel ICL approach tailored for the 0-CLT setting. SSP is based on the key observation that LLMs output more accurate labels if in-context exemplars are from the target language (even if their labels are slightly noisy). To operationalize this, since target language training data is not available in 0-CLT, SSP operates in two stages. In Stage I, using source MRL training data, target language's test data is noisily labeled. In Stage II, these noisy test data points are used as exemplars in ICL for further improved labelling. Additionally, our implementation of SSP uses a novel Integer Linear Programming (ILP)-based exemplar selection that balances similarity, prediction confidence (when available) and label coverage. Experiments on three tasks and eleven LRLs (from three regions) demonstrate that SSP strongly outperforms existing SOTA fine-tuned and prompting-based baselines in 0-CLT setup.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We consider the problem of customizing text-to-image diffusion models with user-supplied reference images. Given new prompts, the existing methods can capture the key concept from the reference images but fail to align the generated image with the prompt. In this work, we seek to address this key issue by proposing new methods that can easily be used in conjunction with existing customization methods that optimize the embeddings/weights at various intermediate stages of the text encoding process. The first contribution of this paper is a dissection of the various stages of the text encoding process leading up to the conditioning vector for text-to-image models. We take a holistic view of existing customization methods and notice that key and value outputs from this process differs substantially from their corresponding baseline (non-customized) models (e.g., baseline stable diffusion). While this difference does not impact the concept being customized, it leads to other parts of the generated image not being aligned with the prompt (see first row in Fig 1). Further, we also observe that these keys and values allow independent control various aspects of the final generation, enabling semantic manipulation of the output. Taken together, the features spanning these keys and values, serve as the basis for our next contribution where we fix the aforementioned issues with existing methods. We propose a new post-processing algorithm, \textbf{AlignIT}, that infuses the keys and values for the concept of interest while ensuring the keys and values for all other tokens in the input prompt are unchanged. Our proposed method can be plugged in directly to existing customization methods, leading to a substantial performance improvement in the alignment of the final result with the input prompt while retaining the customization quality.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The increasing frequency of attacks on Android applications coupled with the recent popularity of large language models (LLMs) necessitates a comprehensive understanding of the capabilities of the latter in identifying potential vulnerabilities, which is key to mitigate the overall risk. To this end, the work at hand compares the ability of nine state-of-the-art LLMs to detect Android code vulnerabilities listed in the latest Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) Mobile Top 10. Each LLM was evaluated against an open dataset of over 100 vulnerable code samples, including obfuscated ones, assessing each model's ability to identify key vulnerabilities. Our analysis reveals the strengths and weaknesses of each LLM, identifying important factors that contribute to their performance. Additionally, we offer insights into context augmentation with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for detecting Android code vulnerabilities, which in turn may propel secure application development. Finally, while the reported findings regarding code vulnerability analysis show promise, they also reveal significant discrepancies among the different LLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Interlinear glossed text (IGT) is a popular format in language documentation projects, where each morpheme is labeled with a descriptive annotation. Automating the creation of interlinear glossed text can be desirable to reduce annotator effort and maintain consistency across annotated corpora. Prior research has explored a number of statistical and neural methods for automatically producing IGT. As large language models (LLMs) have showed promising results across multilingual tasks, even for rare, endangered languages, it is natural to wonder whether they can be utilized for the task of generating IGT. We explore whether LLMs can be effective at the task of interlinear glossing with in-context learning, without any traditional training. We propose new approaches for selecting examples to provide in-context, observing that targeted selection can significantly improve performance. We find that LLM-based methods beat standard transformer baselines, despite requiring no training at all. These approaches still underperform state-of-the-art supervised systems for the task, but are highly practical for researchers outside of the NLP community, requiring minimal effort to use.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep neural networks (DNNs) have exhibited remarkable performance across various tasks, yet their susceptibility to spurious correlations poses a significant challenge for out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Spurious correlations refer to erroneous associations in data that do not reflect true underlying relationships but are instead artifacts of dataset characteristics or biases. These correlations can lead DNNs to learn patterns that are not robust across diverse datasets or real-world scenarios, hampering their ability to generalize beyond training data. In this paper, we propose an autoencoder-based approach to analyze the nature of spurious correlations that exist in the Global Wheat Head Detection (GWHD) 2021 dataset. We then use inpainting followed by Weighted Boxes Fusion (WBF) to achieve a 2% increase in the Average Domain Accuracy (ADA) over the YOLOv5 baseline and consistently show that our approach has the ability to suppress some of the spurious correlations in the GWHD 2021 dataset. The key advantage of our approach is that it is more suitable in scenarios where there is limited scope to adapt or fine-tune the trained model in unseen test environments.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) can now generate and recognize text in a wide range of styles and genres, including highly specialized, creative genres like poetry. But what do LLMs really know about poetry? What can they know about poetry? We develop a task to evaluate how well LLMs recognize a specific aspect of poetry, poetic form, for more than 20 forms and formal elements in the English language. Poetic form captures many different poetic features, including rhyme scheme, meter, and word or line repetition. We use this task to reflect on LLMs' current poetic capabilities, as well as the challenges and pitfalls of creating NLP benchmarks for poetry and for other creative tasks. In particular, we use this task to audit and reflect on the poems included in popular pretraining datasets. Our findings have implications for NLP researchers interested in model evaluation, digital humanities and cultural analytics scholars, and cultural heritage professionals.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Detecting obstacles in railway scenarios is both crucial and challenging due to the wide range of obstacle categories and varying ambient conditions such as weather and light. Given the impossibility of encompassing all obstacle categories during the training stage, we address this out-of-distribution (OOD) issue with a semi-supervised segmentation approach guided by optical flow clues. We reformulate the task as a binary segmentation problem instead of the traditional object detection approach. To mitigate data shortages, we generate highly realistic synthetic images using Segment Anything (SAM) and YOLO, eliminating the need for manual annotation to produce abundant pixel-level annotations. Additionally, we leverage optical flow as prior knowledge to train the model effectively. Several experiments are conducted, demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Natural language question answering (QA) over structured data sources such as tables and knowledge graphs (KGs) have been widely investigated, for example with Large Language Models (LLMs). The main solutions include question to formal query parsing and retrieval-based answer generation. However, current methods of the former often suffer from weak generalization, failing to dealing with multiple sources simultaneously, while the later is limited in trustfulness. In this paper, we propose UnifiedTQA, a trustful QA framework that can simultaneously support multiple types of structured data in a unified way. To this end, it adopts an LLM-friendly and unified knowledge representation method called Condition Graph (CG), and uses an LLM and demonstration-based two-level method for CG querying. For enhancement, it is also equipped with dynamic demonstration retrieval. We have evaluated UnifiedTQA with 5 benchmarks covering 3 types of structured data. It outperforms 2 existing unified structured data QA methods and in comparison with the baselines that are specific to a data type, it achieves state-of-the-art on 2 of them. Further more, we demonstrates potential of our method for more general QA tasks, QA over mixed structured data and QA across structured data.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Role-playing agents (RPA) have been a popular application area for large language models (LLMs), attracting significant interest from both industry and academia.While existing RPAs well portray the characters' knowledge and tones, they face challenges in capturing their minds, especially for small role-playing language models (RPLMs). In this paper, we propose to enhance RPLMs via personality-indicative data. Specifically, we leverage questions from psychological scales and distill advanced RPAs to generate dialogues that grasp the minds of characters. Experimental results validate that RPLMs trained with our dataset exhibit advanced role-playing capabilities for both general and personality-related evaluations.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>A primary cost driver for training large models is wall-clock training time. We show that popular time estimates based on FLOPs are poor estimates, and construct a more accurate proxy based on memory copies. We show that with some simple accounting, we can estimate the training speed of a transformer model from its hyperparameters. Combined with a scaling law curve like Chinchilla, this lets us estimate the final loss of the model. We fit our estimate to real data with a linear regression, and apply the result to rewrite Chinchilla in terms of a model's estimated training time as opposed to the amount of training data. This gives an expression for the loss in terms of the model's hyperparameters alone. We show that this expression is accurate across a wide range of model hyperparameter values, enabling us to analytically make architectural decisions and train models more efficiently.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Fisheye images are categorized fisheye into central and deviated based on the optical center position. Existing rectification methods are limited to central fisheye images, while this paper proposes a novel method that extends to deviated fisheye image rectification. The challenge lies in the variant global distortion distribution pattern caused by the random optical center position. To address this challenge, we propose a distortion vector map (DVM) that measures the degree and direction of local distortion. By learning the DVM, the model can independently identify local distortions at each pixel without relying on global distortion patterns. The model adopts a pre-training and fine-tuning training paradigm. In the pre-training stage, it predicts the distortion vector map and perceives the local distortion features of each pixel. In the fine-tuning stage, it predicts a pixel-wise flow map for deviated fisheye image rectification. We also propose a data augmentation method mixing central, deviated, and distorted-free images. Such data augmentation promotes the model performance in rectifying both central and deviated fisheye images, compared with models trained on single-type fisheye images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated graph learning collaboratively learns a global graph neural network with distributed graphs, where the non-independent and identically distributed property is one of the major challenges. Most relative arts focus on traditional distributed tasks like images and voices, incapable of graph structures. This paper firstly reveals that local client distortion is brought by both node-level semantics and graph-level structure. First, for node-level semantics, we find that contrasting nodes from distinct classes is beneficial to provide a well-performing discrimination. We pull the local node towards the global node of the same class and push it away from the global node of different classes. Second, we postulate that a well-structural graph neural network possesses similarity for neighbors due to the inherent adjacency relationships. However, aligning each node with adjacent nodes hinders discrimination due to the potential class inconsistency. We transform the adjacency relationships into the similarity distribution and leverage the global model to distill the relation knowledge into the local model, which preserves the structural information and discriminability of the local model. Empirical results on three graph datasets manifest the superiority of the proposed method over its counterparts.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, privacy, protect, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Local differential privacy (LDP) is an efficient solution for providing privacy to client's sensitive data while simultaneously releasing aggregate statistics without relying on a trusted central server (aggregator) as in the central model of differential privacy. The shuffle model with LDP provides an additional layer of privacy, by disconnecting the link between clients and the aggregator, further improving the utility of LDP. However, LDP has been shown to be vulnerable to malicious clients who can perform both input and output manipulation attacks, i.e., before and after applying the LDP mechanism, to skew the aggregator's results. In this work, we show how to prevent malicious clients from compromising LDP schemes. Specifically, we give efficient constructions to prevent both input ánd output manipulation attacks from malicious clients for generic LDP algorithms. Our proposed schemes for verifiable LDP (VLDP), completely protect from output manipulation attacks, and prevent input attacks using signed data, requiring only one-time interaction between client and server, unlike existing alternatives [28, 33]. Most importantly, we are the first to provide an efficient scheme for VLDP in the shuffle model. We describe and prove secure, two schemes for VLDP in the regular model, and one in the shuffle model. We show that all schemes are highly practical, with client runtimes of < 2 seconds, and server runtimes of 5-7 milliseconds per client.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Few-shot anomaly detection methods can effectively address data collecting difficulty in industrial scenarios. Compared to 2D few-shot anomaly detection (2D-FSAD), 3D few-shot anomaly detection (3D-FSAD) is still an unexplored but essential task. In this paper, we propose CLIP3D-AD, an efficient 3D-FSAD method extended on CLIP. We successfully transfer strong generalization ability of CLIP into 3D-FSAD. Specifically, we synthesize anomalous images on given normal images as sample pairs to adapt CLIP for 3D anomaly classification and segmentation. For classification, we introduce an image adapter and a text adapter to fine-tune global visual features and text features. Meanwhile, we propose a coarse-to-fine decoder to fuse and facilitate intermediate multi-layer visual representations of CLIP. To benefit from geometry information of point cloud and eliminate modality and data discrepancy when processed by CLIP, we project and render point cloud to multi-view normal and anomalous images. Then we design multi-view fusion module to fuse features of multi-view images extracted by CLIP which are used to facilitate visual representations for further enhancing vision-language correlation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method has a competitive performance of 3D few-shot anomaly classification and segmentation on MVTec-3D AD dataset.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>protect, diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Personalized diffusion models have gained popularity for adapting pre-trained text-to-image models to generate images of specific topics with only a few images. However, recent studies find that these models are vulnerable to minor adversarial perturbation, and the fine-tuning performance is largely degraded on corrupted datasets. Such characteristics are further exploited to craft protective perturbation on sensitive images like portraits that prevent unauthorized generation. In response, diffusion-based purification methods have been proposed to remove these perturbations and retain generation performance. However, existing works lack detailed analysis of the fundamental shortcut learning vulnerability of personalized diffusion models and also turn to over-purifying the images cause information loss. In this paper, we take a closer look at the fine-tuning process of personalized diffusion models through the lens of shortcut learning and propose a hypothesis that could explain the underlying manipulation mechanisms of existing perturbation methods. Specifically, we find that the perturbed images are greatly shifted from their original paired prompt in the CLIP-based latent space. As a result, training with this mismatched image-prompt pair creates a construction that causes the models to dump their out-of-distribution noisy patterns to the identifier, thus causing serious performance degradation. Based on this observation, we propose a systematic approach to retain the training performance with purification that realigns the latent image and its semantic meaning and also introduces contrastive learning with a negative token to decouple the learning of wanted clean identity and the unwanted noisy pattern, that shows strong potential capacity against further adaptive perturbation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The field of text-to-image (T2I) generation has made significant progress in recent years, largely driven by advancements in diffusion models. Linguistic control enables effective content creation, but struggles with fine-grained control over image generation. This challenge has been explored, to a great extent, by incorporating additional user-supplied spatial conditions, such as depth maps and edge maps, into pre-trained T2I models through extra encoding. However, multi-control image synthesis still faces several challenges. Specifically, current approaches are limited in handling free combinations of diverse input control signals, overlook the complex relationships among multiple spatial conditions, and often fail to maintain semantic alignment with provided textual prompts. This can lead to suboptimal user experiences. To address these challenges, we propose AnyControl, a multi-control image synthesis framework that supports arbitrary combinations of diverse control signals. AnyControl develops a novel Multi-Control Encoder that extracts a unified multi-modal embedding to guide the generation process. This approach enables a holistic understanding of user inputs, and produces high-quality, faithful results under versatile control signals, as demonstrated by extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and Llama3 have significantly impacted various fields by enabling high-quality synthetic data generation and reducing dependence on expensive human-generated datasets. Despite this, challenges remain in the areas of generalization, controllability, diversity, and truthfulness within the existing generative frameworks. To address these challenges, this paper presents UniGen, a comprehensive LLM-powered framework designed to produce diverse, accurate, and highly controllable datasets. UniGen is adaptable, supporting all types of text datasets and enhancing the generative process through innovative mechanisms. To augment data diversity, UniGen incorporates an attribute-guided generation module and a group checking feature. For accuracy, it employs a code-based mathematical assessment for label verification alongside a retrieval-augmented generation technique for factual validation. The framework also allows for user-specified constraints, enabling customization of the data generation process to suit particular requirements. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior quality of data generated by UniGen, and each module within UniGen plays a critical role in this enhancement. Additionally, UniGen is applied in two practical scenarios: benchmarking LLMs and data augmentation. The results indicate that UniGen effectively supports dynamic and evolving benchmarking, and that data augmentation improves LLM capabilities in various domains, including agent-oriented abilities and reasoning skills.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Unpaired medical image synthesis aims to provide complementary information for an accurate clinical diagnostics, and address challenges in obtaining aligned multi-modal medical scans. Transformer-based models excel in imaging translation tasks thanks to their ability to capture long-range dependencies. Although effective in supervised training settings, their performance falters in unpaired image synthesis, particularly in synthesizing structural details. This paper empirically demonstrates that, lacking strong inductive biases, Transformer can converge to non-optimal solutions in the absence of paired data. To address this, we introduce UNet Structured Transformer (UNest), a novel architecture incorporating structural inductive biases for unpaired medical image synthesis. We leverage the foundational Segment-Anything Model to precisely extract the foreground structure and perform structural attention within the main anatomy. This guides the model to learn key anatomical regions, thus improving structural synthesis under the lack of supervision in unpaired training. Evaluated on two public datasets, spanning three modalities, i.e., MR, CT, and PET, UNest improves recent methods by up to 19.30% across six medical image synthesis tasks.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Cross-silo federated learning (FL) enables decentralized organizations to collaboratively train models while preserving data privacy and has made significant progress in medical image classification. One common assumption is task homogeneity where each client has access to all classes during training. However, in clinical practice, given a multi-label classification task, constrained by the level of medical knowledge and the prevalence of diseases, each institution may diagnose only partial categories, resulting in task heterogeneity. How to pursue effective multi-label medical image classification under task heterogeneity is under-explored. In this paper, we first formulate such a realistic label missing setting in the multi-label FL domain and propose a two-stage method FedMLP to combat class missing from two aspects: pseudo label tagging and global knowledge learning. The former utilizes a warmed-up model to generate class prototypes and select samples with high confidence to supplement missing labels, while the latter uses a global model as a teacher for consistency regularization to prevent forgetting missing class knowledge. Experiments on two publicly-available medical datasets validate the superiority of FedMLP against the state-of-the-art both federated semi-supervised and noisy label learning approaches under task heterogeneity.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Video understanding requires the extraction of rich spatio-temporal representations, which transformer models achieve through self-attention. Unfortunately, self-attention poses a computational burden. In NLP, Mamba has surfaced as an efficient alternative for transformers. However, Mamba's successes do not trivially extend to computer vision tasks, including those in video analysis. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the differences between self-attention and Mamba. We identify two limitations in Mamba's token processing: historical decay and element contradiction. We propose VideoMambaPro (VMP) that solves the identified limitations by adding masked backward computation and elemental residual connections to a VideoMamba backbone. VideoMambaPro shows state-of-the-art video action recognition performance compared to transformer models, and surpasses VideoMamba by clear margins: 7.9% and 8.1% top-1 on Kinetics-400 and Something-Something V2, respectively. Our VideoMambaPro-M model achieves 91.9% top-1 on Kinetics-400, only 0.2% below InternVideo2-6B but with only 1.2% of its parameters. The combination of high performance and efficiency makes VideoMambaPro an interesting alternative for transformer models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Image restoration has made marvelous progress with the advent of deep learning. Previous methods usually rely on designing powerful network architecture to elevate performance, however, the natural visual effect of the restored results is limited by color and texture distortions. Besides the visual perceptual quality, the semantic perception recovery is an important but often overlooked perspective of restored image, which is crucial for the deployment in high-level tasks. In this paper, we propose a new perspective to resort these issues by introducing a naturalness-oriented and semantic-aware optimization mechanism, dubbed DiffLoss. Specifically, inspired by the powerful distribution coverage capability of the diffusion model for natural image generation, we exploit the Markov chain sampling property of diffusion model and project the restored results of existing networks into the sampling space. Besides, we reveal that the bottleneck feature of diffusion models, also dubbed h-space feature, is a natural high-level semantic space. We delve into this property and propose a semantic-aware loss to further unlock its potential of semantic perception recovery, which paves the way to connect image restoration task and downstream high-level recognition task. With these two strategies, the DiffLoss can endow existing restoration methods with both more natural and semantic-aware results. We verify the effectiveness of our method on substantial common image restoration tasks and benchmarks. Code will be available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) are now rapidly advancing and surpassing human abilities on many natural language tasks. However, aligning these super-human LLMs with human knowledge remains challenging because the supervision signals from human annotators may be wrong. This issue, known as the "super-alignment" problem, requires enhancing weak-to-strong generalization, where a strong LLM must generalize from imperfect supervision provided by a weaker source. To address this issue, we propose an approach to improve weak-to-strong generalization by involving the reliability of weak supervision signals in the alignment process. In our method, we query the weak supervisor for multiple answers, estimate the answer reliability, and enhance the alignment process by filtering out uncertain data or re-weighting reliable data. Experiments on four datasets demonstrate that our methods effectively identify the quality of weak labels and significantly enhance weak-to-strong generalization. Our work presents effective techniques for error-robust model alignment, reducing error propagation from noisy supervision and enhancing the accuracy and reliability of LLMs. Codes are publicly available at this http URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>It is of critical importance to design digital identity systems that ensure the privacy of citizens as well as protecting them from issuer corruption. Unfortunately, what Europe's and USA's public sectors are currently developing does not offer such basic protections. We aim to solve this issue and propose a method for untraceable selective disclosure and privacy preserving revocation of digital credentials, using the unique homomorphic characteristics of second order Elliptic Curves and Boneh-Lynn-Shacham (BLS) signatures. Our approach ensures that users can selectively reveal only the necessary credentials, while protecting their privacy across multiple presentations. We also aim to protect users from issuer corruption, by making it possible to apply a threshold for revocation to require collective agreement among multiple revocation issuers.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePINS) are secured and governed by blockchains but beyond crypto-economic incentives, they lack measures to establish trust in participating devices and their services. The verification of relevant device credentials during device registration helps to overcome this problem. However, on-chain verification in decentralized applications (dApp) discloses potentially confidential device attributes whereas off-chain verification introduces undesirable trust assumptions. In this paper, we propose a credential-based device registration (CDR) mechanism that verifies device credentials on the blockchain and leverages zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) to protect confidential device attributes from being disclosed. We characterize CDR for DePINs, present a general system model, and technically evaluate CDR using zkSNARKs with Groth16 and Marlin. Our experiments give first insights into performance impacts and reveal a tradeoff between the applied proof systems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>3D object detection is an important task that has been widely applied in autonomous driving. Recently, fusing multi-modal inputs, i.e., LiDAR and camera data, to perform this task has become a new trend. Existing methods, however, either ignore the sparsity of Lidar features or fail to preserve the original spatial structure of LiDAR and the semantic density of camera features simultaneously due to the modality gap. To address issues, this letter proposes a novel bidirectional complementary Lidar-camera fusion framework, called BiCo-Fusion that can achieve robust semantic- and spatial-aware 3D object detection. The key insight is to mutually fuse the multi-modal features to enhance the semantics of LiDAR features and the spatial awareness of the camera features and adaptatively select features from both modalities to build a unified 3D representation. Specifically, we introduce Pre-Fusion consisting of a Voxel Enhancement Module (VEM) to enhance the semantics of voxel features from 2D camera features and Image Enhancement Module (IEM) to enhance the spatial characteristics of camera features from 3D voxel features. Both VEM and IEM are bidirectionally updated to effectively reduce the modality gap. We then introduce Unified Fusion to adaptively weight to select features from the enchanted Lidar and camera features to build a unified 3D representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our BiCo-Fusion against the prior arts. Project page: this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>"Accuracy-on-the-line" is a widely observed phenomenon in machine learning, where a model's accuracy on in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data is positively correlated across different hyperparameters and data configurations. But when does this useful relationship break down? In this work, we explore its robustness. The key observation is that noisy data and the presence of nuisance features can be sufficient to shatter the Accuracy-on-the-line phenomenon. In these cases, ID and OOD accuracy can become negatively correlated, leading to "Accuracy-on-the-wrong-line". This phenomenon can also occur in the presence of spurious (shortcut) features, which tend to overshadow the more complex signal (core, non-spurious) features, resulting in a large nuisance feature space. Moreover, scaling to larger datasets does not mitigate this undesirable behavior and may even exacerbate it. We formally prove a lower bound on Out-of-distribution (OOD) error in a linear classification model, characterizing the conditions on the noise and nuisance features for a large OOD error. We finally demonstrate this phenomenon across both synthetic and real datasets with noisy data and nuisance features.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning approach that enables training on decentralized data while preserving privacy. However, FL systems often involve resource-constrained client devices with limited computational power, memory, storage, and bandwidth. This paper introduces FedMap, a novel method that aims to enhance the communication efficiency of FL deployments by collaboratively learning an increasingly sparse global model through iterative, unstructured pruning. Importantly, FedMap trains a global model from scratch, unlike other methods reported in the literature, making it ideal for privacy-critical use cases such as in the medical and finance domains, where suitable pre-training data is often limited. FedMap adapts iterative magnitude-based pruning to the FL setting, ensuring all clients prune and refine the same subset of the global model parameters, therefore gradually reducing the global model size and communication overhead. The iterative nature of FedMap, forming subsequent models as subsets of predecessors, avoids parameter reactivation issues seen in prior work, resulting in stable performance. In this paper we provide an extensive evaluation of FedMap across diverse settings, datasets, model architectures, and hyperparameters, assessing performance in both IID and non-IID environments. Comparative analysis against the baseline approach demonstrates FedMap's ability to achieve more stable client model performance. For IID scenarios, FedMap achieves over $90$\% pruning without significant performance degradation. In non-IID settings, it achieves at least $~80$\% pruning while maintaining accuracy. FedMap offers a promising solution to alleviate communication bottlenecks in FL systems while retaining model accuracy.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Grounding DINO and the Segment Anything Model (SAM) have achieved impressive performance in zero-shot object detection and image segmentation, respectively. Together, they have a great potential in revolutionizing zero-shot semantic segmentation or data annotation. Yet, in specialized domains like medical image segmentation, objects of interest (e.g., organs, tissues, and tumors) may not fall in existing class names. To address this problem, the referring expression comprehension (REC) ability of Grounding DINO is leveraged to detect arbitrary targets by their language descriptions. However, recent studies have highlighted severe limitation of the REC framework in this application setting owing to its tendency to make false positive predictions when the target is absent in the given image. And, while this bottleneck is central to the prospect of open-set semantic segmentation, it is still largely unknown how much improvement can be achieved by studying the prediction errors. To this end, we perform empirical studies on eight publicly available datasets and reveal that these errors consistently follow a predictable pattern and can, thus, be mitigated by a simple strategy. Specifically, we show that these false positive detections with appreciable confidence scores generally occupy large image areas and can usually be filtered by their relative sizes. More importantly, we expect these observations to inspire future research in improving REC-based detection and automated segmentation. Using this technique, we evaluate the performance of SAM on multiple datasets from various specialized domains and report significant improvement in segmentation performance and annotation time savings over manual approaches.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) holds promise for reforming the methodology of spatio-temporal data mining. However, current works for evaluating the spatio-temporal understanding capability of LLMs are somewhat limited and biased. These works either fail to incorporate the latest language models or only focus on assessing the memorized spatio-temporal knowledge. To address this gap, this paper dissects LLMs' capability of spatio-temporal data into four distinct dimensions: knowledge comprehension, spatio-temporal reasoning, accurate computation, and downstream applications. We curate several natural language question-answer tasks for each category and build the benchmark dataset, namely STBench, containing 13 distinct tasks and over 60,000 QA pairs. Moreover, we have assessed the capabilities of 13 LLMs, such as GPT-4o, Gemma and Mistral. Experimental results reveal that existing LLMs show remarkable performance on knowledge comprehension and spatio-temporal reasoning tasks, with potential for further enhancement on other tasks through in-context learning, chain-of-though prompting, and fine-tuning.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Empathetic response generation is a desirable aspect of conversational agents, crucial for facilitating engaging and emotionally intelligent multi-turn conversations between humans and machines. Leveraging large language models for this task has shown promising results, yet challenges persist in ensuring both the empathetic quality of the responses and retention of the generalization performance of the models. In this paper, we propose a novel approach where we construct theory-driven preference datasets and use them to align LLMs with preference optimization algorithms to address these challenges. To measure empathetic response generation, we employ the EmpatheticDialogues dataset, assessing empathy with the diff-EPITOME and BERTscore metrics, and evaluate the generalization performance on the MMLU benchmark. We make all datasets, source code, and models publicly available.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Determining the similarities and differences between humans and artificial intelligence is an important goal both in machine learning and cognitive neuroscience. However, similarities in representations only inform us about the degree of alignment, not the factors that determine it. Drawing upon recent developments in cognitive science, we propose a generic framework for yielding comparable representations in humans and deep neural networks (DNN). Applying this framework to humans and a DNN model of natural images revealed a low-dimensional DNN embedding of both visual and semantic dimensions. In contrast to humans, DNNs exhibited a clear dominance of visual over semantic features, indicating divergent strategies for representing images. While in-silico experiments showed seemingly-consistent interpretability of DNN dimensions, a direct comparison between human and DNN representations revealed substantial differences in how they process images. By making representations directly comparable, our results reveal important challenges for representational alignment, offering a means for improving their comparability.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Intellectual Property (IP) piracy, overbuilding, reverse engineering, and hardware Trojan are serious security concerns during integrated circuit (IC) development. Logic locking has proven to be a solid defence for mitigating these threats. The existing logic locking techniques are vulnerable to SAT-based attacks. However, several SAT-resistant logic locking methods are reported; they require significant overhead. This paper proposes a novel input dependent key-based logic locking (IDKLL) that effectively prevents SAT-based attacks with low overhead. We first introduce a novel idea of IDKLL, where a design is locked such that it functions correctly for all input patterns only when their corresponding valid key sequences are applied. In contrast to conventional logic locking, the proposed IDKLL method uses multiple key sequences (instead of a single key sequence) as a valid key that provides correct functionality for all inputs. Further, we propose a sub-circuit replacement based IDKLL approach called SubLock that locks the design by replacing the original sub-circuitry with the corresponding IDKLL based locked circuit to prevent SAT attack with low overhead. The experimental evaluation on ISCAS benchmarks shows that the proposed SubLock mitigates the SAT attack with high security and reduced overhead over the well-known existing methods.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present the first rigorous security, performance, energy, and cost analyses of the state-of-the-art on-DRAM-die read disturbance mitigation method, Per Row Activation Counting (PRAC), described in JEDEC DDR5 specification's April 2024 update. Unlike prior state-of-the-art that advises the memory controller to periodically issue refresh management (RFM) commands, which provides the DRAM chip with time to perform refreshes, PRAC introduces a new back-off signal. PRAC's back-off signal propagates from the DRAM chip to the memory controller and forces the memory controller to 1) stop serving requests and 2) issue RFM commands. As a result, RFM commands are issued when needed as opposed to periodically, reducing RFM's overheads. We analyze PRAC in four steps. First, we define an adversarial access pattern that represents the worst-case for PRAC's security. Second, we investigate PRAC's configurations and security implications. Our analyses show that PRAC can be configured for secure operation as long as no bitflip occurs before accessing a memory location 10 times. Third, we evaluate the performance impact of PRAC and compare it against prior works using Ramulator 2.0. Our analysis shows that while PRAC incurs less than 13.4% performance overhead for today's DRAM chips, its performance overheads can reach up to 63.2% for future DRAM chips that are more vulnerable to read disturbance bitflips. Fourth, we define an availability adversarial access pattern that exacerbates PRAC's performance overhead to perform a memory performance attack, demonstrating that such an adversarial pattern can hog up to 79% of DRAM throughput and degrade system throughput by up to 65%. We discuss PRAC's implications on future systems and foreshadow future research directions. To aid future research, we open-source our implementations and scripts at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The importance of addressing fairness and bias in artificial intelligence (AI) systems cannot be over-emphasized. Mainstream media has been awashed with news of incidents around stereotypes and bias in many of these systems in recent years. In this survey, we fill a gap with regards to the minimal study of fairness and bias in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) compared to Large Language Models (LLMs), providing 50 examples of datasets and models along with the challenges affecting them; we identify a new category of quantifying bias (preuse), in addition to the two well-known ones in the literature: intrinsic and extrinsic; we critically discuss the various ways researchers are addressing these challenges. Our method involved two slightly different search queries on Google Scholar, which revealed that 33,400 and 538,000 links are the results for the terms "Fairness and bias in Large Multimodal Models" and "Fairness and bias in Large Language Models", respectively. We believe this work contributes to filling this gap and providing insight to researchers and other stakeholders on ways to address the challenge of fairness and bias in multimodal A!.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) face significant challenges in visual document understanding (VDU) tasks due to the high resolution, dense text, and complex layouts typical of document images. These characteristics demand a high level of detail perception ability from MLLMs. While increasing input resolution improves detail perception, it also leads to longer sequences of visual tokens, increasing computational costs and straining the models' ability to handle long contexts. To address these challenges, we introduce DocKylin, a document-centric MLLM that performs visual content slimming at both the pixel and token levels, thereby reducing token sequence length in VDU scenarios. DocKylin utilizes an Adaptive Pixel Slimming (APS) preprocessing module to perform pixel-level slimming, increasing the proportion of informative pixels. Moreover, DocKylin incorporates a novel Dynamic Token Slimming (DTS) module to conduct token-level slimming, filtering essential tokens and removing others to create a compressed, adaptive visual sequence. Experiments demonstrate DocKylin's promising performance across various VDU benchmarks. Notably, both the proposed APS and DTS are parameter-free, facilitating easy integration into existing MLLMs, and our experiments indicate their potential for broader applications.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Environment, Social, and Governance (ESG) KPIs assess an organization's performance on issues such as climate change, greenhouse gas emissions, water consumption, waste management, human rights, diversity, and policies. ESG reports convey this valuable quantitative information through tables. Unfortunately, extracting this information is difficult due to high variability in the table structure as well as content. We propose Statements, a novel domain agnostic data structure for extracting quantitative facts and related information. We propose translating tables to statements as a new supervised deep-learning universal information extraction task. We introduce SemTabNet - a dataset of over 100K annotated tables. Investigating a family of T5-based Statement Extraction Models, our best model generates statements which are 82% similar to the ground-truth (compared to baseline of 21%). We demonstrate the advantages of statements by applying our model to over 2700 tables from ESG reports. The homogeneous nature of statements permits exploratory data analysis on expansive information found in large collections of ESG reports.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models(LLMs) have shown exceptional abilities, yet training these models can be quite challenging. There is a strong dependence on the quality of data and finding the best instruction tuning set. Further, the inherent limitations in training methods create substantial difficulties to train relatively smaller models with 7B and 13B parameters. In our research, we suggest an improved training method for these models by utilising knowledge from larger models, such as a mixture of experts (8x7B) architectures. The scale of these larger models allows them to capture a wide range of variations from data alone, making them effective teachers for smaller models. Moreover, we implement a novel post-training domain alignment phase that employs domain-specific expert models to boost domain-specific knowledge during training while preserving the model's ability to generalise. Fine-tuning Mistral 7B and 2x7B with our method surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art language models with more than 7B and 13B parameters: achieving up to $7.9$ in MT-Bench and $93.04\%$ on AlpacaEval.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, interpretability, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce the Abductive Rule Learner with Context-awareness (ARLC), a model that solves abstract reasoning tasks based on Learn-VRF. ARLC features a novel and more broadly applicable training objective for abductive reasoning, resulting in better interpretability and higher accuracy when solving Raven's progressive matrices (RPM). ARLC allows both programming domain knowledge and learning the rules underlying a data distribution. We evaluate ARLC on the I-RAVEN dataset, showcasing state-of-the-art accuracy across both in-distribution and out-of-distribution (unseen attribute-rule pairs) tests. ARLC surpasses neuro-symbolic and connectionist baselines, including large language models, despite having orders of magnitude fewer parameters. We show ARLC's robustness to post-programming training by incrementally learning from examples on top of programmed knowledge, which only improves its performance and does not result in catastrophic forgetting of the programmed solution. We validate ARLC's seamless transfer learning from a 2x2 RPM constellation to unseen constellations. Our code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The accurate prediction of drug molecule solubility is essential for determining their therapeutic effectiveness and safety, influencing the drug's ADME processes. Traditional solubility prediction techniques often fail to capture the complex nature of molecular tructures, leading to notable deviations between predictions and actual results. For example, the Discussion on Advanced Drug-Like Compound Structures. Lusci highlighted issues in capturing crucial cyclic structural information in molecules with ring structures. To overcome this issue, our research introduces a novel deep learning framework combining attention-based transformers, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), aimed at enhancing the precision of solubility predictions. Utilizing a training set of 9,943 compounds and testing on an anticancer compound dataset, our method achieved a correlation coefficient ($R^2$) of 0.55 and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.59, which outperforms the benchmark models' scores of 0.52 ($R^2$) and 0.61 (RMSE). Importantly, in an additional independent test, our model significantly outperformed the baseline with an RMSE of 1.05 compared to 1.28, a relative accuracy improvement of 45.9%. This research not only demonstrates the vast potential of deep learning for improving solubility prediction accuracy but also offers novel insights for drug design and selection in the future. Continued efforts will be directed towards optimizing the model architecture and extending its application to better support the drug development process, underscoring the pivotal role of deep learning in drug discovery.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Neural networks can learn spurious correlations that lead to the correct prediction in a validation set, but generalise poorly because the predictions are right for the wrong reason. This undesired learning of naive shortcuts (Clever Hans effect) can happen for example in echocardiogram view classification when background cues (e.g. metadata) are biased towards a class and the model learns to focus on those background features instead of on the image content. We propose a simple, yet effective random background augmentation method called BackMix, which samples random backgrounds from other examples in the training set. By enforcing the background to be uncorrelated with the outcome, the model learns to focus on the data within the ultrasound sector and becomes invariant to the regions outside this. We extend our method in a semi-supervised setting, finding that the positive effects of BackMix are maintained with as few as 5% of segmentation labels. A loss weighting mechanism, wBackMix, is also proposed to increase the contribution of the augmented examples. We validate our method on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in classification accuracy, region focus and generalisability.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The scaling of large language models to encode all the world's knowledge in model parameters is unsustainable and has exacerbated resource barriers. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) presents a potential solution, yet its application to vision-language models (VLMs) is under explored. Existing methods focus on models designed for single tasks. Furthermore, they're limited by the need for resource intensive pre training, additional parameter requirements, unaddressed modality prioritization and lack of clear benefit over non-retrieval baselines. This paper introduces RAVEN, a multitask retrieval augmented VLM framework that enhances base VLMs through efficient, task specific fine-tuning. By integrating retrieval augmented samples without the need for additional retrieval-specific parameters, we show that the model acquires retrieval properties that are effective across multiple tasks. Our results and extensive ablations across retrieved modalities for the image captioning and VQA tasks indicate significant performance improvements compared to non retrieved baselines +1 CIDEr on MSCOCO, +4 CIDEr on NoCaps and nearly a +3\% accuracy on specific VQA question types. This underscores the efficacy of applying RAG approaches to VLMs, marking a stride toward more efficient and accessible multimodal learning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been used to finetune Large Language Models (LLMs) using a reward model trained from preference data, to better align with human judgment. The recently introduced direct alignment methods, which are often simpler, more stable, and computationally lighter, can more directly achieve this. However, these approaches cannot optimize arbitrary rewards, and the preference-based ones are not the only rewards of interest for LLMs (eg., unit tests for code generation or textual entailment for summarization, among others). RL-finetuning is usually done with a variation of policy gradient, which calls for on-policy or near-on-policy samples, requiring costly generations. We introduce Contrastive Policy Gradient, or CoPG, a simple and mathematically principled new RL algorithm that can estimate the optimal policy even from off-policy data. It can be seen as an off-policy policy gradient approach that does not rely on important sampling techniques and highlights the importance of using (the right) state baseline. We show this approach to generalize the direct alignment method IPO (identity preference optimization) and classic policy gradient. We experiment with the proposed CoPG on a toy bandit problem to illustrate its properties, as well as for finetuning LLMs on a summarization task, using a learned reward function considered as ground truth for the purpose of the experiments.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>To better align Large Language Models (LLMs) with human judgment, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) learns a reward model and then optimizes it using regularized RL. Recently, direct alignment methods were introduced to learn such a fine-tuned model directly from a preference dataset without computing a proxy reward function. These methods are built upon contrastive losses involving the log-likelihood of (dis)preferred completions according to the trained model. However, completions have various lengths, and the log-likelihood is not length-invariant. On the other side, the cross-entropy loss used in supervised training is length-invariant, as batches are typically averaged token-wise. To reconcile these approaches, we introduce a principled approach for making direct alignment length-invariant. Formally, we introduce a new averaging operator, to be composed with the optimality operator giving the best policy for the underlying RL problem. It translates into averaging the log-likelihood within the loss. We empirically study the effect of such averaging, observing a trade-off between the length of generations and their scores.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Despite significant advancements in robotic systems and surgical data science, ensuring safe and optimal execution in robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RMIS) remains a complex challenge. Current surgical error detection methods involve two parts: identifying surgical gestures and then detecting errors within each gesture clip. These methods seldom consider the rich contextual and semantic information inherent in surgical videos, limiting their performance due to reliance on accurate gesture identification. Motivated by the chain-of-thought prompting in natural language processing, this letter presents a novel and real-time end-to-end error detection framework, Chain-of-Thought (COG) prompting, leveraging contextual information from surgical videos. This encompasses two reasoning modules designed to mimic the decision-making processes of expert surgeons. Concretely, we first design a Gestural-Visual Reasoning module, which utilizes transformer and attention architectures for gesture prompting, while the second, a Multi-Scale Temporal Reasoning module, employs a multi-stage temporal convolutional network with both slow and fast paths for temporal information extraction. We extensively validate our method on the public benchmark RMIS dataset JIGSAWS. Our method encapsulates the reasoning processes inherent to surgical activities enabling it to outperform the state-of-the-art by 4.6% in F1 score, 4.6% in Accuracy, and 5.9% in Jaccard index while processing each frame in 6.69 milliseconds on average, demonstrating the great potential of our approach in enhancing the safety and efficacy of RMIS procedures and surgical education.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, defense, attack, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are sophisticated, targeted cyberattacks designed to gain unauthorized access to systems and remain undetected for extended periods. To evade detection, APT cyberattacks deceive defense layers with breaches and exploits, thereby complicating exposure by traditional anomaly detection-based security methods. The challenge of detecting APTs with machine learning is compounded by the rarity of relevant datasets and the significant imbalance in the data, which makes the detection process highly burdensome. We present AE-APT, a deep learning-based tool for APT detection that features a family of AutoEncoder methods ranging from a basic one to a Transformer-based one. We evaluated our tool on a suite of provenance trace databases produced by the DARPA Transparent Computing program, where APT-like attacks constitute as little as 0.004% of the data. The datasets span multiple operating systems, including Android, Linux, BSD, and Windows, and cover two attack scenarios. The outcomes showed that AE-APT has significantly higher detection rates compared to its competitors, indicating superior performance in detecting and ranking anomalies.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Tokenizers are crucial for encoding information in Large Language Models, but their development has recently stagnated, and they contain inherent weaknesses. Major limitations include computational overhead, ineffective vocabulary use, and unnecessarily large embedding and head layers. Additionally, their performance is biased towards a reference corpus, leading to reduced effectiveness for underrepresented languages. To remedy these issues, we propose T-FREE, which directly embeds words through sparse activation patterns over character triplets, and does not require a reference corpus. T-FREE inherently exploits morphological similarities and allows for strong compression of embedding layers. In our exhaustive experimental evaluation, we achieve competitive downstream performance with a parameter reduction of more than 85% on these layers. Further, T-FREE shows significant improvements in cross-lingual transfer learning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Domain adaptive semantic segmentation aims to generate accurate and dense predictions for an unlabeled target domain by leveraging a supervised model trained on a labeled source domain. The prevalent self-training approach involves retraining the dense discriminative classifier of $p(class|pixel feature)$ using the pseudo-labels from the target domain. While many methods focus on mitigating the issue of noisy pseudo-labels, they often overlook the underlying data distribution p(pixel feature|class) in both the source and target domains. To address this limitation, we propose the multi-prototype Gaussian-Mixture-based (ProtoGMM) model, which incorporates the GMM into contrastive losses to perform guided contrastive learning. Contrastive losses are commonly executed in the literature using memory banks, which can lead to class biases due to underrepresented classes. Furthermore, memory banks often have fixed capacities, potentially restricting the model's ability to capture diverse representations of the target/source domains. An alternative approach is to use global class prototypes (i.e. averaged features per category). However, the global prototypes are based on the unimodal distribution assumption per class, disregarding within-class variation. To address these challenges, we propose the ProtoGMM model. This novel approach involves estimating the underlying multi-prototype source distribution by utilizing the GMM on the feature space of the source samples. The components of the GMM model act as representative prototypes. To achieve increased intra-class semantic similarity, decreased inter-class similarity, and domain alignment between the source and target domains, we employ multi-prototype contrastive learning between source distribution and target samples. The experiments show the effectiveness of our method on UDA benchmarks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) have been employed in various intelligent educational tasks to assist teaching. While preliminary explorations have focused on independent LLM-empowered agents for specific educational tasks, the potential for LLMs within a multi-agent collaborative framework to simulate a classroom with real user participation remains unexplored. In this work, we propose SimClass, a multi-agent classroom simulation framework involving user participation. We recognize representative class roles and introduce a novel class control mechanism for automatic classroom teaching, and conduct user experiments in two real-world courses. Utilizing the Flanders Interactive Analysis System and Community of Inquiry theoretical frame works from educational analysis, we demonstrate that LLMs can simulate traditional classroom interaction patterns effectively while enhancing user's experience. We also observe emergent group behaviors among agents in SimClass, where agents collaborate to create enlivening interactions in classrooms to improve user learning process. We hope this work pioneers the application of LLM-empowered multi-agent systems in virtual classroom teaching.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant promise as copilots in various tasks. Local deployment of LLMs on edge devices is necessary when handling privacy-sensitive data or latency-sensitive tasks. The computational constraints of such devices make direct deployment of powerful large-scale LLMs impractical, necessitating the Knowledge Distillation from large-scale models to lightweight models. Lots of work has been done to elicit diversity and quality training examples from LLMs, but little attention has been paid to aligning teacher instructional content based on student preferences, akin to "responsive teaching" in pedagogy. Thus, we propose ARTE, dubbed Aligning TeacheR with StudenT PreferencEs, a framework that aligns the teacher model with student preferences to generate tailored training examples for Knowledge Distillation. Specifically, we elicit draft questions and rationales from the teacher model, then collect student preferences on these questions and rationales using students' performance with in-context learning as a proxy, and finally align the teacher model with student preferences. In the end, we repeat the first step with the aligned teacher model to elicit tailored training examples for the student model on the target task. Extensive experiments on academic benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of ARTE over existing instruction-tuning datasets distilled from powerful LLMs. Moreover, we thoroughly investigate the generalization of ARTE, including the generalization of fine-tuned student models in reasoning ability and the generalization of aligned teacher models to generate tailored training data across tasks and students. In summary, our contributions lie in proposing a novel framework for tailored training example generation, demonstrating its efficacy in experiments, and investigating the generalization of both student & aligned teacher models in ARTE.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a state-of-the-art technique that enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by retrieving relevant knowledge from an external, non-parametric database. This approach aims to mitigate common LLM issues such as hallucinations and outdated knowledge. Although existing research has demonstrated security and privacy vulnerabilities within RAG systems, making them susceptible to attacks like jailbreaks and prompt injections, the security of the RAG system's external databases remains largely underexplored. In this paper, we employ Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) to determine whether a sample is part of the knowledge database of a RAG system, using only black-box API access. Our core hypothesis posits that if a sample is a member, it will exhibit significant similarity to the text generated by the RAG system. To test this, we compute the cosine similarity and the model's perplexity to establish a membership score, thereby building robust features. We then introduce two novel attack strategies: a Threshold-based Attack and a Machine Learning-based Attack, designed to accurately identify membership. Experimental validation of our methods has achieved a ROC AUC of 82%.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Uncovering latent values and opinions in large language models (LLMs) can help identify biases and mitigate potential harm. Recently, this has been approached by presenting LLMs with survey questions and quantifying their stances towards morally and politically charged statements. However, the stances generated by LLMs can vary greatly depending on how they are prompted, and there are many ways to argue for or against a given position. In this work, we propose to address this by analysing a large and robust dataset of 156k LLM responses to the 62 propositions of the Political Compass Test (PCT) generated by 6 LLMs using 420 prompt variations. We perform coarse-grained analysis of their generated stances and fine-grained analysis of the plain text justifications for those stances. For fine-grained analysis, we propose to identify tropes in the responses: semantically similar phrases that are recurrent and consistent across different prompts, revealing patterns in the text that a given LLM is prone to produce. We find that demographic features added to prompts significantly affect outcomes on the PCT, reflecting bias, as well as disparities between the results of tests when eliciting closed-form vs. open domain responses. Additionally, patterns in the plain text rationales via tropes show that similar justifications are repeatedly generated across models and prompts even with disparate stances.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recently, the emerging graph Transformers have made significant advancements for node classification on graphs. In most graph Transformers, a crucial step involves transforming the input graph into token sequences as the model input, enabling Transformer to effectively learn the node representations. However, we observe that existing methods only express partial graph information of nodes through single-type token generation. Consequently, they require tailored strategies to encode additional graph-specific features into the Transformer to ensure the quality of node representation learning, limiting the model flexibility to handle diverse graphs. To this end, we propose a new graph Transformer called NTFormer to address this issue. NTFormer introduces a novel token generator called Node2Par, which constructs various token sequences using different token elements for each node. This flexibility allows Node2Par to generate valuable token sequences from different perspectives, ensuring comprehensive expression of rich graph features. Benefiting from the merits of Node2Par, NTFormer only leverages a Transformer-based backbone without graph-specific modifications to learn node representations, eliminating the need for graph-specific modifications. Extensive experiments conducted on various benchmark datasets containing homophily and heterophily graphs with different scales demonstrate the superiority of NTFormer over representative graph Transformers and graph neural networks for node classification.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advancements in Large Language Models have transformed ML/AI development, necessitating a reevaluation of AutoML principles for the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. To address the challenges of hyper-parameter optimization and online adaptation in RAG, we propose the AutoRAG-HP framework, which formulates the hyper-parameter tuning as an online multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem and introduces a novel two-level Hierarchical MAB (Hier-MAB) method for efficient exploration of large search spaces. We conduct extensive experiments on tuning hyper-parameters, such as top-k retrieved documents, prompt compression ratio, and embedding methods, using the ALCE-ASQA and Natural Questions datasets. Our evaluation from jointly optimization all three hyper-parameters demonstrate that MAB-based online learning methods can achieve Recall@5 $\approx 0.8$ for scenarios with prominent gradients in search space, using only $\sim20\%$ of the LLM API calls required by the Grid Search approach. Additionally, the proposed Hier-MAB approach outperforms other baselines in more challenging optimization scenarios. The code will be made available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>explainability, diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Many problems in physical sciences are characterized by the prediction of space-time sequences. Such problems range from weather prediction to the analysis of disease propagation and video prediction. Modern techniques for the solution of these problems typically combine Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) architecture with a time prediction mechanism. However, oftentimes, such approaches underperform in the long-range propagation of information and lack explainability. In this work, we introduce a physically inspired architecture for the solution of such problems. Namely, we propose to augment CNNs with advection by designing a novel semi-Lagrangian push operator. We show that the proposed operator allows for the non-local transformation of information compared with standard convolutional kernels. We then complement it with Reaction and Diffusion neural components to form a network that mimics the Reaction-Advection-Diffusion equation, in high dimensions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our network on a number of spatio-temporal datasets that show their merit.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While pre-training large-scale video-language models (VLMs) has shown remarkable potential for various downstream video-language tasks, existing VLMs can still suffer from certain commonly seen limitations, e.g., coarse-grained cross-modal aligning , under-modeling of temporal dynamics, detached video-language view. In this work, we target enhancing VLMs with a fine-grained structural spatio-temporal alignment learning method (namely Finsta). First of all, we represent the input texts and videos with fine-grained scene graph (SG) structures, both of which are further unified into a holistic SG (HSG) for bridging two modalities. Then, an SG-based framework is built, where the textual SG (TSG) is encoded with a graph Transformer, while the video dynamic SG (DSG) and the HSG are modeled with a novel recurrent graph Transformer for spatial and temporal feature propagation. A spatial-temporal Gaussian differential graph Transformer is further devised to strengthen the sense of the changes in objects across spatial and temporal dimensions. Next, based on the fine-grained structural features of TSG and DSG, we perform object-centered spatial alignment and predicate-centered temporal alignment respectively, enhancing the video-language grounding in both the spatiality and temporality. We design our method as a plug&play system, which can be integrated into existing well-trained VLMs for further representation augmentation, without training from scratch or relying on SG annotations in downstream applications. On 6 representative VL modeling tasks over 12 datasets in both standard and long-form video scenarios, Finsta consistently improves the existing 13 strong-performing VLMs persistently, and refreshes the current state-of-the-art end task performance significantly in both the fine-tuning and zero-shot settings.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While tokenized graph Transformers have demonstrated strong performance in node classification tasks, their reliance on a limited subset of nodes with high similarity scores for constructing token sequences overlooks valuable information from other nodes, hindering their ability to fully harness graph information for learning optimal node representations. To address this limitation, we propose a novel graph Transformer called GCFormer. Unlike previous approaches, GCFormer develops a hybrid token generator to create two types of token sequences, positive and negative, to capture diverse graph information. And a tailored Transformer-based backbone is adopted to learn meaningful node representations from these generated token sequences. Additionally, GCFormer introduces contrastive learning to extract valuable information from both positive and negative token sequences, enhancing the quality of learned node representations. Extensive experimental results across various datasets, including homophily and heterophily graphs, demonstrate the superiority of GCFormer in node classification, when compared to representative graph neural networks (GNNs) and graph Transformers.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) are central to our interaction with digital devices. Recently, growing efforts have been made to build models for various GUI understanding tasks. However, these efforts largely overlook an important GUI-referring task: screen reading based on user-indicated points, which we name the Screen Point-and-Read (SPR) task. This task is predominantly handled by rigid accessible screen reading tools, in great need of new models driven by advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). In this paper, we propose a Tree-of-Lens (ToL) agent, utilizing a novel ToL grounding mechanism, to address the SPR task. Based on the input point coordinate and the corresponding GUI screenshot, our ToL agent constructs a Hierarchical Layout Tree. Based on the tree, our ToL agent not only comprehends the content of the indicated area but also articulates the layout and spatial relationships between elements. Such layout information is crucial for accurately interpreting information on the screen, distinguishing our ToL agent from other screen reading tools. We also thoroughly evaluate the ToL agent against other baselines on a newly proposed SPR benchmark, which includes GUIs from mobile, web, and operating systems. Last but not least, we test the ToL agent on mobile GUI navigation tasks, demonstrating its utility in identifying incorrect actions along the path of agent execution trajectories.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Up-to-date and reliable Large Language Models (LLMs) are consistently sought after. Typically, LLMs are trained on a fixed dataset and then deployed.

Enable automatic training of AI using web data involves significant concerns regarding data quality and safety due to bias, spam, and other unsafe or unwanted text. Pure data is essential for producing reliable models. Training a model on impure data may result in undesirable outcomes.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), such as GPT-4V, has led to significant advancements. However, these models still face challenges in medical multimodal capabilities due to limitations in the quantity and quality of medical vision-text data, stemming from data privacy concerns and high annotation costs. While pioneering approaches utilize PubMed's large-scale, de-identified medical image-text pairs to address these limitations, they still fall short due to inherent data noise. To tackle this, we refined medical image-text pairs from PubMed and employed MLLMs (GPT-4V) in an 'unblinded' capacity to denoise and reformat the data, resulting in the creation of the PubMedVision dataset with 1.3 million medical VQA samples. Our validation demonstrates that: (1) PubMedVision can significantly enhance the medical multimodal capabilities of current MLLMs, showing significant improvement in benchmarks including the MMMU Health & Medicine track; (2) manual checks by medical experts and empirical results validate the superior data quality of our dataset compared to other data construction methods. Using PubMedVision, we train a 34B medical MLLM HuatuoGPT-Vision, which shows superior performance in medical multimodal scenarios among open-source MLLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent studies have shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to accurately retrieve information and maintain reasoning capabilities when processing long-context inputs. To address these limitations, we propose a finetuning approach utilizing a carefully designed synthetic dataset comprising numerical key-value retrieval tasks. Our experiments on models like GPT-3.5 Turbo and Mistral 7B demonstrate that finetuning LLMs on this dataset significantly improves LLMs' information retrieval and reasoning capabilities in longer-context settings. We present an analysis of the finetuned models, illustrating the transfer of skills from synthetic to real task evaluations (e.g., $10.5\%$ improvement on $20$ documents MDQA at position $10$ for GPT-3.5 Turbo). We also find that finetuned LLMs' performance on general benchmarks remains almost constant while LLMs finetuned on other baseline long-context augmentation data can encourage hallucination (e.g., on TriviaQA, Mistral 7B finetuned on our synthetic data cause no performance drop while other baseline data can cause a drop that ranges from $2.33\%$ to $6.19\%$). Our study highlights the potential of finetuning on synthetic data for improving the performance of LLMs on longer-context tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Given an image of a natural scene, we are able to quickly decompose it into a set of components such as objects, lighting, shadows, and foreground. We can then envision a scene where we combine certain components with those from other images, for instance a set of objects from our bedroom and animals from a zoo under the lighting conditions of a forest, even if we have never encountered such a scene before. In this paper, we present a method to decompose an image into such compositional components. Our approach, Decomp Diffusion, is an unsupervised method which, when given a single image, infers a set of different components in the image, each represented by a diffusion model. We demonstrate how components can capture different factors of the scene, ranging from global scene descriptors like shadows or facial expression to local scene descriptors like constituent objects. We further illustrate how inferred factors can be flexibly composed, even with factors inferred from other models, to generate a variety of scenes sharply different than those seen in training time.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In recent decades, the causes and consequences of climate change have accelerated, affecting our planet on an unprecedented scale. This change is closely tied to the ways in which humans alter their surroundings. As our actions continue to impact natural areas, using satellite images to observe and measure these effects has become crucial for understanding and combating climate change. Aiming to map land naturalness on the continuum of modern human pressure, we have developed a multi-modal supervised deep learning framework that addresses the unique challenges of satellite data and the task at hand. We incorporate contextual and geographical priors, represented by corresponding coordinate information and broader contextual information, including and surrounding the immediate patch to be predicted. Our framework improves the model's predictive performance in mapping land naturalness from Sentinel-2 data, a type of multi-spectral optical satellite imagery. Recognizing that our protective measures are only as effective as our understanding of the ecosystem, quantifying naturalness serves as a crucial step toward enhancing our environmental stewardship.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In recent years, extensive research has been conducted on the vulnerability of ASR systems, revealing that black-box adversarial example attacks pose significant threats to real-world ASR systems. However, most existing black-box attacks rely on queries to the target ASRs, which is impractical when queries are not permitted. In this paper, we propose ZQ-Attack, a transfer-based adversarial attack on ASR systems in the zero-query black-box setting. Through a comprehensive review and categorization of modern ASR technologies, we first meticulously select surrogate ASRs of diverse types to generate adversarial examples. Following this, ZQ-Attack initializes the adversarial perturbation with a scaled target command audio, rendering it relatively imperceptible while maintaining effectiveness. Subsequently, to achieve high transferability of adversarial perturbations, we propose a sequential ensemble optimization algorithm, which iteratively optimizes the adversarial perturbation on each surrogate model, leveraging collaborative information from other models. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate ZQ-Attack. In the over-the-line setting, ZQ-Attack achieves a 100% success rate of attack (SRoA) with an average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 21.91dB on 4 online speech recognition services, and attains an average SRoA of 100% and SNR of 19.67dB on 16 open-source ASRs. For commercial intelligent voice control devices, ZQ-Attack also achieves a 100% SRoA with an average SNR of 15.77dB in the over-the-air setting.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Test set contamination, wherein test data from a benchmark ends up in a newer model's training set, is a well-documented obstacle for fair LLM evaluation and can quickly render benchmarks obsolete. To mitigate this, many recent benchmarks crowdsource new prompts and evaluations from human or LLM judges; however, these can introduce significant biases, and break down when scoring hard questions. In this work, we introduce a new benchmark for LLMs designed to be immune to both test set contamination and the pitfalls of LLM judging and human crowdsourcing. We release LiveBench, the first benchmark that (1) contains frequently-updated questions from recent information sources, (2) scores answers automatically according to objective ground-truth values, and (3) contains a wide variety of challenging tasks, spanning math, coding, reasoning, language, instruction following, and data analysis. To achieve this, LiveBench contains questions that are based on recently-released math competitions, arXiv papers, news articles, and datasets, and it contains harder, contamination-free versions of tasks from previous benchmarks such as Big-Bench Hard, AMPS, and IFEval. We evaluate many prominent closed-source models, as well as dozens of open-source models ranging from 0.5B to 110B in size. LiveBench is difficult, with top models achieving below 65% accuracy. We release all questions, code, and model answers. Questions will be added and updated on a monthly basis, and we will release new tasks and harder versions of tasks over time so that LiveBench can distinguish between the capabilities of LLMs as they improve in the future. We welcome community engagement and collaboration for expanding the benchmark tasks and models.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present substantial evidence demonstrating the benefits of integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with a Contextual Multi-Armed Bandit framework. Contextual bandits have been widely used in recommendation systems to generate personalized suggestions based on user-specific contexts. We show that LLMs, pre-trained on extensive corpora rich in human knowledge and preferences, can simulate human behaviours well enough to jump-start contextual multi-armed bandits to reduce online learning regret. We propose an initialization algorithm for contextual bandits by prompting LLMs to produce a pre-training dataset of approximate human preferences for the bandit. This significantly reduces online learning regret and data-gathering costs for training such models. Our approach is validated empirically through two sets of experiments with different bandit setups: one which utilizes LLMs to serve as an oracle and a real-world experiment utilizing data from a conjoint survey experiment.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Scaling up deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods presents a significant challenge. Following developments in generative modelling, model-based RL positions itself as a strong contender. Recent advances in sequence modelling have led to effective transformer-based world models, albeit at the price of heavy computations due to the long sequences of tokens required to accurately simulate environments. In this work, we propose $\Delta$-IRIS, a new agent with a world model architecture composed of a discrete autoencoder that encodes stochastic deltas between time steps and an autoregressive transformer that predicts future deltas by summarizing the current state of the world with continuous tokens. In the Crafter benchmark, $\Delta$-IRIS sets a new state of the art at multiple frame budgets, while being an order of magnitude faster to train than previous attention-based approaches.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>protect, defense, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>For the last several years, the embedding of hidden information by steganographic techniques in network communications is increasingly used by attackers in order to obscure data infiltration, exfiltration or command and control in IT (information technology) and OT (operational technology) systems. Especially industrial control systems (ICS) and critical infrastructures have increased protection requirements. Currently, network defense mechanisms are unfortunately quite ineffective against novel attacks based on network steganography. Thus, on the one hand huge amounts of network data with steganographic embedding is required to train, evaluate and improve defense mechanisms. On the other hand, the real-time embedding of hidden information in productive ICS networks is crucial due to safety violations. Additionally it is time consuming because it needs special laboratory setup. To address this challenge, this work introduces an embedding concept to gene ate synthetic steganographic network data to automatically produce significant amounts of data for training and evaluation of defense mechanisms. The concept enables the possibility to manipulate a network packet wherever required and outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of embedding pace significantly.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Fully test-time adaptation aims to adapt the network model based on sequential analysis of input samples during the inference stage to address the cross-domain performance degradation problem of deep neural networks. This work is based on the following interesting finding: in transformer-based image classification, the class token at the first transformer encoder layer can be learned to capture the domain-specific characteristics of target samples during test-time adaptation. This learned token, when combined with input image patch embeddings, is able to gradually remove the domain-specific information from the feature representations of input samples during the transformer encoding process, thereby significantly improving the test-time adaptation performance of the source model across different domains. We refer to this class token as visual conditioning token (VCT). To successfully learn the VCT, we propose a bi-level learning approach to capture the long-term variations of domain-specific characteristics while accommodating local variations of instance-specific characteristics. Experimental results on the benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed bi-level visual conditioning token learning method is able to achieve significantly improved test-time adaptation performance by up to 1.9%.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Hate speech poses a significant threat to social harmony. Over the past two years, Indonesia has seen a ten-fold increase in the online hate speech ratio, underscoring the urgent need for effective detection mechanisms. However, progress is hindered by the limited availability of labeled data for Indonesian texts. The condition is even worse for marginalized minorities, such as Shia, LGBTQ, and other ethnic minorities because hate speech is underreported and less understood by detection tools. Furthermore, the lack of accommodation for subjectivity in current datasets compounds this issue. To address this, we introduce IndoToxic2024, a comprehensive Indonesian hate speech and toxicity classification dataset. Comprising 43,692 entries annotated by 19 diverse individuals, the dataset focuses on texts targeting vulnerable groups in Indonesia, specifically during the hottest political event in the country: the presidential election. We establish baselines for seven binary classification tasks, achieving a macro-F1 score of 0.78 with a BERT model (IndoBERTweet) fine-tuned for hate speech classification. Furthermore, we demonstrate how incorporating demographic information can enhance the zero-shot performance of the large language model, gpt-3.5-turbo. However, we also caution that an overemphasis on demographic information can negatively impact the fine-tuned model performance due to data fragmentation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>High-quality distractors are crucial to both the assessment and pedagogical value of multiple-choice questions (MCQs), where manually crafting ones that anticipate knowledge deficiencies or misconceptions among real students is difficult. Meanwhile, automated distractor generation, even with the help of large language models (LLMs), remains challenging for subjects like math. It is crucial to not only identify plausible distractors but also understand the error behind them. In this paper, we introduce DiVERT (Distractor Generation with Variational Errors Represented as Text), a novel variational approach that learns an interpretable representation of errors behind distractors in math MCQs. Through experiments on a real-world math MCQ dataset with 1,434 questions used by hundreds of thousands of students, we show that DiVERT, despite using a base open-source LLM with 7B parameters, outperforms state-of-the-art approaches using GPT-4o on downstream distractor generation. We also conduct a human evaluation with math educators and find that DiVERT leads to error labels that are of comparable quality to human-authored ones.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Sentiment analysis serves as a pivotal component in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Advancements in multilingual pre-trained models such as XLM-R and mT5 have contributed to the increasing interest in cross-lingual sentiment analysis. The recent emergence in Large Language Models (LLM) has significantly advanced general NLP tasks, however, the capability of such LLMs in cross-lingual sentiment analysis has not been fully studied. This work undertakes an empirical analysis to compare the cross-lingual transfer capability of public Small Multilingual Language Models (SMLM) like XLM-R, against English-centric LLMs such as Llama-3, in the context of sentiment analysis across English, Spanish, French and Chinese. Our findings reveal that among public models, SMLMs exhibit superior zero-shot cross-lingual performance relative to LLMs. However, in few-shot cross-lingual settings, public LLMs demonstrate an enhanced adaptive potential. In addition, we observe that proprietary GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 lead in zero-shot cross-lingual capability, but are outpaced by public models in few-shot scenarios.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Existing 3D object detection suffers from expensive annotation costs and poor transferability to unknown data due to the domain gap, Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) aims to generalize detection models trained in labeled source domains to perform robustly on unexplored target domains, providing a promising solution for cross-domain 3D object detection. Although Self-Training (ST) based cross-domain 3D detection methods with the assistance of pseudo-labeling techniques have achieved remarkable progress, they still face the issue of low-quality pseudo-labels when there are significant domain disparities due to the absence of a process for feature distribution alignment. While Adversarial Learning (AL) based methods can effectively align the feature distributions of the source and target domains, the inability to obtain labels in the target domain forces the adoption of asymmetric optimization losses, resulting in a challenging issue of source domain bias. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel unsupervised domain adaptation framework for 3D object detection via collaborating ST and AL, dubbed as STAL3D, unleashing the complementary advantages of pseudo labels and feature distribution alignment. Additionally, a Background Suppression Adversarial Learning (BS-AL) module and a Scale Filtering Module (SFM) are designed tailored for 3D cross-domain scenes, effectively alleviating the issues of the large proportion of background interference and source domain size bias. Our STAL3D achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple cross-domain tasks and even surpasses the Oracle results on Waymo $\rightarrow$ KITTI and Waymo $\rightarrow$ KITTI-rain.</li>

In this paper, we present a novel framework, SimTxtSeg, that leverages simple text cues to generate high-quality pseudo-labels and study the cross-modal fusion in training segmentation models, simultaneously. Our contribution consists of two key components: an effective Textual-to-Visual Cue Converter that produces visual prompts from text prompts on medical images, and a text-guided segmentation model with Text-Vision Hybrid Attention that fuses text and image features. We evaluate our framework on two medical image segmentation tasks: colonic polyp segmentation and MRI brain tumor segmentation, and achieve consistent state-of-the-art performance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Transformer-based segmentation methods face the challenge of efficient inference when dealing with high-resolution images. Recently, several linear attention architectures, such as Mamba and RWKV, have attracted much attention as they can process long sequences efficiently. In this work, we focus on designing an efficient segment-anything model by exploring these different architectures. Specifically, we design a mixed backbone that contains convolution and RWKV operation, which achieves the best for both accuracy and efficiency. In addition, we design an efficient decoder to utilize the multiscale tokens to obtain high-quality masks. We denote our method as RWKV-SAM, a simple, effective, fast baseline for SAM-like models. Moreover, we build a benchmark containing various high-quality segmentation datasets and jointly train one efficient yet high-quality segmentation model using this benchmark. Based on the benchmark results, our RWKV-SAM achieves outstanding performance in efficiency and segmentation quality compared to transformers and other linear attention models. For example, compared with the same-scale transformer model, RWKV-SAM achieves more than 2x speedup and can achieve better segmentation performance on various datasets. In addition, RWKV-SAM outperforms recent vision Mamba models with better classification and semantic segmentation results. Code and models will be publicly available.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Modern generative models demonstrate impressive capabilities, likely stemming from an ability to identify and manipulate abstract concepts underlying their training data. However, fundamental questions remain: what determines the concepts a model learns, the order in which it learns them, and its ability to manipulate those concepts? To address these questions, we propose analyzing a model's learning dynamics via a framework we call the concept space, where each axis represents an independent concept underlying the data generating process. By characterizing learning dynamics in this space, we identify how the speed at which a concept is learned, and hence the order of concept learning, is controlled by properties of the data we term concept signal. Further, we observe moments of sudden turns in the direction of a model's learning dynamics in concept space. Surprisingly, these points precisely correspond to the emergence of hidden capabilities, i.e., where latent interventions show the model possesses the capability to manipulate a concept, but these capabilities cannot yet be elicited via naive input prompting. While our results focus on synthetically defined toy datasets, we hypothesize a general claim on emergence of hidden capabilities may hold: generative models possess latent capabilities that emerge suddenly and consistently during training, though a model might not exhibit these capabilities under naive input prompting.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, attack, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the dynamic cyber threat landscape, effective decision-making under uncertainty is crucial for maintaining robust information security. This paper introduces the Cyber Resilience Index (CRI), a TTP-based probabilistic approach to quantifying an organisation's defence effectiveness against cyber-attacks (campaigns). Building upon the Threat-Intelligence Based Security Assessment (TIBSA) methodology, we present a mathematical model that translates complex threat intelligence into an actionable, unified metric similar to a stock market index, that executives can understand and interact with while teams can act upon. Our method leverages Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) to simulate attacker behaviour considering real-world uncertainties and the latest threat actor tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). This allows for dynamic, context-aware evaluation of an organization's security posture, moving beyond static compliance-based assessments. As a result, decision-makers are equipped with a single metric of cyber resilience that bridges the gap between quantitative and qualitative assessments, enabling data-driven resource allocation and strategic planning. This can ultimately lead to more informed decision-making, mitigate under or overspending, and assist in resource allocation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We demonstrate and investigate the remarkable robustness of Large Language Models by deleting and swapping adjacent layers. We find that deleting and swapping interventions retain 72-95\% of the original model's prediction accuracy without fine-tuning, whereas models with more layers exhibit more robustness. Based on the results of the layer-wise intervention and further experiments, we hypothesize the existence of four universal stages of inference across eight different models: detokenization, feature engineering, prediction ensembling, and residual sharpening. The first stage integrates local information, lifting raw token representations into higher-level contextual representations. Next is the iterative refinement of task and entity-specific features. Then, the second half of the model begins with a phase transition, where hidden representations align more with the vocabulary space due to specialized model components. Finally, the last layer sharpens the following token distribution by eliminating obsolete features that add noise to the prediction.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Current universal segmentation methods demonstrate strong capabilities in pixel-level image and video understanding. However, they lack reasoning abilities and cannot be controlled via text instructions. In contrast, large vision-language multimodal models exhibit powerful vision-based conversation and reasoning capabilities but lack pixel-level understanding and have difficulty accepting visual prompts for flexible user interaction. This paper proposes OMG-LLaVA, a new and elegant framework combining powerful pixel-level vision understanding with reasoning abilities. It can accept various visual and text prompts for flexible user interaction. Specifically, we use a universal segmentation method as the visual encoder, integrating image information, perception priors, and visual prompts into visual tokens provided to the LLM. The LLM is responsible for understanding the user's text instructions and providing text responses and pixel-level segmentation results based on the visual information. We propose perception prior embedding to better integrate perception priors with image features. OMG-LLaVA achieves image-level, object-level, and pixel-level reasoning and understanding in a single model, matching or surpassing the performance of specialized methods on multiple benchmarks. Rather than using LLM to connect each specialist, our work aims at end-to-end training on one encoder, one decoder, and one LLM. The code and model have been released for further research.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Visual perception tasks are predominantly solved by Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures, which, despite their effectiveness, encounter a computational bottleneck due to the quadratic complexity of computing self-attention. This inefficiency is largely due to the self-attention heads capturing redundant token interactions, reflecting inherent redundancy within visual data. Many works have aimed to reduce the computational complexity of self-attention in ViTs, leading to the development of efficient and sparse transformer architectures. In this paper, viewing through the efficiency lens, we realized that introducing any sparse self-attention strategy in ViTs can keep the computational overhead low. However, these strategies are sub-optimal as they often fail to capture fine-grained visual details. This observation leads us to propose a general, efficient, sparse architecture, named Fibottention, for approximating self-attention with superlinear complexity that is built upon Fibonacci sequences. The key strategies in Fibottention include: it excludes proximate tokens to reduce redundancy, employs structured sparsity by design to decrease computational demands, and incorporates inception-like diversity across attention heads. This diversity ensures the capture of complementary information through non-overlapping token interactions, optimizing both performance and resource utilization in ViTs for visual representation learning. We embed our Fibottention mechanism into multiple state-of-the-art transformer architectures dedicated to visual tasks. Leveraging only 2-6% of the elements in the self-attention heads, Fibottention in conjunction with ViT and its variants, consistently achieves significant performance boosts compared to standard ViTs in nine datasets across three domains $\unicode{x2013}$ image classification, video understanding, and robot learning tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce ReXTime, a benchmark designed to rigorously test AI models' ability to perform temporal reasoning within video events. Specifically, ReXTime focuses on reasoning across time, i.e. human-like understanding when the question and its corresponding answer occur in different video segments. This form of reasoning, requiring advanced understanding of cause-and-effect relationships across video segments, poses significant challenges to even the frontier multimodal large language models. To facilitate this evaluation, we develop an automated pipeline for generating temporal reasoning question-answer pairs, significantly reducing the need for labor-intensive manual annotations. Our benchmark includes 921 carefully vetted validation samples and 2,143 test samples, each manually curated for accuracy and relevance. Evaluation results show that while frontier large language models outperform academic models, they still lag behind human performance by a significant 14.3% accuracy gap. Additionally, our pipeline creates a training dataset of 9,695 machine generated samples without manual effort, which empirical studies suggest can enhance the across-time reasoning via fine-tuning.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Automatic anomaly detection based on visual cues holds practical significance in various domains, such as manufacturing and product quality assessment. This paper introduces a new conditional anomaly detection problem, which involves identifying anomalies in a query image by comparing it to a reference shape. To address this challenge, we have created a large dataset, BrokenChairs-180K, consisting of around 180K images, with diverse anomalies, geometries, and textures paired with 8,143 reference 3D shapes. To tackle this task, we have proposed a novel transformer-based approach that explicitly learns the correspondence between the query image and reference 3D shape via feature alignment and leverages a customized attention mechanism for anomaly detection. Our approach has been rigorously evaluated through comprehensive experiments, serving as a benchmark for future research in this domain.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Model inversion and membership inference attacks aim to reconstruct and verify the data which a model was trained on. However, they are not guaranteed to find all training samples as they do not know the size of the training set. In this paper, we introduce a new task: dataset size recovery, that aims to determine the number of samples used to train a model, directly from its weights. We then propose DSiRe, a method for recovering the number of images used to fine-tune a model, in the common case where fine-tuning uses LoRA. We discover that both the norm and the spectrum of the LoRA matrices are closely linked to the fine-tuning dataset size; we leverage this finding to propose a simple yet effective prediction algorithm. To evaluate dataset size recovery of LoRA weights, we develop and release a new benchmark, LoRA-WiSE, consisting of over 25000 weight snapshots from more than 2000 diverse LoRA fine-tuned models. Our best classifier can predict the number of fine-tuning images with a mean absolute error of 0.36 images, establishing the feasibility of this attack.</li>
