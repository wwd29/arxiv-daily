<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The increasing prevalence of surveillance cameras in smart cities, coupled with the surge of online video applications, has heightened concerns regarding public security and privacy protection, which propelled automated Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) into a fundamental research task within the Artificial Intelligence (AI) community. With the advancements in deep learning and edge computing, VAD has made significant progress and advances synergized with emerging applications in smart cities and video internet, which has moved beyond the conventional research scope of algorithm engineering to deployable Networking Systems for VAD (NSVAD), a practical hotspot for intersection exploration in the AI, IoVT, and computing fields. In this article, we delineate the foundational assumptions, learning frameworks, and applicable scenarios of various deep learning-driven VAD routes, offering an exhaustive tutorial for novices in NSVAD. This article elucidates core concepts by reviewing recent advances and typical solutions, and aggregating available research resources (e.g., literatures, code, tools, and workshops) accessible at this https URL. Additionally, we showcase our latest NSVAD research in industrial IoT and smart cities, along with an end-cloud collaborative architecture for deployable NSVAD to further elucidate its potential scope of research and application. Lastly, this article projects future development trends and discusses how the integration of AI and computing technologies can address existing research challenges and promote open opportunities, serving as an insightful guide for prospective researchers and engineers.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Prior studies on 3D scene understanding have primarily developed specialized models for specific tasks or required task-specific fine-tuning. In this study, we propose Grounded 3D-LLM, which explores the potential of 3D large multi-modal models (3D LMMs) to consolidate various 3D vision tasks within a unified generative framework. The model uses scene referent tokens as special noun phrases to reference 3D scenes, enabling the handling of sequences that interleave 3D and textual data. It offers a natural approach for translating 3D vision tasks into language formats using task-specific instruction templates. To facilitate the use of referent tokens in subsequent language modeling, we have curated large-scale grounded language datasets that offer finer scene-text correspondence at the phrase level by bootstrapping existing object labels. Subsequently, we introduced Contrastive LAnguage-Scene Pre-training (CLASP) to effectively leverage this data, thereby integrating 3D vision with language models. Our comprehensive evaluation covers open-ended tasks like dense captioning and 3D QA, alongside close-ended tasks such as object detection and language grounding. Experiments across multiple 3D benchmarks reveal the leading performance and the broad applicability of Grounded 3D-LLM. Code and datasets will be released on the project page: this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, protect, defense</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Classical cybersecurity is often perceived as a rigid science discipline filled with computer scientists and mathematicians. However, due to the rapid pace of technology development and integration, new criminal enterprises, new defense tactics, and the understanding of the human element, cybersecurity is quickly beginning to encompass more than just computers. Cybersecurity experts must broaden their perspectives beyond traditional disciplinary boundaries to provide the best protection possible. They must start to practice transdisciplinary cybersecurity. Taking influence from the Stakeholder Theory in business ethics, this paper presents a framework to encourage transdisciplinary thinking and assist experts in tackling the new challenges of the modern day. The framework uses the simple Think, Plan, Do approach to enable experts to develop their transdisciplinary thinking. The framework is intended to be used as an evaluation tool for existing cybersecurity practices or postures, as a development tool to engage with other disciplines to foster learning and create new methods, and as a guidance tool to encourage new ways of thinking about, perceiving, and executing cybersecurity practices. For each of those intended uses, a use case is presented as an example to showcase how the framework might be used. The ultimate goal of this paper is not the framework but transdisciplinary thinking. By using the tool presented here and developing their own transdisciplinary thinking, cybersecurity experts can be better prepared to face cybersecurity's unique and complex challenges.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Ashland City, Tennessee, located within the Lower Cumberland Sycamore watershed, is highly susceptible to flooding due to increased upstream water levels. This study aimed to develop a robust flood prediction model for the city, utilizing water level data at 30-minute intervals from ten USGS gauge stations within the watershed. A Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) network, known for its ability to effectively process sequential time-series data, was used. The model was trained, validated, and tested using a year-long dataset (January 2021-January 2022), and its performance was evaluated using statistical metrics including Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Percent Bias (PBIAS), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Coefficient of Determination (R^2). The results demonstrated a high level of accuracy, with the model explaining 98.2% of the variance in the data. Despite minor discrepancies between predicted and observed values, the GRU model proved to be an effective tool for flood prediction in Ashland City, with potential applications for enhancing disaster preparedness and response efforts in Ashland City.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, defense, attack, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a leading paradigm for decentralized, privacy preserving machine learning training. However, recent research on gradient inversion attacks (GIAs) have shown that gradient updates in FL can leak information on private training samples. While existing surveys on GIAs have focused on the honest-but-curious server threat model, there is a dearth of research categorizing attacks under the realistic and far more privacy-infringing cases of malicious servers and clients. In this paper, we present a survey and novel taxonomy of GIAs that emphasize FL threat models, particularly that of malicious servers and clients. We first formally define GIAs and contrast conventional attacks with the malicious attacker. We then summarize existing honest-but-curious attack strategies, corresponding defenses, and evaluation metrics. Critically, we dive into attacks with malicious servers and clients to highlight how they break existing FL defenses, focusing specifically on reconstruction methods, target model architectures, target data, and evaluation metrics. Lastly, we discuss open problems and future research directions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) market has been significantly growing and Considering the availability of drones at low-cost prices the possibility of misusing them, for illegal purposes such as drug trafficking, spying, and terrorist attacks posing high risks to national security, is rising. Therefore, detecting and tracking unauthorized drones to prevent future attacks that threaten lives, facilities, and security, become a necessity. Drone detection can be performed using different sensors, while image-based detection is one of them due to the development of artificial intelligence techniques. However, knowing unauthorized drone types is one of the challenges due to the lack of drone types datasets. For that, in this paper, we provide a dataset of various drones as well as a comparison of recognized object detection models on the proposed dataset including YOLO algorithms with their different versions, like, v3, v4, and v5 along with the Detectronv2. The experimental results of different models are provided along with a description of each method. The collected dataset can be found in this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As deep learning models are becoming larger and data-hungrier, there are growing ethical, legal and technical concerns over use of data: in practice, agreements on data use may change over time, rendering previously-used training data impermissible for training purposes. These issues have driven increased attention to machine unlearning: removing "the influence of" a subset of training data from a trained model. In this work, we advocate for a relaxed definition of unlearning that does not address privacy applications but targets a scenario where a data owner withdraws permission of use of their data for training purposes. In this context, we consider the important problem of \emph{transfer unlearning} where a pretrained model is transferred to a target dataset that contains some "non-static" data that may need to be unlearned in the future. We propose a new method that uses a mechanism for selecting relevant examples from an auxiliary "static" dataset, and finetunes on the selected data instead of "non-static" target data; addressing all unlearning requests ahead of time. We also adapt a recent relaxed definition of unlearning to our problem setting and demonstrate that our approach is an exact transfer unlearner according to it, while being highly efficient (amortized). We find that our method outperforms the gold standard "exact unlearning" (finetuning on only the "static" portion of the target dataset) on several datasets, especially for small "static" sets, sometimes approaching an upper bound for test accuracy. We also analyze factors influencing the accuracy boost obtained by data selection.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Existing debiasing techniques are typically training-based or require access to the model's internals and output distributions, so they are inaccessible to end-users looking to adapt LLM outputs for their particular needs. In this study, we examine whether structured prompting techniques can offer opportunities for fair text generation. We evaluate a comprehensive end-user-focused iterative framework of debiasing that applies System 2 thinking processes for prompts to induce logical, reflective, and critical text generation, with single, multi-step, instruction, and role-based variants. By systematically evaluating many LLMs across many datasets and different prompting strategies, we show that the more complex System 2-based Implicative Prompts significantly improve over other techniques demonstrating lower mean bias in the outputs with competitive performance on the downstream tasks. Our work offers research directions for the design and the potential of end-user-focused evaluative frameworks for LLM use.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Single object tracking is a vital task of many applications in critical fields. However, it is still considered one of the most challenging vision tasks. In recent years, computer vision, especially object tracking, witnessed the introduction or adoption of many novel techniques, setting new fronts for performance. In this survey, we visit some of the cutting-edge techniques in vision, such as Sequence Models, Generative Models, Self-supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Meta-Learning, Continual Learning, and Domain Adaptation, focusing on their application in single object tracking. We propose a novel categorization of single object tracking methods based on novel techniques and trends. Also, we conduct a comparative analysis of the performance reported by the methods presented on popular tracking benchmarks. Moreover, we analyze the pros and cons of the presented approaches and present a guide for non-traditional techniques in single object tracking. Finally, we suggest potential avenues for future research in single-object tracking.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The infrequency and heterogeneity of clinical presentations in rare diseases often lead to underdiagnosis and their exclusion from structured datasets. This necessitates the utilization of unstructured text data for comprehensive analysis. However, the manual identification from clinical reports is an arduous and intrinsically subjective task. This study proposes a novel hybrid approach that synergistically combines a traditional dictionary-based natural language processing (NLP) tool with the powerful capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to enhance the identification of rare diseases from unstructured clinical notes. We comprehensively evaluate various prompting strategies on six large language models (LLMs) of varying sizes and domains (general and medical). This evaluation encompasses zero-shot, few-shot, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques to enhance the LLMs' ability to reason about and understand contextual information in patient reports. The results demonstrate effectiveness in rare disease identification, highlighting the potential for identifying underdiagnosed patients from clinical notes.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various language processing tasks, motivating their adoption in simultaneous translation. Current fine-tuning methods to adapt LLMs for simultaneous translation focus on prompting optimization strategies using either data augmentation or prompt structure modifications. However, these methods suffer from several issues, such as an unnecessarily expanded training set, computational inefficiency from dumping the KV cache, increased prompt sizes, or restriction to a single decision policy. To eliminate these issues, we propose a new paradigm in fine-tuning LLMs for simultaneous translation, called SimulMask. It utilizes a novel attention mask technique that models simultaneous translation during fine-tuning by masking attention connections under a desired decision policy. Applying the proposed SimulMask on a Falcon LLM for the IWSLT 2017 dataset, we have observed a significant translation quality improvement compared to state-of-the-art prompting optimization strategies on three language pairs when averaged across four different latency regimes while reducing the computational cost.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Fully supervised deep learning approaches have demonstrated impressive accuracy in sea ice classification, but their dependence on high-resolution labels presents a significant challenge due to the difficulty of obtaining such data. In response, our weakly supervised learning method provides a compelling alternative by utilizing lower-resolution regional labels from expert-annotated ice charts. This approach achieves exceptional pixel-level classification performance by introducing regional loss representations during training to measure the disparity between predicted and ice chart-derived sea ice type distributions. Leveraging the AI4Arctic Sea Ice Challenge Dataset, our method outperforms the fully supervised U-Net benchmark, the top solution of the AutoIce challenge, in both mapping resolution and class-wise accuracy, marking a significant advancement in automated operational sea ice mapping.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Over the last decade, a wide range of training and deployment strategies for Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged. Among these, the prompting paradigms of Auto-regressive LLMs (AR-LLMs) have catalyzed a significant surge in Artificial Intelligence (AI). This paper aims to emphasize the significance of utilizing free-form modalities (forms of input and output) and verbal free-form contexts as user-directed channels (methods for transforming modalities) for downstream deployment. Specifically, we analyze the structure of modalities within both two types of LLMs and six task-specific channels during deployment. From the perspective of users, our analysis introduces and applies the analytical metrics of task customizability, transparency, and complexity to gauge their usability, highlighting the superior nature of AR-LLMs' prompting paradigms. Moreover, we examine the stimulation of diverse cognitive behaviors in LLMs through the adoption of free-form text and verbal contexts, mirroring human linguistic expressions of such behaviors. We then detail four common cognitive behaviors to underscore how AR-LLMs' prompting successfully imitate human-like behaviors using this free-form modality and channel. Lastly, the potential for improving LLM deployment, both as autonomous agents and within multi-agent systems, is identified via cognitive behavior concepts and principles.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, protect</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Street-view image has been widely applied as a crucial mobile mapping data source. The inpainting of street-view images is a critical step for street-view image processing, not only for the privacy protection, but also for the urban environment mapping applications. This paper presents a novel Deep Neural Network (DNN), multi-scale semantic prior Feature guided image inpainting Network (MFN) for inpainting street-view images, which generate static street-view images without moving objects (e.g., pedestrians, vehicles). To enhance global context understanding, a semantic prior prompter is introduced to learn rich semantic priors from large pre-trained model. We design the prompter by stacking multiple Semantic Pyramid Aggregation (SPA) modules, capturing a broad range of visual feature patterns. A semantic-enhanced image generator with a decoder is proposed that incorporates a novel cascaded Learnable Prior Transferring (LPT) module at each scale level. For each decoder block, an attention transfer mechanism is applied to capture long-term dependencies, and the semantic prior features are fused with the image features to restore plausible structure in an adaptive manner. Additionally, a background-aware data processing scheme is adopted to prevent the generation of hallucinated objects within holes. Experiments on Apolloscapes and Cityscapes datasets demonstrate better performance than state-of-the-art methods, with MAE, and LPIPS showing improvements of about 9.5% and 41.07% respectively. Visual comparison survey among multi-group person is also conducted to provide performance evaluation, and the results suggest that the proposed MFN offers a promising solution for privacy protection and generate more reliable scene for urban applications with street-view images.</li>

          ART3D: 3D Gaussian Splatting for Text-Guided Artistic Scenes Generation(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we explore the existing challenges in 3D artistic scene generation by introducing ART3D, a novel framework that combines diffusion models and 3D Gaussian splatting techniques. Our method effectively bridges the gap between artistic and realistic images through an innovative image semantic transfer algorithm. By leveraging depth information and an initial artistic image, we generate a point cloud map, addressing domain differences. Additionally, we propose a depth consistency module to enhance 3D scene consistency. Finally, the 3D scene serves as initial points for optimizing Gaussian splats. Experimental results demonstrate ART3D's superior performance in both content and structural consistency metrics when compared to existing methods. ART3D significantly advances the field of AI in art creation by providing an innovative solution for generating high-quality 3D artistic scenes.</li>

          Federated Learning With Energy Harvesting Devices: An MDP Framework(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated learning (FL) requires edge devices to perform local training and exchange information with a parameter server, leading to substantial energy consumption. A critical challenge in practical FL systems is the rapid energy depletion of battery-limited edge devices, which curtails their operational lifespan and affects the learning performance. To address this issue, we apply energy harvesting technique in FL systems to extract ambient energy for continuously powering edge devices. We first establish the convergence bound for the wireless FL system with energy harvesting devices, illustrating that the convergence is impacted by partial device participation and packet drops, both of which depend on the energy supply. To accelerate the convergence, we formulate a joint device scheduling and power control problem and model it as a Markov decision process (MDP). By solving this MDP, we derive the optimal transmission policy and demonstrate that it possesses a monotone structure with respect to the battery and channel states. To overcome the curse of dimensionality caused by the exponential complexity of computing the optimal policy, we propose a low-complexity algorithm, which is asymptotically optimal as the number of devices increases. Furthermore, for unknown channels and harvested energy statistics, we develop a structure-enhanced deep reinforcement learning algorithm that leverages the monotone structure of the optimal policy to improve the training performance. Finally, extensive numerical experiments on real-world datasets are presented to validate the theoretical results and corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we initiate our discussion by demonstrating how Large Language Models (LLMs), when tasked with responding to queries, display a more even probability distribution in their answers if they are more adept, as opposed to their less skilled counterparts. Expanding on this foundational insight, we propose a new self-evaluation method ProbDiff for assessing the efficacy of various LLMs. This approach obviates the necessity for an additional evaluation model or the dependence on external, proprietary models like GPT-4 for judgment. It uniquely utilizes the LLMs being tested to compute the probability discrepancy between the initial response and its revised versions. A higher discrepancy for a given query between two LLMs indicates a relatively weaker capability. Our findings reveal that ProbDiff achieves results on par with those obtained from evaluations based on GPT-4, spanning a range of scenarios that include natural language generation (NLG) tasks such as translation, summarization, and our proposed Xiaohongshu blog writing task, and benchmarks for LLM evaluation like AlignBench, MT-Bench, and AlpacaEval, across LLMs of varying magnitudes.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Event Extraction (EE) is an essential information extraction task that aims to extract event-related information from unstructured texts. The paradigm of this task has shifted from conventional classification-based methods to more contemporary question-answering (QA)-based approaches. However, in QA-based EE, the questions' quality dramatically affects the extraction accuracy, and how to generate high-quality questions for QA-based EE still remains a challenge. In this work, to tackle this challenge, we suggest four criteria to evaluate the quality of a question and propose a reinforcement learning method for QA-Based EE that can generate fluent, generalizable, and context-dependent questions and provides clear guidance to QA models. The extensive experiments conducted on ACE and RAMS datasets have strongly validated our approach's effectiveness, which also demonstrates its robustness in scenarios with limited training data.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, security, privacy, protect, defense, attack, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recently, generative AI has attracted much attention from both academic and industrial fields, which has shown its potential, especially in the data generation and synthesis aspects. Simultaneously, secure and privacy-preserving mobile crowdsensing (SPPMCS) has been widely applied in data collection/ acquirement due to an advantage on low deployment cost, flexible implementation, and high adaptability. Since generative AI can generate new synthetic data to replace the original data to be analyzed and processed, it can lower data attacks and privacy leakage risks for the original data. Therefore, integrating generative AI into SPPMCS is feasible and significant. Moreover, this paper investigates an integration of generative AI in SPPMCS, where we present potential research focuses, solutions, and case studies. Specifically, we firstly review the preliminaries for generative AI and SPPMCS, where their integration potential is presented. Then, we discuss research issues and solutions for generative AI-enabled SPPMCS, including security defense of malicious data injection, illegal authorization, malicious spectrum manipulation at the physical layer, and privacy protection on sensing data content, sensing terminals' identification and location. Next, we propose a framework for sensing data content protection with generative AI, and simulations results have clearly demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Finally, we present major research directions for generative AI-enabled SPPMCS.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text classification is a fundamental task in Natural Language Processing (NLP), and the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized the field. This paper introduces the Smart Expert System, a novel approach that leverages LLMs as text classifiers. The system simplifies the traditional text classification workflow, eliminating the need for extensive preprocessing and domain expertise. The performance of several LLMs, machine learning (ML) algorithms, and neural network (NN) based structures is evaluated on four datasets. Results demonstrate that certain LLMs surpass traditional methods in sentiment analysis, spam SMS detection and multi-label classification. Furthermore, it is shown that the system's performance can be further enhanced through few-shot or fine-tuning strategies, making the fine-tuned model the top performer across all datasets.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, protect, defense, attack, robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models have become increasingly prominent, also signaling a shift towards multimodality as the next frontier in artificial intelligence, where their embeddings are harnessed as prompts to generate textual content. Vision-language models (VLMs) stand at the forefront of this advancement, offering innovative ways to combine visual and textual data for enhanced understanding and interaction. However, this integration also enlarges the attack surface. Patch-based adversarial attack is considered the most realistic threat model in physical vision applications, as demonstrated in many existing literature. In this paper, we propose to address patched visual prompt injection, where adversaries exploit adversarial patches to generate target content in VLMs. Our investigation reveals that patched adversarial prompts exhibit sensitivity to pixel-wise randomization, a trait that remains robust even against adaptive attacks designed to counteract such defenses. Leveraging this insight, we introduce SmoothVLM, a defense mechanism rooted in smoothing techniques, specifically tailored to protect VLMs from the threat of patched visual prompt injectors. Our framework significantly lowers the attack success rate to a range between 0% and 5.0% on two leading VLMs, while achieving around 67.3% to 95.0% context recovery of the benign images, demonstrating a balance between security and usability.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Due to the large-scale image size and object variations, current CNN-based and Transformer-based approaches for remote sensing image semantic segmentation are suboptimal for capturing the long-range dependency or limited to the complex computational complexity. In this paper, we propose CM-UNet, comprising a CNN-based encoder for extracting local image features and a Mamba-based decoder for aggregating and integrating global information, facilitating efficient semantic segmentation of remote sensing images. Specifically, a CSMamba block is introduced to build the core segmentation decoder, which employs channel and spatial attention as the gate activation condition of the vanilla Mamba to enhance the feature interaction and global-local information fusion. Moreover, to further refine the output features from the CNN encoder, a Multi-Scale Attention Aggregation (MSAA) module is employed to merge the different scale features. By integrating the CSMamba block and MSAA module, CM-UNet effectively captures the long-range dependencies and multi-scale global contextual information of large-scale remote-sensing images. Experimental results obtained on three benchmarks indicate that the proposed CM-UNet outperforms existing methods in various performance metrics. The codes are available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In light of recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) that have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP), there is an urgent need for new benchmarks to keep pace with the fast development of LLMs. In this paper, we propose CFLUE, the Chinese Financial Language Understanding Evaluation benchmark, designed to assess the capability of LLMs across various dimensions. Specifically, CFLUE provides datasets tailored for both knowledge assessment and application assessment. In knowledge assessment, it consists of 38K+ multiple-choice questions with associated solution explanations. These questions serve dual purposes: answer prediction and question reasoning. In application assessment, CFLUE features 16K+ test instances across distinct groups of NLP tasks such as text classification, machine translation, relation extraction, reading comprehension, and text generation. Upon CFLUE, we conduct a thorough evaluation of representative LLMs. The results reveal that only GPT-4 and GPT-4-turbo achieve an accuracy exceeding 60\% in answer prediction for knowledge assessment, suggesting that there is still substantial room for improvement in current LLMs. In application assessment, although GPT-4 and GPT-4-turbo are the top two performers, their considerable advantage over lightweight LLMs is noticeably diminished.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed NLP with their remarkable In-context Learning (ICL) capabilities. Automated assistants based on LLMs are gaining popularity; however, adapting them to novel tasks is still challenging. While colossal models excel in zero-shot performance, their computational demands limit widespread use, and smaller language models struggle without context. This paper investigates whether LLMs can generalize from labeled examples of predefined tasks to novel tasks. Drawing inspiration from biological neurons and the mechanistic interpretation of the Transformer architecture, we explore the potential for information sharing across tasks. We design a cross-task prompting setup with three LLMs and show that LLMs achieve significant performance improvements despite no examples from the target task in the context. Cross-task prompting leads to a remarkable performance boost of 107% for LLaMA-2 7B, 18.6% for LLaMA-2 13B, and 3.2% for GPT 3.5 on average over zero-shot prompting, and performs comparable to standard in-context learning. The effectiveness of generating pseudo-labels for in-task examples is demonstrated, and our analyses reveal a strong correlation between the effect of cross-task examples and model activation similarities in source and target input tokens. This paper offers a first-of-its-kind exploration of LLMs' ability to solve novel tasks based on contextual signals from different task examples.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper addresses the problem of accurately estimating a function on one domain when only its discrete samples are available on another domain. To answer this challenge, we utilize a neural network, which we train to incorporate prior knowledge of the function. In addition, by carefully analyzing the problem, we obtain a bound on the error over the extrapolation domain and define a condition number for this problem that quantifies the level of difficulty of the setup. Compared to other machine learning methods that provide time series prediction, such as transformers, our approach is suitable for setups where the interpolation and extrapolation regions are general subdomains and, in particular, manifolds. In addition, our construction leads to an improved loss function that helps us boost the accuracy and robustness of our neural network. We conduct comprehensive numerical tests and comparisons of our extrapolation versus standard methods. The results illustrate the effectiveness of our approach in various scenarios.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this report, we describe the technical details of our submission to the 2024 RoboDrive Challenge Robust Map Segmentation Track. The Robust Map Segmentation track focuses on the segmentation of complex driving scene elements in BEV maps under varied driving conditions. Semantic map segmentation provides abundant and precise static environmental information crucial for autonomous driving systems' planning and navigation. While current methods excel in ideal circumstances, e.g., clear daytime conditions and fully functional sensors, their resilience to real-world challenges like adverse weather and sensor failures remains unclear, raising concerns about system safety. In this paper, we explored several methods to improve the robustness of the map segmentation task. The details are as follows: 1) Robustness analysis of utilizing temporal information; 2) Robustness analysis of utilizing different backbones; and 3) Data Augmentation to boost corruption robustness. Based on the evaluation results, we draw several important findings including 1) The temporal fusion module is effective in improving the robustness of the map segmentation model; 2) A strong backbone is effective for improving the corruption robustness; and 3) Some data augmentation methods are effective in improving the robustness of map segmentation models. These novel findings allowed us to achieve promising results in the 2024 RoboDrive Challenge-Robust Map Segmentation Track.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in multi-view camera-only 3D object detection either rely on an accurate reconstruction of bird's-eye-view (BEV) 3D features or on traditional 2D perspective view (PV) image features. While both have their own pros and cons, few have found a way to stitch them together in order to benefit from "the best of both worlds". To this end, we explore a duo space (i.e., BEV and PV) 3D perception framework, in conjunction with some useful duo space fusion strategies that allow effective aggregation of the two feature representations. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed method, DuoSpaceNet, is the first to leverage two distinct feature spaces and achieves the state-of-the-art 3D object detection and BEV map segmentation results on nuScenes dataset.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language model (LLM)-based recommender models that bridge users and items through textual prompts for effective semantic reasoning have gained considerable attention. However, few methods consider the underlying rationales behind interactions, such as user preferences and item attributes, limiting the reasoning capability of LLMs for recommendations. This paper proposes a rationale distillation recommender (RDRec), a compact model designed to learn rationales generated by a larger language model (LM). By leveraging rationales from reviews related to users and items, RDRec remarkably specifies their profiles for recommendations. Experiments show that RDRec achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both top-N and sequential recommendations. Our source code is released at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Crowd counting and localization have become increasingly important in computer vision due to their wide-ranging applications. While point-based strategies have been widely used in crowd counting methods, they face a significant challenge, i.e., the lack of an effective learning strategy to guide the matching process. This deficiency leads to instability in matching point proposals to target points, adversely affecting overall performance. To address this issue, we introduce an effective approach to stabilize the proposal-target matching in point-based methods. We propose Auxiliary Point Guidance (APG) to provide clear and effective guidance for proposal selection and optimization, addressing the core issue of matching uncertainty. Additionally, we develop Implicit Feature Interpolation (IFI) to enable adaptive feature extraction in diverse crowd scenarios, further enhancing the model's robustness and accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing significant improvements in crowd counting and localization performance, particularly under challenging conditions.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>3D occupancy perception holds a pivotal role in recent vision-centric autonomous driving systems by converting surround-view images into integrated geometric and semantic representations within dense 3D grids. Nevertheless, current models still encounter two main challenges: modeling depth accurately in the 2D-3D view transformation stage, and overcoming the lack of generalizability issues due to sparse LiDAR supervision. To address these issues, this paper presents GEOcc, a Geometric-Enhanced Occupancy network tailored for vision-only surround-view perception. Our approach is three-fold: 1) Integration of explicit lift-based depth prediction and implicit projection-based transformers for depth modeling, enhancing the density and robustness of view transformation. 2) Utilization of mask-based encoder-decoder architecture for fine-grained semantic predictions; 3) Adoption of context-aware self-training loss functions in the pertaining stage to complement LiDAR supervision, involving the re-rendering of 2D depth maps from 3D occupancy features and leveraging image reconstruction loss to obtain denser depth supervision besides sparse LiDAR ground-truths. Our approach achieves State-Of-The-Art performance on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset with the least image resolution needed and the most weightless image backbone compared with current models, marking an improvement of 3.3% due to our proposed contributions. Comprehensive experimentation also demonstrates the consistent superiority of our method over baselines and alternative approaches.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep learning methods for time series have already reached excellent performances in both prediction and classification tasks, including anomaly detection. However, the complexity inherent in Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) creates a challenge when it comes to explainability methods. To overcome this inherent lack of interpretability, we propose ECATS, a concept-based neuro-symbolic architecture where concepts are represented as Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formulae. Leveraging kernel-based methods for STL, concept embeddings are learnt in an unsupervised manner through a cross-attention mechanism. The network makes class predictions through these concept embeddings, allowing for a meaningful explanation to be naturally extracted for each input. Our preliminary experiments with a simple CPS-based dataset show that our model is able to achieve great classification performance while ensuring local interpretability.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The crux of Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) lies in modeling dense text-video relations to associate abstract linguistic concepts with dynamic visual contents at pixel-level. Current RVOS methods typically use vision and language models pre-trained independently as backbones. As images and texts are mapped to uncoupled feature spaces, they face the arduous task of learning Vision-Language~(VL) relation modeling from scratch. Witnessing the success of Vision-Language Pre-trained (VLP) models, we propose to learn relation modeling for RVOS based on their aligned VL feature space. Nevertheless, transferring VLP models to RVOS is a deceptively challenging task due to the substantial gap between the pre-training task (image/region-level prediction) and the RVOS task (pixel-level prediction in videos). In this work, we introduce a framework named VLP-RVOS to address this transfer challenge. We first propose a temporal-aware prompt-tuning method, which not only adapts pre-trained representations for pixel-level prediction but also empowers the vision encoder to model temporal clues. We further propose to perform multi-stage VL relation modeling while and after feature extraction for comprehensive VL understanding. Besides, we customize a cube-frame attention mechanism for spatial-temporal reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms and exhibits strong generalization abilities.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Given the power of vision transformers, a new learning paradigm, pre-training and then prompting, makes it more efficient and effective to address downstream visual recognition tasks. In this paper, we identify a novel security threat towards such a paradigm from the perspective of backdoor attacks. Specifically, an extra prompt token, called the switch token in this work, can turn the backdoor mode on, i.e., converting a benign model into a backdoored one. Once under the backdoor mode, a specific trigger can force the model to predict a target class. It poses a severe risk to the users of cloud API, since the malicious behavior can not be activated and detected under the benign mode, thus making the attack very stealthy. To attack a pre-trained model, our proposed attack, named SWARM, learns a trigger and prompt tokens including a switch token. They are optimized with the clean loss which encourages the model always behaves normally even the trigger presents, and the backdoor loss that ensures the backdoor can be activated by the trigger when the switch is on. Besides, we utilize the cross-mode feature distillation to reduce the effect of the switch token on clean samples. The experiments on diverse visual recognition tasks confirm the success of our switchable backdoor attack, i.e., achieving 95%+ attack success rate, and also being hard to be detected and removed.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have driven advances in natural language processing. Still, their growing scale has increased the computational burden, necessitating a balance between efficiency and performance. Low-rank compression, a promising technique, reduces non-essential parameters by decomposing weight matrices into products of two low-rank matrices. Yet, its application in LLMs has not been extensively studied. The key to low-rank compression lies in low-rank factorization and low-rank dimensions allocation. To address the challenges of low-rank compression in LLMs, we conduct empirical research on the low-rank characteristics of large models. We propose a low-rank compression method suitable for LLMs. This approach involves precise estimation of feature distributions through pooled covariance matrices and a Bayesian optimization strategy for allocating low-rank dimensions. Experiments on the LLaMA-2 models demonstrate that our method outperforms existing strong structured pruning and low-rank compression techniques in maintaining model performance at the same compression ratio.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We consider a distributed learning problem, where agents minimize a global objective function by exchanging information over a network. Our approach has two distinct features: (i) It substantially reduces communication by triggering communication only when necessary, and (ii) it is agnostic to the data-distribution among the different agents. We can therefore guarantee convergence even if the local data-distributions of the agents are arbitrarily distinct. We analyze the convergence rate of the algorithm and derive accelerated convergence rates in a convex setting. We also characterize the effect of communication drops and demonstrate that our algorithm is robust to communication failures. The article concludes by presenting numerical results from a distributed LASSO problem, and distributed learning tasks on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. The experiments underline communication savings of 50% or more due to the event-based communication strategy, show resilience towards heterogeneous data-distributions, and highlight that our approach outperforms common baselines such as FedAvg, FedProx, and FedADMM.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Transformer-based encoder-decoder models have demonstrated impressive results in chemical reaction prediction tasks. However, these models typically rely on pretraining using tens of millions of unlabelled molecules, which can be time-consuming and GPU-intensive. One of the central questions we aim to answer in this work is: Can FlanT5 and ByT5, the encode-decoder models pretrained solely on language data, be effectively specialised for organic reaction prediction through task-specific fine-tuning? We conduct a systematic empirical study on several key issues of the process, including tokenisation, the impact of (SMILES-oriented) pretraining, fine-tuning sample efficiency, and decoding algorithms at inference. Our key findings indicate that although being pretrained only on language tasks, FlanT5 and ByT5 provide a solid foundation to fine-tune for reaction prediction, and thus become `chemistry domain compatible' in the process. This suggests that GPU-intensive and expensive pretraining on a large dataset of unlabelled molecules may be useful yet not essential to leverage the power of language models for chemistry. All our models achieve comparable Top-1 and Top-5 accuracy although some variation across different models does exist. Notably, tokenisation and vocabulary trimming slightly affect final performance but can speed up training and inference; The most efficient greedy decoding strategy is very competitive while only marginal gains can be achieved from more sophisticated decoding algorithms. In summary, we evaluate FlanT5 and ByT5 across several dimensions and benchmark their impact on organic reaction prediction, which may guide more effective use of these state-of-the-art language models for chemistry-related tasks in the future.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant attention in the field of natural language processing (NLP) due to their wide range of applications. However, training LLMs for languages other than English poses significant challenges, due to the difficulty in acquiring large-scale corpus and the requisite computing resources. In this paper, we propose ChatFlow, a cross-language transfer-based LLM, to address these challenges and train large Chinese language models in a cost-effective manner. We employ a mix of Chinese, English, and parallel corpus to continuously train the LLaMA2 model, aiming to align cross-language representations and facilitate the knowledge transfer specifically to the Chinese language model. In addition, we use a dynamic data sampler to progressively transition the model from unsupervised pre-training to supervised fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach accelerates model convergence and achieves superior performance. We evaluate ChatFlow on popular Chinese and English benchmarks, the results indicate that it outperforms other Chinese models post-trained on LLaMA-2-7B.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper surveys and organizes research works on medical dialog systems, which is an important yet challenging task. Although these systems have been surveyed in the medical community from an application perspective, a systematic review from a rigorous technical perspective has to date remained noticeably absent. As a result, an overview of the categories, methods, and evaluation of medical dialogue systems remain limited and underspecified, hindering the further improvement of this area. To fill this gap, we investigate an initial pool of 325 papers from well-known computer science, and natural language processing conferences and journals, and make an overview. Recently, large language models have shown strong model capacity on downstream tasks, which also reshaped medical dialog systems' foundation. Despite the alluring practical application value, current medical dialogue systems still suffer from problems. To this end, this paper lists the grand challenges of medical dialog systems, especially of large language models.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Huge memory consumption has been a major bottleneck for deploying high-throughput large language models in real-world applications. In addition to the large number of parameters, the key-value (KV) cache for the attention mechanism in the transformer architecture consumes a significant amount of memory, especially when the number of layers is large for deep language models. In this paper, we propose a novel method that only computes and caches the KVs of a small number of layers, thus significantly saving memory consumption and improving inference throughput. Our experiments on large language models show that our method achieves up to 26$\times$ higher throughput than standard transformers and competitive performance in language modeling and downstream tasks. In addition, our method is orthogonal to existing transformer memory-saving techniques, so it is straightforward to integrate them with our model, achieving further improvement in inference efficiency.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Graph Masked Autoencoders (GMAEs) have emerged as a notable self-supervised learning approach for graph-structured data. Existing GMAE models primarily focus on reconstructing node-level information, categorizing them as single-scale GMAEs. This methodology, while effective in certain contexts, tends to overlook the complex hierarchical structures inherent in many real-world graphs. For instance, molecular graphs exhibit a clear hierarchical organization in the form of the atoms-functional groups-molecules structure. Hence, the inability of single-scale GMAE models to incorporate these hierarchical relationships often leads to their inadequate capture of crucial high-level graph information, resulting in a noticeable decline in performance. To address this limitation, we propose Hierarchical Graph Masked AutoEncoders (Hi-GMAE), a novel multi-scale GMAE framework designed to handle the hierarchical structures within graphs. First, Hi-GMAE constructs a multi-scale graph hierarchy through graph pooling, enabling the exploration of graph structures across different granularity levels. To ensure masking uniformity of subgraphs across these scales, we propose a novel coarse-to-fine strategy that initiates masking at the coarsest scale and progressively back-projects the mask to the finer scales. Furthermore, we integrate a gradual recovery strategy with the masking process to mitigate the learning challenges posed by completely masked subgraphs. Diverging from the standard graph neural network (GNN) used in GMAE models, Hi-GMAE modifies its encoder and decoder into hierarchical structures. This entails using GNN at the finer scales for detailed local graph analysis and employing a graph transformer at coarser scales to capture global information. Our experiments on 15 graph datasets consistently demonstrate that Hi-GMAE outperforms 17 state-of-the-art self-supervised competitors.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated Learning (FL) has gained attention for addressing data scarcity and privacy concerns. While parallel FL algorithms like FedAvg exhibit remarkable performance, they face challenges in scenarios with diverse network speeds and concerns about centralized control, especially in multi-institutional collaborations like the medical domain. Serial FL presents an alternative solution, circumventing these challenges by transferring model updates serially between devices in a cyclical manner. Nevertheless, it is deemed inferior to parallel FL in that (1) its performance shows undesirable fluctuations, and (2) it converges to a lower plateau, particularly when dealing with non-IID data. The observed phenomenon is attributed to catastrophic forgetting due to knowledge loss from previous sites. In this paper, to overcome fluctuation and low efficiency in the iterative learning and forgetting process, we introduce cyclical weight consolidation (CWC), a straightforward yet potent approach specifically tailored for serial FL. CWC employs a consolidation matrix to regulate local optimization. This matrix tracks the significance of each parameter on the overall federation throughout the entire training trajectory, preventing abrupt changes in significant weights. During revisitation, to maintain adaptability, old memory undergoes decay to incorporate new information. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that in various non-IID settings, CWC mitigates the fluctuation behavior of the original serial FL approach and enhances the converged performance consistently and significantly. The improved performance is either comparable to or better than the parallel vanilla.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Compositional generalization is an important ability of language models and has many different manifestations. For data-to-text generation, previous research on this ability is limited to a single manifestation called Systematicity and lacks consideration of large language models (LLMs), which cannot fully cover practical application scenarios. In this work, we propose SPOR, a comprehensive and practical evaluation method for compositional generalization in data-to-text generation. SPOR includes four aspects of manifestations (Systematicity, Productivity, Order invariance, and Rule learnability) and allows high-quality evaluation without additional manual annotations based on existing datasets. We demonstrate SPOR on two different datasets and evaluate some existing language models including LLMs. We find that the models are deficient in various aspects of the evaluation and need further improvement. Our work shows the necessity for comprehensive research on different manifestations of compositional generalization in data-to-text generation and provides a framework for evaluation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become integral in safety-critical applications, thus raising concerns about their fault tolerance. Conventional hardware-dependent fault tolerance methods, such as Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR), are computationally expensive, imposing a remarkable overhead on CNNs. Whereas fault tolerance techniques can be applied either at the hardware level or at the model levels, the latter provides more flexibility without sacrificing generality. This paper introduces a model-level hardening approach for CNNs by integrating error correction directly into the neural networks. The approach is hardware-agnostic and does not require any changes to the underlying accelerator device. Analyzing the vulnerability of parameters enables the duplication of selective filters/neurons so that their output channels are effectively corrected with an efficient and robust correction layer. The proposed method demonstrates fault resilience nearly equivalent to TMR-based correction but with significantly reduced overhead. Nevertheless, there exists an inherent overhead to the baseline CNNs. To tackle this issue, a cost-effective parameter vulnerability based pruning technique is proposed that outperforms the conventional pruning method, yielding smaller networks with a negligible accuracy loss. Remarkably, the hardened pruned CNNs perform up to 24\% faster than the hardened un-pruned ones.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) have become integral to our professional workflows and daily lives. Nevertheless, these machine companions of ours have a critical flaw: the huge amount of data which endows them with vast and diverse knowledge, also exposes them to the inevitable toxicity and bias. While most LLMs incorporate defense mechanisms to prevent the generation of harmful content, these safeguards can be easily bypassed with minimal prompt engineering. In this paper, we introduce the new Thoroughly Engineered Toxicity (TET) dataset, comprising manually crafted prompts designed to nullify the protective layers of such models. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate the pivotal role of TET in providing a rigorous benchmark for evaluation of toxicity awareness in several popular LLMs: it highlights the toxicity in the LLMs that might remain hidden when using normal prompts, thus revealing subtler issues in their behavior.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability, explainability, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The classification of statements provided by individuals during police interviews is a complex and significant task within the domain of natural language processing (NLP) and legal informatics. The lack of extensive domain-specific datasets raises challenges to the advancement of NLP methods in the field. This paper aims to address some of the present challenges by introducing a novel dataset tailored for classification of statements made during police interviews, prior to court proceedings. Utilising the curated dataset for training and evaluation, we introduce a fine-tuned DistilBERT model that achieves state-of-the-art performance in distinguishing truthful from deceptive statements. To enhance interpretability, we employ explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods to offer explainability through saliency maps, that interpret the model's decision-making process. Lastly, we present an XAI interface that empowers both legal professionals and non-specialists to interact with and benefit from our system. Our model achieves an accuracy of 86%, and is shown to outperform a custom transformer architecture in a comparative study. This holistic approach advances the accessibility, transparency, and effectiveness of statement analysis, with promising implications for both legal practice and research.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Referring image segmentation (RIS) aims to locate the particular region corresponding to the language expression. Existing methods incorporate features from different modalities in a \emph{bottom-up} manner. This design may get some unnecessary image-text pairs, which leads to an inaccurate segmentation mask. In this paper, we propose a referring image segmentation method called HARIS, which introduces the Human-Like Attention mechanism and uses the parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) framework. To be specific, the Human-Like Attention gets a \emph{feedback} signal from multi-modal features, which makes the network center on the specific objects and discard the irrelevant image-text pairs. Besides, we introduce the PEFT framework to preserve the zero-shot ability of pre-trained encoders. Extensive experiments on three widely used RIS benchmarks and the PhraseCut dataset demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and great zero-shot ability.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Coreference resolution, critical for identifying textual entities referencing the same entity, faces challenges in pronoun resolution, particularly identifying pronoun antecedents. Existing methods often treat pronoun resolution as a separate task from mention detection, potentially missing valuable information. This study proposes the first end-to-end neural network system for Persian pronoun resolution, leveraging pre-trained Transformer models like ParsBERT. Our system jointly optimizes both mention detection and antecedent linking, achieving a 3.37 F1 score improvement over the previous state-of-the-art system (which relied on rule-based and statistical methods) on the Mehr corpus. This significant improvement demonstrates the effectiveness of combining neural networks with linguistic models, potentially marking a significant advancement in Persian pronoun resolution and paving the way for further research in this under-explored area.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we introduce the first comprehensive multilingual sign language dataset named Prompt2Sign, which builds from public data including American Sign Language (ASL) and seven others. Our dataset transforms a vast array of videos into a streamlined, model-friendly format, optimized for training with translation models like seq2seq and text2text. Building on this new dataset, we propose SignLLM, the first multilingual Sign Language Production (SLP) model, which includes two novel multilingual SLP modes that allow for the generation of sign language gestures from input text or prompt. Both of the modes can use a new loss and a module based on reinforcement learning, which accelerates the training by enhancing the model's capability to autonomously sample high-quality data. We present benchmark results of SignLLM, which demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on SLP tasks across eight sign languages.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) trained on general domain corpora showed remarkable results on natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, previous research demonstrated LLMs trained using domain-focused corpora perform better on specialized tasks. Inspired by this pivotal insight, we developed INDUS, a comprehensive suite of LLMs tailored for the Earth science, biology, physics, heliophysics, planetary sciences and astrophysics domains and trained using curated scientific corpora drawn from diverse data sources. The suite of models include: (1) an encoder model trained using domain-specific vocabulary and corpora to address natural language understanding tasks, (2) a contrastive-learning-based general text embedding model trained using a diverse set of datasets drawn from multiple sources to address information retrieval tasks and (3) smaller versions of these models created using knowledge distillation techniques to address applications which have latency or resource constraints. We also created three new scientific benchmark datasets namely, CLIMATE-CHANGE-NER (entity-recognition), NASA-QA (extractive QA) and NASA-IR (IR) to accelerate research in these multi-disciplinary fields. Finally, we show that our models outperform both general-purpose encoders (RoBERTa) and existing domain-specific encoders (SciBERT) on these new tasks as well as existing benchmark tasks in the domains of interest.</li>

However, the extensive model size and high training and inference costs have hindered the widespread application of MLLMs in academia and industry. Thus, studying efficient and lightweight MLLMs has enormous potential, especially in edge computing scenarios. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive and systematic review of the current state of efficient MLLMs. Specifically, we summarize the timeline of representative efficient MLLMs, research state of efficient structures and strategies, and the applications.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Subtitling plays a crucial role in enhancing the accessibility of audiovisual content and encompasses three primary subtasks: translating spoken dialogue, segmenting translations into concise textual units, and estimating timestamps that govern their on-screen duration. Past attempts to automate this process rely, to varying degrees, on automatic transcripts, employed diversely for the three subtasks. In response to the acknowledged limitations associated with this reliance on transcripts, recent research has shifted towards transcription-free solutions for translation and segmentation, leaving the direct generation of timestamps as uncharted territory. To fill this gap, we introduce the first direct model capable of producing automatic subtitles, entirely eliminating any dependence on intermediate transcripts also for timestamp prediction. Experimental results, backed by manual evaluation, showcase our solution's new state-of-the-art performance across multiple language pairs and diverse conditions.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Knowledge-intensive tasks pose a significant challenge for Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Commonly adopted methods, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), often exhibit limitations when applied to such tasks. Nevertheless, there have been notable endeavours to mitigate these challenges, with a significant emphasis on augmenting LLMs through Knowledge Graphs (KGs). While KGs provide many advantages for representing knowledge, their development costs can deter extensive research and applications. Addressing this limitation, we introduce a framework for enriching embeddings of small-scale domain-specific Knowledge Graphs with well-established general-purpose KGs. Adopting our method, a modest domain-specific KG can benefit from a performance boost in downstream tasks when linked to a substantial general-purpose KG. Experimental evaluations demonstrate a notable enhancement, with up to a 44% increase observed in the Hits@10 metric. This relatively unexplored research direction can catalyze more frequent incorporation of KGs in knowledge-intensive tasks, resulting in more robust, reliable ML implementations, which hallucinates less than prevalent LLM solutions.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models have become a successful approach for solving various image inverse problems by providing a powerful diffusion prior. Many studies tried to combine the measurement into diffusion by score function replacement, matrix decomposition, or optimization algorithms, but it is hard to balance the data consistency and realness. The slow sampling speed is also a main obstacle to its wide application. To address the challenges, we propose Deep Data Consistency (DDC) to update the data consistency step with a deep learning model when solving inverse problems with diffusion models. By analyzing existing methods, the variational bound training objective is used to maximize the conditional posterior and reduce its impact on the diffusion process. In comparison with state-of-the-art methods in linear and non-linear tasks, DDC demonstrates its outstanding performance of both similarity and realness metrics in generating high-quality solutions with only 5 inference steps in 0.77 seconds on average. In addition, the robustness of DDC is well illustrated in the experiments across datasets, with large noise and the capacity to solve multiple tasks in only one pre-trained model.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>defense, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable performance in various tasks. However, recent works reveal that GNNs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Generally, backdoor attack poisons the graph by attaching backdoor triggers and the target class label to a set of nodes in the training graph. A GNN trained on the poisoned graph will then be misled to predict test nodes attached with trigger to the target class. Despite their effectiveness, our empirical analysis shows that triggers generated by existing methods tend to be out-of-distribution (OOD), which significantly differ from the clean data. Hence, these injected triggers can be easily detected and pruned with widely used outlier detection methods in real-world applications. Therefore, in this paper, we study a novel problem of unnoticeable graph backdoor attacks with in-distribution (ID) triggers. To generate ID triggers, we introduce an OOD detector in conjunction with an adversarial learning strategy to generate the attributes of the triggers within distribution. To ensure a high attack success rate with ID triggers, we introduce novel modules designed to enhance trigger memorization by the victim model trained on poisoned graph. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in generating in distribution triggers that can by-pass various defense strategies while maintaining a high attack success rate.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the digital era, Online Social Networks (OSNs) play a crucial role in information dissemination, with sharing cards for link previews emerging as a key feature. These cards offer snapshots of shared content, including titles, descriptions, and images. In this study, we investigate the construction and dissemination mechanisms of these cards, focusing on two primary server-side generation methods based on Share-SDK and HTML meta tags. Our investigation reveals a novel type of attack, i.e., Sharing Card Forgery (SCF) attack that can be exploited to create forged benign sharing cards for malicious links. We demonstrate the feasibility of these attacks through practical implementations and evaluate their effectiveness across 13 various online social networks. Our findings indicate a significant risk, as the deceptive cards can evade detection and persist on social platforms, thus posing a substantial threat to user security. We also delve into countermeasures and discuss the challenges in effectively mitigating these types of attacks. This study not only sheds light on a novel phishing technique but also calls for heightened awareness and improved defensive strategies in the OSN ecosystem.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Spatiotemporal time series forecasting plays a key role in a wide range of real-world applications. While significant progress has been made in this area, fully capturing and leveraging spatiotemporal heterogeneity remains a fundamental challenge. Therefore, we propose a novel Heterogeneity-Informed Meta-Parameter Learning scheme. Specifically, our approach implicitly captures spatiotemporal heterogeneity through learning spatial and temporal embeddings, which can be viewed as a clustering process. Then, a novel spatiotemporal meta-parameter learning paradigm is proposed to learn spatiotemporal-specific parameters from meta-parameter pools, which is informed by the captured heterogeneity. Based on these ideas, we develop a Heterogeneity-Informed Spatiotemporal Meta-Network (HimNet) for spatiotemporal time series forecasting. Extensive experiments on five widely-used benchmarks demonstrate our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while exhibiting superior interpretability.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Active learning is designed to minimize annotation efforts by prioritizing instances that most enhance learning. However, many active learning strategies struggle with a 'cold start' problem, needing substantial initial data to be effective. This limitation often reduces their utility for pre-trained models, which already perform well in few-shot scenarios. To address this, we introduce ActiveLLM, a novel active learning approach that leverages large language models such as GPT-4, Llama 3, and Mistral Large for selecting instances. We demonstrate that ActiveLLM significantly enhances the classification performance of BERT classifiers in few-shot scenarios, outperforming both traditional active learning methods and the few-shot learning method SetFit. Additionally, ActiveLLM can be extended to non-few-shot scenarios, allowing for iterative selections. In this way, ActiveLLM can even help other active learning strategies to overcome their cold start problem. Our results suggest that ActiveLLM offers a promising solution for improving model performance across various learning setups.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative modeling aims at producing new datapoints whose statistical properties resemble the ones in a training dataset. In recent years, there has been a burst of machine learning techniques and settings that can achieve this goal with remarkable performances. In most of these settings, one uses the training dataset in conjunction with noise, which is added as a source of statistical variability and is essential for the generative task. Here, we explore the idea of using internal chaotic dynamics in high-dimensional chaotic systems as a way to generate new datapoints from a training dataset. We show that simple learning rules can achieve this goal within a set of vanilla architectures and characterize the quality of the generated datapoints through standard accuracy measures.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Increasing demands on medical imaging departments are taking a toll on the radiologist's ability to deliver timely and accurate reports. Recent technological advances in artificial intelligence have demonstrated great potential for automatic radiology report generation (ARRG), sparking an explosion of research. This survey paper conducts a methodological review of contemporary ARRG approaches by way of (i) assessing datasets based on characteristics, such as availability, size, and adoption rate, (ii) examining deep learning training methods, such as contrastive learning and reinforcement learning, (iii) exploring state-of-the-art model architectures, including variations of CNN and transformer models, (iv) outlining techniques integrating clinical knowledge through multimodal inputs and knowledge graphs, and (v) scrutinising current model evaluation techniques, including commonly applied NLP metrics and qualitative clinical reviews. Furthermore, the quantitative results of the reviewed models are analysed, where the top performing models are examined to seek further insights. Finally, potential new directions are highlighted, with the adoption of additional datasets from other radiological modalities and improved evaluation methods predicted as important areas of future development.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, federate, generative, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance over a wide range of tasks, thanks to the unprecedented amount of data they have been trained on. As established scaling laws indicate, LLMs' future performance improvement depends on the amount of computing and data sources we can leverage for pre-training. Federated learning (FL) has the potential to unleash the majority of the planet's data and computational resources, which are underutilized by the data-center-focused training methodology of current LLM practice. Our work presents a robust, flexible, reproducible FL approach that enables large-scale collaboration across institutions to train LLMs. This would mobilize more computational and data resources while matching or potentially exceeding centralized performance. We further show the effectiveness of the federated training scales with model size and present our approach for training a billion-scale federated LLM using limited resources. This will help data-rich actors to become the protagonists of LLMs pre-training instead of leaving the stage to compute-rich actors alone.</li>

          ECR-Chain: Advancing Generative Language Models to Better Emotion-Cause Reasoners through Reasoning Chains(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Understanding the process of emotion generation is crucial for analyzing the causes behind emotions. Causal Emotion Entailment (CEE), an emotion-understanding task, aims to identify the causal utterances in a conversation that stimulate the emotions expressed in a target utterance. However, current works in CEE mainly focus on modeling semantic and emotional interactions in conversations, neglecting the exploration of the emotion-generation process. This hinders the models from deeply understanding emotions, restricting their ability to produce explainable predictions. In this work, inspired by the emotion generation process of "stimulus-appraisal-emotion" in the cognitive appraisal theory, we introduce a step-by-step reasoning method, Emotion-Cause Reasoning Chain (ECR-Chain), to infer the stimulus from the target emotional expressions in conversations. Specifically, we first introduce the ECR-Chain to ChatGPT via few-shot prompting, which significantly improves its performance on the CEE task. We further propose an automated construction process to utilize ChatGPT in building an ECR-Chain set, which can enhance the reasoning abilities of smaller models through supervised training and assist the Vicuna-7B model in achieving state-of-the-art CEE performance. Moreover, our methods can enable these generative language models to effectively perform emotion-cause reasoning in an explainable manner. Our code, data and more details are at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advancements in text-to-image generation using diffusion models have significantly improved the quality of generated images and expanded the ability to depict a wide range of objects. However, ensuring that these models adhere closely to the text prompts remains a considerable challenge. This issue is particularly pronounced when trying to generate photorealistic images of humans. Without significant prompt engineering efforts models often produce unrealistic images and typically fail to incorporate the full extent of the prompt information. This limitation can be largely attributed to the nature of captions accompanying the images used in training large scale diffusion models, which typically prioritize contextual information over details related to the person's appearance. In this paper we address this issue by introducing a training-free pipeline designed to generate accurate appearance descriptions from images of people. We apply this method to create approximately 250,000 captions for publicly available face datasets. We then use these synthetic captions to fine-tune a text-to-image diffusion model. Our results demonstrate that this approach significantly improves the model's ability to generate high-quality, realistic human faces and enhances adherence to the given prompts, compared to the baseline model. We share our synthetic captions, pretrained checkpoints and training code.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, privacy</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper presents a novel approach to the digital signing of electronic documents through the use of a camera-based interaction system, single-finger tracking for sign recognition, and multi commands executing hand gestures. The proposed solution, referred to as "Air Signature," involves writing the signature in front of the camera, rather than relying on traditional methods such as mouse drawing or physically signing on paper and showing it to a web camera. The goal is to develop a state-of-the-art method for detecting and tracking gestures and objects in real-time. The proposed methods include applying existing gesture recognition and object tracking systems, improving accuracy through smoothing and line drawing, and maintaining continuity during fast finger movements. An evaluation of the fingertip detection, sketching, and overall signing process is performed to assess the effectiveness of the proposed solution. The secondary objective of this research is to develop a model that can effectively recognize the unique signature of a user. This type of signature can be verified by neural cores that analyze the movement, speed, and stroke pixels of the signing in real time. The neural cores use machine learning algorithms to match air signatures to the individual's stored signatures, providing a secure and efficient method of verification. Our proposed System does not require sensors or any hardware other than the camera.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Glioblastoma is the most common primary adult brain tumor, with a grim prognosis - median survival of 12-18 months following treatment, and 4 months otherwise. Glioblastoma is widely infiltrative in the cerebral hemispheres and well-defined by heterogeneous molecular and micro-environmental histopathologic profiles, which pose a major obstacle in treatment. Correctly diagnosing these tumors and assessing their heterogeneity is crucial for choosing the precise treatment and potentially enhancing patient survival rates. In the gold-standard histopathology-based approach to tumor diagnosis, detecting various morpho-pathological features of distinct histology throughout digitized tissue sections is crucial. Such "features" include the presence of cellular tumor, geographic necrosis, pseudopalisading necrosis, areas abundant in microvascular proliferation, infiltration into the cortex, wide extension in subcortical white matter, leptomeningeal infiltration, regions dense with macrophages, and the presence of perivascular or scattered lymphocytes. With these features in mind and building upon the main aim of the BraTS Cluster of Challenges this https URL, the goal of the BraTS-Path challenge is to provide a systematically prepared comprehensive dataset and a benchmarking environment to develop and fairly compare deep-learning models capable of identifying tumor sub-regions of distinct histologic profile. These models aim to further our understanding of the disease and assist in the diagnosis and grading of conditions in a consistent manner.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Time series (TS) forecasting has been an unprecedentedly popular problem in recent years, with ubiquitous applications in both scientific and business fields. Various approaches have been introduced to time series analysis, including both statistical approaches and deep neural networks. Although neural network approaches have illustrated stronger ability of representation than statistical methods, they struggle to provide sufficient interpretablility, and can be too complicated to optimize. In this paper, we present WEITS, a frequency-aware deep learning framework that is highly interpretable and computationally efficient. Through multi-level wavelet decomposition, WEITS novelly infuses frequency analysis into a highly deep learning framework. Combined with a forward-backward residual architecture, it enjoys both high representation capability and statistical interpretability. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets have demonstrated competitive performance of our model, along with its additional advantage of high computation efficiency. Furthermore, WEITS provides a general framework that can always seamlessly integrate with state-of-the-art approaches for time series forecast.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The goal of image registration is to establish spatial correspondence between two or more images, traditionally through dense displacement fields (DDFs) or parametric transformations (e.g., rigid, affine, and splines). Rethinking the existing paradigms of achieving alignment via spatial transformations, we uncover an alternative but more intuitive correspondence representation: a set of corresponding regions-of-interest (ROI) pairs, which we demonstrate to have sufficient representational capability as other correspondence representation methods.Further, it is neither necessary nor sufficient for these ROIs to hold specific anatomical or semantic significance. In turn, we formulate image registration as searching for the same set of corresponding ROIs from both moving and fixed images - in other words, two multi-class segmentation tasks on a pair of images. For a general-purpose and practical implementation, we integrate the segment anything model (SAM) into our proposed algorithms, resulting in a SAM-enabled registration (SAMReg) that does not require any training data, gradient-based fine-tuning or engineered prompts. We experimentally show that the proposed SAMReg is capable of segmenting and matching multiple ROI pairs, which establish sufficiently accurate correspondences, in three clinical applications of registering prostate MR, cardiac MR and abdominal CT images. Based on metrics including Dice and target registration errors on anatomical structures, the proposed registration outperforms both intensity-based iterative algorithms and DDF-predicting learning-based networks, even yielding competitive performance with weakly-supervised registration which requires fully-segmented training data.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rising complexity of cyber threats calls for a comprehensive reassessment of current security frameworks in business environments. This research focuses on Stealth Data Exfiltration, a significant cyber threat characterized by covert infiltration, extended undetectability, and unauthorized dissemination of confidential data. Our findings reveal that conventional defense-in-depth strategies often fall short in combating these sophisticated threats, highlighting the immediate need for a shift in information risk management across businesses. The evolving nature of cyber threats, driven by advancements in techniques such as social engineering, multi-vector attacks, and Generative AI, underscores the need for robust, adaptable, and comprehensive security strategies. As we navigate this complex landscape, it is crucial to anticipate potential threats and continually update our defenses. We propose a shift from traditional perimeter-based, prevention-focused models, which depend on a static attack surface, to a more dynamic framework that prepares for inevitable breaches. This suggested model, known as MESA 2.0 Security Model, prioritizes swift detection, immediate response, and ongoing resilience, thereby enhancing an organizations ability to promptly identify and neutralize threats, significantly reducing the consequences of security breaches. This study suggests that businesses adopt a forward-thinking and adaptable approach to security management to stay ahead of the ever-changing cyber threat landscape.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Most existing methods often rely on complex models to predict scene depth with high accuracy, resulting in slow inference that is not conducive to deployment. To better balance precision and speed, we first designed SmallDepth based on sparsity. Second, to enhance the feature representation ability of SmallDepth during training under the condition of equal complexity during inference, we propose an equivalent transformation module(ETM). Third, to improve the ability of each layer in the case of a fixed SmallDepth to perceive different context information and improve the robustness of SmallDepth to the left-right direction and illumination changes, we propose pyramid loss. Fourth, to further improve the accuracy of SmallDepth, we utilized the proposed function approximation loss (APX) to transfer knowledge in the pretrained HQDecv2, obtained by optimizing the previous HQDec to address grid artifacts in some regions, to SmallDepth. Extensive experiments demonstrate that each proposed component improves the precision of SmallDepth without changing the complexity of SmallDepth during inference, and the developed approach achieves state-of-the-art results on KITTI at an inference speed of more than 500 frames per second and with approximately 2 M parameters.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) constitute a breakthrough state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology which is rapidly evolving and promises to aid in medical diagnosis either by assisting doctors or by simulating a doctor's workflow in more advanced and complex implementations. In this technical paper, we outline Cognitive Network Evaluation Toolkit for Medical Domains (COGNET-MD), which constitutes a novel benchmark for LLM evaluation in the medical domain. Specifically, we propose a scoring-framework with increased difficulty to assess the ability of LLMs in interpreting medical text. The proposed framework is accompanied with a database of Multiple Choice Quizzes (MCQs). To ensure alignment with current medical trends and enhance safety, usefulness, and applicability, these MCQs have been constructed in collaboration with several associated medical experts in various medical domains and are characterized by varying degrees of difficulty. The current (first) version of the database includes the medical domains of Psychiatry, Dentistry, Pulmonology, Dermatology and Endocrinology, but it will be continuously extended and expanded to include additional medical domains.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) provide precise location, while Real Time Kinematics (RTK) allow mobile receivers (termed rovers), leveraging fixed stations, to correct errors in their Position Navigation and Timing (PNT) solution. This allows compensating for multi-path effects, ionospheric errors, and observation biases, enabling consumer receivers to achieve centimeter-level accuracy. While network distribution of correction streams can be protected with common secure networking practices, the reference stations can still be attacked by GNSS spoofing or jamming. This work investigates (i) the effect RTK reference station spoofing has on the rover's PNT solution quality and (ii) the potential countermeasures towards hardening the RTK infrastructure.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In recent years, various large foundation models have been proposed for image segmentation. There models are often trained on large amounts of data corresponding to general computer vision tasks. Hence, these models do not perform well on medical data. There have been some attempts in the literature to perform parameter-efficient finetuning of such foundation models for medical image segmentation. However, these approaches assume that all the parameters of the model are available for adaptation. But, in many cases, these models are released as APIs or blackboxes, with no or limited access to the model parameters and data. In addition, finetuning methods also require a significant amount of compute, which may not be available for the downstream task. At the same time, medical data can't be shared with third-party agents for finetuning due to privacy reasons. To tackle these challenges, we pioneer a blackbox adaptation technique for prompted medical image segmentation, called BAPS. BAPS has two components - (i) An Image-Prompt decoder (IP decoder) module that generates visual prompts given an image and a prompt, and (ii) A Zero Order Optimization (ZOO) Method, called SPSA-GC that is used to update the IP decoder without the need for backpropagating through the foundation model. Thus, our method does not require any knowledge about the foundation model's weights or gradients. We test BAPS on four different modalities and show that our method can improve the original model's performance by around 4%.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the e-commerce domain, the accurate extraction of attribute-value pairs from product listings (e.g., Brand: Apple) is crucial for enhancing search and recommendation systems. The automation of this extraction process is challenging due to the vast diversity of product categories and their respective attributes, compounded by the lack of extensive, accurately annotated training datasets and the demand for low latency to meet the real-time needs of e-commerce platforms. To address these challenges, we introduce GenToC, a novel two-stage model for extracting attribute-value pairs from product titles. GenToC is designed to train with partially-labeled data, leveraging incomplete attribute-value pairs and obviating the need for a fully annotated dataset. Moreover, we introduce a bootstrapping method that enables GenToC to progressively refine and expand its training dataset. This enhancement substantially improves the quality of data available for training other neural network models that are typically faster but are inherently less capable than GenToC in terms of their capacity to handle partially-labeled data. By supplying an enriched dataset for training, GenToC significantly advances the performance of these alternative models, making them more suitable for real-time deployment. Our results highlight the unique capability of GenToC to learn from a limited set of labeled data and to contribute to the training of more efficient models, marking a significant leap forward in the automated extraction of attribute-value pairs from product titles. GenToC has been successfully integrated into India's largest B2B e-commerce platform, this http URL, achieving a significant increase of 21.1% in recall over the existing deployed system while maintaining a high precision of 89.5% in this challenging task.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Proving local robustness is crucial to increase the reliability of neural networks. While many verifiers prove robustness in $L_\infty$ $\epsilon$-balls, very little work deals with robustness verification in $L_0$ $\epsilon$-balls, capturing robustness to few pixel attacks. This verification introduces a combinatorial challenge, because the space of pixels to perturb is discrete and of exponential size. A previous work relies on covering designs to identify sets for defining $L_\infty$ neighborhoods, which if proven robust imply that the $L_0$ $\epsilon$-ball is robust. However, the number of neighborhoods to verify remains very high, leading to a high analysis time. We propose covering verification designs, a combinatorial design that tailors effective but analysis-incompatible coverings to $L_0$ robustness verification. The challenge is that computing a covering verification design introduces a high time and memory overhead, which is intensified in our setting, where multiple candidate coverings are required to identify how to reduce the overall analysis time. We introduce CoVerD, an $L_0$ robustness verifier that selects between different candidate coverings without constructing them, but by predicting their block size distribution. This prediction relies on a theorem providing closed-form expressions for the mean and variance of this distribution. CoVerD constructs the chosen covering verification design on-the-fly, while keeping the memory consumption minimal and enabling to parallelize the analysis. The experimental results show that CoVerD reduces the verification time on average by up to 5.1x compared to prior work and that it scales to larger $L_0$ $\epsilon$-balls.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Mechanistic Interpretability aims to reverse engineer the algorithms implemented by neural networks by studying their weights and activations. An obstacle to reverse engineering neural networks is that many of the parameters inside a network are not involved in the computation being implemented by the network. These degenerate parameters may obfuscate internal structure. Singular learning theory teaches us that neural network parameterizations are biased towards being more degenerate, and parameterizations with more degeneracy are likely to generalize further. We identify 3 ways that network parameters can be degenerate: linear dependence between activations in a layer; linear dependence between gradients passed back to a layer; ReLUs which fire on the same subset of datapoints. We also present a heuristic argument that modular networks are likely to be more degenerate, and we develop a metric for identifying modules in a network that is based on this argument. We propose that if we can represent a neural network in a way that is invariant to reparameterizations that exploit the degeneracies, then this representation is likely to be more interpretable, and we provide some evidence that such a representation is likely to have sparser interactions. We introduce the Interaction Basis, a tractable technique to obtain a representation that is invariant to degeneracies from linear dependence of activations or Jacobians.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Mechanistic interpretability aims to understand the behavior of neural networks by reverse-engineering their internal computations. However, current methods struggle to find clear interpretations of neural network activations because a decomposition of activations into computational features is missing. Individual neurons or model components do not cleanly correspond to distinct features or functions. We present a novel interpretability method that aims to overcome this limitation by transforming the activations of the network into a new basis - the Local Interaction Basis (LIB). LIB aims to identify computational features by removing irrelevant activations and interactions. Our method drops irrelevant activation directions and aligns the basis with the singular vectors of the Jacobian matrix between adjacent layers. It also scales features based on their importance for downstream computation, producing an interaction graph that shows all computationally-relevant features and interactions in a model. We evaluate the effectiveness of LIB on modular addition and CIFAR-10 models, finding that it identifies more computationally-relevant features that interact more sparsely, compared to principal component analysis. However, LIB does not yield substantial improvements in interpretability or interaction sparsity when applied to language models. We conclude that LIB is a promising theory-driven approach for analyzing neural networks, but in its current form is not applicable to large language models.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Modeling the shape of garments has received much attention, but most existing approaches assume the garments to be worn by someone, which constrains the range of shapes they can assume. In this work, we address shape recovery when garments are being manipulated instead of worn, which gives rise to an even larger range of possible shapes. To this end, we leverage the implicit sewing patterns (ISP) model for garment modeling and extend it by adding a diffusion-based deformation prior to represent these shapes. To recover 3D garment shapes from incomplete 3D point clouds acquired when the garment is folded, we map the points to UV space, in which our priors are learned, to produce partial UV maps, and then fit the priors to recover complete UV maps and 2D to 3D mappings. Experimental results demonstrate the superior reconstruction accuracy of our method compared to previous ones, especially when dealing with large non-rigid deformations arising from the manipulations.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrates remarkable multilingual capabilities in natural language processing, attracting global attention in both academia and industry. To mitigate potential discrimination and enhance the overall usability and accessibility for diverse language user groups, it is important for the development of language-fair technology. Despite the breakthroughs of LLMs, the investigation into the multilingual scenario remains insufficient, where a comprehensive survey to summarize recent approaches, developments, limitations, and potential solutions is desirable. To this end, we provide a survey with multiple perspectives on the utilization of LLMs in the multilingual scenario. We first rethink the transitions between previous and current research on pre-trained language models. Then we introduce several perspectives on the multilingualism of LLMs, including training and inference methods, model security, multi-domain with language culture, and usage of datasets. We also discuss the major challenges that arise in these aspects, along with possible solutions. Besides, we highlight future research directions that aim at further enhancing LLMs with multilingualism. The survey aims to help the research community address multilingual problems and provide a comprehensive understanding of the core concepts, key techniques, and latest developments in multilingual natural language processing based on LLMs.</li>
