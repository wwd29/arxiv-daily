<li>Summary: <p>Multi-signature is a protocol where a set of signatures jointly sign a
message so that the final signature is significantly shorter than concatenating
individual signatures together. Recently, it finds applications in blockchain,
where several users want to jointly authorize a payment through a
multi-signature. However, in this setting, there is no centralized authority
and it could suffer from a rogue key attack where the attacker can generate his
own keys arbitrarily. Further, to minimize the storage on blockchain, it is
desired that the aggregated public-key and the aggregated signature are both as
short as possible. In this paper, we find a compiler that converts a kind of
identification (ID) scheme (which we call a linear ID) to a multi-signature so
that both the aggregated public-key and the aggregated signature have a size
independent of the number of signers. Our compiler is provably secure. The
advantage of our results is that we reduce a multi-party problem to a weakly
secure two-party problem. We realize our compiler with two ID schemes. The
first is Schnorr ID. The second is a new lattice-based ID scheme, which via our
compiler gives the first regular lattice-based multi-signature scheme with
key-and-signature compact without a restart during signing process.

<li>Summary: <p>Information flow security properties were defined some years ago (see, e.g.,
the surveys \cite{FG01,Ry01}) in terms of suitable equivalence checking
problems. These definitions were provided by using sequential models of
computations (e.g., labeled transition systems \cite{GV15}), and interleaving
behavioral equivalences (e.g., bisimulation equivalence \cite{Mil89}). More
recently, the distributed model of Petri nets has been used to study
non-interference in \cite{BG03,BG09,BC15}, but also in these papers an
interleaving semantics was used. We argue that in order to capture all the
relevant information flows, truly-concurrent behavioral equivalences must be
used. In particular, we propose for Petri nets the distributed non-interference
property, called DNI, based on {\em branching place bisimilarity}
\cite{Gor21b}, which is a sensible, decidable equivalence for finite Petri nets
with silent moves. Then we focus our attention on the subclass of Petri nets
called {\em finite-state machines}, which can be represented (up to
isomorphism) by the simple process algebra CFM \cite{Gor17}. DNI is very easily
checkable on CFM processes, as it is compositional, so that it does does not
suffer from the state-space explosion problem. Moreover, we show that DNI can
be characterized syntactically on CFM by means of a type system.

<li>Summary: <p>Face identity masking algorithms developed in recent years aim to protect the
privacy of people in video recordings. These algorithms are designed to
interfere with identification, while preserving information about facial
actions. An important challenge is to preserve subtle actions in the eye
region, while obscuring the salient identity cues from the eyes. We evaluated
the effectiveness of identity-masking algorithms based on Canny filters,
applied with and without eye enhancement, for interfering with identification
and preserving facial actions. In Experiments 1 and 2, we tested human
participants' ability to match the facial identity of a driver in a low
resolution video to a high resolution facial image. Results showed that both
masking methods impaired identification, and that eye enhancement did not alter
the effectiveness of the Canny filter mask. In Experiment 3, we tested action
preservation and found that neither method interfered significantly with driver
action perception. We conclude that relatively simple, filter-based masking
algorithms, which are suitable for application to low quality video, can be
used in privacy protection without compromising action perception.

<li>Summary: <p>The need for a privacy management layer in today's systems started to
manifest with the emergence of new systems for privacy-preserving analytics and
privacy compliance. As a result, we began to see many independent efforts
emerge that try to provide system support for privacy. Recently, the scope of
privacy solutions used in systems has expanded to encompass more complex
techniques such as Differential Privacy (DP). The use of these solutions in
large-scale systems imposes new challenges and requirements. Careful planning
and coordination are necessary to ensure that privacy guarantees are maintained
across a wide range of heterogeneous applications and data systems. This
requires new solutions for managing shared application state and allocating
scarce and non-replenishable privacy resources. In this paper, we introduce
Cohere, a new data management system that simplifies the use of DP in
large-scale systems. Cohere implements a unified interface that allows
heterogeneous applications to operate on a unified view of users' data. Cohere
further extends existing accounting systems with the ability to manage and
optimally allocate shared privacy resources, i.e., budget, under complex
preferences. We show that Cohere can effectively enable advanced privacy
solutions in existing large-scale systems with minimal modifications to
existing data management systems and with moderate overhead.

<li>Summary: <p>The (logically) centralised architecture of the software-defined networks
makes them an easy target for packet injection attacks. In these attacks, the
attacker injects malicious packets into the SDN network to affect the services
and performance of the SDN controller and overflow the capacity of the SDN
switches. Such attacks have been shown to ultimately stop the network
functioning in real-time, leading to network breakdowns. There have been
significant works on detecting and defending against similar DoS attacks in
non-SDN networks, but detection and protection techniques for SDN against
packet injection attacks are still in their infancy. Furthermore, many of the
proposed solutions have been shown to be easily by-passed by simple
modifications to the attacking packets or by altering the attacking profile. In
this paper, we develop novel Graph Convolutional Neural Network models and
algorithms for grouping network nodes/users into security classes by learning
from network data. We start with two simple classes - nodes that engage in
suspicious packet injection attacks and nodes that are not. From these classes,
we then partition the network into separate segments with different security
policies using distributed Ryu controllers in an SDN network. We show in
experiments on an emulated SDN that our detection solution outperforms
alternative approaches with above 99\% detection accuracy on various types
(both old and new) of injection attacks. More importantly, our mitigation
solution maintains continuous functions of non-compromised nodes while
isolating compromised/suspicious nodes in real-time. All code and data are
publicly available for reproducibility of our results.

<li>Summary: <p>This work proposes a quasirandom sequence of quadratures for high-dimensional
mean-field variational inference and a related sparsifying methodology. Each
iterate of the sequence contains two evaluations points that combine to
correctly integrate all univariate quadratic functions, as well as univariate
cubics if the mean-field factors are symmetric. More importantly, averaging
results over short subsequences achieves periodic exactness on a much larger
space of multivariate polynomials of quadratic total degree. This framework is
devised by first considering stochastic blocked mean-field quadratures, which
may be useful in other contexts. By replacing pseudorandom sequences with
quasirandom sequences, over half of all multivariate quadratic basis functions
integrate exactly with only 4 function evaluations, and the exactness dimension
increases for longer subsequences. Analysis shows how these efficient integrals
characterize the dominant log-posterior contributions to mean-field variational
approximations, including diagonal Hessian approximations, to support a robust
sparsifying methodology in deep learning algorithms. A numerical demonstration
of this approach on a simple Convolutional Neural Network for MNIST retains
high test accuracy, 96.9%, while training over 98.9% of parameters to zero in
only 10 epochs, bearing potential to reduce both storage and energy
requirements for deep learning models.

<li>Summary: <p>Objective
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Kalman filtering has previously been applied to track neural model states and
parameters, particularly at the scale relevant to EEG. However, this approach
lacks a reliable method to determine the initial filter conditions and assumes
that the distribution of states remains Gaussian. This study presents an
alternative, data-driven method to track the states and parameters of neural
mass models (NMMs) from EEG recordings using deep learning techniques,
specifically an LSTM neural network.
</p>
<p>Approach
</p>
<p>An LSTM filter was trained on simulated EEG data generated by a neural mass
model using a wide range of parameters. With an appropriately customised loss
function, the LSTM filter can learn the behaviour of NMMs. As a result, it can
output the state vector and parameters of NMMs given observation data as the
input.
</p>
<p>Main Results
</p>
<p>Test results using simulated data yielded correlations with R squared of
around 0.99 and verified that the method is robust to noise and can be more
accurate than a nonlinear Kalman filter when the initial conditions of the
Kalman filter are not accurate. As an example of real-world application, the
LSTM filter was also applied to real EEG data that included epileptic seizures,
and revealed changes in connectivity strength parameters at the beginnings of
seizures.
</p>
<p>Significance
</p>
<p>Tracking the state vector and parameters of mathematical brain models is of
great importance in the area of brain modelling, monitoring, imaging and
control. This approach has no need to specify the initial state vector and
parameters, which is very difficult to do in practice because many of the
variables being estimated cannot be measured directly in physiological
experiments. This method may be applied using any neural mass model and,
therefore, provides a general, novel, efficient approach to estimate brain
model variables that are often difficult to measure.

<li>Summary: <p>We revisit the estimation bias in policy gradients for the discounted
episodic Markov decision process (MDP) from Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
perspective. The objective is formulated theoretically as the expected returns
discounted over the time horizon. One of the major policy gradient biases is
the state distribution shift: the state distribution used to estimate the
gradients differs from the theoretical formulation in that it does not take
into account the discount factor. Existing discussion of the influence of this
bias was limited to the tabular and softmax cases in the literature. Therefore,
in this paper, we extend it to the DRL setting where the policy is
parameterized and demonstrate how this bias can lead to suboptimal policies
theoretically. We then discuss why the empirically inaccurate implementations
with shifted state distribution can still be effective. We show that, despite
such state distribution shift, the policy gradient estimation bias can be
reduced in the following three ways: 1) a small learning rate; 2) an
adaptive-learning-rate-based optimizer; and 3) KL regularization. Specifically,
we show that a smaller learning rate, or, an adaptive learning rate, such as
that used by Adam and RSMProp optimizers, makes the policy optimization robust
to the bias. We further draw connections between optimizers and the
optimization regularization to show that both the KL and the reverse KL
regularization can significantly rectify this bias. Moreover, we provide
extensive experiments on continuous control tasks to support our analysis. Our
paper sheds light on how successful PG algorithms optimize policies in the DRL
setting, and contributes insights into the practical issues in DRL.

<li>Summary: <p>Machine learning currently plays an increasingly important role in people's
lives in areas such as credit scoring, auto-driving, disease diagnosing, and
insurance quoting. However, in many of these areas, machine learning models
have performed unfair behaviors against some sub-populations, such as some
particular groups of race, sex, and age. These unfair behaviors can be on
account of the pre-existing bias in the training dataset due to historical and
social factors. In this paper, we focus on a real-world application of credit
scoring and construct a fair prediction model by introducing latent variables
to remove the correlation between protected attributes, such as sex and age,
with the observable feature inputs, including house and job. For detailed
implementation, we apply Bayesian approaches, including the Markov Chain Monte
Carlo simulation, to estimate our proposed fair model.

<li>Summary: <p>Human mobility clustering is an important problem for understanding human
mobility behaviors (e.g., work and school commutes). Existing methods typically
contain two steps: choosing or learning a mobility representation and applying
a clustering algorithm to the representation. However, these methods rely on
strict visiting orders in trajectories and cannot take advantage of multiple
types of mobility representations. This paper proposes a novel mobility
clustering method for mobility behavior detection. First, the proposed method
contains a permutation-equivalent operation to handle sub-trajectories that
might have different visiting orders but similar impacts on mobility behaviors.
Second, the proposed method utilizes a variational autoencoder architecture to
simultaneously perform clustering in both latent and original spaces. Also, in
order to handle the bias of a single latent space, our clustering assignment
prediction considers multiple learned latent spaces at different epochs. This
way, the proposed method produces accurate results and can provide reliability
estimates of each trajectory's cluster assignment. The experiment shows that
the proposed method outperformed state-of-the-art methods in mobility behavior
detection from trajectories with better accuracy and more interpretability.
