<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Privacy Masking is a critical concept under data privacy involving anonymization and de-anonymization of personally identifiable information (PII). Privacy masking techniques rely on Named Entity Recognition (NER) approaches under NLP support in identifying and classifying named entities in each text. NER approaches, however, have several limitations including (a) content sensitivity including ambiguous, polysemic, context dependent or domain specific content, (b) phrasing variabilities including nicknames and alias, informal expressions, alternative representations, emerging expressions, evolving naming conventions and (c) formats or syntax variations, typos, misspellings. However, there are a couple of PII datasets that have been widely used by researchers and the open-source community to train models on PII detection or masking. These datasets have been used to train models including Piiranha and Starpii, which have been downloaded over 300k and 580k times on HuggingFace. We examine the quality of the PII masking by these models given the limitations of the datasets and of the NER approaches. We curate a dataset of 17K unique, semi-synthetic sentences containing 16 types of PII by compiling information from across multiple jurisdictions including India, U.K and U.S. We generate sentences (using language models) containing these PII at five different NER detection feature dimensions - (1) Basic Entity Recognition, (2) Contextual Entity Disambiguation, (3) NER in Noisy & Real-World Data, (4) Evolving & Novel Entities Detection and (5) Cross-Lingual or multi-lingual NER) and 1 in adversarial context. We present the results and exhibit the privacy exposure caused by such model use (considering the extent of lifetime downloads of these models). We conclude by highlighting the gaps in measuring performance of the models and the need for contextual disclosure in model cards for such models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant progress in language understanding and reasoning. Evaluating and analyzing their logical reasoning abilities has therefore become essential. However, existing datasets and benchmarks are often limited to overly simplistic, unnatural, or contextually constrained examples. In response to the growing demand, we introduce SmartyPat-Bench, a challenging, naturally expressed, and systematically labeled benchmark derived from real-world high-quality Reddit posts containing subtle logical fallacies. Unlike existing datasets and benchmarks, it provides more detailed annotations of logical fallacies and features more diverse data. To further scale up the study and address the limitations of manual data collection and labeling - such as fallacy-type imbalance and labor-intensive annotation - we introduce SmartyPat, an automated framework powered by logic programming-based oracles. SmartyPat utilizes Prolog rules to systematically generate logically fallacious statements, which are then refined into fluent natural-language sentences by LLMs, ensuring precise fallacy representation. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that SmartyPat produces fallacies comparable in subtlety and quality to human-generated content and significantly outperforms baseline methods. Finally, experiments reveal nuanced insights into LLM capabilities, highlighting that while excessive reasoning steps hinder fallacy detection accuracy, structured reasoning enhances fallacy categorization performance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) engage users in multi-turn interactions to deliver personalized recommendations. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) further enhances these systems by enabling more natural and dynamic user interactions. However, a key challenge remains in understanding how personality traits shape conversational recommendation outcomes. Psychological evidence highlights the influence of personality traits on user interaction behaviors. To address this, we introduce an LLM-based personality-aware user simulation for CRSs (PerCRS). The user agent induces customizable personality traits and preferences, while the system agent possesses the persuasion capability to simulate realistic interaction in CRSs. We incorporate multi-aspect evaluation to ensure robustness and conduct extensive analysis from both user and system perspectives. Experimental results demonstrate that state-of-the-art LLMs can effectively generate diverse user responses aligned with specified personality traits, thereby prompting CRSs to dynamically adjust their recommendation strategies. Our experimental analysis offers empirical insights into the impact of personality traits on the outcomes of conversational recommender systems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models are increasingly used in scientific domains, especially for molecular understanding and analysis. However, existing models are affected by hallucination issues, resulting in errors in drug design and utilization. In this paper, we first analyze the sources of hallucination in LLMs for molecular comprehension tasks, specifically the knowledge shortcut phenomenon observed in the PubChem dataset. To evaluate hallucination in molecular comprehension tasks with computational efficiency, we introduce \textbf{Mol-Hallu}, a novel free-form evaluation metric that quantifies the degree of hallucination based on the scientific entailment relationship between generated text and actual molecular properties. Utilizing the Mol-Hallu metric, we reassess and analyze the extent of hallucination in various LLMs performing molecular comprehension tasks. Furthermore, the Hallucination Reduction Post-processing stage~(HRPP) is proposed to alleviate molecular hallucinations, Experiments show the effectiveness of HRPP on decoder-only and encoder-decoder molecular LLMs. Our findings provide critical insights into mitigating hallucination and improving the reliability of LLMs in scientific applications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), numerous outstanding accomplishments have emerged within the open-source community. Due to the complexity of creating and training multimodal data pairs, it is still a computational and time-consuming process to build powerful MLLMs. In this work, we introduce Capybara-OMNI, an MLLM that trains in a lightweight and efficient manner and supports understanding text, image, video, and audio modalities. We present in detail the framework design, the data construction, and the training recipe, to develop an MLLM step-by-step to obtain competitive performance. We also provide exclusive benchmarks utilized in our experiments to show how to properly verify understanding capabilities across different modalities. Results show that by following our guidance, we can efficiently build an MLLM that achieves competitive performance among models of the same scale on various multimodal benchmarks. Additionally, to enhance the multimodal instruction following and conversational capabilities of the model, we further discuss how to train the chat version upon an MLLM understanding model, which is more in line with user habits for tasks like real-time interaction with humans. We publicly disclose the Capybara-OMNI model, along with its chat-based version. The disclosure includes both the model weights, a portion of the training data, and the inference codes, which are made available on GitHub.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Following the widespread adoption of ChatGPT in early 2023, numerous studies reported that large language models (LLMs) can match or even surpass human performance in creative tasks. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs have become more creative over time, and how consistent their creative output is. In this study, we evaluated 14 widely used LLMs -- including GPT-4, Claude, Llama, Grok, Mistral, and DeepSeek -- across two validated creativity assessments: the Divergent Association Task (DAT) and the Alternative Uses Task (AUT). Contrary to expectations, we found no evidence of increased creative performance over the past 18-24 months, with GPT-4 performing worse than in previous studies. For the more widely used AUT, all models performed on average better than the average human, with GPT-4o and o3-mini performing best. However, only 0.28% of LLM-generated responses reached the top 10% of human creativity benchmarks. Beyond inter-model differences, we document substantial intra-model variability: the same LLM, given the same prompt, can produce outputs ranging from below-average to original. This variability has important implications for both creativity research and practical applications. Ignoring such variability risks misjudging the creative potential of LLMs, either inflating or underestimating their capabilities. The choice of prompts affected LLMs differently. Our findings underscore the need for more nuanced evaluation frameworks and highlight the importance of model selection, prompt design, and repeated assessment when using Generative AI (GenAI) tools in creative contexts.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>defense, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the past few years, Language Models (LMs) have shown par-human capabilities in several domains. Despite their practical applications and exceeding user consumption, they are susceptible to jailbreaks when malicious input exploits the LM's weaknesses, causing it to deviate from its intended behavior. Current defensive strategies either classify the input prompt as adversarial or prevent LMs from generating harmful outputs. However, it is challenging to explain the reason behind the malicious nature of the jailbreak, which results in a wide variety of closed-box approaches. In this research, we propose and demonstrate that system-prompt attention from Small Language Models (SLMs) can be used to characterize adversarial prompts, providing a novel, explainable, and cheaper defense approach called AttentionDefense. Our research suggests that the attention mechanism is an integral component in understanding and explaining how LMs respond to malicious input that is not captured in the semantic meaning of text embeddings. The proposed AttentionDefense is evaluated against existing jailbreak benchmark datasets. Ablation studies show that SLM-based AttentionDefense has equivalent or better jailbreak detection performance compared to text embedding-based classifiers and GPT-4 zero-shot this http URL further validate the efficacy of the proposed approach, we generate a dataset of novel jailbreak variants of the existing benchmark dataset using a closed-loop LLM-based multi-agent system. We demonstrate that the proposed AttentionDefense approach performs robustly on this novel jailbreak dataset while existing approaches suffer in performance. Additionally, for practical purposes AttentionDefense is an ideal solution as it has the computation requirements of a small LM but the performance of a LLM detector.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While data synthesis and distillation are promising strategies to enhance small language models, current approaches heavily rely on Large Language Models (LLMs), which suffer from high computational costs, environmental inefficiency, and potential biases inherited from monolithic architectures. In contrast, smaller LLMs are more accessible and sustainable, but their individual capabilities often fall short in generating high-quality, diverse, and reliable data. Inspired by collaborative human processes (e.g., peer review), we propose a multiple small LLMs involved framework, GRA, that aggregates specialized roles across small LLMs to iterative refinement and quality control typically achieved by a single large LLM. In this collaborative framework, multiple small LLMs assume distinct roles-Generator, Reviewer, and Adjudicator-to simulate a peer-review-inspired data synthesis pipeline. The Generator proposes initial data samples, the Reviewer critiques their quality and diversity, and the Adjudicator resolves conflicts to finalize the output. By decomposing the synthesis process into specialized sub-tasks, collaborative small LLMs can achieve data-level parity with large LLM-based distillation. Through experiments across multiple benchmarks, we demonstrate that GRA-produced data matches or exceeds the quality of single large LLM outputs, e.g., Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct. Our results challenge the necessity of monolithic large models for high-quality data synthesis, advocating instead for strategic coordination of smaller agents.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by retrieving relevant document from external knowledge sources. By referencing this external knowledge, RAG effectively reduces the generation of factually incorrect content and addresses hallucination issues within LLMs. Recently, there has been growing attention to improving the performance and efficiency of RAG systems from various perspectives. While these advancements have yielded significant results, the application of RAG in domains with considerable societal implications raises a critical question about fairness: What impact does the introduction of the RAG paradigm have on the fairness of LLMs? To address this question, we conduct extensive experiments by varying the LLMs, retrievers, and retrieval sources. Our experimental analysis reveals that the scale of the LLMs plays a significant role in influencing fairness outcomes within the RAG framework. When the model scale is smaller than 8B, the integration of retrieval mechanisms often exacerbates unfairness in small-scale LLMs (e.g., LLaMA3.2-1B, Mistral-7B, and LLaMA3-8B). To mitigate the fairness issues introduced by RAG for small-scale LLMs, we propose two approaches, FairFT and FairFilter. Specifically, in FairFT, we align the retriever with the LLM in terms of fairness, enabling it to retrieve documents that facilitate fairer model outputs. In FairFilter, we propose a fairness filtering mechanism to filter out biased content after retrieval. Finally, we validate our proposed approaches on real-world datasets, demonstrating their effectiveness in improving fairness while maintaining performance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Natural Language Inference (NLI) is a fundamental task in both natural language processing and information retrieval. While NLI has developed many sub-directions such as sentence-level NLI, document-level NLI and cross-lingual NLI, Cross-Document Cross-Lingual NLI (CDCL-NLI) remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm for CDCL-NLI that extends traditional NLI capabilities to multi-document, multilingual scenarios. To support this task, we construct a high-quality CDCL-NLI dataset including 1,110 instances and spanning 26 languages. To build a baseline for this task, we also propose an innovative method that integrates RST-enhanced graph fusion and interpretability prediction. Our method employs RST (Rhetorical Structure Theory) on RGAT (Relation-aware Graph Attention Network) for cross-document context modeling, coupled with a structure-aware semantic alignment mechanism based on lexical chains for cross-lingual understanding. For NLI interpretability, we develop an EDU-level attribution framework that generates extractive explanations. Extensive experiments demonstrate our approach's superior performance, achieving significant improvements over both traditional NLI models such as DocNLI and R2F, as well as LLMs like Llama3 and GPT-4o. Our work sheds light on the study of NLI and will bring research interest on cross-document cross-lingual context understanding, semantic retrieval and interpretability inference.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the vast expansion of content on social media platforms, analyzing and comprehending online discourse has become increasingly complex. This paper introduces LLMTaxo, a novel framework leveraging large language models for the automated construction of taxonomy of factual claims from social media by generating topics from multi-level granularities. This approach aids stakeholders in more effectively navigating the social media landscapes. We implement this framework with different models across three distinct datasets and introduce specially designed taxonomy evaluation metrics for a comprehensive assessment. With the evaluations from both human evaluators and GPT-4, the results indicate that LLMTaxo effectively categorizes factual claims from social media, and reveals that certain models perform better on specific datasets.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Clinical case reports and discharge summaries may be the most complete and accurate summarization of patient encounters, yet they are finalized, i.e., timestamped after the encounter. Complementary data structured streams become available sooner but suffer from incompleteness. To train models and algorithms on more complete and temporally fine-grained data, we construct a pipeline to phenotype, extract, and annotate time-localized findings within case reports using large language models. We apply our pipeline to generate an open-access textual time series corpus for Sepsis-3 comprising 2,139 case reports from the Pubmed-Open Access (PMOA) Subset. To validate our system, we apply it on PMOA and timeline annotations from I2B2/MIMIC-IV and compare the results to physician-expert annotations. We show high recovery rates of clinical findings (event match rates: O1-preview--0.755, Llama 3.3 70B Instruct--0.753) and strong temporal ordering (concordance: O1-preview--0.932, Llama 3.3 70B Instruct--0.932). Our work characterizes the ability of LLMs to time-localize clinical findings in text, illustrating the limitations of LLM use for temporal reconstruction and providing several potential avenues of improvement via multimodal integration.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) augments Large Language Models (LLMs) with external knowledge, conventional single-agent RAG remains fundamentally limited in resolving complex queries demanding coordinated reasoning across heterogeneous data ecosystems. We present HM-RAG, a novel Hierarchical Multi-agent Multimodal RAG framework that pioneers collaborative intelligence for dynamic knowledge synthesis across structured, unstructured, and graph-based data. The framework is composed of three-tiered architecture with specialized agents: a Decomposition Agent that dissects complex queries into contextually coherent sub-tasks via semantic-aware query rewriting and schema-guided context augmentation; Multi-source Retrieval Agents that carry out parallel, modality-specific retrieval using plug-and-play modules designed for vector, graph, and web-based databases; and a Decision Agent that uses consistency voting to integrate multi-source answers and resolve discrepancies in retrieval results through Expert Model Refinement. This architecture attains comprehensive query understanding by combining textual, graph-relational, and web-derived evidence, resulting in a remarkable 12.95% improvement in answer accuracy and a 3.56% boost in question classification accuracy over baseline RAG systems on the ScienceQA and CrisisMMD benchmarks. Notably, HM-RAG establishes state-of-the-art results in zero-shot settings on both datasets. Its modular architecture ensures seamless integration of new data modalities while maintaining strict data governance, marking a significant advancement in addressing the critical challenges of multimodal reasoning and knowledge synthesis in RAG systems.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Span-level emotion-cause-category triplet extraction represents a novel and complex challenge within emotion cause analysis. This task involves identifying emotion spans, cause spans, and their associated emotion categories within the text to form structured triplets. While prior research has predominantly concentrated on clause-level emotion-cause pair extraction and span-level emotion-cause detection, these methods often confront challenges originating from redundant information retrieval and difficulty in accurately determining emotion categories, particularly when emotions are expressed implicitly or ambiguously. To overcome these challenges, this study explores a fine-grained approach to span-level emotion-cause-category triplet extraction and introduces an innovative framework that leverages instruction tuning and data augmentation techniques based on large language models. The proposed method employs task-specific triplet extraction instructions and utilizes low-rank adaptation to fine-tune large language models, eliminating the necessity for intricate task-specific architectures. Furthermore, a prompt-based data augmentation strategy is developed to address data scarcity by guiding large language models in generating high-quality synthetic training data. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms existing baseline methods, achieving at least a 12.8% improvement in span-level emotion-cause-category triplet extraction metrics. The results demonstrate the method's effectiveness and robustness, offering a promising avenue for advancing research in emotion cause analysis. The source code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Users of Large Language Models (LLMs) often perceive these models as intelligent entities with human-like capabilities. However, the extent to which LLMs' capabilities truly approximate human abilities remains a topic of debate. In this paper, to characterize the capabilities of LLMs in relation to human capabilities, we collected performance data from over 80 models across 37 evaluation benchmarks. The evaluation benchmarks are categorized into 6 primary abilities and 11 sub-abilities in human aspect. Then, we then clustered the performance rankings into several categories and compared these clustering results with classifications based on human ability aspects. Our findings lead to the following conclusions: 1. We have confirmed that certain capabilities of LLMs with fewer than 10 billion parameters can indeed be described using human ability metrics; 2. While some abilities are considered interrelated in humans, they appear nearly uncorrelated in LLMs; 3. The capabilities possessed by LLMs vary significantly with the parameter scale of the model.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The evaluation of open-ended responses in serious games presents a unique challenge, as correctness is often subjective. Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being explored as evaluators in such contexts, yet their accuracy and consistency remain uncertain, particularly for smaller models intended for local execution. This study investigates the reliability of five small-scale LLMs when assessing player responses in \textit{En-join}, a game that simulates decision-making within energy communities. By leveraging traditional binary classification metrics (including accuracy, true positive rate, and true negative rate), we systematically compare these models across different evaluation scenarios. Our results highlight the strengths and limitations of each model, revealing trade-offs between sensitivity, specificity, and overall performance. We demonstrate that while some models excel at identifying correct responses, others struggle with false positives or inconsistent evaluations. The findings highlight the need for context-aware evaluation frameworks and careful model selection when deploying LLMs as evaluators. This work contributes to the broader discourse on the trustworthiness of AI-driven assessment tools, offering insights into how different LLM architectures handle subjective evaluation tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) face significant challenges in specialized biomedical tasks due to the inherent complexity of medical reasoning and the sensitive nature of clinical data. Existing LLMs often struggle with intricate medical terminology and the need for accurate clinical insights, leading to performance reduction when quantized for resource-constrained deployment. To address these issues, we propose Quantized Medical Tree of Thought (QM-ToT), a path-based reasoning framework. QM-ToT leverages a Tree of Thought (ToT) reasoning approach to decompose complex medical problems into manageable subtasks, coupled with evaluator assessment layers. This framework facilitates substantial performance improvements in INT4-quantized models on the challenging MedQAUSMLE dataset. Specifically, we demonstrate a remarkable accuracy increase from 34% to 50% for the LLaMA2-70b model and from 58.77% to 69.49% for LLaMA-3.1-8b. Besides, we also proposed an effect data distillation method based on ToT. Compared to the traditional distillation method, we achieved an improvement of 86. 27% while using only 3.9% of the this http URL work, for the first time, showcases the potential of ToT to significantly enhance performance on complex biomedical tasks, establishing a crucial foundation for future advances in deploying high-performing quantized LLM in resource-limited medical settings.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) are often provided as a service via an API, making it challenging for developers to detect changes in their behavior. We present an approach to monitor LLMs for changes by comparing the distributions of linguistic and psycholinguistic features of generated text. Our method uses a statistical test to determine whether the distributions of features from two samples of text are equivalent, allowing developers to identify when an LLM has changed. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using five OpenAI completion models and Meta's Llama 3 70B chat model. Our results show that simple text features coupled with a statistical test can distinguish between language models. We also explore the use of our approach to detect prompt injection attacks. Our work enables frequent LLM change monitoring and avoids computationally expensive benchmark evaluations.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, generative, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The emergence of generative AI chatbots such as ChatGPT has prompted growing public and academic interest in their role as informal mental health support tools. While early rule-based systems have been around for several years, large language models (LLMs) offer new capabilities in conversational fluency, empathy simulation, and availability. This study explores how users engage with LLMs as mental health tools by analyzing over 10,000 TikTok comments from videos referencing LLMs as mental health tools. Using a self-developed tiered coding schema and supervised classification models, we identify user experiences, attitudes, and recurring themes. Results show that nearly 20% of comments reflect personal use, with these users expressing overwhelmingly positive attitudes. Commonly cited benefits include accessibility, emotional support, and perceived therapeutic value. However, concerns around privacy, generic responses, and the lack of professional oversight remain prominent. It is important to note that the user feedback does not indicate which therapeutic framework, if any, the LLM-generated output aligns with. While the findings underscore the growing relevance of AI in everyday practices, they also highlight the urgent need for clinical and ethical scrutiny in the use of AI for mental health support.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>There is a long history of building predictive models in healthcare using tabular data from electronic medical records. However, these models fail to extract the information found in unstructured clinical notes, which document diagnosis, treatment, progress, medications, and care plans. In this study, we investigate how answers generated by GPT-4o-mini (ChatGPT) to simple clinical questions about patients, when given access to the patient's discharge summary, can support patient-level mortality prediction. Using data from 14,011 first-time admissions to the Coronary Care or Cardiovascular Intensive Care Units in the MIMIC-IV Note dataset, we implement a transparent framework that uses GPT responses as input features in logistic regression models. Our findings demonstrate that GPT-based models alone can outperform models trained on standard tabular data, and that combining both sources of information yields even greater predictive power, increasing AUC by an average of 5.1 percentage points and increasing positive predictive value by 29.9 percent for the highest-risk decile. These results highlight the value of integrating large language models (LLMs) into clinical prediction tasks and underscore the broader potential for using LLMs in any domain where unstructured text data remains an underutilized resource.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis through discrete tokenization paradigms, current architectures exhibit fundamental tensions between three critical dimensions: 1) irreversible loss of acoustic characteristics caused by quantization of speech prompts; 2) stringent dependence on precisely aligned prompt speech-text pairs that limit real-world deployment; and 3) catastrophic forgetting of the LLM's native text comprehension during optimization for speech token generation. To address these challenges, we propose an LLM-based text-to-speech Generation approach Optimized via a novel dual-branch ArchiTecture (GOAT-TTS). Our framework introduces two key innovations: (1) The modality-alignment branch combines a speech encoder and projector to capture continuous acoustic embeddings, enabling bidirectional correlation between paralinguistic features (language, timbre, emotion) and semantic text representations without transcript dependency; (2) The speech-generation branch employs modular fine-tuning on top-k layers of an LLM for speech token prediction while freezing the bottom-k layers to preserve foundational linguistic knowledge. Moreover, multi-token prediction is introduced to support real-time streaming TTS synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that our GOAT-TTS achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art TTS models while validating the efficacy of synthesized dialect speech data.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recently, the application of the retrieval-augmented Large Language Models (LLMs) in specific domains has gained significant attention, especially in biopharmaceuticals. However, in this context, there is no benchmark specifically designed for biopharmaceuticals to evaluate LLMs. In this paper, we introduce the Biopharmaceuticals Retrieval-Augmented Generation Evaluation (BRAGE) , the first benchmark tailored for evaluating LLMs' Query and Reference Understanding Capability (QRUC) in the biopharmaceutical domain, available in English, French, German and Chinese. In addition, Traditional Question-Answering (QA) metrics like accuracy and exact match fall short in the open-ended retrieval-augmented QA scenarios. To address this, we propose a citation-based classification method to evaluate the QRUC of LLMs to understand the relationship between queries and references. We apply this method to evaluate the mainstream LLMs on BRAGE. Experimental results show that there is a significant gap in the biopharmaceutical QRUC of mainstream LLMs, and their QRUC needs to be improved.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>defense, attack, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance across myriad language tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where adversaries implant hidden triggers that systematically manipulate model outputs. Traditional defenses focus on explicit token-level anomalies and therefore overlook semantic backdoors-covert triggers embedded at the conceptual level (e.g., ideological stances or cultural references) that rely on meaning-based cues rather than lexical oddities. We first show, in a controlled finetuning setting, that such semantic backdoors can be implanted with only a small poisoned corpus, establishing their practical feasibility. We then formalize the notion of semantic backdoors in LLMs and introduce a black-box detection framework, RAVEN (short for "Response Anomaly Vigilance for uncovering semantic backdoors"), which combines semantic entropy with cross-model consistency analysis. The framework probes multiple models with structured topic-perspective prompts, clusters the sampled responses via bidirectional entailment, and flags anomalously uniform outputs; cross-model comparison isolates model-specific anomalies from corpus-wide biases. Empirical evaluations across diverse LLM families (GPT-4o, Llama, DeepSeek, Mistral) uncover previously undetected semantic backdoors, providing the first proof-of-concept evidence of these hidden vulnerabilities and underscoring the urgent need for concept-level auditing of deployed language models.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Urban causal research is essential for understanding the complex dynamics of cities and informing evidence-based policies. However, it is challenged by the inefficiency and bias of hypothesis generation, barriers to multimodal data complexity, and the methodological fragility of causal experimentation. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) present an opportunity to rethink how urban causal analysis is conducted. This Perspective examines current urban causal research by analyzing taxonomies that categorize research topics, data sources, and methodological approaches to identify structural gaps. We then introduce an LLM-driven conceptual framework, AutoUrbanCI, composed of four distinct modular agents responsible for hypothesis generation, data engineering, experiment design and execution, and results interpretation with policy recommendations. We propose evaluation criteria for rigor and transparency and reflect on implications for human-AI collaboration, equity, and accountability. We call for a new research agenda that embraces AI-augmented workflows not as replacements for human expertise but as tools to broaden participation, improve reproducibility, and unlock more inclusive forms of urban causal reasoning.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) have shown increasing promise in educational settings, yet their mathematical reasoning has been considered evolving. This study evaluates the mathematical capabilities of various LLMs using the Finnish matriculation examination, a high-stakes digital test for upper secondary education. Initial tests yielded moderate performance corresponding to mid-range grades, but later evaluations demonstrated substantial improvements as the language models evolved. Remarkably, some models achieved near-perfect or perfect scores, matching top student performance and qualifying for university admission. Our findings highlight the rapid advances in the mathematical proficiency of LLMs and illustrate their potential to also support educational assessments at scale.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Timing of clinical events is central to characterization of patient trajectories, enabling analyses such as process tracing, forecasting, and causal reasoning. However, structured electronic health records capture few data elements critical to these tasks, while clinical reports lack temporal localization of events in structured form. We present a system that transforms case reports into textual time series-structured pairs of textual events and timestamps. We contrast manual and large language model (LLM) annotations (n=320 and n=390 respectively) of ten randomly-sampled PubMed open-access (PMOA) case reports (N=152,974) and assess inter-LLM agreement (n=3,103; N=93). We find that the LLM models have moderate event recall(O1-preview: 0.80) but high temporal concordance among identified events (O1-preview: 0.95). By establishing the task, annotation, and assessment systems, and by demonstrating high concordance, this work may serve as a benchmark for leveraging the PMOA corpus for temporal analytics.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Drug overdose remains a critical global health issue, often driven by misuse of opioids, painkillers, and psychiatric medications. Traditional research methods face limitations, whereas social media offers real-time insights into self-reported substance use and overdose symptoms. This study proposes an AI-driven NLP framework trained on annotated social media data to detect commonly used drugs and associated overdose symptoms. Using a hybrid annotation strategy with LLMs and human annotators, we applied traditional ML models, neural networks, and advanced transformer-based models. Our framework achieved 98% accuracy in multi-class and 97% in multi-label classification, outperforming baseline models by up to 8%. These findings highlight the potential of AI for supporting public health surveillance and personalized intervention strategies.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Validating Large Language Models with ReLM explores the application of formal languages to evaluate and control Large Language Models (LLMs) for memorization, bias, and zero-shot performance. Current approaches for evaluating these types behavior are often slow, imprecise, costly, or introduce biases of their own, but are necessary due to the importance of this behavior when productionizing LLMs. This project reproduces key results from the original ReLM paper and expounds on the approach and applications with an emphasis on the relevance to the field of systems for machine learning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Mixture-of-Experts based large language models (MoE LLMs) have shown significant promise in multitask adaptability by dynamically routing inputs to specialized experts. Despite their success, the collaborative mechanisms among experts are still not well understood, limiting both the interpretability and optimization of these models. In this paper, we focus on two critical issues: (1) identifying expert collaboration patterns, and (2) optimizing MoE LLMs through expert pruning. To address the first issue, we propose a hierarchical sparse dictionary learning (HSDL) method that uncovers the collaboration patterns among experts. For the second issue, we introduce the Contribution-Aware Expert Pruning (CAEP) algorithm, which effectively prunes low-contribution experts. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that expert collaboration patterns are closely linked to specific input types and exhibit semantic significance across various tasks. Moreover, pruning experiments show that our approach improves overall performance by 2.5\% on average, outperforming existing methods. These findings offer valuable insights into enhancing the efficiency and interpretability of MoE LLMs, offering a clearer understanding of expert interactions and improving model optimization.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Current learning-based subject customization approaches, predominantly relying on U-Net architectures, suffer from limited generalization ability and compromised image quality. Meanwhile, optimization-based methods require subject-specific fine-tuning, which inevitably degrades textual controllability. To address these challenges, we propose InstantCharacter, a scalable framework for character customization built upon a foundation diffusion transformer. InstantCharacter demonstrates three fundamental advantages: first, it achieves open-domain personalization across diverse character appearances, poses, and styles while maintaining high-fidelity results. Second, the framework introduces a scalable adapter with stacked transformer encoders, which effectively processes open-domain character features and seamlessly interacts with the latent space of modern diffusion transformers. Third, to effectively train the framework, we construct a large-scale character dataset containing 10-million-level samples. The dataset is systematically organized into paired (multi-view character) and unpaired (text-image combinations) subsets. This dual-data structure enables simultaneous optimization of identity consistency and textual editability through distinct learning pathways. Qualitative experiments demonstrate the advanced capabilities of InstantCharacter in generating high-fidelity, text-controllable, and character-consistent images, setting a new benchmark for character-driven image generation.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Training a state-of-the-art Large Language Model (LLM) is an increasingly expensive endeavor due to growing computational, hardware, energy, and engineering demands. Yet, an often-overlooked (and seldom paid) expense is the human labor behind these models' training data. Every LLM is built on an unfathomable amount of human effort: trillions of carefully written words sourced from books, academic papers, codebases, social media, and more. This position paper aims to assign a monetary value to this labor and argues that the most expensive part of producing an LLM should be the compensation provided to training data producers for their work. To support this position, we study 64 LLMs released between 2016 and 2024, estimating what it would cost to pay people to produce their training datasets from scratch. Even under highly conservative estimates of wage rates, the costs of these models' training datasets are 10-1000 times larger than the costs to train the models themselves, representing a significant financial liability for LLM providers. In the face of the massive gap between the value of training data and the lack of compensation for its creation, we highlight and discuss research directions that could enable fairer practices in the future.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Existing zero-shot 3D point cloud segmentation methods often struggle with limited transferability from seen classes to unseen classes and from semantic to visual space. To alleviate this, we introduce 3D-PointZshotS, a geometry-aware zero-shot segmentation framework that enhances both feature generation and alignment using latent geometric prototypes (LGPs). Specifically, we integrate LGPs into a generator via a cross-attention mechanism, enriching semantic features with fine-grained geometric details. To further enhance stability and generalization, we introduce a self-consistency loss, which enforces feature robustness against point-wise perturbations. Additionally, we re-represent visual and semantic features in a shared space, bridging the semantic-visual gap and facilitating knowledge transfer to unseen classes. Experiments on three real-world datasets, namely ScanNet, SemanticKITTI, and S3DIS, demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance over four baselines in terms of harmonic mIoU.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>protect, fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In recent years, fairness in machine learning has emerged as a critical concern to ensure that developed and deployed predictive models do not have disadvantageous predictions for marginalized groups. It is essential to mitigate discrimination against individuals based on protected attributes such as gender and race. In this work, we consider applying subgroup justice concepts to gradient-boosting machines designed for supervised learning problems. Our approach expanded gradient-boosting methodologies to explore a broader range of objective functions, which combines conventional losses such as the ones from classification and regression and a min-max fairness term. We study relevant theoretical properties of the solution of the min-max optimization problem. The optimization process explored the primal-dual problems at each boosting round. This generic framework can be adapted to diverse fairness concepts. The proposed min-max primal-dual gradient boosting algorithm was theoretically shown to converge under mild conditions and empirically shown to be a powerful and flexible approach to address binary and subgroup fairness.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Mixture of Experts (MoE) pretraining is more scalable than dense Transformer pretraining, because MoEs learn to route inputs to a sparse set of their feedforward parameters. However, this means that MoEs only receive a sparse backward update, leading to training instability and suboptimal performance. We present a lightweight approximation method that gives the MoE router a dense gradient update while continuing to sparsely activate its parameters. Our method, which we refer to as Default MoE, substitutes missing expert activations with default outputs consisting of an exponential moving average of expert outputs previously seen over the course of training. This allows the router to receive signals from every expert for each token, leading to significant improvements in training performance. Our Default MoE outperforms standard TopK routing in a variety of settings without requiring significant computational overhead. Code: this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The intersection of deep learning and symbolic mathematics has seen rapid progress in recent years, exemplified by the work of Lample and Charton. They demonstrated that effective training of machine learning models for solving mathematical problems critically depends on high-quality, domain-specific datasets. In this paper, we address the computation of Gröbner basis using Transformers. While a dataset generation method tailored to Transformer-based Gröbner basis computation has previously been proposed, it lacked theoretical guarantees regarding the generality or quality of the generated datasets. In this work, we prove that datasets generated by the previously proposed algorithm are sufficiently general, enabling one to ensure that Transformers can learn a sufficiently diverse range of Gröbner bases. Moreover, we propose an extended and generalized algorithm to systematically construct datasets of ideal generators, further enhancing the training effectiveness of Transformer. Our results provide a rigorous geometric foundation for Transformers to address a mathematical problem, which is an answer to Lample and Charton's idea of training on diverse or representative inputs.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In our paper we explore the definition, and extrapolation of fallacies as they pertain to the automatic detection of manipulation on social media. In particular we explore how these logical fallacies might appear in the real world i.e internet forums. We discovered a prevalence of misinformation / misguided intention in discussion boards specifically centered around the Ukrainian Russian Conflict which serves to narrow the domain of our task. Although automatic fallacy detection has gained attention recently, most datasets use unregulated fallacy taxonomies or are limited to formal linguistic domains like political debates or news reports. Online discourse, however, often features non-standardized and diverse language not captured in these domains. We present Shady Linguistic Utterance Replication-Generation (SLURG) to address these limitations, exploring the feasibility of generating synthetic fallacious forum-style comments using large language models (LLMs), specifically DeepHermes-3-Mistral-24B. Our findings indicate that LLMs can replicate the syntactic patterns of real data} and that high-quality few-shot prompts enhance LLMs' ability to mimic the vocabulary diversity of online forums.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) present unique challenges in representation learning by requiring models to capture both the semantic richness of node-associated texts and the structural dependencies of the graph. While graph neural networks (GNNs) excel at modeling topological information, they lack the capacity to process unstructured text. Conversely, large language models (LLMs) are proficient in text understanding but are typically unaware of graph structure. In this work, we propose BiGTex (Bidirectional Graph Text), a novel architecture that tightly integrates GNNs and LLMs through stacked Graph-Text Fusion Units. Each unit allows for mutual attention between textual and structural representations, enabling information to flow in both directions, text influencing structure and structure guiding textual interpretation. The proposed architecture is trained using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA), keeping the LLM frozen while adapting to task-specific signals. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that BiGTex achieves state-of-the-art performance in node classification and generalizes effectively to link prediction. An ablation study further highlights the importance of soft prompting and bi-directional attention in the model's success.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Clinical natural language processing (NLP) is increasingly in demand in both clinical research and operational practice. However, most of the state-of-the-art solutions are transformers-based and require high computational resources, limiting their accessibility. We propose a hybrid NLP framework that integrates rule-based filtering, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, and a BERT-based model to improve efficiency while maintaining accuracy. We applied this framework in a dementia identification case study involving 4.9 million veterans with incident hypertension, analyzing 2.1 billion clinical notes. At the patient level, our method achieved a precision of 0.90, a recall of 0.84, and an F1-score of 0.87. Additionally, this NLP approach identified over three times as many dementia cases as structured data methods. All processing was completed in approximately two weeks using a single machine with dual A40 GPUs. This study demonstrates the feasibility of hybrid NLP solutions for large-scale clinical text analysis, making state-of-the-art methods more accessible to healthcare organizations with limited computational resources.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Contrastive video-language pretraining has demonstrated great success in learning rich and robust video representations. However, deploying such video encoders on compute-constrained edge devices remains challenging due to their high computational demands. Additionally, existing models are typically trained to process only short video clips, often limited to 4 to 64 frames. In this paper, we introduce AdaVid, a flexible architectural framework designed to learn efficient video encoders that can dynamically adapt their computational footprint based on available resources. At the heart of AdaVid is an adaptive transformer block, inspired by Matryoshka Representation Learning, which allows the model to adjust its hidden embedding dimension at inference time. We show that AdaVid-EgoVLP, trained on video-narration pairs from the large-scale Ego4D dataset, matches the performance of the standard EgoVLP on short video-language benchmarks using only half the compute, and even outperforms EgoVLP when given equal computational resources. We further explore the trade-off between frame count and compute on the challenging Diving48 classification benchmark, showing that AdaVid enables the use of more frames without exceeding computational limits. To handle longer videos, we also propose a lightweight hierarchical network that aggregates short clip features, achieving a strong balance between compute efficiency and accuracy across several long video benchmarks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent work suggests that preference-tuning techniques--including Reinforcement Learning from Human Preferences (RLHF) methods like PPO and GRPO, as well as alternatives like DPO--reduce diversity, creating a dilemma given that such models are widely deployed in applications requiring diverse outputs. To address this, we introduce a framework for measuring effective semantic diversity--diversity among outputs that meet quality thresholds--which better reflects the practical utility of large language models (LLMs). Using open-ended tasks that require no human intervention, we find counterintuitive results: although preference-tuned models--especially those trained via RL--exhibit reduced lexical and syntactic diversity, they produce greater effective semantic diversity than SFT or base models, not from increasing diversity among high-quality outputs, but from generating more high-quality outputs overall. We discover that preference tuning reduces syntactic diversity while preserving semantic diversity--revealing a distinction between diversity in form and diversity in content that traditional metrics often overlook. Our analysis further shows that smaller models are consistently more parameter-efficient at generating unique content within a fixed sampling budget, offering insights into the relationship between model scaling and diversity. These findings have important implications for applications that require diverse yet high-quality outputs, from creative assistance to synthetic data generation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) encode vast amounts of pre-trained knowledge in their parameters, but updating them as real-world information evolves remains a challenge. Existing methodologies and benchmarks primarily target entity substitutions, failing to capture the full breadth of complex real-world dynamics. In this paper, we introduce Knowledge Update Playground (KUP), an automatic pipeline for simulating realistic knowledge updates reflected in an evidence corpora. KUP's evaluation framework includes direct and indirect probes to both test memorization of updated facts and reasoning over them, for any update learning methods. Next, we present a lightweight method called memory conditioned training (MCT), which conditions tokens in the update corpus on self-generated "memory" tokens during training. Our strategy encourages LLMs to surface and reason over newly memorized knowledge at inference. Our results on two strong LLMs show that (1) KUP benchmark is highly challenging, with the best CPT models achieving $<2\%$ in indirect probing setting (reasoning) and (2) MCT training significantly outperforms prior continued pre-training (CPT) baselines, improving direct probing (memorization) results by up to $25.4\%$.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>How diffusion models generalize beyond their training set is not known, and is somewhat mysterious given two facts: the optimum of the denoising score matching (DSM) objective usually used to train diffusion models is the score function of the training distribution; and the networks usually used to learn the score function are expressive enough to learn this score to high accuracy. We claim that a certain feature of the DSM objective -- the fact that its target is not the training distribution's score, but a noisy quantity only equal to it in expectation -- strongly impacts whether and to what extent diffusion models generalize. In this paper, we develop a mathematical theory that partly explains this 'generalization through variance' phenomenon. Our theoretical analysis exploits a physics-inspired path integral approach to compute the distributions typically learned by a few paradigmatic under- and overparameterized diffusion models. We find that the distributions diffusion models effectively learn to sample from resemble their training distributions, but with 'gaps' filled in, and that this inductive bias is due to the covariance structure of the noisy target used during training. We also characterize how this inductive bias interacts with feature-related inductive biases.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Timely and accurate detection of hurricane debris is critical for effective disaster response and community resilience. While post-disaster aerial imagery is readily available, robust debris segmentation solutions applicable across multiple disaster regions remain limited. Developing a generalized solution is challenging due to varying environmental and imaging conditions that alter debris' visual signatures across different regions, further compounded by the scarcity of training data. This study addresses these challenges by fine-tuning pre-trained foundational vision models, achieving robust performance with a relatively small, high-quality dataset. Specifically, this work introduces an open-source dataset comprising approximately 1,200 manually annotated aerial RGB images from Hurricanes Ian, Ida, and Ike. To mitigate human biases and enhance data quality, labels from multiple annotators are strategically aggregated and visual prompt engineering is employed. The resulting fine-tuned model, named fCLIPSeg, achieves a Dice score of 0.70 on data from Hurricane Ida -- a disaster event entirely excluded during training -- with virtually no false positives in debris-free areas. This work presents the first event-agnostic debris segmentation model requiring only standard RGB imagery during deployment, making it well-suited for rapid, large-scale post-disaster impact assessments and recovery planning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>To what extent can entire books be extracted from LLMs? Using the Llama 3 70B family of models, and the "prefix-prompting" extraction technique, we were able to auto-regressively reconstruct, with a very high level of similarity, one entire book (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland) from just the first 500 tokens. We were also able to obtain high extraction rates on several other books, piece-wise. However, these successes do not extend uniformly to all books. We show that extraction rates of books correlate with book popularity and thus, likely duplication in the training data. We also confirm the undoing of mitigations in the instruction-tuned Llama 3.1, following recent work (Nasr et al., 2025). We further find that this undoing comes from changes to only a tiny fraction of weights concentrated primarily in the lower transformer blocks. Our results provide evidence of the limits of current regurgitation mitigation strategies and introduce a framework for studying how fine-tuning affects the retrieval of verbatim memorization in aligned LLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Purpose: The operating room (OR) is a complex environment where optimizing workflows is critical to reduce costs and improve patient outcomes. The use of computer vision approaches for the automatic recognition of perioperative events enables identification of bottlenecks for OR optimization. However, privacy concerns limit the use of computer vision for automated event detection from OR videos, which makes privacy-preserving approaches needed for OR workflow analysis. Methods: We propose a two-stage pipeline for privacy-preserving OR video analysis and event detection. In the first stage, we leverage vision foundation models for depth estimation and semantic segmentation to generate de-identified Digital Twins (DT) of the OR from conventional RGB videos. In the second stage, we employ the SafeOR model, a fused two-stream approach that processes segmentation masks and depth maps for OR event detection. We evaluate this method on an internal dataset of 38 simulated surgical trials with five event classes. Results: Our results indicate that this DT-based approach to the OR event detection model achieves performance on par and sometimes even better than raw RGB video-based models on detecting OR events. Conclusion: DTs enable privacy-preserving OR workflow analysis, facilitating the sharing of de-identified data across institutions and they can potentially enhance model generalizability by mitigating domain-specific appearance differences.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation framework for aligning Persian Large Language Models (LLMs) with critical ethical dimensions, including safety, fairness, and social norms. It addresses the gaps in existing LLM evaluation frameworks by adapting them to Persian linguistic and cultural contexts. This benchmark creates three types of Persian-language benchmarks: (i) translated data, (ii) new data generated synthetically, and (iii) new naturally collected data. We translate Anthropic Red Teaming data, AdvBench, HarmBench, and DecodingTrust into Persian. Furthermore, we create ProhibiBench-fa, SafeBench-fa, FairBench-fa, and SocialBench-fa as new datasets to address harmful and prohibited content in indigenous culture. Moreover, we collect extensive dataset as GuardBench-fa to consider Persian cultural norms. By combining these datasets, our work establishes a unified framework for evaluating Persian LLMs, offering a new approach to culturally grounded alignment evaluation. A systematic evaluation of Persian LLMs is performed across the three alignment aspects: safety (avoiding harmful content), fairness (mitigating biases), and social norms (adhering to culturally accepted behaviors). We present a publicly available leaderboard that benchmarks Persian LLMs with respect to safety, fairness, and social norms at: this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The elliptical shape prior information plays a vital role in improving the accuracy of image segmentation for specific tasks in medical and natural images. Existing deep learning-based segmentation methods, including the Segment Anything Model (SAM), often struggle to produce segmentation results with elliptical shapes efficiently. This paper proposes a new approach to integrate the prior of elliptical shapes into the deep learning-based SAM image segmentation techniques using variational methods. The proposed method establishes a parameterized elliptical contour field, which constrains the segmentation results to align with predefined elliptical contours. Utilizing the dual algorithm, the model seamlessly integrates image features with elliptical priors and spatial regularization priors, thereby greatly enhancing segmentation accuracy. By decomposing SAM into four mathematical sub-problems, we integrate the variational ellipse prior to design a new SAM network structure, ensuring that the segmentation output of SAM consists of elliptical regions. Experimental results on some specific image datasets demonstrate an improvement over the original SAM.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>explainability, generative, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly enhanced large language models (LLMs) in knowledge-intensive tasks by incorporating external knowledge retrieval. However, existing RAG frameworks primarily rely on semantic similarity and correlation-driven retrieval, limiting their ability to distinguish true causal relationships from spurious associations. This results in responses that may be factually grounded but fail to establish cause-and-effect mechanisms, leading to incomplete or misleading insights. To address this issue, we introduce Causal Dynamic Feedback for Adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (CDF-RAG), a framework designed to improve causal consistency, factual accuracy, and explainability in generative reasoning. CDF-RAG iteratively refines queries, retrieves structured causal graphs, and enables multi-hop causal reasoning across interconnected knowledge sources. Additionally, it validates responses against causal pathways, ensuring logically coherent and factually grounded outputs. We evaluate CDF-RAG on four diverse datasets, demonstrating its ability to improve response accuracy and causal correctness over existing RAG-based methods.

We show KRR achieves comparably high storage capacity (reaching ratio 1.5 shown) and noise robustness (recalling from around 80% corrupted patterns) as KLR, while drastically reducing training time, establishing KRR as an efficient method for building high-performance associative memories.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Open-Set Semi-Supervised Learning (OSSL) tackles the practical challenge of learning from unlabeled data that may include both in-distribution (ID) and unknown out-of-distribution (OOD) classes. However, existing OSSL methods form suboptimal feature spaces by either excluding OOD samples, interfering with them, or overtrusting their information during training. In this work, we introduce MagMatch, a novel framework that naturally isolates OOD samples through a prototype-based contrastive learning paradigm. Unlike conventional methods, MagMatch does not assign any prototypes to OOD samples; instead, it selectively aligns ID samples with class prototypes using an ID-Selective Magnetic (ISM) module, while allowing OOD samples - the "others" - to remain unaligned in the feature space. To support this process, we propose Selective Magnetic Alignment (SMA) loss for unlabeled data, which dynamically adjusts alignment based on sample confidence. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate that MagMatch significantly outperforms existing methods in both closed-set classification accuracy and OOD detection AUROC, especially in generalizing to unseen OOD data.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Labeling has always been expensive in the medical context, which has hindered related deep learning application. Our work introduces active learning in surgical video frame selection to construct a high-quality, affordable Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy dataset for semantic segmentation. Active learning allows the Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) learning pipeline to include the dataset construction workflow, which means DNNs trained by existing dataset will identify the most informative data from the newly collected data. At the same time, DNNs' performance and generalization ability improve over time when the newly selected and annotated data are included in the training data. We assessed different data informativeness measurements and found the deep features distances select the most informative data in this task. Our experiments show that with half of the data selected by active learning, the DNNs achieve almost the same performance with 0.4349 mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) compared to the same DNNs trained on the full dataset (0.4374 mIoU) on the critical anatomies and surgical instruments.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, diffusion, generative, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The widespread adoption of diffusion models in image generation has increased the demand for privacy-compliant unlearning. However, due to the high-dimensional nature and complex feature representations of diffusion models, achieving selective unlearning remains challenging, as existing methods struggle to remove sensitive information while preserving the consistency of non-sensitive regions. To address this, we propose an Automatic Dataset Creation Framework based on prompt-based layered editing and training-free local feature removal, constructing the ForgetMe dataset and introducing the Entangled evaluation metric. The Entangled metric quantifies unlearning effectiveness by assessing the similarity and consistency between the target and background regions and supports both paired (Entangled-D) and unpaired (Entangled-S) image data, enabling unsupervised evaluation. The ForgetMe dataset encompasses a diverse set of real and synthetic scenarios, including CUB-200-2011 (Birds), Stanford-Dogs, ImageNet, and a synthetic cat dataset. We apply LoRA fine-tuning on Stable Diffusion to achieve selective unlearning on this dataset and validate the effectiveness of both the ForgetMe dataset and the Entangled metric, establishing them as benchmarks for selective unlearning. Our work provides a scalable and adaptable solution for advancing privacy-preserving generative AI.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Event cameras have attracted increasing attention in recent years due to their advantages in high dynamic range, high temporal resolution, low power consumption, and low latency. Some researchers have begun exploring pre-training directly on event data. Nevertheless, these efforts often fail to establish strong connections with RGB frames, limiting their applicability in multi-modal fusion scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a novel CM3AE pre-training framework for the RGB-Event perception. This framework accepts multi-modalities/views of data as input, including RGB images, event images, and event voxels, providing robust support for both event-based and RGB-event fusion based downstream tasks. Specifically, we design a multi-modal fusion reconstruction module that reconstructs the original image from fused multi-modal features, explicitly enhancing the model's ability to aggregate cross-modal complementary information. Additionally, we employ a multi-modal contrastive learning strategy to align cross-modal feature representations in a shared latent space, which effectively enhances the model's capability for multi-modal understanding and capturing global dependencies. We construct a large-scale dataset containing 2,535,759 RGB-Event data pairs for the pre-training. Extensive experiments on five downstream tasks fully demonstrated the effectiveness of CM3AE.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training of deep learning models without requiring data to leave local clients, thereby preserving client privacy. The aggregation process on the server plays a critical role in the performance of the resulting FL model. The most commonly used aggregation method is weighted averaging based on the amount of data from each client, which is thought to reflect each client's contribution. However, this method is prone to model bias, as dishonest clients might report inaccurate training data volumes to the server, which is hard to verify. To address this issue, we propose a novel secure \underline{Fed}erated \underline{D}ata q\underline{u}antity-\underline{a}ware weighted averaging method (FedDua). It enables FL servers to accurately predict the amount of training data from each client based on their local model gradients uploaded. Furthermore, it can be seamlessly integrated into any FL algorithms that involve server-side model aggregation. Extensive experiments on three benchmarking datasets demonstrate that FedDua improves the global model performance by an average of 3.17% compared to four popular FL aggregation methods in the presence of inaccurate client data volume declarations.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, security, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The security of private communication is increasingly at risk due to widespread surveillance. Steganography, a technique for embedding secret messages within innocuous carriers, enables covert communication over monitored channels. Provably Secure Steganography (PSS) is state of the art for making stego carriers indistinguishable from normal ones by ensuring computational indistinguishability between stego and cover distributions. However, current PSS methods often require explicit access to the distribution of generative model for both sender and receiver, limiting their practicality in black box scenarios. In this paper, we propose a provably secure steganography scheme that does not require access to explicit model distributions for both sender and receiver. Our method incorporates a dynamic sampling strategy, enabling generative models to embed secret messages within multiple sampling choices without disrupting the normal generation process of the model. Extensive evaluations of three real world datasets and three LLMs demonstrate that our blackbox method is comparable with existing white-box steganography methods in terms of efficiency and capacity while eliminating the degradation of steganography in model generated outputs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Efficient chemical kinetic model inference and application for combustion problems is challenging due to large ODE systems and wideley separated time scales. Machine learning techniques have been proposed to streamline these models, though strong nonlinearity and numerical stiffness combined with noisy data sources makes their application challenging. The recently developed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) and KAN ordinary differential equations (KAN-ODEs) have been demonstrated as powerful tools for scientific applications thanks to their rapid neural scaling, improved interpretability, and smooth activation functions. Here, we develop ChemKANs by augmenting the KAN-ODE framework with physical knowledge of the flow of information through the relevant kinetic and thermodynamic laws, as well as an elemental conservation loss term. This novel framework encodes strong inductive bias that enables streamlined training and higher accuracy predictions, while facilitating parameter sparsity through full sharing of information across all inputs and outputs. In a model inference investigation, we find that ChemKANs exhibit no overfitting or model degradation when tasked with extracting predictive models from data that is both sparse and noisy, a task that a standard DeepONet struggles to accomplish. Next, we find that a remarkably parameter-lean ChemKAN (only 344 parameters) can accurately represent hydrogen combustion chemistry, providing a 2x acceleration over the detailed chemistry in a solver that is generalizable to larger-scale turbulent flow simulations. These demonstrations indicate potential for ChemKANs in combustion physics and chemical kinetics, and demonstrate the scalability of generic KAN-ODEs in significantly larger and more numerically challenging problems than previously studied.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) sometimes fail to respond appropriately to deterministic tasks -- such as counting or forming acronyms -- because the implicit prior distribution they have learned over sequences of tokens influences their responses. In this work, we show that, in at least some cases, LLMs actually compute the information needed to perform these tasks correctly, and we identify some interventions that can allow them to access this information to improve their performance. First, we show that simply prompting the language model to not rely on its prior knowledge leads to dramatic improvements in prior-dominated tasks. We then use mechanistic interpretability techniques to localize the prior within the LLM and manipulate the extent to which that prior influences its responses. Specifically, we show that it is possible to identify layers of the underlying neural network that correlate with the prior probability of a response and that lightweight finetuning of these layers with basic prompts on prior-dominated tasks achieves high performance on held-out answers. These results suggest that the information required to produce a correct response is contained within the representations of the problems formed by the models. Furthermore, we show that this finetuning is significantly more effective for prior-dominated tasks, and that the error after finetuning is no longer correlated with the prior. Our results suggest that it may be possible to define effective methods for manipulating the extent to which LLMs rely upon their priors in solving problems, potentially increasing their performance in settings where LLMs hallucinate for reasons related to the prior probability of token sequences.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>protect, fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Discrimination-aware classification aims to make accurate predictions while satisfying fairness constraints. Traditional decision tree learners typically optimize for information gain in the target attribute alone, which can result in models that unfairly discriminate against protected social groups (e.g., gender, ethnicity). Motivated by these shortcomings, we propose GroupCART, a tree-based ensemble optimizer that avoids bias during model construction by optimizing not only for decreased entropy in the target attribute but also for increased entropy in protected attributes. Our experiments show that GroupCART achieves fairer models without data transformation and with minimal performance degradation. Furthermore, the method supports customizable weighting, offering a smooth and flexible trade-off between predictive performance and fairness based on user requirements. These results demonstrate that algorithmic bias in decision tree models can be mitigated through multi-task, fairness-aware learning.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Transformers have attained outstanding performance across various modalities, employing scaled-dot-product (SDP) attention mechanisms. Researchers have attempted to migrate Transformers to graph learning, but most advanced Graph Transformers are designed with major architectural differences, either integrating message-passing or incorporating sophisticated attention mechanisms. These complexities prevent the easy adoption of Transformer training advances. We propose three simple modifications to the plain Transformer to render it applicable to graphs without introducing major architectural distortions. Specifically, we advocate for the use of (1) simplified $L_2$ attention to measure the magnitude closeness of tokens; (2) adaptive root-mean-square normalization to preserve token magnitude information; and (3) a relative positional encoding bias with a shared encoder. Significant performance gains across a variety of graph datasets justify the effectiveness of our proposed modifications. Furthermore, empirical evaluation on the expressiveness benchmark reveals noteworthy realized expressiveness in the graph isomorphism.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Geometry problem-solving (GPS), a challenging task requiring both visual comprehension and symbolic reasoning, effectively measures the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Humans exhibit strong reasoning ability in this task through accurate identification and adaptive application of geometric principles within visual contexts. However, existing benchmarks fail to jointly assess both dimensions of the human-like geometric reasoning mechanism in MLLMs, remaining a critical gap in assessing their ability to tackle GPS. To this end, we introduce GeoSense, the first comprehensive bilingual benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the geometric reasoning abilities of MLLMs through the lens of geometric principles. GeoSense features a five-level hierarchical framework of geometric principles spanning plane and solid geometry, an intricately annotated dataset of 1,789 problems, and an innovative evaluation strategy. Through extensive experiments on GeoSense with various open-source and closed-source MLLMs, we observe that Gemini-2.0-pro-flash performs best, achieving an overall score of $65.3$. Our in-depth analysis reveals that the identification and application of geometric principles remain a bottleneck for leading MLLMs, jointly hindering their reasoning abilities. These findings underscore GeoSense's potential to guide future advancements in MLLMs' geometric reasoning capabilities, paving the way for more robust and human-like reasoning in artificial intelligence.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, extraction, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>3D Referring Expression Segmentation (3D-RES) typically requires extensive instance-level annotations, which are time-consuming and costly. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) mitigates this by using limited labeled data alongside abundant unlabeled data, improving performance while reducing annotation costs. SSL uses a teacher-student paradigm where teacher generates high-confidence-filtered pseudo-labels to guide student. However, in the context of 3D-RES, where each label corresponds to a single mask and labeled data is scarce, existing SSL methods treat high-quality pseudo-labels merely as auxiliary supervision, which limits the model's learning potential. The reliance on high-confidence thresholds for filtering often results in potentially valuable pseudo-labels being discarded, restricting the model's ability to leverage the abundant unlabeled data. Therefore, we identify two critical challenges in semi-supervised 3D-RES, namely, inefficient utilization of high-quality pseudo-labels and wastage of useful information from low-quality pseudo-labels. In this paper, we introduce the first semi-supervised learning framework for 3D-RES, presenting a robust baseline method named 3DResT. To address these challenges, we propose two novel designs called Teacher-Student Consistency-Based Sampling (TSCS) and Quality-Driven Dynamic Weighting (QDW). TSCS aids in the selection of high-quality pseudo-labels, integrating them into the labeled dataset to strengthen the labeled supervision signals. QDW preserves low-quality pseudo-labels by dynamically assigning them lower weights, allowing for the effective extraction of useful information rather than discarding them. Extensive experiments conducted on the widely used benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Notably, with only 1% labeled data, 3DResT achieves an mIoU improvement of 8.34 points compared to the fully supervised method.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Restoring images afflicted by complex real-world degradations remains challenging, as conventional methods often fail to adapt to the unique mixture and severity of artifacts present. This stems from a reliance on indirect cues which poorly capture the true perceptual quality deficit. To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce AdaQual-Diff, a diffusion-based framework that integrates perceptual quality assessment directly into the generative restoration process. Our approach establishes a mathematical relationship between regional quality scores from DeQAScore and optimal guidance complexity, implemented through an Adaptive Quality Prompting mechanism. This mechanism systematically modulates prompt structure according to measured degradation severity: regions with lower perceptual quality receive computationally intensive, structurally complex prompts with precise restoration directives, while higher quality regions receive minimal prompts focused on preservation rather than intervention. The technical core of our method lies in the dynamic allocation of computational resources proportional to degradation severity, creating a spatially-varying guidance field that directs the diffusion process with mathematical precision. By combining this quality-guided approach with content-specific conditioning, our framework achieves fine-grained control over regional restoration intensity without requiring additional parameters or inference iterations. Experimental results demonstrate that AdaQual-Diff achieves visually superior restorations across diverse synthetic and real-world datasets.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we introduce a novel method named Robo-SGG, i.e., Layout-Oriented Normalization and Restitution for Robust Scene Graph Generation. Compared to the existing SGG setting, the robust scene graph generation aims to perform inference on a diverse range of corrupted images, with the core challenge being the domain shift between the clean and corrupted images. Existing SGG methods suffer from degraded performance due to compromised visual features e.g., corruption interference or occlusions. To obtain robust visual features, we exploit the layout information, which is domain-invariant, to enhance the efficacy of existing SGG methods on corrupted images. Specifically, we employ Instance Normalization(IN) to filter out the domain-specific feature and recover the unchangeable structural features, i.e., the positional and semantic relationships among objects by the proposed Layout-Oriented Restitution. Additionally, we propose a Layout-Embedded Encoder (LEE) that augments the existing object and predicate encoders within the SGG framework, enriching the robust positional and semantic features of objects and predicates. Note that our proposed Robo-SGG module is designed as a plug-and-play component, which can be easily integrated into any baseline SGG model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that by integrating the state-of-the-art method into our proposed Robo-SGG, we achieve relative improvements of 5.6%, 8.0%, and 6.5% in mR@50 for PredCls, SGCls, and SGDet tasks on the VG-C dataset, respectively, and achieve new state-of-the-art performance in corruption scene graph generation benchmark (VG-C and GQA-C). We will release our source code and model.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Building change detection remains challenging for urban development, disaster assessment, and military reconnaissance. While foundation models like Segment Anything Model (SAM) show strong segmentation capabilities, SAM is limited in the task of building change detection due to domain gap issues. Existing adapter-based fine-tuning approaches face challenges with imbalanced building distribution, resulting in poor detection of subtle changes and inaccurate edge extraction. Additionally, bi-temporal misalignment in change detection, typically addressed by optical flow, remains vulnerable to background noises. This affects the detection of building changes and compromises both detection accuracy and edge recognition. To tackle these challenges, we propose a new SAM-Based Network with Distribution-Aware Fourier Adaptation and Edge-Constrained Warping (FAEWNet) for building change detection. FAEWNet utilizes the SAM encoder to extract rich visual features from remote sensing images. To guide SAM in focusing on specific ground objects in remote sensing scenes, we propose a Distribution-Aware Fourier Aggregated Adapter to aggregate task-oriented changed information. This adapter not only effectively addresses the domain gap issue, but also pays attention to the distribution of changed buildings. Furthermore, to mitigate noise interference and misalignment in height offset estimation, we design a novel flow module that refines building edge extraction and enhances the perception of changed buildings. Our state-of-the-art results on the LEVIR-CD, S2Looking and WHU-CD datasets highlight the effectiveness of FAEWNet. The code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we present the demonstration of training a four-layer neural network entirely using fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), supporting both single-output and multi-output classification tasks in a non-interactive setting. A key contribution of our work is identifying that replacing \textit{Softmax} with \textit{Sigmoid}, in conjunction with the Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss function, provides an effective and scalable solution for homomorphic classification. Moreover, we show that the BCE loss function, originally designed for multi-output tasks, naturally extends to the multi-class setting, thereby enabling broader applicability. We also highlight the limitations of prior loss functions such as the SLE loss and the one proposed in the 2019 CVPR Workshop, both of which suffer from vanishing gradients as network depth increases. To address the challenges posed by large-scale encrypted data, we further introduce an improved version of the previously proposed data encoding scheme, \textit{Double Volley Revolver}, which achieves a better trade-off between computational and memory efficiency, making FHE-based neural network training more practical.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present a neural network structure, FramePack, to train next-frame (or next-frame-section) prediction models for video generation. The FramePack compresses input frames to make the transformer context length a fixed number regardless of the video length. As a result, we are able to process a large number of frames using video diffusion with computation bottleneck similar to image diffusion. This also makes the training video batch sizes significantly higher (batch sizes become comparable to image diffusion training). We also propose an anti-drifting sampling method that generates frames in inverted temporal order with early-established endpoints to avoid exposure bias (error accumulation over iterations). Finally, we show that existing video diffusion models can be finetuned with FramePack, and their visual quality may be improved because the next-frame prediction supports more balanced diffusion schedulers with less extreme flow shift timesteps.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Machine-learned potentials (MLPs) have revolutionized materials discovery by providing accurate and efficient predictions of molecular and material properties. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a state-of-the-art approach due to their ability to capture complex atomic interactions. However, GNNs often produce unreliable predictions when encountering out-of-domain data and it is difficult to identify when that happens. To address this challenge, we explore Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) techniques, focusing on Direct Propagation of Shallow Ensembles (DPOSE) as a computationally efficient alternative to deep ensembles. By integrating DPOSE into the SchNet model, we assess its ability to provide reliable uncertainty estimates across diverse Density Functional Theory datasets, including QM9, OC20, and Gold Molecular Dynamics. Our findings often demonstrate that DPOSE successfully distinguishes between in-domain and out-of-domain samples, exhibiting higher uncertainty for unobserved molecule and material classes. This work highlights the potential of lightweight UQ methods in improving the robustness of GNN-based materials modeling and lays the foundation for future integration with active learning strategies.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) not only have solved complex reasoning problems but also exhibit remarkable performance in tasks that require subjective decision making. Existing studies suggest that LLM generations can be subjectively grounded to some extent, yet exploring whether LLMs can account for individual-level subjectivity has not been sufficiently studied. In this paper, we characterize subjectivity of individuals on social media and infer their moral judgments using LLMs. We propose a framework, SOLAR (Subjective Ground with Value Abstraction), that observes value conflicts and trade-offs in the user-generated texts to better represent subjective ground of individuals. Empirical results show that our framework improves overall inference results as well as performance on controversial situations. Additionally, we qualitatively show that SOLAR provides explanations about individuals' value preferences, which can further account for their judgments.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with long-context reasoning, not only due to the quadratic scaling of computational complexity with sequence length but also because of the scarcity and expense of annotating long-context data. There has been barely any open-source work that systematically ablates long-context data, nor is there any openly available instruction tuning dataset with contexts surpassing 100K tokens. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel post-training synthetic data generation strategy designed to efficiently extend the context window of LLMs while preserving their general task performance. Our approach scalably extends to arbitrarily long context lengths, unconstrained by the length of available real-world data, which effectively addresses the scarcity of raw long-context data. Through a step-by-step rotary position embedding (RoPE) scaling training strategy, we demonstrate that our model, with a context length of up to 1M tokens, performs well on the RULER benchmark and InfiniteBench and maintains robust performance on general language tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep learning (DL)-based image classification models are essential for autonomous vehicle (AV) perception modules since incorrect categorization might have severe repercussions. Adversarial attacks are widely studied cyberattacks that can lead DL models to predict inaccurate output, such as incorrectly classified traffic signs by the perception module of an autonomous vehicle. In this study, we create and compare hybrid classical-quantum deep learning (HCQ-DL) models with classical deep learning (C-DL) models to demonstrate robustness against adversarial attacks for perception modules. Before feeding them into the quantum system, we used transfer learning models, alexnet and vgg-16, as feature extractors. We tested over 1000 quantum circuits in our HCQ-DL models for projected gradient descent (PGD), fast gradient sign attack (FGSA), and gradient attack (GA), which are three well-known untargeted adversarial approaches. We evaluated the performance of all models during adversarial attacks and no-attack scenarios. Our HCQ-DL models maintain accuracy above 95\% during a no-attack scenario and above 91\% for GA and FGSA attacks, which is higher than C-DL models. During the PGD attack, our alexnet-based HCQ-DL model maintained an accuracy of 85\% compared to C-DL models that achieved accuracies below 21\%. Our results highlight that the HCQ-DL models provide improved accuracy for traffic sign classification under adversarial settings compared to their classical counterparts.</li>

By leveraging enhanced residual units, depth-wise separable convolutions, and hierarchical skip connections, AdaptoVision significantly reduces parameter count and computational requirements while preserving competitive performance across various benchmark and medical image datasets. Extensive experimentation demonstrates that AdaptoVision achieves state-of-the-art on BreakHis dataset and comparable accuracy levels, notably 95.3\% on CIFAR-10 and 85.77\% on CIFAR-100, without relying on any pretrained weights. The model's streamlined architecture and strategic simplifications promote effective feature extraction and robust generalization, making it particularly suitable for deployment in real-time and resource-constrained environments.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Aligning language models with human preferences presents significant challenges, particularly in achieving personalization without incurring excessive computational costs. Existing methods rely on reward signals and additional annotated data, limiting their scalability and adaptability to diverse human values. To address these challenges, we introduce Persona-judge, a novel discriminative paradigm that enables training-free personalized alignment with unseen preferences. Instead of optimizing policy parameters through external reward feedback, Persona-judge leverages the intrinsic preference judgment capabilities of the model. Specifically, a draft model generates candidate tokens conditioned on a given preference, while a judge model, embodying another preference, cross-validates the predicted tokens whether to be accepted. Experimental results demonstrate that Persona-judge, using the inherent preference evaluation mechanisms of the model, offers a scalable and computationally efficient solution to personalized alignment, paving the way for more adaptive customized alignment.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Abstractive compression utilizes smaller langauge models to condense query-relevant context, reducing computational costs in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However,retrieved documents often include information that is either irrelevant to answering the query or misleading due to factual incorrect content, despite having high relevance scores. This behavior indicates that abstractive compressors are more likely to omit important information essential for the correct answer, especially in long contexts where attention dispersion occurs. To address this issue, we categorize retrieved documents in a more fine-grained manner and propose Abstractive Compression Robust against Noise (ACoRN), which introduces two novel training steps. First, we use offline data augmentation on the training dataset to enhance compressor robustness against two distinct types of retrieval noise. Second, since the language modelbased compressor cannot fully utilize information from multiple retrieved documents and exhibits positional bias, we perform finetuning to generate summaries centered around key information that directly supports the correct answer. Our experiments demonstrate that T5-large, trained with ACoRN as a compressor, improves EM and F1 scores while preserving the answer string, which could serve as direct evidence. ACoRN excels on datasets with many accuracy-reducing documents, making it highly useful in real-world scenarios.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on extensive datasets often learn sensitive information, which raises significant social and legal concerns under principles such as the "Right to be forgotten." Retraining entire models from scratch to remove undesired information is both costly and impractical. Furthermore, existing single-domain unlearning methods fail to address multi-domain scenarios, where knowledge is interwoven across domains such as privacy and copyright, creating overlapping representations that lead to excessive knowledge removal or degraded performance. To tackle these issues, we propose GRAIL (GRadient-based AdaptIve unLearning), a novel multi-domain unlearning framework. GRAIL leverages gradient information from multiple domains to precisely distinguish the unlearning scope from the retention scope, and applies an adaptive parameter-wise localization strategy to selectively remove targeted knowledge while preserving critical parameters for each domain. Experimental results on unlearning benchmarks show that GRAIL achieves unlearning success on par with the existing approaches, while also demonstrating up to 17% stronger knowledge retention success compared to the previous state-of-art method. Our findings establish a new paradigm for effectively managing and regulating sensitive information in large-scale pre-trained language models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in code generation tasks. However, there remains a performance gap between open-source and closed-source models. To address this gap, existing approaches typically generate large amounts of synthetic data for fine-tuning, which often leads to inefficient training. In this work, we propose a data selection strategy in order to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of training for code-based LLMs. By prioritizing data complexity and ensuring that the sampled subset aligns with the distribution of the original dataset, our sampling strategy effectively selects high-quality data. Additionally, we optimize the tokenization process through a "dynamic pack" technique, which minimizes padding tokens and reduces computational resource consumption. Experimental results show that when training on 40% of the OSS-Instruct dataset, the DeepSeek-Coder-Base-6.7B model achieves an average performance of 66.9%, surpassing the 66.1% performance with the full dataset. Moreover, training time is reduced from 47 minutes to 34 minutes, and the peak GPU memory decreases from 61.47 GB to 42.72 GB during a single epoch. Similar improvements are observed with the CodeLlama-Python-7B model on the Evol-Instruct dataset. By optimizing both data selection and tokenization, our approach not only improves model performance but also improves training efficiency.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, transformer, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) frequently generate hallucinations-content that deviates from factual accuracy or provided context-posing challenges for diagnosis due to the complex interplay of underlying causes. This paper introduces a subsequence association framework to systematically trace and understand hallucinations. Our key insight is that hallucinations arise when dominant hallucinatory associations outweigh faithful ones. Through theoretical and empirical analyses, we demonstrate that decoder-only transformers effectively function as subsequence embedding models, with linear layers encoding input-output associations. We propose a tracing algorithm that identifies causal subsequences by analyzing hallucination probabilities across randomized input contexts. Experiments show our method outperforms standard attribution techniques in identifying hallucination causes and aligns with evidence from the model's training corpus. This work provides a unified perspective on hallucinations and a robust framework for their tracing and analysis.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Collaborative perception has attracted growing interest from academia and industry due to its potential to enhance perception accuracy, safety, and robustness in autonomous driving through multi-agent information fusion. With the advancement of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication, numerous collaborative perception datasets have emerged, varying in cooperation paradigms, sensor configurations, data sources, and application scenarios. However, the absence of systematic summarization and comparative analysis hinders effective resource utilization and standardization of model evaluation. As the first comprehensive review focused on collaborative perception datasets, this work reviews and compares existing resources from a multi-dimensional perspective. We categorize datasets based on cooperation paradigms, examine their data sources and scenarios, and analyze sensor modalities and supported tasks. A detailed comparative analysis is conducted across multiple dimensions. We also outline key challenges and future directions, including dataset scalability, diversity, domain adaptation, standardization, privacy, and the integration of large language models. To support ongoing research, we provide a continuously updated online repository of collaborative perception datasets and related literature: this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advancements in image editing have utilized large-scale multimodal models to enable intuitive, natural instruction-driven interactions. However, conventional methods still face significant challenges, particularly in spatial reasoning, precise region segmentation, and maintaining semantic consistency, especially in complex scenes. To overcome these challenges, we introduce SmartFreeEdit, a novel end-to-end framework that integrates a multimodal large language model (MLLM) with a hypergraph-enhanced inpainting architecture, enabling precise, mask-free image editing guided exclusively by natural language instructions. The key innovations of SmartFreeEdit include:(1)the introduction of region aware tokens and a mask embedding paradigm that enhance the spatial understanding of complex scenes;(2) a reasoning segmentation pipeline designed to optimize the generation of editing masks based on natural language instructions;and (3) a hypergraph-augmented inpainting module that ensures the preservation of both structural integrity and semantic coherence during complex edits, overcoming the limitations of local-based image generation. Extensive experiments on the Reason-Edit benchmark demonstrate that SmartFreeEdit surpasses current state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics, including segmentation accuracy, instruction adherence, and visual quality preservation, while addressing the issue of local information focus and improving global consistency in the edited image.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the booming development of blockchain technology, smart contracts have been widely used in finance, supply chain, Internet of things and other fields in recent years. However, the security problems of smart contracts become increasingly prominent. Security events caused by smart contracts occur frequently, and the existence of malicious codes may lead to the loss of user assets and system crash. In this paper, a simple study is carried out on malicious code detection of intelligent contracts based on machine learning. The main research work and achievements are as follows: Feature extraction and vectorization of smart contract are the first step to detect malicious code of smart contract by using machine learning method, and feature processing has an important impact on detection results. In this paper, an opcode vectorization method based on smart contract text is adopted. Based on considering the structural characteristics of contract opcodes, the opcodes are classified and simplified. Then, N-Gram (N=2) algorithm and TF-IDF algorithm are used to convert the simplified opcodes into vectors, and then put into the machine learning model for training. In contrast, N-Gram algorithm and TF-IDF algorithm are directly used to quantify opcodes and put into the machine learning model training. Judging which feature extraction method is better according to the training results. Finally, the classifier chain is applied to the intelligent contract malicious code detection.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper presents an adversary model and a simulation framework specifically tailored for analyzing attacks on distributed systems composed of multiple distributed protocols, with a focus on assessing the security of blockchain networks. Our model classifies and constrains adversarial actions based on the assumptions of the target protocols, defined by failure models, communication models, and the fault tolerance thresholds of Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) protocols. The goal is to study not only the intended effects of adversarial strategies but also their unintended side effects on critical system properties. We apply this framework to analyze fairness properties in a Hyperledger Fabric (HF) blockchain network. Our focus is on novel fairness attacks that involve coordinated adversarial actions across various HF services. Simulations show that even a constrained adversary can violate fairness with respect to specific clients (client fairness) and impact related guarantees (order fairness), which relate the reception order of transactions to their final order in the blockchain. This paper significantly extends our previous work by introducing and evaluating a mitigation mechanism specifically designed to counter transaction reordering attacks. We implement and integrate this defense into our simulation environment, demonstrating its effectiveness under diverse conditions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Unified Structured Knowledge Reasoning (USKR) aims to answer natural language questions (NLQs) by using structured sources such as tables, databases, and knowledge graphs in a unified way. Existing USKR methods either rely on employing task-specific strategies or custom-defined representations, which struggle to leverage the knowledge transfer between different SKR tasks or align with the prior of LLMs, thereby limiting their performance. This paper proposes a novel USKR framework named \textsc{Pandora}, which takes advantage of \textsc{Python}'s \textsc{Pandas} API to construct a unified knowledge representation for alignment with LLM pre-training. It employs an LLM to generate textual reasoning steps and executable Python code for each question. Demonstrations are drawn from a memory of training examples that cover various SKR tasks, facilitating knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks involving three SKR tasks demonstrate that \textsc{Pandora} outperforms existing unified frameworks and competes effectively with task-specific methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>protect, robust, extraction, watermark</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present MaskMark, a simple, efficient and flexible framework for image watermarking. MaskMark has two variants: MaskMark-D, which supports global watermark embedding, watermark localization, and local watermark extraction for applications such as tamper detection, and MaskMark-ED, which focuses on local watermark embedding and extraction with enhanced robustness in small regions, enabling localized image protection. Built upon the classical Encoder- Distortion-Decoder training paradigm, MaskMark-D introduces a simple masking mechanism during the decoding stage to support both global and local watermark extraction. A mask is applied to the watermarked image before extraction, allowing the decoder to focus on selected regions and learn local extraction. A localization module is also integrated into the decoder to identify watermark regions during inference, reducing interference from irrelevant content and improving accuracy. MaskMark-ED extends this design by incorporating the mask into the encoding stage as well, guiding the encoder to embed the watermark in designated local regions for enhanced robustness. Comprehensive experiments show that MaskMark achieves state-of-the-art performance in global watermark extraction, local watermark extraction, watermark localization, and multi-watermark embedding. It outperforms all existing baselines, including the recent leading model WAM for local watermarking, while preserving high visual quality of the watermarked images. MaskMark is also flexible, by adjusting the distortion layer, it can adapt to different robustness requirements with just a few steps of fine-tuning. Moreover, our approach is efficient and easy to optimize, requiring only 20 hours on a single A6000 GPU with just 1/15 the computational cost of WAM.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As artificial intelligence methods are increasingly applied to complex task scenarios, high dimensional multi-label learning has emerged as a prominent research focus. At present, the curse of dimensionality remains one of the major bottlenecks in high-dimensional multi-label learning, which can be effectively addressed through multi-label feature selection methods. However, existing multi-label feature selection methods mostly focus on identifying global features shared across all labels, which overlooks personalized characteristics and specific requirements of individual labels. This global-only perspective may limit the ability to capture label-specific discriminative information, thereby affecting overall performance. In this paper, we propose a novel method called GPMFS (Global Foundation and Personalized Optimization for Multi-Label Feature Selection). GPMFS firstly identifies global features by exploiting label correlations, then adaptively supplements each label with a personalized subset of discriminative features using a threshold-controlled strategy. Experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that GPMFS achieves superior performance while maintaining strong interpretability and robustness. Furthermore, GPMFS provides insights into the label-specific strength across different multi-label datasets, thereby demonstrating the necessity and potential applicability of personalized feature selection approaches.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) eliminates the reliance on the server-client architecture inherent in traditional federated learning, attracting significant research interest in recent years. Simultaneously, the objective functions in machine learning tasks are often nonconvex and frequently incorporate additional, potentially nonsmooth regularization terms to satisfy practical requirements, thereby forming nonconvex composite optimization problems. Employing DFL methods to solve such general optimization problems leads to the formulation of Decentralized Nonconvex Composite Federated Learning (DNCFL), a topic that remains largely underexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel DNCFL algorithm, termed \bf{DEPOSITUM}. Built upon proximal stochastic gradient tracking, DEPOSITUM mitigates the impact of data heterogeneity by enabling clients to approximate the global gradient. The introduction of momentums in the proximal gradient descent step, replacing tracking variables, reduces the variance introduced by stochastic gradients. Additionally, DEPOSITUM supports local updates of client variables, significantly reducing communication costs. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that DEPOSITUM achieves an expected $\epsilon$-stationary point with an iteration complexity of $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon^2)$. The proximal gradient, consensus errors, and gradient estimation errors decrease at a sublinear rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/T)$. With appropriate parameter selection, the algorithm achieves network-independent linear speedup without requiring mega-batch sampling. Finally, we apply DEPOSITUM to the training of neural networks on real-world datasets, systematically examining the influence of various hyperparameters on its performance. Comparisons with other federated composite optimization algorithms validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, protect, attack, diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid advancement of diffusion models and personalization techniques has made it possible to recreate individual portraits from just a few publicly available images. While such capabilities empower various creative applications, they also introduce serious privacy concerns, as adversaries can exploit them to generate highly realistic impersonations. To counter these threats, anti-personalization methods have been proposed, which add adversarial perturbations to published images to disrupt the training of personalization models. However, existing approaches largely overlook the intrinsic multi-image nature of personalization and instead adopt a naive strategy of applying perturbations independently, as commonly done in single-image settings. This neglects the opportunity to leverage inter-image relationships for stronger privacy protection. Therefore, we advocate for a group-level perspective on privacy protection against personalization. Specifically, we introduce Cross-image Anti-Personalization (CAP), a novel framework that enhances resistance to personalization by enforcing style consistency across perturbed images. Furthermore, we develop a dynamic ratio adjustment strategy that adaptively balances the impact of the consistency loss throughout the attack iterations. Extensive experiments on the classical CelebHQ and VGGFace2 benchmarks show that CAP substantially improves existing methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, defense, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Effective risk management in cybersecurity requires a thorough understanding of the interplay between attacker capabilities and defense strategies. Attack-Defense Trees (ADTs) are a commonly used methodology for representing this interplay; however, previous work in this domain has only focused on analyzing metrics such as cost, damage, or time from the perspective of the attacker. This approach provides an incomplete view of the system, as it neglects to model defender attributes: in real-world scenarios, defenders have finite resources for countermeasures and are similarly constrained. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that incorporates defense metrics into ADTs, and we present efficient algorithms for computing the Pareto front between defense and attack metrics. Our methods encode both attacker and defender metrics as semirings, allowing our methods to be used for many metrics such as cost, damage, and skill. We analyze tree-structured ADTs using a bottom-up approach and general ADTs by translating them into binary decision diagrams. Experiments on randomly generated ADTS demonstrate that both approaches effectively handle ADTs with several hundred nodes.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in industrial anomaly detection have highlighted the need for deeper logical anomaly analysis, where unexpected relationships among objects, counts, and spatial configurations must be identified and explained. Existing approaches often rely on large-scale external reasoning modules or elaborate pipeline designs, hindering practical deployment and interpretability. To address these limitations, we introduce a new task, Reasoning Logical Anomaly Detection (RLAD), which extends traditional anomaly detection by incorporating logical reasoning. We propose a new framework, LAD-Reasoner, a customized tiny multimodal language model built on Qwen2.5-VL 3B. Our approach leverages a two-stage training paradigm that first employs Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for fine-grained visual understanding, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to refine logical anomaly detection and enforce coherent, human-readable reasoning. Crucially, reward signals are derived from both the detection accuracy and the structural quality of the outputs, obviating the need for building chain of thought (CoT) reasoning data. Experiments on the MVTec LOCO AD dataset show that LAD-Reasoner, though significantly smaller, matches the performance of Qwen2.5-VL-72B in accuracy and F1 score, and further excels in producing concise and interpretable rationales. This unified design reduces reliance on large models and complex pipelines, while offering transparent and interpretable insights into logical anomaly detection. Code and data will be released.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) have delivered remarkable performance in Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS). However, recent methods often overlook the fact that visual cues are susceptible, whereas the underlying geometry remains stable, rendering depth information more robust. In this paper, we investigate the potential of integrating depth information with features from VFMs, to improve the geometric consistency within an image and boost the generalization performance of VFMs. We propose a novel fine-tuning DGSS framework, named DepthForge, which integrates the visual cues from frozen DINOv2 or EVA02 and depth cues from frozen Depth Anything V2. In each layer of the VFMs, we incorporate depth-aware learnable tokens to continuously decouple domain-invariant visual and spatial information, thereby enhancing depth awareness and attention of the VFMs. Finally, we develop a depth refinement decoder and integrate it into the model architecture to adaptively refine multi-layer VFM features and depth-aware learnable tokens. Extensive experiments are conducted based on various DGSS settings and five different datsets as unseen target domains. The qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms alternative approaches with stronger performance, steadier visual-spatial attention, and superior generalization ability. In particular, DepthForge exhibits outstanding performance under extreme conditions (e.g., night and snow). Code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As Agentic AI gain mainstream adoption, the industry invests heavily in model capabilities, achieving rapid leaps in reasoning and quality. However, these systems remain largely confined to data silos, and each new integration requires custom logic that is difficult to scale. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) addresses this challenge by defining a universal, open standard for securely connecting AI-based applications (MCP clients) to data sources (MCP servers). However, the flexibility of the MCP introduces new risks, including malicious tool servers and compromised data integrity. We present MCP Guardian, a framework that strengthens MCP-based communication with authentication, rate-limiting, logging, tracing, and Web Application Firewall (WAF) scanning. Through real-world scenarios and empirical testing, we demonstrate how MCP Guardian effectively mitigates attacks and ensures robust oversight with minimal overheads. Our approach fosters secure, scalable data access for AI assistants, underscoring the importance of a defense-in-depth approach that enables safer and more transparent innovation in AI-driven environments.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>protect, fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We know that language models (LMs) form biases and stereotypes of minorities, leading to unfair treatments of members of these groups, thanks to research mainly in the US and the broader English-speaking world. As the negative behavior of these models has severe consequences for society and individuals, industry and academia are actively developing methods to reduce the bias in LMs. However, there are many under-represented groups and languages that have been overlooked so far. This includes marginalized groups that are specific to individual countries and regions in the English speaking and Western world, but crucially also almost all marginalized groups in the rest of the world. The UN estimates, that between 600 million to 1.2 billion people worldwide are members of marginalized groups and in need for special protection. If we want to develop inclusive LMs that work for everyone, we have to broaden our understanding to include overlooked marginalized groups and low-resource languages and dialects. In this work, we contribute to this effort with the first study investigating offensive stereotyping bias in 23 LMs for 270 marginalized groups from Egypt, the remaining 21 Arab countries, Germany, the UK, and the US. Additionally, we investigate the impact of low-resource languages and dialects on the study of bias in LMs, demonstrating the limitations of current bias metrics, as we measure significantly higher bias when using the Egyptian Arabic dialect versus Modern Standard Arabic. Our results show, LMs indeed show higher bias against many marginalized groups in comparison to dominant groups. However, this is not the case for Arabic LMs, where the bias is high against both marginalized and dominant groups in relation to religion and ethnicity. Our results also show higher intersectional bias against Non-binary, LGBTQIA+ and Black women.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in general domains and demonstrated promise in multimodal mathematical reasoning. However, applying MLLMs to geometry problem solving (GPS) remains challenging due to lack of accurate step-by-step solution data and severe hallucinations during reasoning. In this paper, we propose GeoGen, a pipeline that can automatically generates step-wise reasoning paths for geometry diagrams. By leveraging the precise symbolic reasoning, \textbf{GeoGen} produces large-scale, high-quality question-answer pairs. To further enhance the logical reasoning ability of MLLMs, we train \textbf{GeoLogic}, a Large Language Model (LLM) using synthetic data generated by GeoGen. Serving as a bridge between natural language and symbolic systems, GeoLogic enables symbolic tools to help verifying MLLM outputs, making the reasoning process more rigorous and alleviating hallucinations. Experimental results show that our approach consistently improves the performance of MLLMs, achieving remarkable results on benchmarks for geometric reasoning tasks. This improvement stems from our integration of the strengths of LLMs and symbolic systems, which enables a more reliable and interpretable approach for the GPS task.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Ensuring the ethical deployment of text-to-image models requires effective techniques to prevent the generation of harmful or inappropriate content. While concept erasure methods offer a promising solution, existing finetuning-based approaches suffer from notable limitations. Anchor-free methods risk disrupting sampling trajectories, leading to visual artifacts, while anchor-based methods rely on the heuristic selection of anchor concepts. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce a finetuning framework, dubbed ANT, which Automatically guides deNoising Trajectories to avoid unwanted concepts. ANT is built on a key insight: reversing the condition direction of classifier-free guidance during mid-to-late denoising stages enables precise content modification without sacrificing early-stage structural integrity. This inspires a trajectory-aware objective that preserves the integrity of the early-stage score function field, which steers samples toward the natural image manifold, without relying on heuristic anchor concept selection. For single-concept erasure, we propose an augmentation-enhanced weight saliency map to precisely identify the critical parameters that most significantly contribute to the unwanted concept, enabling more thorough and efficient erasure. For multi-concept erasure, our objective function offers a versatile plug-and-play solution that significantly boosts performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ANT achieves state-of-the-art results in both single and multi-concept erasure, delivering high-quality, safe outputs without compromising the generative fidelity.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in the visual-language area have developed natural multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) for spatial reasoning through visual prompting. However, due to remote sensing (RS) imagery containing abundant geospatial information that differs from natural images, it is challenging to effectively adapt natural spatial models to the RS domain. Moreover, current RS MLLMs are limited in overly narrow interpretation levels and interaction manner, hindering their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address those challenges, a spatial MLLM named EarthGPT-X is proposed, enabling a comprehensive understanding of multi-source RS imagery, such as optical, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), and infrared. EarthGPT-X offers zoom-in and zoom-out insight, and possesses flexible multi-grained interactive abilities. Moreover, EarthGPT-X unifies two types of critical spatial tasks (i.e., referring and grounding) into a visual prompting framework. To achieve these versatile capabilities, several key strategies are developed. The first is the multi-modal content integration method, which enhances the interplay between images, visual prompts, and text instructions. Subsequently, a cross-domain one-stage fusion training strategy is proposed, utilizing the large language model (LLM) as a unified interface for multi-source multi-task learning. Furthermore, by incorporating a pixel perception module, the referring and grounding tasks are seamlessly unified within a single framework. In addition, the experiments conducted demonstrate the superiority of the proposed EarthGPT-X in multi-grained tasks and its impressive flexibility in multi-modal interaction, revealing significant advancements of MLLM in the RS field.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Reconstructing transparent surfaces is essential for tasks such as robotic manipulation in labs, yet it poses a significant challenge for 3D reconstruction techniques like 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). These methods often encounter a transparency-depth dilemma, where the pursuit of photorealistic rendering through standard $\alpha$-blending undermines geometric precision, resulting in considerable depth estimation errors for transparent materials. To address this issue, we introduce Transparent Surface Gaussian Splatting (TSGS), a new framework that separates geometry learning from appearance refinement. In the geometry learning stage, TSGS focuses on geometry by using specular-suppressed inputs to accurately represent surfaces. In the second stage, TSGS improves visual fidelity through anisotropic specular modeling, crucially maintaining the established opacity to ensure geometric accuracy. To enhance depth inference, TSGS employs a first-surface depth extraction method. This technique uses a sliding window over $\alpha$-blending weights to pinpoint the most likely surface location and calculates a robust weighted average depth. To evaluate the transparent surface reconstruction task under realistic conditions, we collect a TransLab dataset that includes complex transparent laboratory glassware. Extensive experiments on TransLab show that TSGS achieves accurate geometric reconstruction and realistic rendering of transparent objects simultaneously within the efficient 3DGS framework. Specifically, TSGS significantly surpasses current leading methods, achieving a 37.3% reduction in chamfer distance and an 8.0% improvement in F1 score compared to the top baseline.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This study explored how large language models (LLMs) perform in two areas related to art: writing critiques of artworks and reasoning about mental states (Theory of Mind, or ToM) in art-related situations. For the critique generation part, we built a system that combines Noel Carroll's evaluative framework with a broad selection of art criticism theories. The model was prompted to first write a full-length critique and then shorter, more coherent versions using a step-by-step prompting process. These AI-generated critiques were then compared with those written by human experts in a Turing test-style evaluation. In many cases, human subjects had difficulty telling which was which, and the results suggest that LLMs can produce critiques that are not only plausible in style but also rich in interpretation, as long as they are carefully guided. In the second part, we introduced new simple ToM tasks based on situations involving interpretation, emotion, and moral tension, which can appear in the context of art. These go beyond standard false-belief tests and allow for more complex, socially embedded forms of reasoning. We tested 41 recent LLMs and found that their performance varied across tasks and models. In particular, tasks that involved affective or ambiguous situations tended to reveal clearer differences. Taken together, these results help clarify how LLMs respond to complex interpretative challenges, revealing both their cognitive limitations and potential. While our findings do not directly contradict the so-called Generative AI Paradox--the idea that LLMs can produce expert-like output without genuine understanding--they suggest that, depending on how LLMs are instructed, such as through carefully designed prompts, these models may begin to show behaviors that resemble understanding more closely than we might assume.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The loss landscape of Variational Quantum Neural Networks (VQNNs) is characterized by local minima that grow exponentially with increasing qubits. Because of this, it is more challenging to recover information from model gradients during training compared to classical Neural Networks (NNs). In this paper we present a numerical scheme that successfully reconstructs input training, real-world, practical data from trainable VQNNs' gradients. Our scheme is based on gradient inversion that works by combining gradients estimation with the finite difference method and adaptive low-pass filtering. The scheme is further optimized with Kalman filter to obtain efficient convergence. Our experiments show that our algorithm can invert even batch-trained data, given the VQNN model is sufficiently over-parameterized.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Pap smear image segmentation is crucial for cervical cancer diagnosis. However, traditional segmentation models often struggle with complex cellular structures and variations in pap smear images. This study proposes a hybrid Dense-UNet201 optimization approach that integrates a pretrained DenseNet201 as the encoder for the U-Net architecture and optimizes it using the spider monkey optimization (SMO) algorithm. The Dense-UNet201 model excelled at feature extraction. The SMO was modified to handle categorical and discrete parameters. The SIPaKMeD dataset was used in this study and evaluated using key performance metrics, including loss, accuracy, Intersection over Union (IoU), and Dice coefficient. The experimental results showed that Dense-UNet201 outperformed U-Net, Res-UNet50, and Efficient-UNetB0. SMO Dense-UNet201 achieved a segmentation accuracy of 96.16%, an IoU of 91.63%, and a Dice coefficient score of 95.63%. These findings underscore the effectiveness of image preprocessing, pretrained models, and metaheuristic optimization in improving medical image analysis and provide new insights into cervical cell segmentation methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, watermark, diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As digital content becomes increasingly ubiquitous, the need for robust watermark removal techniques has grown due to the inadequacy of existing embedding techniques, which lack robustness. This paper introduces a novel Saliency-Aware Diffusion Reconstruction (SADRE) framework for watermark elimination on the web, combining adaptive noise injection, region-specific perturbations, and advanced diffusion-based reconstruction. SADRE disrupts embedded watermarks by injecting targeted noise into latent representations guided by saliency masks although preserving essential image features. A reverse diffusion process ensures high-fidelity image restoration, leveraging adaptive noise levels determined by watermark strength. Our framework is theoretically grounded with stability guarantees and achieves robust watermark removal across diverse scenarios. Empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art (SOTA) watermarking techniques demonstrate SADRE's superiority in balancing watermark disruption and image quality. SADRE sets a new benchmark for watermark elimination, offering a flexible and reliable solution for real-world web content. Code is available on~\href{this https URL}{\textbf{this https URL}}.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The widespread adoption of EMV (Europay, Mastercard, and Visa) contactless payment systems has greatly improved convenience for both users and merchants. However, this growth has also exposed significant security challenges. This SoK provides a comprehensive analysis of security vulnerabilities in EMV contactless payments, particularly within the open-loop systems used by Visa and Mastercard. We categorize attacks into seven attack vectors across three key areas: application selection, cardholder authentication, and transaction authorization. We replicate the attacks on Visa and Mastercard protocols using our experimental platform to determine their practical feasibility and offer insights into the current security landscape of contactless payments. Our study also includes a detailed evaluation of the underlying protocols, along with a comparative analysis of Visa and Mastercard, highlighting vulnerabilities and recommending countermeasures.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Relational Triple Extraction (RTE) is a fundamental task in Natural Language Processing (NLP). However, prior research has primarily focused on optimizing model performance, with limited efforts to understand the internal mechanisms driving these models. Many existing methods rely on complex preprocessing to induce specific interactions, often resulting in opaque systems that may not fully align with their theoretical foundations. To address these limitations, we propose SMARTe: a Slot-based Method for Accountable Relational Triple extraction. SMARTe introduces intrinsic interpretability through a slot attention mechanism and frames the task as a set prediction problem. Slot attention consolidates relevant information into distinct slots, ensuring all predictions can be explicitly traced to learned slot representations and the tokens contributing to each predicted relational triple. While emphasizing interpretability, SMARTe achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art models. Evaluations on the NYT and WebNLG datasets demonstrate that adding interpretability does not compromise performance. Furthermore, we conducted qualitative assessments to showcase the explanations provided by SMARTe, using attention heatmaps that map to their respective tokens. We conclude with a discussion of our findings and propose directions for future research.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Despite the astonishing progress in generative AI, 4D dynamic object generation remains an open challenge. With limited high-quality training data and heavy computing requirements, the combination of hallucinating unseen geometry together with unseen movement poses great challenges to generative models. In this work, we propose TwoSquared as a method to obtain a 4D physically plausible sequence starting from only two 2D RGB images corresponding to the beginning and end of the action. Instead of directly solving the 4D generation problem, TwoSquared decomposes the problem into two steps: 1) an image-to-3D module generation based on the existing generative model trained on high-quality 3D assets, and 2) a physically inspired deformation module to predict intermediate movements. To this end, our method does not require templates or object-class-specific prior knowledge and can take in-the-wild images as input. In our experiments, we demonstrate that TwoSquared is capable of producing texture-consistent and geometry-consistent 4D sequences only given 2D images.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present a novel approach to training specialized instruction-based image-editing diffusion models, addressing key challenges in structural preservation with input images and semantic alignment with user prompts. We introduce an online reinforcement learning framework that aligns the diffusion model with human preferences without relying on extensive human annotations or curating a large dataset. Our method significantly improves the realism and alignment with instructions in two ways. First, the proposed models achieve precise and structurally coherent modifications in complex scenes while maintaining high fidelity in instruction-irrelevant areas. Second, they capture fine nuances in the desired edit by leveraging a visual prompt, enabling detailed control over visual edits without lengthy textual prompts. This approach simplifies users' efforts to achieve highly specific edits, requiring only 5 reference images depicting a certain concept for training. Experimental results demonstrate that our models can perform intricate edits in complex scenes, after just 10 training steps. Finally, we showcase the versatility of our method by applying it to robotics, where enhancing the visual realism of simulated environments through targeted sim-to-real image edits improves their utility as proxies for real-world settings.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) inversion have demonstrated excellent performance in image inpainting that aims to restore lost or damaged image texture using its unmasked content. Previous GAN inversion-based methods usually utilize well-trained GAN models as effective priors to generate the realistic regions for missing holes. Despite excellence, they ignore a hard constraint that the unmasked regions in the input and the output should be the same, resulting in a gap between GAN inversion and image inpainting and thus degrading the performance. Besides, existing GAN inversion approaches often consider a single modality of the input image, neglecting other auxiliary cues in images for improvements. Addressing these problems, we propose a novel GAN inversion approach, dubbed MMInvertFill, for image inpainting. MMInvertFill contains primarily a multimodal guided encoder with a pre-modulation and a GAN generator with F&W+ latent space. Specifically, the multimodal encoder aims to enhance the multi-scale structures with additional semantic segmentation edge texture modalities through a gated mask-aware attention module. Afterwards, a pre-modulation is presented to encode these structures into style vectors. To mitigate issues of conspicuous color discrepancy and semantic inconsistency, we introduce the F&W+ latent space to bridge the gap between GAN inversion and image inpainting. Furthermore, in order to reconstruct faithful and photorealistic images, we devise a simple yet effective Soft-update Mean Latent module to capture more diversified in-domain patterns for generating high-fidelity textures for massive corruptions. In our extensive experiments on six challenging datasets, we show that our MMInvertFill qualitatively and quantitatively outperforms other state-of-the-arts and it supports the completion of out-of-domain images effectively.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Existing multilingual long-context benchmarks, often based on the popular needle-in-a-haystack test, primarily evaluate a model's ability to locate specific information buried within irrelevant texts. However, such a retrieval-centric approach is myopic and inherently limited, as successful recall alone does not indicate a model's capacity to reason over extended contexts. Moreover, these benchmarks are susceptible to data leakage, short-circuiting, and risk making the evaluation a priori identifiable. To address these limitations, we introduce MLRBench, a new synthetic benchmark for multilingual long-context reasoning. Unlike existing benchmarks, MLRBench goes beyond surface-level retrieval by including tasks that assess multi-hop inference, aggregation, and epistemic reasoning. Spanning seven languages, MLRBench is designed to be parallel, resistant to leakage, and scalable to arbitrary context lengths. Our extensive experiments with an open-weight large language model (LLM) reveal a pronounced gap between high- and low-resource languages, particularly for tasks requiring the model to aggregate multiple facts or predict the absence of information. We also find that, in multilingual settings, LLMs effectively utilize less than 30% of their claimed context length. Although off-the-shelf Retrieval Augmented Generation helps alleviate this to a certain extent, it does not solve the long-context problem. We open-source MLRBench to enable future research in improved evaluation and training of multilingual LLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated Learning (FL) allows collaborative training among multiple devices without data sharing, thus enabling privacy-sensitive applications on mobile or Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as mobile health and asset tracking. However, designing an FL system with good model utility that works with low computation/communication overhead on heterogeneous, resource-constrained mobile/IoT devices is challenging. To address this problem, this paper proposes FedX, a novel adaptive model decomposition and quantization FL system for IoT. To balance utility with resource constraints on IoT devices, FedX decomposes a global FL model into different sub-networks with adaptive numbers of quantized bits for different devices. The key idea is that a device with fewer resources receives a smaller sub-network for lower overhead but utilizes a larger number of quantized bits for higher model utility, and vice versa. The quantization operations in FedX are done at the server to reduce the computational load on devices. FedX iteratively minimizes the losses in the devices' local data and in the server's public data using quantized sub-networks under a regularization term, and thus it maximizes the benefits of combining FL with model quantization through knowledge sharing among the server and devices in a cost-effective training process. Extensive experiments show that FedX significantly improves quantization times by up to 8.43X, on-device computation time by 1.5X, and total end-to-end training time by 1.36X, compared with baseline FL systems. We guarantee the global model convergence theoretically and validate local model convergence empirically, highlighting FedX's optimization efficiency.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Classifying imbalanced datasets remains a significant challenge in machine learning, particularly with big data where instances are unevenly distributed among classes, leading to class imbalance issues that impact classifier performance. While Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) addresses this challenge by generating new instances for the under-represented minority class, it faces obstacles in the form of noise and outliers during the creation of new samples. In this paper, a proposed approach, iHHO-SMOTe, which addresses the limitations of SMOTE by first cleansing the data from noise points. This process involves employing feature selection using a random forest to identify the most valuable features, followed by applying the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm to detect outliers based on the selected features. The identified outliers from the minority classes are then removed, creating a refined dataset for subsequent oversampling using the hybrid approach called iHHO-SMOTe. The comprehensive experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate the exceptional performance of the proposed model, with an AUC score exceeding 0.99, a high G-means score of 0.99 highlighting its robustness, and an outstanding F1-score consistently exceeding 0.967. These findings collectively establish Cleansed iHHO-SMOTe as a formidable contender in addressing imbalanced datasets, focusing on noise reduction and outlier handling for improved classification models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multispectral imaging plays a critical role in a range of intelligent transportation applications, including advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), traffic monitoring, and night vision. However, accurate visible and thermal (RGB-T) image registration poses a significant challenge due to the considerable modality differences. In this paper, we present a novel joint Self-Correlation and Cross-Correspondence Estimation Framework (SC3EF), leveraging both local representative features and global contextual cues to effectively generate RGB-T correspondences. For this purpose, we design a convolution-transformer-based pipeline to extract local representative features and encode global correlations of intra-modality for inter-modality correspondence estimation between unaligned visible and thermal images. After merging the local and global correspondence estimation results, we further employ a hierarchical optical flow estimation decoder to progressively refine the estimated dense correspondence maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, outperforming the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on representative RGB-T datasets. Furthermore, it also shows competitive generalization capabilities across challenging scenarios, including large parallax, severe occlusions, adverse weather, and other cross-modal datasets (e.g., RGB-N and RGB-D).</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>defense, attack, robust, steal, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training using decentralized private data from multiple clients. While FL has shown robustness against poisoning attacks with basic defenses, our research reveals new vulnerabilities stemming from non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data among clients. These vulnerabilities pose a substantial risk of model poisoning in real-world FL scenarios. To demonstrate such vulnerabilities, we develop a novel collaborative backdoor poisoning attack called CollaPois. In this attack, we distribute a single pre-trained model infected with a Trojan to a group of compromised clients. These clients then work together to produce malicious gradients, causing the FL model to consistently converge towards a low-loss region centered around the Trojan-infected model. Consequently, the impact of the Trojan is amplified, especially when the benign clients have diverse local data distributions and scattered local gradients. CollaPois stands out by achieving its goals while involving only a limited number of compromised clients, setting it apart from existing attacks. Also, CollaPois effectively avoids noticeable shifts or degradation in the FL model's performance on legitimate data samples, allowing it to operate stealthily and evade detection by advanced robust FL algorithms. Thorough theoretical analysis and experiments conducted on various benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of CollaPois compared to state-of-the-art backdoor attacks. Notably, CollaPois bypasses existing backdoor defenses, especially in scenarios where clients possess diverse data distributions. Moreover, the results show that CollaPois remains effective even when involving a small number of compromised clients. Notably, clients whose local data is closely aligned with compromised clients experience higher risks of backdoor infections.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The growing influence of video content as a medium for communication and misinformation underscores the urgent need for effective tools to analyze claims in multilingual and multi-topic settings. Existing efforts in misinformation detection largely focus on written text, leaving a significant gap in addressing the complexity of spoken text in video transcripts. We introduce ViClaim, a dataset of 1,798 annotated video transcripts across three languages (English, German, Spanish) and six topics. Each sentence in the transcripts is labeled with three claim-related categories: fact-check-worthy, fact-non-check-worthy, or opinion. We developed a custom annotation tool to facilitate the highly complex annotation process. Experiments with state-of-the-art multilingual language models demonstrate strong performance in cross-validation (macro F1 up to 0.896) but reveal challenges in generalization to unseen topics, particularly for distinct domains. Our findings highlight the complexity of claim detection in video transcripts. ViClaim offers a robust foundation for advancing misinformation detection in video-based communication, addressing a critical gap in multimodal analysis.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Despite significant progress, recent studies indicate that current large language models (LLMs) may still capture dataset biases and utilize them during inference, leading to the poor generalizability of LLMs. However, due to the diversity of dataset biases and the insufficient nature of bias suppression based on in-context learning, the effectiveness of previous prior knowledge-based debiasing methods and in-context learning based automatic debiasing methods is limited. To address these challenges, we explore the combination of causal mechanisms with information theory and propose an information gain-guided causal intervention debiasing (IGCIDB) framework. This framework first utilizes an information gain-guided causal intervention method to automatically and autonomously balance the distribution of instruction-tuning dataset. Subsequently, it employs a standard supervised fine-tuning process to train LLMs on the debiased dataset. Experimental results show that IGCIDB can effectively debias LLM to improve its generalizability across different tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Do Large Language Models (LLMs) hold positions that conflict with your country's values? Occasionally they do! However, existing works primarily focus on ethical reviews, failing to capture the diversity of national values, which encompass broader policy, legal, and moral considerations. Furthermore, current benchmarks that rely on spectrum tests using manually designed questionnaires are not easily scalable. To address these limitations, we introduce NaVAB, a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the alignment of LLMs with the values of five major nations: China, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. NaVAB implements a national value extraction pipeline to efficiently construct value assessment datasets. Specifically, we propose a modeling procedure with instruction tagging to process raw data sources, a screening process to filter value-related topics and a generation process with a Conflict Reduction mechanism to filter non-conflicting this http URL conduct extensive experiments on various LLMs across countries, and the results provide insights into assisting in the identification of misaligned scenarios. Moreover, we demonstrate that NaVAB can be combined with alignment techniques to effectively reduce value concerns by aligning LLMs' values with the target country.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Instruction tuning has enabled large language models (LLMs) to achieve remarkable performance, but its success heavily depends on the availability of large-scale, high-quality instruction-response pairs. However, current methods for scaling up data generation often overlook a crucial aspect: the alignment between instructions and responses. We hypothesize that high-quality instruction-response pairs are not defined by the individual quality of each component, but by the extent of their alignment with each other. To address this, we propose a Mutual Alignment Framework (MAIN) that ensures coherence between the instruction and response through mutual constraints. Experiments demonstrate that models such as LLaMA and Mistral, fine-tuned within this framework, outperform traditional methods across multiple benchmarks. This approach underscores the critical role of instruction-response alignment in enabling scalable and high-quality instruction tuning for LLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, an approach for concept extraction from documents using pre-trained large language models (LLMs) is presented. Compared with conventional methods that extract keyphrases summarizing the important information discussed in a document, our approach tackles a more challenging task of extracting all present concepts related to the specific domain, not just the important ones. Through comprehensive evaluations of two widely used benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our method improves the F1 score compared to state-of-the-art techniques. Additionally, we explore the potential of using prompts within these models for unsupervised concept extraction. The extracted concepts are intended to support domain coverage evaluation of ontologies and facilitate ontology learning, highlighting the effectiveness of LLMs in concept extraction tasks.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Transformer models exhibit remarkable in-context learning (ICL), adapting to novel tasks from examples within their context, yet the underlying mechanisms remain largely mysterious. Here, we provide an exact analytical characterization of ICL emergence by deriving the closed-form stochastic gradient descent (SGD) dynamics for a simplified linear transformer performing regression tasks. Our analysis reveals key properties: (1) a natural separation of timescales directly governed by the input data's covariance structure, leading to staged learning; (2) an exact description of how ICL develops, including fixed points corresponding to learned algorithms and conservation laws constraining the dynamics; and (3) surprisingly nonlinear learning behavior despite the model's linearity. We hypothesize this phenomenology extends to non-linear models. To test this, we introduce theory-inspired macroscopic measures (spectral rank dynamics, subspace stability) and use them to provide mechanistic explanations for (1) the sudden emergence of ICL in attention-only networks and (2) delayed generalization (grokking) in modular arithmetic models. Our work offers an exact dynamical model for ICL and theoretically grounded tools for analyzing complex transformer training.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Mechanistic interpretability is concerned with analyzing individual components in a (convolutional) neural network (CNN) and how they form larger circuits representing decision mechanisms. These investigations are challenging since CNNs frequently learn polysemantic channels that encode distinct concepts, making them hard to interpret. To address this, we propose an algorithm to disentangle a specific kind of polysemantic channel into multiple channels, each responding to a single concept. Our approach restructures weights in a CNN, utilizing that different concepts within the same channel exhibit distinct activation patterns in the previous layer. By disentangling these polysemantic features, we enhance the interpretability of CNNs, ultimately improving explanatory techniques such as feature visualizations.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have catalyzed the development of general-purpose autonomous agents, demonstrating remarkable performance in complex reasoning tasks across various domains. This surge has spurred the evolution of a plethora of prompt-based reasoning frameworks. A recent focus has been on iterative reasoning strategies that refine outputs through self-evaluation and verbalized feedback. However, these strategies require additional computational complexity to enable models to recognize and correct their mistakes, leading to a significant increase in their cost. In this work, we introduce the concept of ``retrials without feedback'', an embarrassingly simple yet powerful mechanism for enhancing reasoning frameworks by allowing LLMs to retry problem-solving attempts upon identifying incorrect answers. Unlike conventional iterative refinement methods, our method does not require explicit self-reflection or verbalized feedback, simplifying the refinement process. Our findings indicate that simpler retrial-based approaches often outperform more sophisticated reasoning frameworks, suggesting that the benefits of complex methods may not always justify their computational costs. By challenging the prevailing assumption that more intricate reasoning strategies inherently lead to better performance, our work offers new insights into how simpler, more efficient approaches can achieve optimal results. So, are retrials all you need?</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Domain generalization aims at training on source domains to uncover a domain-invariant feature space, allowing the model to perform robust generalization ability on unknown target domains. However, due to domain gaps, it is hard to find reliable common image feature space, and the reason for that is the lack of suitable basic units for images. Different from image in vision space, language has comprehensive expression elements that can effectively convey semantics. Inspired by the semantic completeness of language and intuitiveness of image, we propose VLCA, which combine language space and vision space, and connect the multiple image domains by using semantic space as the bridge domain. Specifically, in language space, by taking advantage of the completeness of language basic units, we tend to capture the semantic representation of the relations between categories through word vector distance. Then, in vision space, by taking advantage of the intuitiveness of image features, the common pattern of sample features with the same class is explored through low-rank approximation. In the end, the language representation is aligned with the vision representation through the multimodal space of text and image. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has significantly advanced information retrieval systems, particularly in response generation (RG). Unfortunately, LLMs often face knowledge conflicts between internal memory and retrievaled external information, arising from misinformation, biases, or outdated knowledge. These conflicts undermine response reliability and introduce uncertainty in decision-making. In this work, we analyze how LLMs navigate knowledge conflicts from an information-theoretic perspective and reveal that when conflicting and supplementary information exhibit significant differences, LLMs confidently resolve their preferences. However, when the distinction is ambiguous, LLMs experience heightened uncertainty. Based on this insight, we propose Swin-VIB, a novel framework that integrates a pipeline of variational information bottleneck models into adaptive augmentation of retrieved information and guiding LLM preference in response generation. Extensive experiments on single-choice, open-ended question-answering (QA), and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the efficacy of Swin-VIB. Notably, our method improves single-choice task accuracy by at least 7.54\% over competitive baselines.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Serving Large Language Models (LLMs) is critical for AI-powered applications but demands substantial computational resources, particularly in memory bandwidth and computational throughput. Low-precision computation has emerged as a key technique to improve efficiency while reducing resource consumption. Existing approaches for generating low-precision kernels are limited to weight bit widths that are powers of two and suffer from suboptimal performance due to high-level GPU programming abstractions. These abstractions restrict critical optimizations, such as fine-grained register management and optimized memory access patterns, which are essential for efficient low-precision computations. In this paper, we introduce a virtual machine (VM) designed for General-Purpose GPU (GPGPU) computing, enabling support for low-precision data types with arbitrary bit widths while maintaining GPU programmability. The proposed VM features a thread-block-level programming model, a hierarchical memory space, a novel algebraic layout system, and extensive support for diverse low-precision data types. VM programs are compiled into highly efficient GPU programs with automatic vectorization and instruction selection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our VM efficiently supports a full spectrum of low-precision data types, and outperforms state-of-the-art low-precision kernels on their supported types. Compared to existing compilers like Triton and Ladder, as well as hand-optimized kernels such as QuantLLM and Marlin, our VM achieves performance improvements of 1.75x, 2.61x, 1.29x and 1.03x, respectively.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a powerful technique to improve in-context learning (ICL) in large language models (LLMs) by breaking complex reasoning into intermediate steps. However, the ability of CoT to generalize under distribution shift remains poorly understood. In this work, we extend a latent-variable framework for CoT prompting and study its behavior on two prototypical out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios: (i) the latent variables for CoT steps are permuted into novel combinations, and (ii) the latent variables uniformly scaled by a factor. Our experiments demonstrate that CoT inference generalizes effectively to OOD samples whose latent variables closely resemble those seen during training, but its performance degrades as this similarity decreases. These findings provide foundational insights into the strengths and limitations of CoT prompting under OOD conditions and suggest directions for developing more resilient reasoning strategies in future LLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This study presents an ensemble-based approach for cocoa pod disease classification by integrating transfer learning with three ensemble learning strategies: Bagging, Boosting, and Stacking. Pre-trained convolutional neural networks, including VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, ResNet101, InceptionV3, and Xception, were fine-tuned and employed as base learners to detect three disease categories: Black Pod Rot, Pod Borer, and Healthy. A balanced dataset of 6,000 cocoa pod images was curated and augmented to ensure robustness against variations in lighting, orientation, and disease severity. The performance of each ensemble method was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Experimental results show that Bagging consistently achieved superior classification performance with a test accuracy of 100%, outperforming Boosting (97%) and Stacking (92%). The findings confirm that combining transfer learning with ensemble techniques improves model generalization and reliability, making it a promising direction for precision agriculture and automated crop disease management.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, transformer, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) frequently memorize sensitive information during training, posing risks when deploying publicly accessible models. Current machine unlearning methods struggle to selectively remove specific data associations without degrading overall model capabilities. This paper presents our solution to SemEval-2025 Task 4 on targeted unlearning, which introduces a two-stage methodology that combines causal mediation analysis with layer-specific optimization. Through systematic causal tracing experiments on OLMo architectures (1B and 7B parameters), we identify the critical role of the first few transformer layers (layers 0-5) in storing subject-attribute associations within MLP modules. Building on this insight, we develop a constrained optimization approach that freezes upper layers while applying a novel joint loss function to lower layers-simultaneously maximizing forget set loss via output token cross-entropy penalties and minimizing retain set deviation through adaptive regularization. Our method achieves 2nd place in the 1B model track, demonstrating strong task performance while maintaining 88% of baseline MMLU accuracy. These results establish causal-informed layer optimization as a promising paradigm for efficient, precise unlearning in LLMs, offering a significant step forward in addressing data privacy concerns in AI systems.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep learning-based point cloud modeling has been widely investigated as an indispensable component of general shape analysis. Recently, transformer and state space model (SSM) have shown promising capacities in point cloud learning. However, limited research has been conducted on medical point clouds, which have great potential in disease diagnosis and treatment. This paper presents an SSM-based hierarchical feature learning framework for medical point cloud understanding. Specifically, we down-sample input into multiple levels through the farthest point sampling. At each level, we perform a series of k-nearest neighbor (KNN) queries to aggregate multi-scale structural information. To assist SSM in processing point clouds, we introduce coordinate-order and inside-out scanning strategies for efficient serialization of irregular points. Point features are calculated progressively from short neighbor sequences and long point sequences through vanilla and group Point SSM blocks, to capture both local patterns and long-range dependencies. To evaluate the proposed method, we build a large-scale medical point cloud dataset named MedPointS for anatomy classification, completion, and segmentation. Extensive experiments conducted on MedPointS demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance across all tasks. The dataset is available at this https URL.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent studies have made significant progress in developing large language models (LLMs) in the medical domain, which can answer expert-level questions and demonstrate the potential to assist clinicians in real-world clinical scenarios. Studies have also witnessed the importance of integrating various modalities with the existing LLMs for a better understanding of complex clinical contexts, which are innately multi-faceted by nature. Although studies have demonstrated the ability of multimodal LLMs in histopathology to answer questions from given images, they lack in understanding of thorough clinical context due to the patch-level data with limited information from public datasets. Thus, developing WSI-level MLLMs is significant in terms of the scalability and applicability of MLLMs in histopathology. In this study, we introduce an expert-level MLLM for histopathology using WSIs, dubbed as ChatEXAONEPath. We present a retrieval-based data generation pipeline using 10,094 pairs of WSIs and histopathology reports from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We also showcase an AI-based evaluation protocol for a comprehensive understanding of the medical context from given multimodal information and evaluate generated answers compared to the original histopathology reports. We demonstrate the ability of diagnosing the given histopathology images using ChatEXAONEPath with the acceptance rate of 62.9% from 1,134 pairs of WSIs and reports. Our proposed model can understand pan-cancer WSIs and clinical context from various cancer types. We argue that our proposed model has the potential to assist clinicians by comprehensively understanding complex morphology of WSIs for cancer diagnosis through the integration of multiple modalities.</li>

Existing methods face three key challenges: (1) Difficulty in extracting multi-scale features from spatially heterogeneous RS scenes, (2) Limited prior information causing semantic inconsistency in reconstructions, and (3) Trade-off imbalance between geometric accuracy and visual quality. To address these issues, we propose the Texture Transfer Residual Denoising Dual Diffusion Model (TTRD3) with three innovations: First, a Multi-scale Feature Aggregation Block (MFAB) employing parallel heterogeneous convolutional kernels for multi-scale feature extraction. Second, a Sparse Texture Transfer Guidance (STTG) module that transfers HR texture priors from reference images of similar scenes. Third, a Residual Denoising Dual Diffusion Model (RDDM) framework combining residual diffusion for deterministic reconstruction and noise diffusion for diverse generation. Experiments on multi-source RS datasets demonstrate TTRD3's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, achieving 1.43% LPIPS improvement and 3.67% FID enhancement compared to best-performing baselines.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have been equipped with safety mechanisms to prevent harmful outputs, but these guardrails can often be bypassed through "jailbreak" prompts. This paper introduces a novel graph-based approach to systematically generate jailbreak prompts through semantic transformations. We represent malicious prompts as nodes in a graph structure with edges denoting different transformations, leveraging Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) and Resource Description Framework (RDF) to parse user goals into semantic components that can be manipulated to evade safety filters. We demonstrate a particularly effective exploitation vector by instructing LLMs to generate code that realizes the intent described in these semantic graphs, achieving success rates of up to 87% against leading commercial LLMs. Our analysis reveals that contextual framing and abstraction are particularly effective at circumventing safety measures, highlighting critical gaps in current safety alignment techniques that focus primarily on surface-level patterns. These findings provide insights for developing more robust safeguards against structured semantic attacks. Our research contributes both a theoretical framework and practical methodology for systematically stress-testing LLM safety mechanisms.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Aspect-based summarization aims to generate summaries tailored to specific aspects, addressing the resource constraints and limited generalizability of traditional summarization approaches. Recently, large language models have shown promise in this task without the need for training. However, they rely excessively on prompt engineering and face token limits and hallucination challenges, especially with in-context learning. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel framework for aspect-based summarization: Self-Aspect Retrieval Enhanced Summary Generation. Rather than relying solely on in-context learning, given an aspect, we employ an embedding-driven retrieval mechanism to identify its relevant text segments. This approach extracts the pertinent content while avoiding unnecessary details, thereby mitigating the challenge of token limits. Moreover, our framework optimizes token usage by deleting unrelated parts of the text and ensuring that the model generates output strictly based on the given aspect. With extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our framework not only achieves superior performance but also effectively mitigates the token limitation problem.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>watermark, diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text-to-image models based on diffusion processes, such as DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, and Midjourney, are capable of transforming texts into detailed images and have widespread applications in art and design. As such, amateur users can easily imitate professional-level paintings by collecting an artist's work and fine-tuning the model, leading to concerns about artworks' copyright infringement. To tackle these issues, previous studies either add visually imperceptible perturbation to the artwork to change its underlying styles (perturbation-based methods) or embed post-training detectable watermarks in the artwork (watermark-based methods). However, when the artwork or the model has been published online, i.e., modification to the original artwork or model retraining is not feasible, these strategies might not be viable. To this end, we propose a novel method for data-use auditing in the text-to-image generation model. The general idea of ArtistAuditor is to identify if a suspicious model has been finetuned using the artworks of specific artists by analyzing the features related to the style. Concretely, ArtistAuditor employs a style extractor to obtain the multi-granularity style representations and treats artworks as samplings of an artist's style. Then, ArtistAuditor queries a trained discriminator to gain the auditing decisions. The experimental results on six combinations of models and datasets show that ArtistAuditor can achieve high AUC values (> 0.937). By studying ArtistAuditor's transferability and core modules, we provide valuable insights into the practical implementation. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of ArtistAuditor in real-world cases by an online platform Scenario. ArtistAuditor is open-sourced at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>explainability, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This study explores the relationship between deep learning (DL) model accuracy and expert agreement in the classification of crash narratives. We evaluate five DL models -- including BERT variants, the Universal Sentence Encoder (USE), and a zero-shot classifier -- against expert-labeled data and narrative text. The analysis is further extended to four large language models (LLMs): GPT-4, LLaMA 3, Qwen, and Claude. Our results reveal a counterintuitive trend: models with higher technical accuracy often exhibit lower agreement with domain experts, whereas LLMs demonstrate greater expert alignment despite relatively lower accuracy scores. To quantify and interpret model-expert agreement, we employ Cohen's Kappa, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and SHAP-based explainability techniques. Findings indicate that expert-aligned models tend to rely more on contextual and temporal language cues, rather than location-specific keywords. These results underscore that accuracy alone is insufficient for evaluating models in safety-critical NLP applications. We advocate for incorporating expert agreement as a complementary metric in model evaluation frameworks and highlight the promise of LLMs as interpretable, scalable tools for crash analysis pipelines.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in video generation have been driven by diffusion models and autoregressive frameworks, yet critical challenges persist in harmonizing prompt adherence, visual quality, motion dynamics, and duration: compromises in motion dynamics to enhance temporal visual quality, constrained video duration (5-10 seconds) to prioritize resolution, and inadequate shot-aware generation stemming from general-purpose MLLMs' inability to interpret cinematic grammar, such as shot composition, actor expressions, and camera motions. These intertwined limitations hinder realistic long-form synthesis and professional film-style generation. To address these limitations, we propose SkyReels-V2, an Infinite-length Film Generative Model, that synergizes Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM), Multi-stage Pretraining, Reinforcement Learning, and Diffusion Forcing Framework. Firstly, we design a comprehensive structural representation of video that combines the general descriptions by the Multi-modal LLM and the detailed shot language by sub-expert models. Aided with human annotation, we then train a unified Video Captioner, named SkyCaptioner-V1, to efficiently label the video data. Secondly, we establish progressive-resolution pretraining for the fundamental video generation, followed by a four-stage post-training enhancement: Initial concept-balanced Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) improves baseline quality; Motion-specific Reinforcement Learning (RL) training with human-annotated and synthetic distortion data addresses dynamic artifacts; Our diffusion forcing framework with non-decreasing noise schedules enables long-video synthesis in an efficient search space; Final high-quality SFT refines visual fidelity.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Proteins typically exist in complexes, interacting with other proteins or biomolecules to perform their specific biological roles. Research on single-chain protein modeling has been extensively and deeply explored, with advancements seen in models like the series of ESM and AlphaFold. Despite these developments, the study and modeling of multi-chain proteins remain largely uncharted, though they are vital for understanding biological functions. Recognizing the importance of these interactions, we introduce APM (All-Atom Protein Generative Model), a model specifically designed for modeling multi-chain proteins. By integrating atom-level information and leveraging data on multi-chain proteins, APM is capable of precisely modeling inter-chain interactions and designing protein complexes with binding capabilities from scratch. It also performs folding and inverse-folding tasks for multi-chain proteins. Moreover, APM demonstrates versatility in downstream applications: it achieves enhanced performance through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) while also supporting zero-shot sampling in certain tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper introduces a novel dual-region augmentation approach designed to reduce reliance on large-scale labeled datasets while improving model robustness and adaptability across diverse computer vision tasks, including source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) and person re-identification (ReID). Our method performs targeted data transformations by applying random noise perturbations to foreground objects and spatially shuffling background patches. This effectively increases the diversity of the training data, improving model robustness and generalization. Evaluations on the PACS dataset for SFDA demonstrate that our augmentation strategy consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving significant accuracy improvements in both single-target and multi-target adaptation settings. By augmenting training data through structured transformations, our method enables model generalization across domains, providing a scalable solution for reducing reliance on manually annotated datasets. Furthermore, experiments on Market-1501 and DukeMTMC-reID datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach for person ReID, surpassing traditional augmentation techniques.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Computer vision is transforming fashion through Virtual Try-On (VTON) and Virtual Try-Off (VTOFF). VTON generates images of a person in a specified garment using a target photo and a standardized garment image, while a more challenging variant, Person-to-Person Virtual Try-On (p2p-VTON), uses a photo of another person wearing the garment. VTOFF, on the other hand, extracts standardized garment images from clothed individuals. We introduce TryOffDiff, a diffusion-based VTOFF model. Built on a latent diffusion framework with SigLIP image conditioning, it effectively captures garment properties like texture, shape, and patterns. TryOffDiff achieves state-of-the-art results on VITON-HD and strong performance on DressCode dataset, covering upper-body, lower-body, and dresses. Enhanced with class-specific embeddings, it pioneers multi-garment VTOFF, the first of its kind. When paired with VTON models, it improves p2p-VTON by minimizing unwanted attribute transfer, such as skin color. Code is available at: this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly employing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to improve the factuality of their responses. However, in practice, these systems often need to handle ambiguous user queries and potentially conflicting information from multiple sources while also suppressing inaccurate information from noisy or irrelevant documents. Prior work has generally studied and addressed these challenges in isolation, considering only one aspect at a time, such as handling ambiguity or robustness to noise and misinformation. We instead consider multiple factors simultaneously, proposing (i) RAMDocs (Retrieval with Ambiguity and Misinformation in Documents), a new dataset that simulates complex and realistic scenarios for conflicting evidence for a user query, including ambiguity, misinformation, and noise; and (ii) MADAM-RAG, a multi-agent approach in which LLM agents debate over the merits of an answer over multiple rounds, allowing an aggregator to collate responses corresponding to disambiguated entities while discarding misinformation and noise, thereby handling diverse sources of conflict jointly. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MADAM-RAG using both closed and open-source models on AmbigDocs -- which requires presenting all valid answers for ambiguous queries -- improving over strong RAG baselines by up to 11.40% and on FaithEval -- which requires suppressing misinformation -- where we improve by up to 15.80% (absolute) with Llama3.3-70B-Instruct. Furthermore, we find that RAMDocs poses a challenge for existing RAG baselines (Llama3.3-70B-Instruct only obtains 32.60 exact match score). While MADAM-RAG begins to address these conflicting factors, our analysis indicates that a substantial gap remains especially when increasing the level of imbalance in supporting evidence and misinformation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Video Anomaly Detection~(VAD) focuses on identifying anomalies within videos. Supervised methods require an amount of in-domain training data and often struggle to generalize to unseen anomalies. In contrast, training-free methods leverage the intrinsic world knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to detect anomalies but face challenges in localizing fine-grained visual transitions and diverse events. Therefore, we propose EventVAD, an event-aware video anomaly detection framework that combines tailored dynamic graph architectures and multimodal LLMs through temporal-event reasoning. Specifically, EventVAD first employs dynamic spatiotemporal graph modeling with time-decay constraints to capture event-aware video features. Then, it performs adaptive noise filtering and uses signal ratio thresholding to detect event boundaries via unsupervised statistical features. The statistical boundary detection module reduces the complexity of processing long videos for MLLMs and improves their temporal reasoning through event consistency. Finally, it utilizes a hierarchical prompting strategy to guide MLLMs in performing reasoning before determining final decisions. We conducted extensive experiments on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets. The results demonstrate that EventVAD with a 7B MLLM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) in training-free settings, outperforming strong baselines that use 7B or larger MLLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This study conducts a detailed comparison of RF-DETR object detection base model and YOLOv12 object detection model configurations for detecting greenfruits in a complex orchard environment marked by label ambiguity, occlusions, and background blending. A custom dataset was developed featuring both single-class (greenfruit) and multi-class (occluded and non-occluded greenfruits) annotations to assess model performance under dynamic real-world conditions. RF-DETR object detection model, utilizing a DINOv2 backbone and deformable attention, excelled in global context modeling, effectively identifying partially occluded or ambiguous greenfruits. In contrast, YOLOv12 leveraged CNN-based attention for enhanced local feature extraction, optimizing it for computational efficiency and edge deployment. RF-DETR achieved the highest mean Average Precision (mAP50) of 0.9464 in single-class detection, proving its superior ability to localize greenfruits in cluttered scenes. Although YOLOv12N recorded the highest mAP@50:95 of 0.7620, RF-DETR consistently outperformed in complex spatial scenarios. For multi-class detection, RF-DETR led with an mAP@50 of 0.8298, showing its capability to differentiate between occluded and non-occluded fruits, while YOLOv12L scored highest in mAP@50:95 with 0.6622, indicating better classification in detailed occlusion contexts. Training dynamics analysis highlighted RF-DETR's swift convergence, particularly in single-class settings where it plateaued within 10 epochs, demonstrating the efficiency of transformer-based architectures in adapting to dynamic visual data. These findings validate RF-DETR's effectiveness for precision agricultural applications, with YOLOv12 suited for fast-response scenarios. >Index Terms: RF-DETR object detection, YOLOv12, YOLOv13, YOLOv14, YOLOv15, YOLOE, YOLO World, YOLO, You Only Look Once, Roboflow, Detection Transformers, CNNs</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Flow matching models have emerged as a strong alternative to diffusion models, but existing inversion and editing methods designed for diffusion are often ineffective or inapplicable to them. The straight-line, non-crossing trajectories of flow models pose challenges for diffusion-based approaches but also open avenues for novel solutions. In this paper, we introduce a predictor-corrector-based framework for inversion and editing in flow models. First, we propose Uni-Inv, an effective inversion method designed for accurate reconstruction. Building on this, we extend the concept of delayed injection to flow models and introduce Uni-Edit, a region-aware, robust image editing approach. Our methodology is tuning-free, model-agnostic, efficient, and effective, enabling diverse edits while ensuring strong preservation of edit-irrelevant regions. Extensive experiments across various generative models demonstrate the superiority and generalizability of Uni-Inv and Uni-Edit, even under low-cost settings. Project page: this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, extraction, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep learning-based trajectory prediction models have demonstrated promising capabilities in capturing complex interactions. However, their out-of-distribution generalization remains a significant challenge, particularly due to unbalanced data and a lack of enough data and diversity to ensure robustness and calibration. To address this, we propose SHIFT (Spectral Heteroscedastic Informed Forecasting for Trajectories), a novel framework that uniquely combines well-calibrated uncertainty modeling with informative priors derived through automated rule extraction. SHIFT reformulates trajectory prediction as a classification task and employs heteroscedastic spectral-normalized Gaussian processes to effectively disentangle epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. We learn informative priors from training labels, which are automatically generated from natural language driving rules, such as stop rules and drivability constraints, using a retrieval-augmented generation framework powered by a large language model. Extensive evaluations over the nuScenes dataset, including challenging low-data and cross-location scenarios, demonstrate that SHIFT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving substantial gains in uncertainty calibration and displacement metrics. In particular, our model excels in complex scenarios, such as intersections, where uncertainty is inherently higher. Project page: this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Video Models (LVMs) built upon Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in video understanding but often suffer from misalignment with human intuition and video hallucination issues. To address these challenges, we introduce VistaDPO, a novel framework for Video Hierarchical Spatial-Temporal Direct Preference Optimization. VistaDPO enhances text-video preference alignment across three hierarchical levels: i) Instance Level, aligning overall video content with responses; ii) Temporal Level, aligning video temporal semantics with event descriptions; and iii) Perceptive Level, aligning spatial objects with language tokens. Given the lack of datasets for fine-grained video-language preference alignment, we construct VistaDPO-7k, a dataset of 7.2K QA pairs annotated with chosen and rejected responses, along with spatial-temporal grounding information such as timestamps, keyframes, and bounding boxes. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as Video Hallucination, Video QA, and Captioning performance tasks demonstrate that VistaDPO significantly improves the performance of existing LVMs, effectively mitigating video-language misalignment and hallucination.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In recent years, the field of vision-language model pre-training has experienced rapid advancements, driven primarily by the continuous enhancement of textual capabilities in large language models. However, existing training paradigms for multimodal large language models heavily rely on high-quality image-text pairs. As models and data scales grow exponentially, the availability of such meticulously curated data has become increasingly scarce and saturated, thereby severely limiting further advancements in this domain. This study investigates scalable caption generation techniques for vision-language model pre-training and demonstrates that large-scale low-hallucination synthetic captions can serve dual purposes: 1) acting as a viable alternative to real-world data for pre-training paradigms and 2) achieving superior performance enhancement when integrated into vision-language models through empirical validation. This paper presents three key contributions: 1) a novel pipeline for generating high-quality, low-hallucination, and knowledge-rich synthetic captions. Our continuous DPO methodology yields remarkable results in reducing hallucinations. Specifically, the non-hallucination caption rate on a held-out test set increases from 48.2% to 77.9% for a 7B-size model. 2) Comprehensive empirical validation reveals that our synthetic captions confer superior pre-training advantages over their counterparts. Across 35 vision language tasks, the model trained with our data achieves a significant performance gain of at least 6.2% compared to alt-text pairs and other previous work. Meanwhile, it also offers considerable support in the text-to-image domain. With our dataset, the FID score is reduced by 17.1 on a real-world validation benchmark and 13.3 on the MSCOCO validation benchmark. 3) We will release Hunyuan-Recap100M, a low-hallucination and knowledge-intensive synthetic caption dataset.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present a novel approach to integrating scientific knowledge into generative models, enhancing their realism and consistency in image synthesis. First, we introduce Science-T2I, an expert-annotated adversarial dataset comprising adversarial 20k image pairs with 9k prompts, covering wide distinct scientific knowledge categories. Leveraging Science-T2I, we present SciScore, an end-to-end reward model that refines the assessment of generated images based on scientific knowledge, which is achieved by augmenting both the scientific comprehension and visual capabilities of pre-trained CLIP model. Additionally, based on SciScore, we propose a two-stage training framework, comprising a supervised fine-tuning phase and a masked online fine-tuning phase, to incorporate scientific knowledge into existing generative models. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in establishing new standards for evaluating the scientific realism of generated content. Specifically, SciScore attains performance comparable to human-level, demonstrating a 5% improvement similar to evaluations conducted by experienced human evaluators. Furthermore, by applying our proposed fine-tuning method to FLUX, we achieve a performance enhancement exceeding 50% on SciScore.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Reward models (RMs) are essential for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, they often struggle with capturing complex human preferences and generalizing to unseen data. To address these challenges, we introduce Energy-Based Reward Model (EBRM), a lightweight post-hoc refinement framework that enhances RM robustness and generalization. EBRM models the reward distribution explicitly, capturing uncertainty in human preferences and mitigating the impact of noisy or misaligned annotations. It achieves this through conflict-aware data filtering, label-noise-aware contrastive training, and hybrid initialization. Notably, EBRM enhances RMs without retraining, making it computationally efficient and adaptable across different models and tasks. Empirical evaluations on RM benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements in both robustness and generalization, achieving up to a 5.97% improvement in safety-critical alignment tasks compared to standard RMs. Furthermore, reinforcement learning experiments confirm that our refined rewards enhance alignment quality, effectively delaying reward hacking. These results demonstrate our approach as a scalable and effective enhancement for existing RMs and alignment pipelines. The code is available at EBRM.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>A wide range of LM applications require generating text that conforms to syntactic or semantic constraints. Imposing such constraints can be naturally framed as probabilistic conditioning, but exact generation from the resulting distribution -- which can differ substantially from the LM's base distribution -- is generally intractable. In this work, we develop an architecture for controlled LM generation based on sequential Monte Carlo (SMC). Our SMC framework allows us to flexibly incorporate domain- and problem-specific constraints at inference time, and efficiently reallocate computational resources in light of new information during the course of generation. By comparing to a number of alternatives and ablations on four challenging domains -- Python code generation for data science, text-to-SQL, goal inference, and molecule synthesis -- we demonstrate that, with little overhead, our approach allows small open-source language models to outperform models over 8x larger, as well as closed-source, fine-tuned ones. In support of the probabilistic perspective, we show that these performance improvements are driven by better approximation to the posterior distribution. Our system builds on the framework of Lew et al. (2023) and integrates with its language model probabilistic programming language, giving users a simple, programmable way to apply SMC to a broad variety of controlled generation problems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Human action recognition (HAR) has achieved impressive results with deep learning models, but their decision-making process remains opaque due to their black-box nature. Ensuring interpretability is crucial, especially for real-world applications requiring transparency and accountability. Existing video XAI methods primarily rely on feature attribution or static textual concepts, both of which struggle to capture motion dynamics and temporal dependencies essential for action understanding. To address these challenges, we propose Pose Concept Bottleneck for Explainable Action Recognition (PCBEAR), a novel concept bottleneck framework that introduces human pose sequences as motion-aware, structured concepts for video action recognition. Unlike methods based on pixel-level features or static textual descriptions, PCBEAR leverages human skeleton poses, which focus solely on body movements, providing robust and interpretable explanations of motion dynamics. We define two types of pose-based concepts: static pose concepts for spatial configurations at individual frames, and dynamic pose concepts for motion patterns across multiple frames. To construct these concepts, PCBEAR applies clustering to video pose sequences, allowing for automatic discovery of meaningful concepts without manual annotation. We validate PCBEAR on KTH, Penn-Action, and HAA500, showing that it achieves high classification performance while offering interpretable, motion-driven explanations. Our method provides both strong predictive performance and human-understandable insights into the model's reasoning process, enabling test-time interventions for debugging and improving model behavior.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>How can we know whether new mechanistic interpretability methods achieve real improvements? In pursuit of meaningful and lasting evaluation standards, we propose MIB, a benchmark with two tracks spanning four tasks and five models. MIB favors methods that precisely and concisely recover relevant causal pathways or specific causal variables in neural language models. The circuit localization track compares methods that locate the model components - and connections between them - most important for performing a task (e.g., attribution patching or information flow routes). The causal variable localization track compares methods that featurize a hidden vector, e.g., sparse autoencoders (SAEs) or distributed alignment search (DAS), and locate model features for a causal variable relevant to the task. Using MIB, we find that attribution and mask optimization methods perform best on circuit localization. For causal variable localization, we find that the supervised DAS method performs best, while SAE features are not better than neurons, i.e., standard dimensions of hidden vectors. These findings illustrate that MIB enables meaningful comparisons of methods, and increases our confidence that there has been real progress in the field.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Bridging natural language and 3D geometry is a crucial step toward flexible, language-driven scene understanding. While recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled fast and high-quality scene reconstruction, research has also explored incorporating open-vocabulary understanding into 3DGS. However, most existing methods require iterative optimization over per-view 2D semantic feature maps, which not only results in inefficiencies but also leads to inconsistent 3D semantics across views. To address these limitations, we introduce a training-free framework that constructs a superpoint graph directly from Gaussian primitives. The superpoint graph partitions the scene into spatially compact and semantically coherent regions, forming view-consistent 3D entities and providing a structured foundation for open-vocabulary understanding. Based on the graph structure, we design an efficient reprojection strategy that lifts 2D semantic features onto the superpoints, avoiding costly multi-view iterative training. The resulting representation ensures strong 3D semantic coherence and naturally supports hierarchical understanding, enabling both coarse- and fine-grained open-vocabulary perception within a unified semantic field. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art open-vocabulary segmentation performance, with semantic field reconstruction completed over $30\times$ faster.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Personalized image synthesis has emerged as a pivotal application in text-to-image generation, enabling the creation of images featuring specific subjects in diverse contexts. While diffusion models have dominated this domain, auto-regressive models, with their unified architecture for text and image modeling, remain underexplored for personalized image generation. This paper investigates the potential of optimizing auto-regressive models for personalized image synthesis, leveraging their inherent multimodal capabilities to perform this task. We propose a two-stage training strategy that combines optimization of text embeddings and fine-tuning of transformer layers. Our experiments on the auto-regressive model demonstrate that this method achieves comparable subject fidelity and prompt following to the leading diffusion-based personalization methods. The results highlight the effectiveness of auto-regressive models in personalized image generation, offering a new direction for future research in this area.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Designing efficient and effective architectural backbones has been in the core of research efforts to enhance the capability of foundation models. Inspired by the human cognitive phenomenon of attentional bias-the natural tendency to prioritize certain events or stimuli-we reconceptualize neural architectures, including Transformers, Titans, and modern linear recurrent neural networks as associative memory modules that learn a mapping of keys and values using an internal objective, referred to as attentional bias. Surprisingly, we observed that most existing sequence models leverage either (1) dot-product similarity, or (2) L2 regression objectives as their attentional bias. Going beyond these objectives, we present a set of alternative attentional bias configurations along with their effective approximations to stabilize their training procedure. We then reinterpret forgetting mechanisms in modern deep learning architectures as a form of retention regularization, providing a novel set of forget gates for sequence models. Building upon these insights, we present Miras, a general framework to design deep learning architectures based on four choices of: (i) associative memory architecture, (ii) attentional bias objective, (iii) retention gate, and (iv) memory learning algorithm. We present three novel sequence models-Moneta, Yaad, and Memora-that go beyond the power of existing linear RNNs while maintaining a fast parallelizable training process. Our experiments show different design choices in Miras yield models with varying strengths. For example, certain instances of Miras achieve exceptional performance in special tasks such as language modeling, commonsense reasoning, and recall intensive tasks, even outperforming Transformers and other modern linear recurrent models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose spatial polarization multiplexing (SPM) for reconstructing object shape and reflectance from a single polarimetric image and demonstrate its application to dynamic surface recovery. Although single-pattern structured light enables single-shot shape reconstruction, the reflectance is challenging to recover due to the lack of angular sampling of incident light and the entanglement of the projected pattern and the surface color texture. We design a spatially multiplexed pattern of polarization that can be robustly and uniquely decoded for shape reconstruction by quantizing the AoLP values. At the same time, our spatial-multiplexing enables single-shot ellipsometry of linear polarization by projecting differently polarized light within a local region, which separates the specular and diffuse reflections for BRDF estimation. We achieve this spatial polarization multiplexing with a constrained de Bruijn sequence. Unlike single-pattern structured light with intensity and color, our polarization pattern is invisible to the naked eye and retains the natural surface appearance which is essential for accurate appearance modeling and also interaction with people. We experimentally validate our method on real data. The results show that our method can recover the shape, the Mueller matrix, and the BRDF from a single-shot polarimetric image. We also demonstrate the application of our method to dynamic surfaces.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We adapt alignment techniques from reasoning LLMs to the task of generating engineering sketch constraints found in computer-aided design (CAD) models. Engineering sketches consist of geometric primitives (e.g. points, lines) connected by constraints (e.g. perpendicular, tangent) that define the relationships between them. For a design to be easily editable, the constraints must effectively capture design intent, ensuring the geometry updates predictably when parameters change. Although current approaches can generate CAD designs, an open challenge remains to align model outputs with design intent, we label this problem `design alignment'. A critical first step towards aligning generative CAD models is to generate constraints which fully-constrain all geometric primitives, without over-constraining or distorting sketch geometry. Using alignment techniques to train an existing constraint generation model with feedback from a constraint solver, we are able to fully-constrain 93% of sketches compared to 34% when using a naïve supervised fine-tuning (SFT) baseline and only 8.9% without alignment. Our approach can be applied to any existing constraint generation model and sets the stage for further research bridging alignment strategies between the language and design domains.</li>

Traditionally, vision encoders have relied on a variety of pretraining objectives, each tailored to specific downstream tasks such as classification, captioning, or localization. Surprisingly, after scaling our carefully tuned image pretraining recipe and refining with our robust video data engine, we find that contrastive vision-language training alone can produce strong, general embeddings for all of these downstream tasks. There is only one caveat: these embeddings are hidden within the intermediate layers of the network. To draw them out, we introduce two alignment methods, language alignment for multimodal language modeling, and spatial alignment for dense prediction. Together with the core contrastive checkpoint, our PE family of models achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide variety of tasks, including zero-shot image and video classification and retrieval; document, image, and video Q&A; and spatial tasks such as detection, depth estimation, and tracking. To foster further research, we are releasing our models, code, and a novel dataset of synthetically and human-annotated videos.</li>
