<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The current Domain Name System (DNS) infrastructure faces critical vulnerabilities including poisoning attacks, censorship mechanisms, and centralized points of failure that compromise internet freedom and security. Recent incidents such as DNS poisoning attacks on ISP customers highlight the urgent need for resilient alternatives. This paper presents a novel blockchain-based Decentralized Domain Name System (DDNS). We designed a specialized Proof-of-Work blockchain to maximize support for DNS-related protocols and achieve node decentralization. The system integrates our blockchain with IPFS for distributed storage, implements cryptographic primitives for end-to-end trust signatures, and achieves Never Trust, Always Verify zero-trust verification. Our implementation achieves 15-second domain record propagation times, supports 20 standard DNS record types, and provides perpetual free .ddns domains. The system has been deployed across distributed infrastructure in San Jose, Los Angeles, and Orange County, demonstrating practical scalability and resistance to traditional DNS manipulation techniques. Performance evaluation shows the system can handle up to Max Theor. TPS 1,111.1 tx/s (minimal transactions) and Max Theor. TPS 266.7 tx/s (regular transactions) for domain operations while maintaining sub-second query resolution through intelligent caching mechanisms.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, security, attack, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Game theory has long served as a foundational tool in cybersecurity to test, predict, and design strategic interactions between attackers and defenders. The recent advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers new tools and challenges for the security of computer systems; In this work, we investigate whether classical game-theoretic frameworks can effectively capture the behaviours of LLM-driven actors and bots. Using a reproducible framework for game-theoretic LLM agents, we investigate two canonical scenarios -- the one-shot zero-sum game and the dynamic Prisoner's Dilemma -- and we test whether LLMs converge to expected outcomes or exhibit deviations due to embedded biases. Our experiments involve four state-of-the-art LLMs and span five natural languages, English, French, Arabic, Vietnamese, and Mandarin Chinese, to assess linguistic sensitivity. For both games, we observe that the final payoffs are influenced by agents characteristics such as personality traits or knowledge of repeated rounds. Moreover, we uncover an unexpected sensitivity of the final payoffs to the choice of languages, which should warn against indiscriminate application of LLMs in cybersecurity applications and call for in-depth studies, as LLMs may behave differently when deployed in different countries. We also employ quantitative metrics to evaluate the internal consistency and cross-language stability of LLM agents, to help guide the selection of the most stable LLMs and optimising models for secure applications.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As large language models (LLMs) and generative AI become increasingly integrated into customer service and moderation applications, adversarial threats emerge from both external manipulations and internal label corruption. In this work, we identify and systematically address these dual adversarial threats by introducing DINA (Dual Defense Against Internal Noise and Adversarial Attacks), a novel unified framework tailored specifically for NLP. Our approach adapts advanced noisy-label learning methods from computer vision and integrates them with adversarial training to simultaneously mitigate internal label sabotage and external adversarial perturbations. Extensive experiments conducted on a real-world dataset from an online gaming service demonstrate that DINA significantly improves model robustness and accuracy compared to baseline models. Our findings not only highlight the critical necessity of dual-threat defenses but also offer practical strategies for safeguarding NLP systems in realistic adversarial scenarios, underscoring broader implications for fair and responsible AI deployment.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in LLM agentic systems have improved the automation of offensive security tasks, particularly for Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges. We systematically investigate the key factors that drive agent success and provide a detailed recipe for building effective LLM-based offensive security agents. First, we present CTFJudge, a framework leveraging LLM as a judge to analyze agent trajectories and provide granular evaluation across CTF solving steps. Second, we propose a novel metric, CTF Competency Index (CCI) for partial correctness, revealing how closely agent solutions align with human-crafted gold standards. Third, we examine how LLM hyperparameters, namely temperature, top-p, and maximum token length, influence agent performance and automated cybersecurity task planning. For rapid evaluation, we present CTFTiny, a curated benchmark of 50 representative CTF challenges across binary exploitation, web, reverse engineering, forensics, and cryptography. Our findings identify optimal multi-agent coordination settings and lay the groundwork for future LLM agent research in cybersecurity. We make CTFTiny open source to public this https URL along with CTFJudge on this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, protect, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent years have witnessed growing interest in adopting large language models (LLMs) for Register Transfer Level (RTL) code optimization. While powerful cloud-based LLMs offer superior optimization capabilities, they pose unacceptable intellectual property (IP) leakage risks when processing proprietary hardware designs. In this paper, we propose a new scenario where Verilog code must be optimized for specific attributes without leaking sensitive IP information. We introduce the first IP-preserving edge-cloud collaborative framework that leverages the benefits of both paradigms. Our approach employs local small LLMs (e.g., Qwen-2.5-Coder-7B) to perform secure comparative analysis between paired high-quality target designs and novice draft codes, yielding general design principles that summarize key insights for improvements. These principles are then used to query stronger cloud LLMs (e.g., Deepseek-V3) for targeted code improvement, ensuring that only abstracted and IP-safe guidance reaches external services. Our experimental results demonstrate that the framework achieves significantly higher optimization success rates compared to baseline methods. For example, combining Qwen-2.5-Coder-7B and Deepseek-V3 achieves a 66.67\% optimization success rate for power utilization, outperforming Deepseek-V3 alone (49.81\%) and even commercial models like GPT-4o (55.81\%). Further investigation of local and cloud LLM combinations reveals that different model pairings exhibit varying strengths for specific optimization objectives, with interesting trends emerging when varying the number of comparative code pairs. Our work establishes a new paradigm for secure hardware design optimization that balances performance gains with IP protection.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>RL-based medical questionnaire systems have shown great potential in medical scenarios. However, their safety and robustness remain unresolved. This study performs a comprehensive evaluation on adversarial attack methods to identify and analyze their potential vulnerabilities. We formulate the diagnosis process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), where the state is the patient responses and unasked questions, and the action is either to ask a question or to make a diagnosis. We implemented six prevailing major attack methods, including the Fast Gradient Signed Method (FGSM), Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), Carlini & Wagner Attack (C&W) attack, Basic Iterative Method (BIM), DeepFool, and AutoAttack, with seven epsilon values each. To ensure the generated adversarial examples remain clinically plausible, we developed a comprehensive medical validation framework consisting of 247 medical constraints, including physiological bounds, symptom correlations, and conditional medical constraints. We achieved a 97.6% success rate in generating clinically plausible adversarial samples. We performed our experiment on the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) dataset (this https URL), which consists of 182,630 samples, to predict the participant's 4-year mortality rate. We evaluated our attacks on the AdaptiveFS framework proposed in arXiv:2004.00994. Our results show that adversarial attacks could significantly impact the diagnostic accuracy, with attack success rates ranging from 33.08% (FGSM) to 64.70% (AutoAttack). Our work has demonstrated that even under strict medical constraints on the input, such RL-based medical questionnaire systems still show significant vulnerabilities.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Active learning(AL), which serves as the representative label-efficient learning paradigm, has been widely applied in resource-constrained scenarios. The achievement of AL is attributed to acquisition functions, which are designed for identifying the most important data to label. Despite this success, one question remains unanswered: is AL safe? In this work, we introduce ALA, a practical and the first framework to utilize the acquisition function as the poisoning attack surface to reveal the weakness of active learning. Specifically, ALA optimizes imperceptibly poisoned inputs to exhibit high uncertainty scores, increasing their probability of being selected by acquisition functions. To evaluate ALA, we conduct extensive experiments across three datasets, three acquisition functions, and two types of clean-label backdoor triggers. Results show that our attack can achieve high success rates (up to 94%) even under low poisoning budgets (0.5%-1.0%) while preserving model utility and remaining undetectable to human annotators. Our findings remind active learning users: acquisition functions can be easily exploited, and active learning should be deployed with caution in trusted data scenarios.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The proliferation of multi-modal fake news on social media poses a significant threat to public trust and social stability. Traditional detection methods, primarily text-based, often fall short due to the deceptive interplay between misleading text and images. While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) offer promising avenues for multi-modal understanding, effectively fusing diverse modal information, especially when their importance is imbalanced or contradictory, remains a critical challenge. This paper introduces MM-FusionNet, an innovative framework leveraging LVLMs for robust multi-modal fake news detection. Our core contribution is the Context-Aware Dynamic Fusion Module (CADFM), which employs bi-directional cross-modal attention and a novel dynamic modal gating network. This mechanism adaptively learns and assigns importance weights to textual and visual features based on their contextual relevance, enabling intelligent prioritization of information. Evaluated on the large-scale Multi-modal Fake News Dataset (LMFND) comprising 80,000 samples, MM-FusionNet achieves a state-of-the-art F1-score of 0.938, surpassing existing multi-modal baselines by approximately 0.5% and significantly outperforming single-modal approaches. Further analysis demonstrates the model's dynamic weighting capabilities, its robustness to modality perturbations, and performance remarkably close to human-level, underscoring its practical efficacy and interpretability for real-world fake news detection.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep neural networks are susceptible to adversarial examples while suffering from incorrect predictions via imperceptible perturbations. Transfer-based attacks create adversarial examples for surrogate models and transfer these examples to target models under black-box scenarios. Recent studies reveal that adversarial examples in flat loss landscapes exhibit superior transferability to alleviate overfitting on surrogate models. However, the prior arts overlook the influence of perturbation directions, resulting in limited transferability. In this paper, we propose a novel attack method, named Residual Perturbation Attack (ResPA), relying on the residual gradient as the perturbation direction to guide the adversarial examples toward the flat regions of the loss function. Specifically, ResPA conducts an exponential moving average on the input gradients to obtain the first moment as the reference gradient, which encompasses the direction of historical gradients. Instead of heavily relying on the local flatness that stems from the current gradients as the perturbation direction, ResPA further considers the residual between the current gradient and the reference gradient to capture the changes in the global perturbation direction. The experimental results demonstrate the better transferability of ResPA than the existing typical transfer-based attack methods, while the transferability can be further improved by combining ResPA with the current input transformation methods.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, transformer, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Database systems are extensively used to store critical data across various domains. However, the frequency of abnormal database access behaviors, such as database intrusion by internal and external attacks, continues to rise. Internal masqueraders often have greater organizational knowledge, making it easier to mimic employee behavior effectively. In contrast, external masqueraders may behave differently due to their lack of familiarity with the organization. Current approaches lack the granularity needed to detect anomalies at the operational level, frequently misclassifying entire sequences of operations as anomalies, even though most operations are likely to represent normal behavior. On the other hand, some anomalous behaviors often resemble normal activities, making them difficult for existing detection methods to identify. This paper introduces a two-tiered anomaly detection approach for Structured Query Language (SQL) using the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model, specifically DistilBERT, a more efficient, pre-trained version. Our method combines both unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques to accurately identify anomalous activities while minimizing the need for data labeling. First, the unsupervised method uses ensemble anomaly detectors that flag embedding vectors distant from learned normal patterns of typical user behavior across the database (out-of-scope queries). Second, the supervised method uses fine-tuned transformer-based models to detect internal attacks with high precision (in-scope queries), using role-labeled classification, even on limited labeled SQL data. Our findings make a significant contribution by providing an effective solution for safeguarding critical database systems from sophisticated threats.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, robust, diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative models are increasingly adopted in high-stakes domains, yet current deployments offer no mechanisms to verify the origin of model outputs. We address this gap by extending model fingerprinting techniques beyond the traditional collaborative setting to one where the model provider may act adversarially. To our knowledge, this is the first work to evaluate fingerprinting for provenance attribution under such a threat model. The methods rely on a trusted verifier that extracts secret fingerprints from the model's output space, unknown to the provider, and trains a model to predict and verify them. Our empirical evaluation shows that our methods achieve near-zero FPR@95%TPR for instances of GAN and diffusion models, even when tested on small modifications to the original architecture and training data. Moreover, the methods remain robust against adversarial attacks that actively modify the outputs to bypass detection. Source codes are available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Insider threat detection (ITD) poses a persistent and high-impact challenge in cybersecurity due to the subtle, long-term, and context-dependent nature of malicious insider behaviors. Traditional models often struggle to capture semantic intent and complex behavior dynamics, while existing LLM-based solutions face limitations in prompt adaptability and modality coverage. To bridge this gap, we propose DMFI, a dual-modality framework that integrates semantic inference with behavior-aware fine-tuning. DMFI converts raw logs into two structured views: (1) a semantic view that processes content-rich artifacts (e.g., emails, https) using instruction-formatted prompts; and (2) a behavioral abstraction, constructed via a 4W-guided (When-Where-What-Which) transformation to encode contextual action sequences. Two LoRA-enhanced LLMs are fine-tuned independently, and their outputs are fused via a lightweight MLP-based decision module. We further introduce DMFI-B, a discriminative adaptation strategy that separates normal and abnormal behavior representations, improving robustness under severe class imbalance. Experiments on CERT r4.2 and r5.2 datasets demonstrate that DMFI outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detection accuracy. Our approach combines the semantic reasoning power of LLMs with structured behavior modeling, offering a scalable and effective solution for real-world insider threat detection. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of combining LLM reasoning with structured behavioral modeling, offering a scalable and deployable solution for modern insider threat detection.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Enterprises are facing increasing risks of insider threats, while existing detection methods are unable to effectively address these challenges due to reasons such as insufficient temporal dynamic feature modeling, computational efficiency and real-time bottlenecks and cross-modal information island problem. This paper proposes a new insider threat detection framework MambaITD based on the Mamba state space model and cross-modal adaptive fusion. First, the multi-source log preprocessing module aligns heterogeneous data through behavioral sequence encoding, interval smoothing, and statistical feature extraction. Second, the Mamba encoder models long-range dependencies in behavioral and interval sequences, and combines the sequence and statistical information dynamically in combination with the gated feature fusion mechanism. Finally, we propose an adaptive threshold optimization method based on maximizing inter-class variance, which dynamically adjusts the decision threshold by analyzing the probability distribution, effectively identifies anomalies, and alleviates class imbalance and concept drift. Compared with traditional methods, MambaITD shows significant advantages in modeling efficiency and feature fusion capabilities, outperforming Transformer-based methods, and provides a more effective solution for insider threat detection.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Insider threat detection presents a significant challenge due to the deceptive nature of malicious behaviors, which often resemble legitimate user operations. However, existing approaches typically model system logs as flat event sequences, thereby failing to capture the inherent frequency dynamics and multiscale disturbance patterns embedded in user behavior. To address these limitations, we propose Log2Sig, a robust anomaly detection framework that transforms user logs into multivariate behavioral frequency signals, introducing a novel representation of user behavior. Log2Sig employs Multivariate Variational Mode Decomposition (MVMD) to extract Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs), which reveal behavioral fluctuations across multiple temporal scales. Based on this, the model further performs joint modeling of behavioral sequences and frequency-decomposed signals: the daily behavior sequences are encoded using a Mamba-based temporal encoder to capture long-term dependencies, while the corresponding frequency components are linearly projected to match the encoder's output dimension. These dual-view representations are then fused to construct a comprehensive user behavior profile, which is fed into a multilayer perceptron for precise anomaly detection. Experimental results on the CERT r4.2 and r5.2 datasets demonstrate that Log2Sig significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and F1 score.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in large-scale text-to-image diffusion models have heightened concerns about their potential misuse, especially in generating harmful or misleading content. This underscores the urgent need for effective machine unlearning, i.e., removing specific knowledge or concepts from pretrained models without compromising overall performance. One possible approach is Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which offers an efficient means to fine-tune models for targeted unlearning. However, LoRA often inadvertently alters unrelated content, leading to diminished image fidelity and realism. To address this limitation, we introduce UnGuide -- a novel approach which incorporates UnGuidance, a dynamic inference mechanism that leverages Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) to exert precise control over the unlearning process. UnGuide modulates the guidance scale based on the stability of a few first steps of denoising processes, enabling selective unlearning by LoRA adapter. For prompts containing the erased concept, the LoRA module predominates and is counterbalanced by the base model; for unrelated prompts, the base model governs generation, preserving content fidelity. Empirical results demonstrate that UnGuide achieves controlled concept removal and retains the expressive power of diffusion models, outperforming existing LoRA-based methods in both object erasure and explicit content removal tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Artistic style transfer has long been possible with the advancements of convolution- and transformer-based neural networks. Most algorithms apply the artistic style transfer to the whole image, but individual users may only need to apply a style transfer to a specific region in the image. The standard practice is to simply mask the image after the stylization. This work shows that this approach tends to improperly capture the style features in the region of interest. We propose a partial-convolution-based style transfer network that accurately applies the style features exclusively to the region of interest. Additionally, we present network-internal blending techniques that account for imperfections in the region selection. We show that this visually and quantitatively improves stylization using examples from the SA-1B dataset. Code is publicly available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Medical image synthesis is an important topic for both clinical and research applications. Recently, diffusion models have become a leading approach in this area. Despite their strengths, many existing methods struggle with (1) limited generalizability that only work for specific body regions or voxel spacings, (2) slow inference, which is a common issue for diffusion models, and (3) weak alignment with input conditions, which is a critical issue for medical imaging. MAISI, a previously proposed framework, addresses generalizability issues but still suffers from slow inference and limited condition consistency. In this work, we present MAISI-v2, the first accelerated 3D medical image synthesis framework that integrates rectified flow to enable fast and high quality generation. To further enhance condition fidelity, we introduce a novel region-specific contrastive loss to enhance the sensitivity to region of interest. Our experiments show that MAISI-v2 can achieve SOTA image quality with $33 \times$ acceleration for latent diffusion model. We also conducted a downstream segmentation experiment to show that the synthetic images can be used for data augmentation. We release our code, training details, model weights, and a GUI demo to facilitate reproducibility and promote further development within the community.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>defense, attack, robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized content creation across digital platforms, offering unprecedented capabilities in natural language generation and understanding. These models enable beneficial applications such as content generation, question and answering (Q&A), programming, and code reasoning. Meanwhile, they also pose serious risks by inadvertently or intentionally producing toxic, offensive, or biased content. This dual role of LLMs, both as powerful tools for solving real-world problems and as potential sources of harmful language, presents a pressing sociotechnical challenge. In this survey, we systematically review recent studies spanning unintentional toxicity, adversarial jailbreaking attacks, and content moderation techniques. We propose a unified taxonomy of LLM-related harms and defenses, analyze emerging multimodal and LLM-assisted jailbreak strategies, and assess mitigation efforts, including reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), prompt engineering, and safety alignment. Our synthesis highlights the evolving landscape of LLM safety, identifies limitations in current evaluation methodologies, and outlines future research directions to guide the development of robust and ethically aligned language technologies.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to produce hallucinations - factually incorrect or fabricated information - which poses significant challenges for many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, such as dialogue systems. As a result, detecting hallucinations has become a critical area of research. Current approaches to hallucination detection in dialogue systems primarily focus on verifying the factual consistency of generated responses. However, these responses often contain a mix of accurate, inaccurate or unverifiable facts, making one factual label overly simplistic and coarse-grained. In this paper, we introduce a benchmark, FineDialFact, for fine-grained dialogue fact verification, which involves verifying atomic facts extracted from dialogue responses. To support this, we construct a dataset based on publicly available dialogue datasets and evaluate it using various baseline methods. Experimental results demonstrate that methods incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning can enhance performance in dialogue fact verification. Despite this, the best F1-score achieved on the HybriDialogue, an open-domain dialogue dataset, is only 0.75, indicating that the benchmark remains a challenging task for future research. Our dataset and code will be public on GitHub.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Machine learning using transformers has shown great potential in medical imaging, but its real-world applicability remains limited due to the scarcity of annotated data. In this study, we propose a practical framework for the few-shot deployment of pretrained MRI transformers in diverse brain imaging tasks. By utilizing the Masked Autoencoder (MAE) pretraining strategy on a large-scale, multi-cohort brain MRI dataset comprising over 31 million slices, we obtain highly transferable latent representations that generalize well across tasks and datasets. For high-level tasks such as classification, a frozen MAE encoder combined with a lightweight linear head achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in MRI sequence identification with minimal supervision. For low-level tasks such as segmentation, we propose MAE-FUnet, a hybrid architecture that fuses multiscale CNN features with pretrained MAE embeddings. This model consistently outperforms other strong baselines in both skull stripping and multi-class anatomical segmentation under data-limited conditions. With extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations, our framework demonstrates efficiency, stability, and scalability, suggesting its suitability for low-resource clinical environments and broader neuroimaging applications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Accurate distribution grid topology is essential for reliable modern grid operations. However, real-world utility data originates from multiple sources with varying characteristics and levels of quality. In this work, developed in collaboration with Oncor Electric Delivery, we propose a scalable framework that reconstructs a trustworthy grid topology by systematically integrating heterogeneous data. We observe that distribution topology is fundamentally governed by two complementary dimensions: the spatial layout of physical infrastructure (e.g., GIS and asset metadata) and the dynamic behavior of the system in the signal domain (e.g., voltage time series). When jointly leveraged, these dimensions support a complete and physically coherent reconstruction of network connectivity. To address the challenge of uneven data quality without compromising observability, we introduce a confidence-aware inference mechanism that preserves structurally informative yet imperfect inputs, while quantifying the reliability of each inferred connection for operator interpretation. This soft handling of uncertainty is tightly coupled with hard enforcement of physical feasibility: we embed operational constraints, such as transformer capacity limits and radial topology requirements, directly into the learning process. Together, these components ensure that inference is both uncertainty-aware and structurally valid, enabling rapid convergence to actionable, trustworthy topologies under real-world deployment conditions. The proposed framework is validated using data from over 8000 meters across 3 feeders in Oncor's service territory, demonstrating over 95% accuracy in topology reconstruction and substantial improvements in confidence calibration and computational efficiency relative to baseline methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Human memory is fleeting. As words are processed, the exact wordforms that make up incoming sentences are rapidly lost. Cognitive scientists have long believed that this limitation of memory may, paradoxically, help in learning language - an idea supported by classic connectionist modelling work. The rise of Transformers appears to challenge this idea, as these models can learn language effectively, despite lacking memory limitations or other architectural recency biases. Here, we investigate the hypothesized benefit of fleeting memory for language learning in tightly controlled experiments on transformer language models. Training transformers with and without fleeting memory on a developmentally realistic training set, we find that fleeting memory consistently improves language learning (as quantified by both overall language modelling performance and targeted syntactic evaluation) but, unexpectedly, impairs surprisal-based prediction of human reading times. Interestingly, follow up analyses revealed that this discrepancy - better language modeling, yet worse reading time prediction - could not be accounted for by prior explanations of why better language models sometimes fit human reading time worse. Together, these results support a benefit of memory limitations on neural network language learning - but not on predicting behavior.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The task of style transfer for 3D Gaussian splats has been explored in many previous works, but these require reconstructing or fine-tuning the splat while incorporating style information or optimizing a feature extraction network on the splat representation. We propose a reconstruction- and optimization-free approach to stylizing 3D Gaussian splats. This is done by generating a graph structure across the implicit surface of the splat representation. A feed-forward, surface-based stylization method is then used and interpolated back to the individual splats in the scene. This allows for any style image and 3D Gaussian splat to be used without any additional training or optimization. This also allows for fast stylization of splats, achieving speeds under 2 minutes even on consumer-grade hardware. We demonstrate the quality results this approach achieves and compare to other 3D Gaussian splat style transfer methods. Code is publicly available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Promptable video object segmentation and tracking (VOST) has seen significant advances with the emergence of foundation models like Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2); however, their application in surgical video analysis remains challenging due to complex motion dynamics and the redundancy of memory that impedes effective learning. In this work, we propose TSMS-SAM2, a novel framework that enhances promptable VOST in surgical videos by addressing challenges of rapid object motion and memory redundancy in SAM2. TSMS-SAM2 introduces two key strategies: multi-temporal-scale video sampling augmentation to improve robustness against motion variability, and a memory splitting and pruning mechanism that organizes and filters past frame features for more efficient and accurate segmentation. Evaluated on EndoVis2017 and EndoVis2018 datasets, TSMS-SAM2 achieved the highest mean Dice scores of 95.24 and 86.73, respectively, outperforming prior SAM-based and task-specific methods. Extensive ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of multiscale temporal augmentation and memory splitting, highlighting the framework's potential for robust, efficient segmentation in complex surgical scenarios.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Across scientific domains, a fundamental challenge is to characterize and compute the mappings from underlying physical processes to observed signals and measurements. While nonlinear neural networks have achieved considerable success, they remain theoretically opaque, which hinders adoption in contexts where interpretability is paramount. In contrast, linear neural networks serve as a simple yet effective foundation for gaining insight into these complex relationships. In this work, we develop a unified theoretical framework for analyzing linear encoder-decoder architectures through the lens of Bayes risk minimization for solving data-driven scientific machine learning problems. We derive closed-form, rank-constrained linear and affine linear optimal mappings for forward modeling and inverse recovery tasks. Our results generalize existing formulations by accommodating rank-deficiencies in data, forward operators, and measurement processes. We validate our theoretical results by conducting numerical experiments on datasets from simple biomedical imaging, financial factor analysis, and simulations involving nonlinear fluid dynamics via the shallow water equations. This work provides a robust baseline for understanding and benchmarking learned neural network models for scientific machine learning problems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Textual Attribute Graphs (TAGs) are critical for modeling complex networks like citation networks, but effective node classification remains challenging due to difficulties in integrating rich semantics from text with structural graph information. Existing methods often struggle with capturing nuanced domain-specific terminology, modeling long-range dependencies, adapting to temporal evolution, and scaling to massive datasets. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework that integrates TAPE (Text-Attributed Graph Representation Enhancement) with Graphormer. Our approach leverages a large language model (LLM), specifically ChatGPT, within the TAPE framework to generate semantically rich explanations from paper content, which are then fused into enhanced node representations. These embeddings are combined with structural features using a novel integration layer with learned attention weights. Graphormer's path-aware position encoding and multi-head attention mechanisms are employed to effectively capture long-range dependencies across the citation network. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on the challenging ogbn-arxiv dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a classification accuracy of 0.772, significantly surpassing the best GCN baseline of 0.713. Our method also yields strong results in precision (0.671), recall (0.577), and F1-score (0.610). We validate our approach through comprehensive ablation studies that quantify the contribution of each component, demonstrating the synergy between semantic and structural information. Our framework provides a scalable and robust solution for node classification in dynamic TAGs, offering a promising direction for future research in knowledge systems and scientific discovery.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vision Transformers have substantially advanced the capabilities of segmentation models across both image and video domains. Among them, the Swin Transformer stands out for its ability to capture hierarchical, multi-scale representations, making it a popular backbone for segmentation in videos. However, despite its window-attention scheme, it still incurs a high computational cost, especially in larger variants commonly used for dense prediction in videos. This remains a major bottleneck for real-time, resource-constrained applications. Whilst token reduction methods have been proposed to alleviate this, the window-based attention mechanism of Swin requires a fixed number of tokens per window, limiting the applicability of conventional pruning techniques. Meanwhile, training-free token clustering approaches have shown promise in image segmentation while maintaining window consistency. Nevertheless, they fail to exploit temporal redundancy, missing a key opportunity to further optimize video segmentation performance. We introduce Temporal Cluster Assignment (TCA), a lightweight and effective, fine-tuning-free strategy that enhances token clustering by leveraging temporal coherence across frames. Instead of indiscriminately dropping redundant tokens, TCA refines token clusters using temporal correlations, thereby retaining fine-grained details while significantly reducing computation. Extensive evaluations on YouTube-VIS 2019, YouTube-VIS 2021, OVIS, and a private surgical video dataset show that TCA consistently boosts the accuracy-speed trade-off of existing clustering-based methods. Our results demonstrate that TCA generalizes competently across both natural and domain-specific videos.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Driver visual attention prediction is a critical task in autonomous driving and human-computer interaction (HCI) research. Most prior studies focus on estimating attention allocation at a single moment in time, typically using static RGB images such as driving scene pictures. In this work, we propose a vision-language framework that models the changing landscape of drivers' gaze through natural language, using few-shot and zero-shot learning on single RGB images. We curate and refine high-quality captions from the BDD-A dataset using human-in-the-loop feedback, then fine-tune LLaVA to align visual perception with attention-centric scene understanding. Our approach integrates both low-level cues and top-down context (e.g., route semantics, risk anticipation), enabling language-based descriptions of gaze behavior. We evaluate performance across training regimes (few shot, and one-shot) and introduce domain-specific metrics for semantic alignment and response diversity. Results show that our fine-tuned model outperforms general-purpose VLMs in attention shift detection and interpretability. To our knowledge, this is among the first attempts to generate driver visual attention allocation and shifting predictions in natural language, offering a new direction for explainable AI in autonomous driving. Our approach provides a foundation for downstream tasks such as behavior forecasting, human-AI teaming, and multi-agent coordination.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Blockchain technology offers a promising foundation for modernizing E-Voting systems by enhancing transparency, decentralization, and security. Yet, real-world adoption remains limited due to persistent challenges such as scalability constraints, high computational demands, and complex privacy requirements. This paper presents a comparative framework for analyzing blockchain-based E-Voting architectures, consensus mechanisms, and cryptographic protocols. We examine the limitations of prevalent models like Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, and Delegated Proof of Stake, and propose optimization strategies that include hybrid consensus, lightweight cryptography, and decentralized identity management. Additionally, we explore the novel role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in smart contract generation, anomaly detection, and user interaction. Our findings offer a foundation for designing secure, scalable, and intelligent blockchain-based E-Voting systems suitable for national-scale deployment. This work lays the groundwork for building an end-to-end blockchain E-Voting prototype enhanced by LLM-guided smart contract generation and validation, supported by a systematic framework and simulation-based analysis.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Affective Computing has been established as a crucial field of inquiry to advance the holistic development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. Foundation models -- especially Large Language Models (LLMs) -- have been evaluated, trained, or instruction-tuned in several past works, to become better predictors or generators of emotion. Most of these studies, however, approach emotion-related tasks in a supervised manner, assessing or training the capabilities of LLMs using discrete emotion labels associated with stimuli (e.g., text, images, video, audio). Evaluation studies, in particular, have often been limited to standard and superficial emotion-related tasks, such as the recognition of evoked or expressed emotions. In this paper, we move beyond surface-level emotion tasks to investigate how LLMs reason about emotions through cognitive dimensions. Drawing from cognitive appraisal theory, we examine whether LLMs produce coherent and plausible cognitive reasoning when reasoning about emotionally charged stimuli. We introduce a large-scale benchmark on Cognitive Reasoning for Emotions - CoRE - to evaluate internal cognitive structures implicitly used by LLMs for emotional reasoning. Through a plethora of evaluation experiments and analysis, we seek to answer: (a) Are models more likely to implicitly rely on specific cognitive appraisal dimensions?, (b) What cognitive dimensions are important for characterizing specific emotions?, and, (c) Can the internal representations of different emotion categories in LLMs be interpreted through cognitive appraisal dimensions? Our results and analyses reveal diverse reasoning patterns across different LLMs. Our benchmark and code will be made publicly available.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>3D scene generation plays a crucial role in gaming, artistic creation, virtual reality and many other domains. However, current 3D scene design still relies heavily on extensive manual effort from creators, and existing automated methods struggle to generate open-domain scenes or support flexible editing. As a result, generating 3D worlds directly from text has garnered increasing attention. In this paper, we introduce HOLODECK 2.0, an advanced vision-language-guided framework for 3D world generation with support for interactive scene editing based on human feedback. HOLODECK 2.0 can generate diverse and stylistically rich 3D scenes (e.g., realistic, cartoon, anime, and cyberpunk styles) that exhibit high semantic fidelity to fine-grained input descriptions, suitable for both indoor and open-domain environments. HOLODECK 2.0 leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to identify and parse the objects required in a scene and generates corresponding high-quality assets via state-of-the-art 3D generative models. It then iteratively applies spatial constraints derived from the VLMs to achieve semantically coherent and physically plausible layouts. Human evaluations and CLIP-based assessments demonstrate that HOLODECK 2.0 effectively generates high-quality scenes closely aligned with detailed textual descriptions, consistently outperforming baselines across indoor and open-domain scenarios. Additionally, we provide editing capabilities that flexibly adapt to human feedback, supporting layout refinement and style-consistent object edits. Finally, we present a practical application of HOLODECK 2.0 in procedural game modeling, generating visually rich and immersive environments, potentially boosting efficiency.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present \textit{RopStitch}, an unsupervised deep image stitching framework with both robustness and naturalness. To ensure the robustness of \textit{RopStitch}, we propose to incorporate the universal prior of content perception into the image stitching model by a dual-branch architecture. It separately captures coarse and fine features and integrates them to achieve highly generalizable performance across diverse unseen real-world scenes. Concretely, the dual-branch model consists of a pretrained branch to capture semantically invariant representations and a learnable branch to extract fine-grained discriminative features, which are then merged into a whole by a controllable factor at the correlation level. Besides, considering that content alignment and structural preservation are often contradictory to each other, we propose a concept of virtual optimal planes to relieve this conflict. To this end, we model this problem as a process of estimating homography decomposition coefficients, and design an iterative coefficient predictor and minimal semantic distortion constraint to identify the optimal plane. This scheme is finally incorporated into \textit{RopStitch} by warping both views onto the optimal plane bidirectionally. Extensive experiments across various datasets demonstrate that \textit{RopStitch} significantly outperforms existing methods, particularly in scene robustness and content naturalness.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown improved generation performance through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) following the retriever-reader paradigm, which supplements model inputs with externally retrieved knowledge. However, prior work often evaluates RAG holistically, assessing the retriever and reader jointly, making it difficult to isolate the true contribution of retrieval, particularly given the prompt sensitivity of LLMs used as readers. We introduce Spectrum Projection Score (SPS), a lightweight, supervision-free metric that allows the reader to gauge the semantic alignment of a retrieved summary with its hidden representation by comparing the area formed by generated tokens from the summary, and the principal directions of subspace in the reader and to measure the relevance. Building on SPS we present xCompress, an inference time controller framework that dynamically samples, ranks, and compresses retrieval summary candidates. Extensive experiments on five QA benchmarks with four open source LLMs show that SPS not only enhances performance across a range of tasks but also provides a principled perspective on the interaction between retrieval and generation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Accuracy in neural PDE solvers often breaks down not because of limited expressivity, but due to poor optimisation caused by ill-conditioning, especially in multi-fidelity and stiff problems. We study this issue in Physics-Informed Extreme Learning Machines (PIELMs), a convex variant of neural PDE solvers, and show that asymptotic components in governing equations can produce highly ill-conditioned activation matrices, severely limiting convergence. We introduce Shifted Gaussian Encoding, a simple yet effective activation filtering step that increases matrix rank and expressivity while preserving convexity. Our method extends the solvable range of Peclet numbers in steady advection-diffusion equations by over two orders of magnitude, achieves up to six orders lower error on multi-frequency function learning, and fits high-fidelity image vectors more accurately and faster than deep networks with over a million parameters. This work highlights that conditioning, not depth, is often the bottleneck in scientific neural solvers and that simple architectural changes can unlock substantial gains.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Monitoring construction progress is crucial yet resource-intensive, prompting the exploration of computer-vision-based methodologies for enhanced efficiency and scalability. Traditional data acquisition methods, primarily focusing on indoor environments, falter in construction site's complex, cluttered, and dynamically changing conditions. This paper critically evaluates the application of two advanced 3D segmentation methods, Segment Anything Model (SAM) and Mask3D, in challenging outdoor and indoor conditions. Trained initially on indoor datasets, both models' adaptability and performance are assessed in real-world construction settings, highlighting the gap in current segmentation approaches due to the absence of benchmarks for outdoor scenarios. Through a comparative analysis, this study not only showcases the relative effectiveness of SAM and Mask3D but also addresses the critical need for tailored segmentation workflows capable of extracting actionable insights from construction site data, thereby advancing the field towards more automated and precise monitoring techniques.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is a key technique for training large reasoning models, yet it suffers from a critical vulnerability: the \emph{Think-Answer Mismatch}, where noisy reward signals corrupt the learning process. This problem is most severe in unbalanced response groups, paradoxically degrading the signal precisely when it should be most informative. To address this challenge, we propose Stable Group-Relative Policy Optimization (S-GRPO), a principled enhancement that derives optimal, noise-aware advantage weights to stabilize training. Our comprehensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate S-GRPO's effectiveness and robustness. On various models, S-GRPO significantly outperforms DR. GRPO, achieving performance gains of +2.5% on Qwen-Math-7B-Base, +2.2% on Llama-3.2-3B-Base, and +2.4% on Qwen-Math-1.5B-Instruct. Most critically, while standard GRPO fails to learn under 20% synthetic reward noise, S-GRPO maintains stable learning progress. These results highlight S-GRPO's potential for more robust and effective training of large-scale reasoning models. \footnote{Code and data are available at: this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The lack of spatial dimensional information remains a challenge in normal estimation from a single image. Recent diffusion-based methods have demonstrated significant potential in 2D-to-3D implicit mapping, they rely on data-driven statistical priors and miss the explicit modeling of light-surface interaction, leading to multi-view normal direction conflicts. Moreover, the discrete sampling mechanism of diffusion models causes gradient discontinuity in differentiable rendering reconstruction modules, preventing 3D geometric errors from being backpropagated to the normal generation network, thereby forcing existing methods to depend on dense normal annotations. This paper proposes SINGAD, a novel Self-supervised framework from a single Image for Normal estimation via 3D GAussian splatting guided Diffusion. By integrating physics-driven light-interaction modeling and a differentiable rendering-based reprojection strategy, our framework directly converts 3D geometric errors into normal optimization signals, solving the challenges of multi-view geometric inconsistency and data dependency. Specifically, the framework constructs a light-interaction-driven 3DGS reparameterization model to generate multi-scale geometric features consistent with light transport principles, ensuring multi-view normal consistency. A cross-domain feature fusion module is designed within a conditional diffusion model, embedding geometric priors to constrain normal generation while maintaining accurate geometric error propagation. Furthermore, a differentiable 3D reprojection loss strategy is introduced for self-supervised optimization that minimizes geometric error between the reconstructed and input image, eliminating dependence on annotated normal datasets. Quantitative evaluations on the Google Scanned Objects dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across multiple metrics.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>There is growing interest in integrating high-fidelity visual synthesis capabilities into large language models (LLMs) without compromising their strong reasoning capabilities. Existing methods that directly train LLMs or bridge LLMs and diffusion models usually suffer from costly training since the backbone LLMs have not seen image representations during pretraining. We present Bifrost-1, a unified framework that bridges pretrained multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) and diffusion models using patch-level CLIP image embeddings as latent variables, which are natively aligned with the MLLM's CLIP visual encoder. These patch-level image embeddings are integrated into the diffusion model with a lightweight adaptation of its ControlNet. To retain the original multimodal reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, we equip the MLLM with a visual generation branch initialized from the original MLLM parameters when predicting the patch-level image embeddings. By seamlessly integrating pretrained MLLMs and diffusion models with patch-level CLIP latents, our framework enables high-fidelity controllable image generation with significant training efficiency. Our experiments demonstrate that Bifrost-1 achieves comparable or better performance than previous methods in terms of visual fidelity and multimodal understanding, with substantially lower compute during training. We also provide comprehensive ablation studies showing the effectiveness of our design choices.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Decision trees, without appropriate constraints, can easily become overly complex and prone to overfit, capturing noise rather than generalizable patterns. To resolve this problem,pruning operation is a crucial part in optimizing decision trees, as it not only reduces the complexity of trees but also decreases the probability of generating overfit models. The conventional pruning techniques like Cost-Complexity Pruning (CCP) and Reduced Error Pruning (REP) are mostly based on greedy approaches that focus on immediate gains in performance while pruning nodes of the decision tree. However, this might result in a lower generalization in the long run, compromising the robust ability of the tree model when introduced to unseen data samples, particularly when trained with small and complex datasets. To address this challenge, we are proposing a Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB)-based pruning approach, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based technique, that will dynamically prune the tree to generate an optimal decision tree with better generalization. Our proposed approach assumes the pruning process as an exploration-exploitation problem, where we are utilizing the MAB algorithms to find optimal branch nodes to prune based on feedback from each pruning actions. Experimental evaluation on several benchmark datasets, demonstrated that our proposed approach results in better predictive performance compared to the traditional ones. This suggests the potential of utilizing MAB for a dynamic and probabilistic way of decision tree pruning, in turn optimizing the decision tree-based model.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The fragmentation between high-level task semantics and low-level geometric features remains a persistent challenge in robotic manipulation. While vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise in generating affordance-aware visual representations, the lack of semantic grounding in canonical spaces and reliance on manual annotations severely limit their ability to capture dynamic semantic-affordance relationships. To address these, we propose Primitive-Aware Semantic Grounding (PASG), a closed-loop framework that introduces: (1) Automatic primitive extraction through geometric feature aggregation, enabling cross-category detection of keypoints and axes; (2) VLM-driven semantic anchoring that dynamically couples geometric primitives with functional affordances and task-relevant description; (3) A spatial-semantic reasoning benchmark and a fine-tuned VLM (Qwen2.5VL-PA). We demonstrate PASG's effectiveness in practical robotic manipulation tasks across diverse scenarios, achieving performance comparable to manual annotations. PASG achieves a finer-grained semantic-affordance understanding of objects, establishing a unified paradigm for bridging geometric primitives with task semantics in robotic manipulation.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the domain of scientific machine learning, designing effective reward functions remains a challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly in environments where task goals are difficult to specify numerically. Reward functions in existing work are predominantly based on heuristics, manual engineering, or task-specific tuning. In this work, we introduce a semantically aligned reinforcement learning method where rewards are computed by aligning the current state with a target semantic instruction using a Sentence-Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (SBERT). Instead of relying on manually defined reward functions, the policy receives feedback based on the reward, which is a cosine similarity between the goal textual description and the statement description in the episode. We evaluated our approach in several environments and showed that semantic reward can guide learning to achieve competitive control behavior, even in the absence of hand-crafted reward functions. Our study demonstrates a correlation between the language embedding space and the conventional Euclidean space. This framework opens new horizons for aligning agent behavior with natural language goals and lays the groundwork for a more seamless integration of larger language models (LLMs) and fluid control applications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Cross-topic automated essay scoring (AES) aims to develop a transferable model capable of effectively evaluating essays on a target topic. A significant challenge in this domain arises from the inherent discrepancies between topics. While existing methods predominantly focus on extracting topic-shared features through distribution alignment of source and target topics, they often neglect topic-specific features, limiting their ability to assess critical traits such as topic adherence. To address this limitation, we propose an Adversarial TOpic-aware Prompt-tuning (ATOP), a novel method that jointly learns topic-shared and topic-specific features to improve cross-topic AES. ATOP achieves this by optimizing a learnable topic-aware prompt--comprising both shared and specific components--to elicit relevant knowledge from pre-trained language models (PLMs). To enhance the robustness of topic-shared prompt learning and mitigate feature scale sensitivity introduced by topic alignment, we incorporate adversarial training within a unified regression and classification framework. In addition, we employ a neighbor-based classifier to model the local structure of essay representations and generate pseudo-labels for target-topic essays. These pseudo-labels are then used to guide the supervised learning of topic-specific prompts tailored to the target topic. Extensive experiments on the publicly available ASAP++ dataset demonstrate that ATOP significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both holistic and multi-trait essay scoring. The implementation of our method is publicly available at: this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Emotion recognition plays a vital role in enhancing human-computer interaction. In this study, we tackle the MER-SEMI challenge of the MER2025 competition by proposing a novel multimodal emotion recognition framework. To address the issue of data scarcity, we leverage large-scale pre-trained models to extract informative features from visual, audio, and textual modalities. Specifically, for the visual modality, we design a dual-branch visual encoder that captures both global frame-level features and localized facial representations. For the textual modality, we introduce a context-enriched method that employs large language models to enrich emotional cues within the input text. To effectively integrate these multimodal features, we propose a fusion strategy comprising two key components, i.e., self-attention mechanisms for dynamic modality weighting, and residual connections to preserve original representations. Beyond architectural design, we further refine noisy labels in the training set by a multi-source labeling strategy. Our approach achieves a substantial performance improvement over the official baseline on the MER2025-SEMI dataset, attaining a weighted F-score of 87.49% compared to 78.63%, thereby validating the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation and structured reasoning; however, their performance often degrades on complex tasks that require consistent multi-step planning. Recent work has explored combining LLMs with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), yet existing approaches primarily focus on generating heuristic-based code for optimization or target simpler tasks where correctness alone is sufficient. In this work, we propose MCTS-OPS, a novel neural-symbolic framework that formulates prompt selection as a sequential decision process guided by MCTS. Our method explores and refines multi-step prompt sequences for the goal of improving code generation quality and enhancing the problem-solving capabilities of LLMs in general optimization. Experiments on network optimization show significant improvement over the baselines, both in the success rate of executing the generated code and in the optimization results with the specified objective and constraints (2$\sim$4$\times$ higher reward and 3$\times$ lower standard deviation). Moreover, it improves the chance of attaining the optimal solution by about 10\% of cases, compared to baseline methods in hard problems. These results highlight the promise of combining symbolic planning with LLMs for robust, high-quality code generation in complex domains.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in visual mathematical reasoning across various existing benchmarks. However, these benchmarks are predominantly based on clean or processed multimodal inputs, without incorporating the images provided by real-world Kindergarten through 12th grade (K-12) educational users. To address this gap, we introduce MathReal, a meticulously curated dataset comprising 2,000 mathematical questions with images captured by handheld mobile devices in authentic scenarios. Each question is an image, containing the question text and visual element. We systematically classify the real images into three primary categories: image quality degradation, perspective variation, and irrelevant content interference, which are further delineated into 14 subcategories. Additionally, MathReal spans five core knowledge and ability categories, which encompass three question types and are divided into three difficulty levels. To comprehensively evaluate the multimodal mathematical reasoning abilities of state-of-the-art MLLMs in real-world scenarios, we design six experimental settings that enable a systematic analysis of their performance. Through extensive experimentation, we find that the problem-solving abilities of existing MLLMs are significantly challenged in realistic educational contexts. Based on this, we conduct a thorough analysis of their performance and error patterns, providing insights into their recognition, comprehension, and reasoning capabilities, and outlining directions for future improvements.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in novel view synthesis (NVS) have enabled real-time rendering with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). However, existing methods struggle with artifacts and missing regions when rendering from viewpoints that deviate from the training trajectory, limiting seamless scene exploration. To address this, we propose a 3DGS-based pipeline that generates additional training views to enhance reconstruction. We introduce an information-gain-driven virtual camera placement strategy to maximize scene coverage, followed by video diffusion priors to refine rendered results. Fine-tuning 3D Gaussians with these enhanced views significantly improves reconstruction quality. To evaluate our method, we present Wild-Explore, a benchmark designed for challenging scene exploration. Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing 3DGS-based methods, enabling high-quality, artifact-free rendering from arbitrary viewpoints. this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The quadratic computational cost of the self-attention mechanism is a primary challenge in scaling Transformer models. While attention sparsity is widely studied as a technique to improve computational efficiency, it is almost universally assumed to come at the cost of model accuracy. In this paper, we report a surprising counter-example to this common wisdom. By introducing structured, post-hoc sparsity to the attention mechanism of a DistilBERT model during fine-tuning on the SST-2 sentiment analysis task, we find that model accuracy improves significantly. Our model with 80\% attention sparsity achieves a validation accuracy of 91.59\%, a 0.97\% absolute improvement over the dense baseline. We hypothesize that this phenomenon is due to sparsity acting as a powerful implicit regularizer, preventing the model from overfitting by forcing it to make predictions with a more constrained and robust set of features. Our work recasts attention sparsity not just as a tool for computational efficiency, but as a potential method for improving the generalization and performance of Transformer models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Sub-visible particle analysis using flow imaging microscopy combined with deep learning has proven effective in identifying particle types, enabling the distinction of harmless components such as silicone oil from protein particles. However, the scarcity of available data and severe imbalance between particle types within datasets remain substantial hurdles when applying multi-class classifiers to such problems, often forcing researchers to rely on less effective methods. The aforementioned issue is particularly challenging for particle types that appear unintentionally and in lower numbers, such as silicone oil and air bubbles, as opposed to protein particles, where obtaining large numbers of images through controlled settings is comparatively straightforward. In this work, we develop a state-of-the-art diffusion model to address data imbalance by generating high-fidelity images that can augment training datasets, enabling the effective training of multi-class deep neural networks. We validate this approach by demonstrating that the generated samples closely resemble real particle images in terms of visual quality and structure. To assess the effectiveness of using diffusion-generated images in training datasets, we conduct large-scale experiments on a validation dataset comprising 500,000 protein particle images and demonstrate that this approach improves classification performance with no negligible downside. Finally, to promote open research and reproducibility, we publicly release both our diffusion models and the trained multi-class deep neural network classifiers, along with a straightforward interface for easy integration into future studies, at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Prognostication for comatose post-cardiac arrest patients is a critical challenge that directly impacts clinical decision-making in the ICU. Clinical information that informs prognostication is collected serially over time. Shortly after cardiac arrest, various time-invariant baseline features are collected (e.g., demographics, cardiac arrest characteristics). After ICU admission, additional features are gathered, including time-varying hemodynamic data (e.g., blood pressure, doses of vasopressor medications). We view these as two phases in which we collect new features. In this study, we propose a novel stepwise dynamic competing risks model that improves the prediction of neurological outcomes by automatically determining when to take advantage of time-invariant features (first phase) and time-varying features (second phase). Notably, our model finds patients for whom this second phase (time-varying hemodynamic) information is beneficial for prognostication and also when this information is beneficial (as we collect more hemodynamic data for a patient over time, how important these data are for prognostication varies). Our approach extends the standard Fine and Gray model to explicitly model the two phases and to incorporate neural networks to flexibly capture complex nonlinear feature relationships. Evaluated on a retrospective cohort of 2,278 comatose post-arrest patients, our model demonstrates robust discriminative performance for the competing outcomes of awakening, withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy, and death despite maximal support. Our approach generalizes to more than two phases in which new features are collected and could be used in other dynamic prediction tasks, where it may be helpful to know when and for whom newly collected features significantly improve prediction.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Self-Rewarding Language Models propose an architecture in which the Large Language Models(LLMs) both generates responses and evaluates its own outputs via LLM-as-a-Judge prompting, dynamically improving its generative capabilities through iterative Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). However, our analysis reveals a critical limitation in existing Self-Rewarding paradigms: the synchronized improvement of chosen and rejected responses progressively narrows the representational difference between contrasting samples, undermining effective preference learning. We propose \textbf{Temporal Self-Rewarding Language Models} that strategically coordinate past, present, and future model generations to sustain learning signals. Our dual-phase framework introduces: (1) \textit{Anchored Rejection} - fixing rejected responses using the past initial model's outputs and (2) \textit{Future-Guided Chosen} - dynamically curating chosen samples using next-generation model predictions. Extensive experiments across three model families (Llama, Qwen, Mistral) and different model sizes (Llama3B/8B/70B) demonstrate significant improvements when trained with our method compared to Self-Rewarding using same computation resources. For example, Llama3.1-8B reaches a 29.44 win rate on AlpacaEval 2.0 with our method, outperforming the Self-Rewarding baseline (19.69) by 9.75. Notably, our method also demonstrates superior out-of-distribution generalization across mathematical reasoning (GSM8K), knowledge-based QA (ARC, TruthfulQA), and code generation (HumanEval) tasks, even though we do not specifically collect such training data.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) acquire knowledge across diverse domains such as science, history, and geography encountered during generative pre-training. However, due to their stochasticity, it is difficult to predict what LLMs have acquired. Prior work has developed different ways to probe this knowledge by investigating the hidden representations, crafting specific task prompts, curating representative samples, and estimating their uncertainty. However, these methods require making forward passes through the underlying model to probe the LLM's knowledge about a specific fact, making them computationally expensive and time-consuming. To bridge this gap, we propose $\textbf{PEEK}$ or $\textbf{P}$roxy $\textbf{E}$mbeddings to $\textbf{E}$stimate $\textbf{K}$nowledge of LLMs, by leveraging the pre-trained embedding models that effectively encode factual knowledge as text or graphs as proxies for LLMs. First, we identify a training set of facts known by LLMs through various probing strategies and then adapt embedding models to predict the LLM outputs with a linear decoder layer. Comprehensive evaluation on $3$ Wikipedia-derived datasets, $4$ LLMs, and $7$ embedding models shows that embeddings can predict LLM knowledge on a held-out set with up to 90 % accuracy. Furthermore, we find that sentence embedding models are more suitable than graph embeddings to predict LLM knowledge, shedding light on the underlying representation of the factual landscape. Thus, we believe that knowledge-adapted embeddings can be used to identify knowledge gaps in LLMs at scale and can provide deeper insights into LLMs' internal inductive bias.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Existing methods for human parsing into body parts and clothing often use fixed mask categories with broad labels that obscure fine-grained clothing types. Recent open-vocabulary segmentation approaches leverage pretrained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model features for strong zero-shot transfer, but typically group entire humans into a single person category, failing to distinguish diverse clothing or detailed body parts. To address this, we propose Spectrum, a unified network for part-level pixel parsing (body parts and clothing) and instance-level grouping. While diffusion-based open-vocabulary models generalize well across tasks, their internal representations are not specialized for detailed human parsing. We observe that, unlike diffusion models with broad representations, image-driven 3D texture generators maintain faithful correspondence to input images, enabling stronger representations for parsing diverse clothing and body parts. Spectrum introduces a novel repurposing of an Image-to-Texture (I2Tx) diffusion model -- obtained by fine-tuning a T2I model on 3D human texture maps -- for improved alignment with body parts and clothing. From an input image, we extract human-part internal features via the I2Tx diffusion model and generate semantically valid masks aligned to diverse clothing categories through prompt-guided grounding. Once trained, Spectrum produces semantic segmentation maps for every visible body part and clothing category, ignoring standalone garments or irrelevant objects, for any number of humans in the scene. We conduct extensive cross-dataset experiments -- separately assessing body parts, clothing parts, unseen clothing categories, and full-body masks -- and demonstrate that Spectrum consistently outperforms baseline methods in prompt-based segmentation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we present our solution for the semi-supervised learning track (MER-SEMI) in MER2025. We propose a comprehensive framework, grounded in the principle that "more is better," to construct a robust Mixture of Experts (MoE) emotion recognition system. Our approach integrates a diverse range of input modalities as independent experts, including novel signals such as knowledge from large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and temporal Action Unit (AU) information. To effectively utilize unlabeled data, we introduce a consensus-based pseudo-labeling strategy, generating high-quality labels from the agreement between a baseline model and Gemini, which are then used in a two-stage training paradigm. Finally, we employ a multi-expert voting ensemble combined with a rule-based re-ranking process to correct prediction bias and better align the outputs with human preferences. Evaluated on the MER2025-SEMI challenge dataset, our method achieves an F1-score of 0.8772 on the test set, ranking 2nd in the track. Our code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) typically replace the predefined image placeholder token (<image>) in textual instructions with visual features from an image encoder, forming the input to a backbone Large Language Model (LLM). However, the large number of vision tokens significantly increases the context length, leading to high computational overhead and inference latency. While previous efforts mitigate this by selecting only important visual features or leveraging learnable queries to reduce token count, they often compromise performance or introduce substantial extra costs. In response, we propose Fourier-VLM, a simple yet efficient method that compresses visual representations in the frequency domain. Our approach is motivated by the observation that vision features output from the vision encoder exhibit concentrated energy in low-frequency components. Leveraging this, we apply a low-pass filter to the vision features using a two-dimentional Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). Notably, the DCT is efficiently computed via the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) operator with a time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$, minimizing the extra computational cost while introducing no additional parameters. Extensive experiments across various image-based benchmarks demonstrate that Fourier-VLM achieves competitive performance with strong generalizability across both LLaVA and Qwen-VL architectures. Crucially, it reduce inference FLOPs by up to 83.8% and boots generation speed by 31.2% compared to LLaVA-v1.5, highlighting the superior efficiency and practicality.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>How can we effectively handle queries for on-device large language models (LLMs) with varying runtime constraints, such as latency and accuracy? Multi-scale quantization addresses this challenge by enabling memory-efficient runtime model adaptation of LLMs through the overlaying of multiple model variants quantized to different bitwidths. Meanwhile, an important question still remains open-ended: how can models be properly configured to match a target precision or latency? While mixed-precision offers a promising solution, we take this further by leveraging the key observation that the sensitivity of each layer dynamically changes across decoding iterations. Building on this insight, we introduce DP-LLM, a novel mechanism that dynamically assigns precision to each layer based on input values. DP-LLM augments each linear layer in an LLM with a precision selector that determines the bitwidth at runtime using a lightweight error estimator and threshold values learned through fine-tuning. Experimental results across multiple models and benchmarks demonstrate that DP-LLM achieves a superior performance-latency trade-off, outperforming prior approaches.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Although the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) as judges (LLM-as-a-judge) has been validated, their performance remains limited in open-ended tasks, particularly in story evaluation. Accurate story evaluation is crucial not only for assisting human quality judgment but also for providing key signals to guide story generation. However, existing methods face a dilemma: prompt engineering for closed-source models suffers from poor adaptability, while fine-tuning approaches for open-source models lack the rigorous reasoning capabilities essential for story evaluation. To address this, we propose the Self-Evolving Pairwise Reasoning (EvolvR) framework. Grounded in pairwise comparison, the framework first self-synthesizes score-aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data via a multi-persona strategy. To ensure data quality, these raw CoTs undergo a self-filtering process, utilizing multi-agents to guarantee their logical rigor and robustness. Finally, the evaluator trained on the refined data is deployed as a reward model to guide the story generation task. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on three evaluation benchmarks including StoryER, HANNA and OpenMEVA. Furthermore, when served as a reward model, it significantly enhances the quality of generated stories, thereby fully validating the superiority of our self-evolving approach.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>explainability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Video quality assessment (VQA) aims to objectively quantify perceptual quality degradation in alignment with human visual perception. Despite recent advances, existing VQA models still suffer from two critical limitations: \textit{poor generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) videos} and \textit{limited explainability}, which restrict their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{VQAThinker}, a reasoning-based VQA framework that leverages large multimodal models (LMMs) with reinforcement learning to jointly model video quality understanding and scoring, emulating human perceptual decision-making. Specifically, we adopt group relative policy optimization (GRPO), a rule-guided reinforcement learning algorithm that enables reasoning over video quality under score-level supervision, and introduce three VQA-specific rewards: (1) a \textbf{bell-shaped regression reward} that increases rapidly as the prediction error decreases and becomes progressively less sensitive near the ground truth; (2) a \textbf{pairwise ranking reward} that guides the model to correctly determine the relative quality between video pairs; and (3) a \textbf{temporal consistency reward} that encourages the model to prefer temporally coherent videos over their perturbed counterparts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VQAThinker achieves state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and OOD VQA benchmarks, showing strong generalization for video quality scoring. Furthermore, evaluations on video quality understanding tasks validate its superiority in distortion attribution and quality description compared to existing explainable VQA models and LMMs. These findings demonstrate that reinforcement learning offers an effective pathway toward building generalizable and explainable VQA models solely with score-level supervision.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Lateral ventricle (LV) shape analysis holds promise as a biomarker for neurological diseases; however, challenges remain due to substantial shape variability across individuals and segmentation difficulties arising from limited MRI resolution. We introduce LV-Net, a novel framework for producing individualized 3D LV meshes from brain MRI by deforming an anatomy-aware joint LV-hippocampus template mesh. By incorporating anatomical relationships embedded within the joint template, LV-Net reduces boundary segmentation artifacts and improves reconstruction robustness. In addition, by classifying the vertices of the template mesh based on their anatomical adjacency, our method enhances point correspondence across subjects, leading to more accurate LV shape statistics. We demonstrate that LV-Net achieves superior reconstruction accuracy, even in the presence of segmentation imperfections, and delivers more reliable shape descriptors across diverse datasets. Finally, we apply LV-Net to Alzheimer's disease analysis, identifying LV subregions that show significantly associations with the disease relative to cognitively normal controls.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>State-of-the-art fact-checking systems combat misinformation at scale by employing autonomous LLM-based agents to decompose complex claims into smaller sub-claims, verify each sub-claim individually, and aggregate the partial results to produce verdicts with justifications (explanatory rationales for the verdicts). The security of these systems is crucial, as compromised fact-checkers, which tend to be easily underexplored, can amplify misinformation. This work introduces Fact2Fiction, the first poisoning attack framework targeting such agentic fact-checking systems. Fact2Fiction mirrors the decomposition strategy and exploits system-generated justifications to craft tailored malicious evidences that compromise sub-claim verification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Fact2Fiction achieves 8.9\%--21.2\% higher attack success rates than state-of-the-art attacks across various poisoning budgets. Fact2Fiction exposes security weaknesses in current fact-checking systems and highlights the need for defensive countermeasures.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Salient object detection (SOD) and camouflaged object detection (COD) are two closely related but distinct computer vision tasks. Although both are class-agnostic segmentation tasks that map from RGB space to binary space, the former aims to identify the most salient objects in the image, while the latter focuses on detecting perfectly camouflaged objects that blend into the background in the image. These two tasks exhibit strong contradictory attributes. Previous works have mostly believed that joint learning of these two tasks would confuse the network, reducing its performance on both tasks. However, here we present an opposite perspective: with the correct approach to learning, the network can simultaneously possess the capability to find both salient and camouflaged objects, allowing both tasks to benefit from joint learning. We propose SCJoint, a joint learning scheme for SOD and COD tasks, assuming that the decoding processes of SOD and COD have different distribution characteristics. The key to our method is to learn the respective means and variances of the decoding processes for both tasks by inserting a minimal amount of task-specific learnable parameters within a fully shared network structure, thereby decoupling the contradictory attributes of the two tasks at a minimal cost. Furthermore, we propose a saliency-based sampling strategy (SBSS) to sample the training set of the SOD task to balance the training set sizes of the two tasks. In addition, SBSS improves the training set quality and shortens the training time. Based on the proposed SCJoint and SBSS, we train a powerful generalist network, named JoNet, which has the ability to simultaneously capture both ``salient" and ``camouflaged". Extensive experiments demonstrate the competitive performance and effectiveness of our proposed method. The code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep temporal architectures such as Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) achieve strong predictive performance on sequential data, yet theoretical understanding of their generalization remains limited. We address this gap by providing both the first non-vacuous, architecture-aware generalization bounds for deep temporal models and a principled evaluation methodology. For exponentially $\beta$-mixing sequences, we derive bounds scaling as $ O\!\Bigl(R\,\sqrt{\tfrac{D\,p\,n\,\log N}{N}}\Bigr), $ where $D$ is network depth, $p$ kernel size, $n$ input dimension, and $R$ weight norm. Our delayed-feedback blocking mechanism transforms dependent samples into effectively independent ones while discarding only $O(1/\log N)$ of the data, yielding $\sqrt{D}$ scaling instead of exponential, implying that doubling depth requires approximately quadrupling the training data. We also introduce a fair-comparison methodology that fixes the effective sample size to isolate the effect of temporal structure from information content. Under $N_{\text{eff}}=2{,}000$, strongly dependent sequences ($\rho=0.8$) exhibit $\approx76\%$ smaller generalization gaps than weakly dependent ones ($\rho=0.2$), challenging the intuition that dependence is purely detrimental. Yet convergence rates diverge from theory: weak dependencies follow $N_{\text{eff}}^{-1.21}$ scaling and strong dependencies follow $N_{\text{eff}}^{-0.89}$, both steeper than the predicted $N^{-0.5}$. These findings reveal that temporal dependence can enhance learning under fixed information budgets, while highlighting gaps between theory and practice that motivate future research.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper introduces a structural game-theoretic model to value decentralized digital assets like Bitcoin. Instead of relying on speculative beliefs, it frames the asset's price within a Rational-Expectations Security-Utility Nash Equilibrium (RESUNE). This equilibrium is a fixed point where the market-clearing price dictates the hash rate through a free-entry mining model, which in turn endogenously sets the network's security. The security, defined as one minus the probability of a 51% attack, is determined via a global games model of attacker coordination, providing a unique and continuous security function. We prove the existence of a RESUNE and offer conditions for its uniqueness and stability. The model predicts that the stabilizing direct effect of price on demand must outweigh the potentially destabilizing feedback from price to security. The framework generates testable predictions, such as a protocol halving causing a contraction in both hash rate and price. A structural Vector Autoregression (VAR) model is proposed to test this mechanism. The model decomposes Bitcoin's value into transactional utility, security, and speculative components and explains the observed unidirectional causality from price to hash rate.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Evaluating the abilities of large models and manifesting their gaps are challenging. Current benchmarks adopt either ground-truth-based score-form evaluation on static datasets or indistinct textual chatbot-style human preferences collection, which may not provide users with immediate, intuitive, and perceptible feedback on performance differences. In this paper, we introduce BioMotion Arena, a novel framework for evaluating large language models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) via visual animation. Our methodology draws inspiration from the inherent visual perception of motion patterns characteristic of living organisms that utilizes point-light source imaging to amplify the performance discrepancies between models. Specifically, we employ a pairwise comparison evaluation and collect more than 45k votes for 53 mainstream LLMs and MLLMs on 90 biological motion variants. Data analyses show that the crowd-sourced human votes are in good agreement with those of expert raters, demonstrating the superiority of our BioMotion Arena in offering discriminative feedback. We also find that over 90\% of evaluated models, including the cutting-edge open-source InternVL3 and proprietary Claude-4 series, fail to produce fundamental humanoid point-light groups, much less smooth and biologically plausible motions. This enables BioMotion Arena to serve as a challenging benchmark for performance visualization and a flexible evaluation framework without restrictions on ground-truth.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Provenance graph-based intrusion detection systems are deployed on hosts to defend against increasingly severe Advanced Persistent Threat. Using Graph Neural Networks to detect these threats has become a research focus and has demonstrated exceptional performance. However, the widespread adoption of GNN-based security models is limited by their inherent black-box nature, as they fail to provide security analysts with any verifiable explanations for model predictions or any evidence regarding the model's judgment in relation to real-world attacks. To address this challenge, we propose ProvX, an effective explanation framework for exlaining GNN-based security models on provenance graphs. ProvX introduces counterfactual explanation logic, seeking the minimal structural subset within a graph predicted as malicious that, when perturbed, can subvert the model's original prediction. We innovatively transform the discrete search problem of finding this critical subgraph into a continuous optimization task guided by a dual objective of prediction flipping and distance minimization. Furthermore, a Staged Solidification strategy is incorporated to enhance the precision and stability of the explanations. We conducted extensive evaluations of ProvX on authoritative datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that ProvX can locate critical graph structures that are highly relevant to real-world attacks and achieves an average explanation necessity of 51.59\%, with these metrics outperforming current SOTA explainers. Furthermore, we explore and provide a preliminary validation of a closed-loop Detection-Explanation-Feedback enhancement framework, demonstrating through experiments that the explanation results from ProvX can guide model optimization, effectively enhancing its robustness against adversarial attacks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>To treat Trochlear Dysplasia (TD), current approaches rely mainly on low-resolution clinical Magnetic Resonance (MR) scans and surgical intuition. The surgeries are planned based on surgeons experience, have limited adoption of minimally invasive techniques, and lead to inconsistent outcomes. We propose a pipeline that generates super-resolved, patient-specific 3D pseudo-healthy target morphologies from conventional clinical MR scans. First, we compute an isotropic super-resolved MR volume using an Implicit Neural Representation (INR). Next, we segment femur, tibia, patella, and fibula with a multi-label custom-trained network. Finally, we train a Wavelet Diffusion Model (WDM) to generate pseudo-healthy target morphologies of the trochlear region. In contrast to prior work producing pseudo-healthy low-resolution 3D MR images, our approach enables the generation of sub-millimeter resolved 3D shapes compatible for pre- and intraoperative use. These can serve as preoperative blueprints for reshaping the femoral groove while preserving the native patella articulation. Furthermore, and in contrast to other work, we do not require a CT for our pipeline - reducing the amount of radiation. We evaluated our approach on 25 TD patients and could show that our target morphologies significantly improve the sulcus angle (SA) and trochlear groove depth (TGD).

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Instruction-based editing holds vast potential due to its simple and efficient interactive editing format. However, instruction-based editing, particularly for video, has been constrained by limited training data, hindering its practical application. To this end, we introduce DreamVE, a unified model for instruction-based image and video editing. Specifically, We propose a two-stage training strategy: first image editing, then video editing. This offers two main benefits: (1) Image data scales more easily, and models are more efficient to train, providing useful priors for faster and better video editing training. (2) Unifying image and video generation is natural and aligns with current trends. Moreover, we present comprehensive training data synthesis pipelines, including collage-based and generative model-based data synthesis. The collage-based data synthesis combines foreground objects and backgrounds to generate diverse editing data, such as object manipulation, background changes, and text modifications. It can easily generate billions of accurate, consistent, realistic, and diverse editing pairs. We pretrain DreamVE on extensive collage-based data to achieve strong performance in key editing types and enhance generalization and transfer capabilities. However, collage-based data lacks some attribute editing cases, leading to a relative drop in performance. In contrast, the generative model-based pipeline, despite being hard to scale up, offers flexibility in handling attribute editing cases. Therefore, we use generative model-based data to further fine-tune DreamVE. Besides, we design an efficient and powerful editing framework for DreamVE. We build on the SOTA T2V model and use a token concatenation with early drop approach to inject source image guidance, ensuring strong consistency and editability. The codes and models will be released.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion-based or flow-based models have achieved significant progress in video synthesis but require multiple iterative sampling steps, which incurs substantial computational overhead. While many distillation methods that are solely based on trajectory-preserving or distribution-matching have been developed to accelerate video generation models, these approaches often suffer from performance breakdown or increased artifacts under few-step settings. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{\emph{SwiftVideo}}, a unified and stable distillation framework that combines the advantages of trajectory-preserving and distribution-matching strategies. Our approach introduces continuous-time consistency distillation to ensure precise preservation of ODE trajectories. Subsequently, we propose a dual-perspective alignment that includes distribution alignment between synthetic and real data along with trajectory alignment across different inference steps. Our method maintains high-quality video generation while substantially reducing the number of inference steps. Quantitative evaluations on the OpenVid-1M benchmark demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in few-step video generation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, protect, attack, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The preservation of privacy has emerged as a critical topic in the era of artificial intelligence. However, current work focuses on user-oriented privacy, overlooking severe enterprise data leakage risks exacerbated by the Retrieval-Augmented Generation paradigm. To address this gap, our paper introduces a novel objective: enterprise-oriented privacy concerns. Achieving this objective requires overcoming two fundamental challenges: existing methods such as data sanitization severely degrade model performance, and the field lacks public datasets for evaluation. We address these challenges with several solutions. (1) To prevent performance degradation, we propose ABack, a training-free mechanism that leverages a Hidden State Model to pinpoint the origin of a leakage intention and rewrite the output safely. (2) To solve the lack of datasets, we construct PriGenQA, a new benchmark for enterprise privacy scenarios in healthcare and finance. To ensure a rigorous evaluation, we move beyond simple static attacks by developing a powerful adaptive attacker with Group Relative Policy Optimization. Experiments show that against this superior adversary, ABack improves the overall privacy utility score by up to 15\% over strong baselines, avoiding the performance trade-offs of prior methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Emotion serves as an essential component in daily human interactions. Existing human motion generation frameworks do not consider the impact of emotions, which reduces naturalness and limits their application in interactive tasks, such as human reaction synthesis. In this work, we introduce a novel task: generating diverse reaction motions in response to different emotional cues. However, learning emotion representation from limited motion data and incorporating it into a motion generation framework remains a challenging problem. To address the above obstacles, we introduce a semi-supervised emotion prior in an actor-reactor diffusion model to facilitate emotion-driven reaction synthesis. Specifically, based on the observation that motion clips within a short sequence tend to share the same emotion, we first devise a semi-supervised learning framework to train an emotion prior. With this prior, we further train an actor-reactor diffusion model to generate reactions by considering both spatial interaction and emotional response. Finally, given a motion sequence of an actor, our approach can generate realistic reactions under various emotional conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms existing reaction generation methods. The code and data will be made publicly available at this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the digital age, advanced image editing tools pose a serious threat to the integrity of visual content, making image forgery detection and localization a key research focus. Most existing Image Manipulation Localization (IML) methods rely on discriminative learning and require large, high-quality annotated datasets. However, current datasets lack sufficient scale and diversity, limiting model performance in real-world scenarios. To overcome this, recent studies have explored Constrained IML (CIML), which generates pixel-level annotations through algorithmic supervision. However, existing CIML approaches often depend on complex multi-stage pipelines, making the annotation process inefficient. In this work, we propose a novel generative framework based on diffusion models, named UGD-IML, which for the first time unifies both IML and CIML tasks within a single framework. By learning the underlying data distribution, generative diffusion models inherently reduce the reliance on large-scale labeled datasets, allowing our approach to perform effectively even under limited data conditions. In addition, by leveraging a class embedding mechanism and a parameter-sharing design, our model seamlessly switches between IML and CIML modes without extra components or training overhead. Furthermore, the end-to-end design enables our model to avoid cumbersome steps in the data annotation process. Extensive experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate that UGD-IML outperforms the SOTA methods by an average of 9.66 and 4.36 in terms of F1 metrics for IML and CIML tasks, respectively. Moreover, the proposed method also excels in uncertainty estimation, visualization and robustness.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper presents two effective approaches for Extractive Question Answering (QA) on the Quran. It addresses challenges related to complex language, unique terminology, and deep meaning in the text. The second uses few-shot prompting with instruction-tuned large language models such as Gemini and DeepSeek. A specialized Arabic prompt framework is developed for span extraction. A strong post-processing system integrates subword alignment, overlap suppression, and semantic filtering. This improves precision and reduces hallucinations. Evaluations show that large language models with Arabic instructions outperform traditional fine-tuned models. The best configuration achieves a pAP10 score of 0.637. The results confirm that prompt-based instruction tuning is effective for low-resource, semantically rich QA tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the increasing availability of 2D and 3D data, significant advancements have been made in the field of cross-modal retrieval. Nevertheless, the existence of imperfect annotations presents considerable challenges, demanding robust solutions for 2D-3D cross-modal retrieval in the presence of noisy label conditions. Existing methods generally address the issue of noise by dividing samples independently within each modality, making them susceptible to overfitting on corrupted labels. To address these issues, we propose a robust 2D-3D \textbf{M}ulti-level cross-modal adaptive \textbf{C}orrection and \textbf{A}lignment framework (MCA). Specifically, we introduce a Multimodal Joint label Correction (MJC) mechanism that leverages multimodal historical self-predictions to jointly model the modality prediction consistency, enabling reliable label refinement. Additionally, we propose a Multi-level Adaptive Alignment (MAA) strategy to effectively enhance cross-modal feature semantics and discrimination across different levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method, MCA, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on both conventional and realistic noisy 3D benchmarks, highlighting its generality and effectiveness.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) often suffer from hallucination, generating factually incorrect statements when handling questions beyond their knowledge and perception. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses this by retrieving query-relevant contexts from knowledge bases to support LLM reasoning. Recent advances leverage pre-constructed graphs to capture the relational connections among distributed documents, showing remarkable performance in complex tasks. However, existing Graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) methods rely on a costly process to transform the corpus into a graph, introducing overwhelming token cost and update latency. Moreover, real-world queries vary in type and complexity, requiring different logic structures for accurate reasoning. The pre-built graph may not align with these required structures, resulting in ineffective knowledge retrieval. To this end, we propose a \textbf{\underline{Logic}}-aware \textbf{\underline{R}}etrieval-\textbf{\underline{A}}ugmented \textbf{\underline{G}}eneration framework (\textbf{LogicRAG}) that dynamically extracts reasoning structures at inference time to guide adaptive retrieval without any pre-built graph. LogicRAG begins by decomposing the input query into a set of subproblems and constructing a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to model the logical dependencies among them. To support coherent multi-step reasoning, LogicRAG then linearizes the graph using topological sort, so that subproblems can be addressed in a logically consistent order. Besides, LogicRAG applies graph pruning to reduce redundant retrieval and uses context pruning to filter irrelevant context, significantly reducing the overall token cost. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LogicRAG achieves both superior performance and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Modeling and simulation are widely used in cybersecurity research to assess cyber threats, evaluate defense mechanisms, and analyze vulnerabilities. However, the diversity of application areas, the variety of cyberattacks scenarios, and the differing objectives of these simulations makes it difficult to identify methodological trends. Existing reviews often focus on specific modeling techniques or application domains, making it challenging to analyze the field as a whole. To address these limitations, we present a comprehensive review of the current state of the art, classifying the selected papers based on four dimensions: the application domain, the types of cyber threats represented, the simulation techniques employed, and the primary goals of the simulation. The review discusses the strengths and limitations of different approaches, identifies which cyber threats are the most suited for simulation-based investigations, and analyzes which modeling paradigms are most appropriate for specific cybersecurity challenges.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recognizing handwritten mathematical expressions (HMER) is a challenging task due to the inherent two-dimensional structure, varying symbol scales, and complex spatial relationships among symbols. In this paper, we present a self-supervised learning (SSL) framework for HMER that eliminates the need for expensive labeled data. Our approach begins by pretraining an image encoder using a combination of global and local contrastive loss, enabling the model to learn both holistic and fine-grained representations. A key contribution of this work is a novel self-supervised attention network, which is trained using a progressive spatial masking strategy. This attention mechanism is designed to learn semantically meaningful focus regions, such as operators, exponents, and nested mathematical notation, without requiring any supervision. The progressive masking curriculum encourages the network to become increasingly robust to missing or occluded visual information, ultimately improving structural understanding. Our complete pipeline consists of (1) self-supervised pretraining of the encoder, (2) self-supervised attention learning, and (3) supervised fine-tuning with a transformer decoder to generate LATEX sequences. Extensive experiments on CROHME benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing SSL and fully supervised baselines, validating the effectiveness of our progressive attention mechanism in enhancing HMER performance.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) face interpretability challenges due to their opaque internal representations. While Feature Map Convergence Evaluation (FMCE) quantifies module-level convergence via Feature Map Convergence Scores (FMCS), it lacks experimental validation and closed-loop integration. To address this limitation, we propose FMCE-Net++, a novel training framework that integrates a pretrained, frozen FMCE-Net as an auxiliary head. This module generates FMCS predictions, which, combined with task labels, jointly supervise backbone optimization through a Representation Auxiliary Loss. The RAL dynamically balances the primary classification loss and feature convergence optimization via a tunable \Representation Abstraction Factor. Extensive experiments conducted on MNIST, CIFAR-10, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that FMCE-Net++ consistently enhances model performance without architectural modifications or additional data. Key experimental outcomes include accuracy gains of $+1.16$ pp (ResNet-50/CIFAR-10) and $+1.08$ pp (ShuffleNet v2/CIFAR-100), validating that FMCE-Net++ can effectively elevate state-of-the-art performance ceilings.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion-based models are redefining the state-of-the-art in end-to-end autonomous driving, yet their performance is increasingly hampered by a reliance on transformer-based fusion. These architectures face fundamental limitations: quadratic computational complexity restricts the use of high-resolution features, and a lack of spatial priors prevents them from effectively modeling the inherent structure of Bird's Eye View (BEV) representations. This paper introduces GMF-Drive (Gated Mamba Fusion for Driving), an end-to-end framework that overcomes these challenges through two principled innovations. First, we supersede the information-limited histogram-based LiDAR representation with a geometrically-augmented pillar format encoding shape descriptors and statistical features, preserving critical 3D geometric details. Second, we propose a novel hierarchical gated mamba fusion (GM-Fusion) architecture that substitutes an expensive transformer with a highly efficient, spatially-aware state-space model (SSM). Our core BEV-SSM leverages directional sequencing and adaptive fusion mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies with linear complexity, while explicitly respecting the unique spatial properties of the driving scene. Extensive experiments on the challenging NAVSIM benchmark demonstrate that GMF-Drive achieves a new state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming DiffusionDrive. Comprehensive ablation studies validate the efficacy of each component, demonstrating that task-specific SSMs can surpass a general-purpose transformer in both performance and efficiency for autonomous driving.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Semantic segmentation in open-vocabulary scenarios presents significant challenges due to the wide range and granularity of semantic categories. Existing weakly-supervised methods often rely on category-specific supervision and ill-suited feature construction methods for contrastive learning, leading to semantic misalignment and poor performance. In this work, we propose a novel weakly-supervised approach, SynSeg, to address the challenges. SynSeg performs Multi-Category Contrastive Learning (MCCL) as a stronger training signal with a new feature reconstruction framework named Feature Synergy Structure (FSS). Specifically, MCCL strategy robustly combines both intra- and inter-category alignment and separation in order to make the model learn the knowledge of correlations from different categories within the same image. Moreover, FSS reconstructs discriminative features for contrastive learning through prior fusion and semantic-activation-map enhancement, effectively avoiding the foreground bias introduced by the visual encoder. In general, SynSeg effectively improves the abilities in semantic localization and discrimination under weak supervision. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. For instance, SynSeg achieves higher accuracy than SOTA baselines by 4.5\% on VOC, 8.9\% on Context, 2.6\% on Object and 2.0\% on City.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Present day LLMs face the challenge of managing affordance-based safety risks-situations where outputs inadvertently facilitate harmful actions due to overlooked logical implications. Traditional safety solutions, such as scalar outcome-based reward models, parameter tuning, or heuristic decoding strategies, lack the granularity and proactive nature needed to reliably detect and intervene during subtle yet crucial reasoning steps. Addressing this fundamental gap, we introduce AURA, an innovative, multi-layered framework centered around Process Reward Models (PRMs), providing comprehensive, step level evaluations across logical coherence and safety-awareness. Our framework seamlessly combines introspective self-critique, fine-grained PRM assessments, and adaptive safety-aware decoding to dynamically and proactively guide models toward safer reasoning trajectories. Empirical evidence clearly demonstrates that this approach significantly surpasses existing methods, significantly improving the logical integrity and affordance-sensitive safety of model outputs. This research represents a pivotal step toward safer, more responsible, and contextually aware AI, setting a new benchmark for alignment-sensitive applications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, robust, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) transforms interactive segmentation with zero-shot abilities, its inherent vulnerabilities present a single-point risk, potentially leading to the failure of numerous downstream applications. Proactively evaluating these transferable vulnerabilities is thus imperative. Prior adversarial attacks on SAM often present limited transferability due to insufficient exploration of common weakness across domains. To address this, we propose Vertex-Refining Simplicial Complex Attack (VeSCA), a novel method that leverages only the encoder of SAM for generating transferable adversarial examples. Specifically, it achieves this by explicitly characterizing the shared vulnerable regions between SAM and downstream models through a parametric simplicial complex. Our goal is to identify such complexes within adversarially potent regions by iterative vertex-wise refinement. A lightweight domain re-adaptation strategy is introduced to bridge domain divergence using minimal reference data during the initialization of simplicial complex. Ultimately, VeSCA generates consistently transferable adversarial examples through random simplicial complex sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VeSCA achieves performance improved by 12.7% compared to state-of-the-art methods across three downstream model categories across five domain-specific datasets. Our findings further highlight the downstream model risks posed by SAM's vulnerabilities and emphasize the urgency of developing more robust foundation models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a fundamental technique for compressing large language models (LLMs) into compact, efficient student models. However, existing white-box KD methods mainly focus on balancing ground truth and student-generated responses while overlooking two critical factors: training data quality and student-model compatibility. To address these limitations, we propose Selective Reflection Distillation (SRD), a novel data curation framework that leverages reflections from student models to systematically refine training data. SRD dynamically evaluates and selects prompt-response pairs by comparing ground truth data with student model outputs, selectively curating high-quality, student-compatible training instances through automated ranking based on difficulty. Furthermore, after selecting the training data, a curriculum scheduling strategy is employed to incrementally introduce these curated subsets into the distillation process at fixed intervals. As a plug-and-play enhancement, SRD consistently improves distillation outcomes across diverse white-box KD approaches and model architectures, as well as decreases computational cost significantly during KD training. Experiments on a range of language model benchmarks demonstrate SRD's consistent improvements in distilled model performance, as well as a reduction in training runtime by up to 39%, under diverse KD methods and model families. Notably, SRD operates as a plug-and-play module, enhancing sample efficiency without modifying underlying KD algorithms. Our findings highlight that data quality and compatibility are pivotal to effective and efficient distillation of LLMs, and SRD provides a principled framework to achieve both. This work advances the understanding of data-centric factors in KD and offers practical insights for enhancing the capability and efficiency of compressed LLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Combining sparse IMUs and a monocular camera is a new promising setting to perform real-time human motion capture. This paper proposes a diffusion-based solution to learn human motion priors and fuse the two modalities of signals together seamlessly in a unified framework. By delicately considering the characteristics of the two signals, the sequential visual information is considered as a whole and transformed into a condition embedding, while the inertial measurement is concatenated with the noisy body pose frame by frame to construct a sequential input for the diffusion model. Firstly, we observe that the visual information may be unavailable in some frames due to occlusions or subjects moving out of the camera view. Thus incorporating the sequential visual features as a whole to get a single feature embedding is robust to the occasional degenerations of visual information in those frames. On the other hand, the IMU measurements are robust to occlusions and always stable when signal transmission has no problem. So incorporating them frame-wisely could better explore the temporal information for the system. Experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of the system design and its state-of-the-art performance in pose estimation compared with the previous works.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the rapidly evolving landscape of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), the safety concerns of their outputs have earned significant attention. Although numerous datasets have been proposed, they may become outdated with MLLM advancements and are susceptible to data contamination issues. To address these problems, we propose \textbf{SDEval}, the \textit{first} safety dynamic evaluation framework to controllably adjust the distribution and complexity of safety benchmarks. Specifically, SDEval mainly adopts three dynamic strategies: text, image, and text-image dynamics to generate new samples from original benchmarks. We first explore the individual effects of text and image dynamics on model safety. Then, we find that injecting text dynamics into images can further impact safety, and conversely, injecting image dynamics into text also leads to safety risks. SDEval is general enough to be applied to various existing safety and even capability benchmarks. Experiments across safety benchmarks, MLLMGuard and VLSBench, and capability benchmarks, MMBench and MMVet, show that SDEval significantly influences safety evaluation, mitigates data contamination, and exposes safety limitations of MLLMs. Code is available at this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advancements in multimodal vision models have highlighted limitations in late-stage feature fusion and suboptimal query selection for hybrid prompts open-world segmentation, alongside constraints from caption-derived vocabularies. To address these challenges, we propose Prompt-DINO, a text-guided visual Prompt DINO framework featuring three key innovations. First, we introduce an early fusion mechanism that unifies text/visual prompts and backbone features at the initial encoding stage, enabling deeper cross-modal interactions to resolve semantic ambiguities. Second, we design order-aligned query selection for DETR-based architectures, explicitly optimizing the structural alignment between text and visual queries during decoding to enhance semantic-spatial consistency. Third, we develop a generative data engine powered by the Recognize Anything via Prompting (RAP) model, which synthesizes 0.5B diverse training instances through a dual-path cross-verification pipeline, reducing label noise by 80.5% compared to conventional approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Prompt-DINO achieves state-of-the-art performance on open-world detection benchmarks while significantly expanding semantic coverage beyond fixed-vocabulary constraints. Our work establishes a new paradigm for scalable multimodal detection and data generation in open-world scenarios. Data&Code are available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Aiming to obtain a high-resolution image, pansharpening involves the fusion of a multi-spectral image (MS) and a panchromatic image (PAN), the low-level vision task remaining significant and challenging in contemporary research. Most existing approaches rely predominantly on standard convolutions, few making the effort to adaptive convolutions, which are effective owing to the inter-pixel correlations of remote sensing images. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy for dynamically splitting convolution kernels in conjunction with attention, selecting positions of interest, and splitting the original convolution kernel into multiple smaller kernels, named DSConv. The proposed DSConv more effectively extracts features of different positions within the receptive field, enhancing the network's generalization, optimization, and feature representation capabilities. Furthermore, we innovate and enrich concepts of dynamic splitting convolution and provide a novel network architecture for pansharpening capable of achieving the tasks more efficiently, building upon this methodology. Adequate fair experiments illustrate the effectiveness and the state-of-the-art performance attained by this http URL and rigorous discussions proved the superiority and optimal usage conditions of DSConv.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In oral cancer diagnostics, the limited availability of annotated datasets frequently constrains the performance of diagnostic models, particularly due to the variability and insufficiency of training data. To address these challenges, this study proposed a novel approach to enhance diagnostic accuracy by synthesizing realistic oral cancer lesions using an inpainting technique with a fine-tuned diffusion model. We compiled a comprehensive dataset from multiple sources, featuring a variety of oral cancer images. Our method generated synthetic lesions that exhibit a high degree of visual fidelity to actual lesions, thereby significantly enhancing the performance of diagnostic algorithms. The results show that our classification model achieved a diagnostic accuracy of 0.97 in differentiating between cancerous and non-cancerous tissues, while our detection model accurately identified lesion locations with 0.85 accuracy. This method validates the potential for synthetic image generation in medical diagnostics and paves the way for further research into extending these methods to other types of cancer diagnostics.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, defense, attack, extraction, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the development of customized large language model (LLM) agents, a new threat of black-box backdoor attacks has emerged, where malicious instructions are injected into hidden system prompts. These attacks easily bypass existing defenses that rely on white-box access, posing a serious security challenge. To address this, we propose SLIP, a Soft Label mechanism and key-extraction-guided CoT-based defense against Instruction backdoors in APIs. SLIP is designed based on two key insights. First, to counteract the model's oversensitivity to triggers, we propose a Key-extraction-guided Chain-of-Thought (KCoT). Instead of only considering the single trigger or the input sentence, KCoT prompts the agent to extract task-relevant key phrases. Second, to guide the LLM toward correct answers, our proposed Soft Label Mechanism (SLM) prompts the agent to quantify the semantic correlation between key phrases and candidate answers. Crucially, to mitigate the influence of residual triggers or misleading content in phrases extracted by KCoT, which typically causes anomalous scores, SLM excludes anomalous scores deviating significantly from the mean and subsequently averages the remaining scores to derive a more reliable semantic representation. Extensive experiments on classification and question-answer (QA) tasks demonstrate that SLIP is highly effective, reducing the average attack success rate (ASR) from 90.2% to 25.13% while maintaining high accuracy on clean data and outperforming state-of-the-art defenses.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper addresses the issue of implicit stereotypes that may arise during the generation process of large language models. It proposes an interpretable bias detection method aimed at identifying hidden social biases in model outputs, especially those semantic tendencies that are not easily captured through explicit linguistic features. The method combines nested semantic representation with a contextual contrast mechanism. It extracts latent bias features from the vector space structure of model outputs. Using attention weight perturbation, it analyzes the model's sensitivity to specific social attribute terms, thereby revealing the semantic pathways through which bias is formed. To validate the effectiveness of the method, this study uses the StereoSet dataset, which covers multiple stereotype dimensions including gender, profession, religion, and race. The evaluation focuses on several key metrics, such as bias detection accuracy, semantic consistency, and contextual sensitivity. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves strong detection performance across various dimensions. It can accurately identify bias differences between semantically similar texts while maintaining high semantic alignment and output stability. The method also demonstrates high interpretability in its structural design. It helps uncover the internal bias association mechanisms within language models. This provides a more transparent and reliable technical foundation for bias detection. The approach is suitable for real-world applications where high trustworthiness of generated content is required.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that severely impairs cognitive function and quality of life. Timely intervention in AD relies heavily on early and precise diagnosis, which remains challenging due to the complex and subtle structural changes in the brain. Most existing deep learning methods focus only on a single plane of structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) and struggle to accurately capture the complex and nonlinear relationships among pathological regions of the brain, thus limiting their ability to precisely identify atrophic features. To overcome these limitations, we propose an innovative framework, MPF-KANSC, which integrates multi-plane fusion (MPF) for combining features from the coronal, sagittal, and axial planes, and a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network-guided spatial-channel attention mechanism (KANSC) to more effectively learn and represent sMRI atrophy features. Specifically, the proposed model enables parallel feature extraction from multiple anatomical planes, thus capturing more comprehensive structural information. The KANSC attention mechanism further leverages a more flexible and accurate nonlinear function approximation technique, facilitating precise identification and localization of disease-related abnormalities. Experiments on the ADNI dataset confirm that the proposed MPF-KANSC achieves superior performance in AD diagnosis. Moreover, our findings provide new evidence of right-lateralized asymmetry in subcortical structural changes during AD progression, highlighting the model's promising interpretability.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models have shown remarkable success across generative tasks, yet their high computational demands challenge deployment on resource-limited platforms. This paper investigates a critical question for compute-optimal diffusion model deployment: Under a post-training setting without fine-tuning, is it more effective to reduce the number of denoising steps or to use a cheaper per-step inference? Intuitively, reducing the number of denoising steps increases the variability of the distributions across steps, making the model more sensitive to compression. In contrast, keeping more denoising steps makes the differences smaller, preserving redundancy, and making post-training compression more feasible. To systematically examine this, we propose PostDiff, a training-free framework for accelerating pre-trained diffusion models by reducing redundancy at both the input level and module level in a post-training manner. At the input level, we propose a mixed-resolution denoising scheme based on the insight that reducing generation resolution in early denoising steps can enhance low-frequency components and improve final generation fidelity. At the module level, we employ a hybrid module caching strategy to reuse computations across denoising steps. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that (1) PostDiff can significantly improve the fidelity-efficiency trade-off of state-of-the-art diffusion models, and (2) to boost efficiency while maintaining decent generation fidelity, reducing per-step inference cost is often more effective than reducing the number of denoising steps.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>data-free</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Model merging has emerged as a compelling data-free paradigm for multi-task learning, enabling the fusion of multiple fine-tuned models into a single, powerful entity. A key technique in merging methods is sparsification, which prunes redundant parameters from task vectors to mitigate interference. However, prevailing approaches employ a ``one-size-fits-all'' strategy, applying a uniform sparsity ratio that overlooks the inherent structural and statistical heterogeneity of model parameters. This often leads to a suboptimal trade-off, where critical parameters are inadvertently pruned while less useful ones are retained. To address this limitation, we introduce \textbf{TADrop} (\textbf{T}ensor-wise \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{Drop}), an adaptive sparsification strategy that respects this heterogeneity. Instead of a global ratio, TADrop assigns a tailored sparsity level to each parameter tensor based on its distributional properties. The core intuition is that tensors with denser, more redundant distributions can be pruned aggressively, while sparser, more critical ones are preserved. As a simple and plug-and-play module, we validate TADrop by integrating it with foundational, classic, and SOTA merging methods. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks (vision, language, and multimodal) and models (ViT, BEiT) demonstrate that TADrop consistently and significantly boosts their performance. For instance, when enhancing a leading merging method, it achieves an average performance gain of 2.0\% across 8 ViT-B/32 tasks. TADrop provides a more effective way to mitigate parameter interference by tailoring sparsification to the model's structure, offering a new baseline for high-performance model merging.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities through two complementary paradigms: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which enhances knowledge grounding, and Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), which optimizes complex reasoning abilities. However, these two capabilities are often developed in isolation, and existing efforts to unify them remain narrow in scope-typically limited to open-domain QA with fixed retrieval settings and task-specific assumptions. This lack of integration constrains generalization and limits the applicability of RAG-RL methods to broader domains. To bridge this gap, we propose UR2 (Unified RAG and Reasoning), a general framework that unifies retrieval and reasoning through reinforcement learning. UR2 introduces two key contributions: a difficulty-aware curriculum training that selectively invokes retrieval only for challenging problems, and a hybrid knowledge access strategy combining domain-specific offline corpora with LLM-generated summaries. These components are designed to enable dynamic coordination between retrieval and reasoning, improving adaptability across a diverse range of tasks. Experiments across open-domain QA, MMLU-Pro, medical, and mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that UR2 (built on Qwen2.5-3/7B and LLaMA-3.1-8B) significantly outperforms existing RAG and RL methods, achieving comparable performance to GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4.1-mini on several benchmarks.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The paper reconceptualizes pragmatics not as a subordinate, third dimension of meaning, but as a dynamic interface through which language operates as a socially embedded tool for action. With the emergence of large language models (LLMs) in communicative contexts, this understanding needs to be further refined and methodologically reconsidered. The first section challenges the traditional semiotic trichotomy, arguing that connectionist LLM architectures destabilize established hierarchies of meaning, and proposes the Human-Machine Communication (HMC) framework as a more suitable alternative. The second section examines the tension between human-centred pragmatic theories and the machine-centred nature of LLMs. While traditional, Gricean-inspired pragmatics continue to dominate, it relies on human-specific assumptions ill-suited to predictive systems like LLMs. Probabilistic pragmatics, particularly the Rational Speech Act framework, offers a more compatible teleology by focusing on optimization rather than truth-evaluation. The third section addresses the issue of substitutionalism in three forms - generalizing, linguistic, and communicative - highlighting the anthropomorphic biases that distort LLM evaluation and obscure the role of human communicative subjects. Finally, the paper introduces the concept of context frustration to describe the paradox of increased contextual input paired with a collapse in contextual understanding, emphasizing how users are compelled to co-construct pragmatic conditions both for the model and themselves. These arguments suggest that pragmatic theory may need to be adjusted or expanded to better account for communication involving generative AI.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Underwater 3D scene reconstruction faces severe challenges from light absorption, scattering, and turbidity, which degrade geometry and color fidelity in traditional methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). While NeRF extensions such as SeaThru-NeRF incorporate physics-based models, their MLP reliance limits efficiency and spatial resolution in hazy environments. We introduce UW-3DGS, a novel framework adapting 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for robust underwater reconstruction. Key innovations include: (1) a plug-and-play learnable underwater image formation module using voxel-based regression for spatially varying attenuation and backscatter; and (2) a Physics-Aware Uncertainty Pruning (PAUP) branch that adaptively removes noisy floating Gaussians via uncertainty scoring, ensuring artifact-free geometry. The pipeline operates in training and rendering stages. During training, noisy Gaussians are optimized end-to-end with underwater parameters, guided by PAUP pruning and scattering modeling. In rendering, refined Gaussians produce clean Unattenuated Radiance Images (URIs) free from media effects, while learned physics enable realistic Underwater Images (UWIs) with accurate light transport. Experiments on SeaThru-NeRF and UWBundle datasets show superior performance, achieving PSNR of 27.604, SSIM of 0.868, and LPIPS of 0.104 on SeaThru-NeRF, with ~65% reduction in floating artifacts.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Colonoscopy is a vital tool for the early diagnosis of colorectal cancer, which is one of the main causes of cancer-related mortality globally; hence, it is deemed an essential technique for the prevention and early detection of colorectal cancer. The research introduces a unique multidirectional architectural framework to automate polyp detection within colonoscopy images while helping resolve limited healthcare dataset sizes and annotation complexities. The research implements a comprehensive system that delivers synthetic data generation through Stable Diffusion enhancements together with detection and segmentation algorithms. This detection approach combines Faster R-CNN for initial object localization while the Segment Anything Model (SAM) refines the segmentation masks. The faster R-CNN detection algorithm achieved a recall of 93.08% combined with a precision of 88.97% and an F1 score of 90.98%.SAM is then used to generate the image mask. The research evaluated five state-of-the-art segmentation models that included U-Net, PSPNet, FPN, LinkNet, and MANet using ResNet34 as a base model. The results demonstrate the superior performance of FPN with the highest scores of PSNR (7.205893) and SSIM (0.492381), while UNet excels in recall (84.85%) and LinkNet shows balanced performance in IoU (64.20%) and Dice score (77.53%).</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) often require vast amounts of text to effectively acquire new knowledge. While continuing pre-training on large corpora or employing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has proven successful, updating an LLM with only a few thousand or million tokens remains challenging. In this work, we investigate the task of injecting small, unstructured information into LLMs and its relation to the catastrophic forgetting phenomenon. We use a dataset of recent news -- ensuring no overlap with the model's pre-training data -- to evaluate the knowledge acquisition by probing the model with question-answer pairs related the learned information. Starting from a continued pre-training baseline, we explored different augmentation algorithms to generate synthetic data to improve the knowledge acquisition capabilities. Our experiments show that simply continuing pre-training on limited data yields modest improvements, whereas exposing the model to diverse textual variations significantly improves the learning of new facts -- particularly with methods that induce greater variability through diverse prompting. Furthermore, we shed light on the forgetting phenomenon in small-data regimes, illustrating the delicate balance between learning new content and retaining existing capabilities. We also confirm the sensitivity of RAG-based approaches for knowledge injection, which often lead to greater degradation on control datasets compared to parametric methods. Finally, we demonstrate that models can generate effective synthetic training data themselves, suggesting a pathway toward self-improving model updates. All code and generated data used in our experiments are publicly available, providing a resource for studying efficient knowledge injection in LLMs with limited data at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated clustering aims to group similar clients into clusters and produce one model for each cluster. Such a personalization approach typically improves model performance compared with training a single model to serve all clients, but can be more vulnerable to privacy leakage. Directly applying client-level differentially private (DP) mechanisms to federated clustering could degrade the utilities significantly. We identify that such deficiencies are mainly due to the difficulties of averaging privacy noise within each cluster (following standard privacy mechanisms), as the number of clients assigned to the same clusters is uncontrolled. To this end, we propose a simple and effective technique, named RR-Cluster, that can be viewed as a light-weight add-on to many federated clustering algorithms. RR-Cluster achieves reduced privacy noise via randomly rebalancing cluster assignments, guaranteeing a minimum number of clients assigned to each cluster. We analyze the tradeoffs between decreased privacy noise variance and potentially increased bias from incorrect assignments and provide convergence bounds for RR-Clsuter. Empirically, we demonstrate the RR-Cluster plugged into strong federated clustering algorithms results in significantly improved privacy/utility tradeoffs across both synthetic and real-world datasets.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have grown exponentially since the release of ChatGPT. These models have gained attention due to their robust performance on various tasks, including language processing tasks. These models achieve understanding and comprehension of tasks by training billions of parameters. The development of these models is a transformative force in enhancing natural language understanding and has taken a significant step towards artificial general intelligence (AGI). In this study, we aim to present the DKG-LLM framework. The DKG-LLM framework introduces a groundbreaking approach to medical diagnosis and personalized treatment recommendations by integrating a dynamic knowledge graph (DKG) with the Grok 3 large language model. Using the Adaptive Semantic Fusion Algorithm (ASFA), heterogeneous medical data (including clinical reports and PubMed articles) and patient records dynamically generate a knowledge graph consisting of 15,964 nodes in 13 distinct types (e.g., diseases, symptoms, treatments, patient profiles) and 127,392 edges in 26 relationship types (e.g., causal, therapeutic, association). ASFA utilizes advanced probabilistic models, Bayesian inference, and graph optimization to extract semantic information, dynamically updating the graph with approximately 150 new nodes and edges in each data category while maintaining scalability with up to 987,654 edges. Real-world datasets, including MIMIC-III and PubMed, were utilized to evaluate the proposed architecture. The evaluation results show that DKG-LLM achieves a diagnostic accuracy of 84.19%. The model also has a treatment recommendation accuracy of 89.63% and a semantic coverage of 93.48%. DKG-LLM is a reliable and transformative tool that handles noisy data and complex multi-symptom diseases, along with feedback-based learning from physician input.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, generative, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the acceleration of urbanization, criminal behavior in public scenes poses an increasingly serious threat to social security. Traditional anomaly detection methods based on feature recognition struggle to capture high-level behavioral semantics from historical information, while generative approaches based on Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to meet real-time requirements. To address these challenges, we propose MA-CBP, a criminal behavior prediction framework based on multi-agent asynchronous collaboration. This framework transforms real-time video streams into frame-level semantic descriptions, constructs causally consistent historical summaries, and fuses adjacent image frames to perform joint reasoning over long- and short-term contexts. The resulting behavioral decisions include key elements such as event subjects, locations, and causes, enabling early warning of potential criminal activity. In addition, we construct a high-quality criminal behavior dataset that provides multi-scale language supervision, including frame-level, summary-level, and event-level semantic annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance on multiple datasets and offers a promising solution for risk warning in urban public safety scenarios.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Pleural effusion semantic segmentation can significantly enhance the accuracy and timeliness of clinical diagnosis and treatment by precisely identifying disease severity and lesion areas. Currently, semantic segmentation of pleural effusion CT images faces multiple challenges. These include similar gray levels between effusion and surrounding tissues, blurred edges, and variable morphology. Existing methods often struggle with diverse image variations and complex edges, primarily because direct feature concatenation causes semantic gaps. To address these challenges, we propose the Dual-Branch Interactive Fusion Attention model (DBIF-AUNet). This model constructs a densely nested skip-connection network and innovatively refines the Dual-Domain Feature Disentanglement module (DDFD). The DDFD module orthogonally decouples the functions of dual-domain modules to achieve multi-scale feature complementarity and enhance characteristics at different levels. Concurrently, we design a Branch Interaction Attention Fusion module (BIAF) that works synergistically with the DDFD. This module dynamically weights and fuses global, local, and frequency band features, thereby improving segmentation robustness. Furthermore, we implement a nested deep supervision mechanism with hierarchical adaptive hybrid loss to effectively address class imbalance. Through validation on 1,622 pleural effusion CT images from Southwest Hospital, DBIF-AUNet achieved IoU and Dice scores of 80.1% and 89.0% respectively. These results outperform state-of-the-art medical image segmentation models U-Net++ and Swin-UNet by 5.7%/2.7% and 2.2%/1.5% respectively, demonstrating significant optimization in segmentation accuracy for complex pleural effusion CT images.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Precise jailbreak evaluation is vital for LLM red teaming and jailbreak research. Current approaches employ binary classification ( e.g., string matching, toxic text classifiers, LLM-driven methods), yielding only "yes/no" labels without quantifying harm intensity. Existing multi-dimensional frameworks ( e.g., Security Violation, Relative Truthfulness, Informativeness) apply uniform evaluation criteria across scenarios, resulting in scenario-specific mismatches--for instance, "Relative Truthfulness" is irrelevant to "hate speech"--which compromise evaluation precision. To tackle these limitations, we introduce SceneJailEval, with key contributions: (1) A groundbreaking scenario-adaptive multi-dimensional framework for jailbreak evaluation, overcoming the critical "one-size-fits-all" constraint of existing multi-dimensional methods, and featuring strong extensibility to flexibly adapt to customized or emerging scenarios. (2) A comprehensive 14-scenario dataset with diverse jailbreak variants and regional cases, filling the long-standing gap in high-quality, holistic benchmarks for scenario-adaptive evaluation. (3) SceneJailEval achieves state-of-the-art results, with an F1 score of 0.917 on our full-scenario dataset (+6% over prior SOTA) and 0.995 on JBB (+3% over prior SOTA), surpassing accuracy limits of existing evaluation methods in heterogeneous scenarios and confirming its advantage.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Emotional Intelligence (EI) is a critical yet underexplored dimension in the development of human-aligned LLMs. To address this gap, we introduce a unified, psychologically grounded four-layer taxonomy of EI tailored for large language models (LLMs), encompassing emotional tracking, cause inference, appraisal, and emotionally appropriate response generation. Building on this framework, we present EICAP-Bench, a novel MCQ style multi-turn benchmark designed to evaluate EI capabilities in open-source LLMs across diverse linguistic and cultural contexts. We evaluate six LLMs: LLaMA3 (8B), LLaMA3-Instruct, Gemma (9B), Gemma-Instruct, Qwen2.5 (7B), and Qwen2.5-Instruct on EmoCap-Bench, identifying Qwen2.5-Instruct as the strongest baseline. To assess the potential for enhancing EI capabilities, we fine-tune both Qwen2.5-Base and Qwen2.5-Instruct using LoRA adapters on UltraChat (UC), a large-scale, instruction-tuned dialogue dataset, in both English and Arabic. Our statistical analysis reveals that among the five EI layers, only the Appraisal layer shows significant improvement through UC-based fine-tuning. These findings highlight the limitations of existing pretraining and instruction-tuning paradigms in equipping LLMs with deeper emotional reasoning and underscore the need for targeted data and modeling strategies for comprehensive EI alignment.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Pretrained neural networks have attracted significant interest in chemistry and small molecule drug design. Embeddings from these models are widely used for molecular property prediction, virtual screening, and small data learning in molecular chemistry. This study presents the most extensive comparison of such models to date, evaluating 25 models across 25 datasets. Under a fair comparison framework, we assess models spanning various modalities, architectures, and pretraining strategies. Using a dedicated hierarchical Bayesian statistical testing model, we arrive at a surprising result: nearly all neural models show negligible or no improvement over the baseline ECFP molecular fingerprint. Only the CLAMP model, which is also based on molecular fingerprints, performs statistically significantly better than the alternatives. These findings raise concerns about the evaluation rigor in existing studies. We discuss potential causes, propose solutions, and offer practical recommendations.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Continual Visual Instruction Tuning (CVIT) enables Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to incrementally learn new tasks over time. However, this process is challenged by catastrophic forgetting, where performance on previously learned tasks deteriorates as the model adapts to new ones. A common approach to mitigate forgetting is architecture expansion, which introduces task-specific modules to prevent interference. Yet, existing methods often expand entire layers for each task, leading to significant parameter overhead and poor scalability. To overcome these issues, we introduce LoRA in LoRA (LiLoRA), a highly efficient architecture expansion method tailored for CVIT in MLLMs. LiLoRA shares the LoRA matrix A across tasks to reduce redundancy, applies an additional low-rank decomposition to matrix B to minimize task-specific parameters, and incorporates a cosine-regularized stability loss to preserve consistency in shared representations over time. Extensive experiments on a diverse CVIT benchmark show that LiLoRA consistently achieves superior performance in sequential task learning while significantly improving parameter efficiency compared to existing approaches.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>protect, robust, explainability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Robust content moderation requires classification systems that can quickly adapt to evolving policies without costly retraining. We present classification using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which shifts traditional classification tasks from determining the correct category in accordance with pre-trained parameters to evaluating content in relation to contextual knowledge retrieved at inference. In hate speech detection, this transforms the task from "is this hate speech?" to "does this violate the hate speech policy?" Our Contextual Policy Engine (CPE) - an agentic RAG system - demonstrates this approach and offers three key advantages: (1) robust classification accuracy comparable to leading commercial systems, (2) inherent explainability via retrieved policy segments, and (3) dynamic policy updates without model retraining. Through three experiments, we demonstrate strong baseline performance and show that the system can apply fine-grained policy control by correctly adjusting protection for specific identity groups without requiring retraining or compromising overall performance. These findings establish that RAG can transform classification into a more flexible, transparent, and adaptable process for content moderation and wider classification problems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, protect, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated recommendation systems (FedRecs) have gained significant attention for providing privacy-preserving recommendation services. However, existing FedRecs assume that all users have the same requirements for privacy protection, i.e., they do not upload any data to the server. The approaches overlook the potential to enhance the recommendation service by utilizing publicly available user data. In real-world applications, users can choose to be private or public. Private users' interaction data is not shared, while public users' interaction data can be shared. Inspired by the issue, this paper proposes a novel Graph Federated Learning for Personalized Privacy Recommendation (GFed-PP) that adapts to different privacy requirements while improving recommendation performance. GFed-PP incorporates the interaction data of public users to build a user-item interaction graph, which is then used to form a user relationship graph. A lightweight graph convolutional network (GCN) is employed to learn each user's user-specific personalized item embedding. To protect user privacy, each client learns the user embedding and the scoring function locally. Additionally, GFed-PP achieves optimization of the federated recommendation framework through the initialization of item embedding on clients and the aggregation of the user relationship graph on the server. Experimental results demonstrate that GFed-PP significantly outperforms existing methods for five datasets, offering superior recommendation accuracy without compromising privacy. This framework provides a practical solution for accommodating varying privacy preferences in federated recommendation systems.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The Sharp/van der Heijde (SvdH) score has been widely used in clinical trials to quantify radiographic damage in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), but its complexity has limited its adoption in routine clinical practice. To address the inefficiency of manual scoring, this work proposes a two-stage pipeline for interpretable image-level SvdH score prediction using dual-hand radiographs. Our approach extracts disease-relevant image regions and integrates them using attention-based multiple instance learning to generate image-level features for prediction. We propose two region extraction schemes: 1) sampling image tiles most likely to contain abnormalities, and 2) cropping patches containing disease-relevant joints. With Scheme 2, our best individual score prediction model achieved a Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.943 and a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 15.73. Ensemble learning further boosted prediction accuracy, yielding a PCC of 0.945 and RMSE of 15.57, achieving state-of-the-art performance that is comparable to that of experienced radiologists (PCC = 0.97, RMSE = 18.75). Finally, our pipeline effectively identified and made decisions based on anatomical structures which clinicians consider relevant to RA progression.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Semantic segmentation of urban remote sensing images (URSIs) is crucial for applications such as urban planning and environmental monitoring. However, geospatial objects often exhibit subtle texture differences and similar spatial structures, which can easily lead to semantic ambiguity and misclassification. Moreover, challenges such as irregular object shapes, blurred boundaries, and overlapping spatial distributions of semantic objects contribute to complex and diverse edge morphologies, further complicating accurate segmentation. To tackle these issues, we propose a texture-aware and edge-guided Transformer (TEFormer) that integrates texture awareness and edge-guidance mechanisms for semantic segmentation of URSIs. In the encoder, a texture-aware module (TaM) is designed to capture fine-grained texture differences between visually similar categories to enhance semantic discrimination. Then, an edge-guided tri-branch decoder (Eg3Head) is constructed to preserve local edges and details for multiscale context-awareness. Finally, an edge-guided feature fusion module (EgFFM) is to fuse contextual and detail information with edge information to realize refined semantic segmentation. Extensive experiments show that TEFormer achieves mIoU of 88.57%, 81.46%, and 53.55% on the Potsdam, Vaihingen, and LoveDA datasets, respectively, shows the effectiveness in URSI semantic segmentation.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Depth information is essential in computer vision, particularly in underwater imaging, robotics, and autonomous navigation. However, conventional augmentation techniques overlook depth aware transformations, limiting model robustness in real world depth variations. In this paper, we introduce Depth-Jitter, a novel depth-based augmentation technique that simulates natural depth variations to improve generalization. Our approach applies adaptive depth offsetting, guided by depth variance thresholds, to generate synthetic depth perturbations while preserving structural integrity. We evaluate Depth-Jitter on two benchmark datasets, FathomNet and UTDAC2020 demonstrating its impact on model stability under diverse depth conditions. Extensive experiments compare Depth-Jitter against traditional augmentation strategies such as ColorJitter, analyzing performance across varying learning rates, encoders, and loss functions. While Depth-Jitter does not always outperform conventional methods in absolute performance, it consistently enhances model stability and generalization in depth-sensitive environments. These findings highlight the potential of depth-aware augmentation for real-world applications and provide a foundation for further research into depth-based learning strategies. The proposed technique is publicly available to support advancements in depth-aware augmentation. The code is publicly available on \href{this https URL}{github}.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Image deblurring, removing blurring artifacts from images, is a fundamental task in computational photography and low-level computer vision. Existing approaches focus on specialized solutions tailored to particular blur types, thus, these solutions lack generalization. This limitation in current methods implies requiring multiple models to cover several blur types, which is not practical in many real scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the first all-in-one deblurring method capable of efficiently restoring images affected by diverse blur degradations, including global motion, local motion, blur in low-light conditions, and defocus blur. We propose a mixture-of-experts (MoE) decoding module, which dynamically routes image features based on the recognized blur degradation, enabling precise and efficient restoration in an end-to-end manner. Our unified approach not only achieves performance comparable to dedicated task-specific models, but also demonstrates remarkable robustness and generalization capabilities on unseen blur degradation scenarios.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The advent of 6G networks opens new possibilities for connected infotainment services in vehicular environments. However, traditional Radio Resource Management (RRM) techniques struggle with the increasing volume and complexity of data such as Channel Quality Indicators (CQI) from autonomous vehicles. To address this, we propose SCAR (State-Space Compression for AI-Driven Resource Management), an Edge AI-assisted framework that optimizes scheduling and fairness in vehicular infotainment. SCAR employs ML-based compression techniques (e.g., clustering and RBF networks) to reduce CQI data size while preserving essential features. These compressed states are used to train 6G-enabled Reinforcement Learning policies that maximize throughput while meeting fairness objectives defined by the NGMN. Simulations show that SCAR increases time in feasible scheduling regions by 14\% and reduces unfair scheduling time by 15\% compared to RL baselines without CQI compression. Furthermore, Simulated Annealing with Stochastic Tunneling (SAST)-based clustering reduces CQI clustering distortion by 10\%, confirming its efficiency. These results demonstrate SCAR's scalability and fairness benefits for dynamic vehicular networks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, membership infer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Machine learning models have been shown to be susceptible to membership inference attack, which can be used to determine whether a given sample appears in the training data. Existing membership inference methods commonly assume that the adversary has full access to the features of the target sample. This assumption, however, does not hold in many real-world scenarios where only partial features information is available, thereby limiting the applicability of these methods. In this work, we study an inference scenario where the adversary observes only partial features of each sample and aims to infer whether this observed subset was present in the training set of the target model. We define this problem as Partial Feature Membership Inference (PFMI). To address this problem, we propose MRAD (Memory-guided Reconstruction and Anomaly Detection), a two-stage attack framework. In the first stage, MRAD optimizes the unknown feature values to minimize the loss of the sample. In the second stage, it measures the deviation between the reconstructed sample and the training distribution using anomaly detection. Empirical results demonstrate that MRAD is effective across a range of datasets, and maintains compatibility with various off-the-shelf anomaly detection techniques. For example, on STL-10, our attack achieves an AUC of around 0.6 even with 40% of the missing features.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The generalization of deepfake detectors to unseen manipulation techniques remains a challenge for practical deployment. Although many approaches adapt foundation models by introducing significant architectural complexity, this work demonstrates that robust generalization is achievable through a parameter-efficient adaptation of a pre-trained CLIP vision encoder. The proposed method, LNCLIP-DF, fine-tunes only the Layer Normalization parameters (0.03% of the total) and enhances generalization by enforcing a hyperspherical feature manifold using L2 normalization and latent space augmentations. We conducted an extensive evaluation on 13 benchmark datasets spanning from 2019 to 2025. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming more complex, recent approaches in average cross-dataset AUROC. Our analysis yields two primary findings for the field: 1) training on paired real-fake data from the same source video is essential for mitigating shortcut learning and improving generalization, and 2) detection difficulty on academic datasets has not strictly increased over time, with models trained on older, diverse datasets showing strong generalization capabilities. This work delivers a computationally efficient and reproducible method, proving that state-of-the-art generalization is attainable by making targeted, minimal changes to a pre-trained CLIP model. The code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>defense, attack, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Fine-tuning lets practitioners repurpose aligned large language models (LLMs) for new domains, yet recent work reveals emergent misalignment (EMA): Even a small, domain-specific fine-tune can induce harmful behaviors far outside the target domain. Even in the case where model weights are hidden behind a fine-tuning API, this gives attackers inadvertent access to a broadly misaligned model in a way that can be hard to detect from the fine-tuning data alone. We present the first systematic study of in-training safeguards against EMA that are practical for providers who expose fine-tuning via an API. We investigate four training regularization interventions: (i) KL-divergence regularization toward a safe reference model, (ii) $\ell_2$ distance in feature space, (iii) projecting onto a safe subspace (SafeLoRA), and (iv) interleaving of a small amount of safe training examples from a general instruct-tuning dataset. We first evaluate the methods' emergent misalignment effect across four malicious, EMA-inducing tasks. Second, we assess the methods' impacts on benign tasks. We conclude with a discussion of open questions in emergent misalignment research.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Synthetic data generation is a key technique in modern artificial intelligence, addressing data scarcity, privacy constraints, and the need for diverse datasets in training robust models. In this work, we propose a method for generating privacy-preserving high-quality synthetic tabular data using Tensor Networks, specifically Matrix Product States (MPS). We benchmark the MPS-based generative model against state-of-the-art models such as CTGAN, VAE, and PrivBayes, focusing on both fidelity and privacy-preserving capabilities. To ensure differential privacy (DP), we integrate noise injection and gradient clipping during training, enabling privacy guarantees via R√©nyi Differential Privacy accounting. Across multiple metrics analyzing data fidelity and downstream machine learning task performance, our results show that MPS outperforms classical models, particularly under strict privacy constraints. This work highlights MPS as a promising tool for privacy-aware synthetic data generation. By combining the expressive power of tensor network representations with formal privacy mechanisms, the proposed approach offers an interpretable and scalable alternative for secure data sharing. Its structured design facilitates integration into sensitive domains where both data quality and confidentiality are critical.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated learning (FL) enables the collaborative training of deep neural networks across decentralized data archives (i.e., clients), where each client stores data locally and only shares model updates with a central server. This makes FL a suitable learning paradigm for remote sensing (RS) image classification tasks, where data centralization may be restricted due to legal and privacy constraints. However, a key challenge in applying FL to RS tasks is the communication overhead caused by the frequent exchange of large model updates between clients and the central server. To address this issue, in this paper we propose a novel strategy (denoted as FedX) that uses explanation-guided pruning to reduce communication overhead by minimizing the size of the transmitted models without compromising performance. FedX leverages backpropagation-based explanation methods to estimate the task-specific importance of model components and prunes the least relevant ones at the central server. The resulting sparse global model is then sent to clients, substantially reducing communication overhead. We evaluate FedX on multi-label scene classification using the BigEarthNet-S2 dataset and single-label scene classification using the EuroSAT dataset. Experimental results show the success of FedX in significantly reducing the number of shared model parameters while enhancing the generalization capability of the global model, compared to both unpruned model and state-of-the-art pruning methods.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Integrating multi-omics datasets through data-driven analysis offers a comprehensive understanding of the complex biological processes underlying various diseases, particularly cancer. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently demonstrated remarkable ability to exploit relational structures in biological data, enabling advances in multi-omics integration for cancer subtype classification. Existing approaches often neglect the intricate coupling between heterogeneous omics, limiting their capacity to resolve subtle cancer subtype heterogeneity critical for precision oncology. To address these limitations, we propose a framework named Graph Transformer for Multi-omics Cancer Subtype Classification (GTMancer). This framework builds upon the GNN optimization problem and extends its application to complex multi-omics data. Specifically, our method leverages contrastive learning to embed multi-omics data into a unified semantic space. We unroll the multiplex graph optimization problem in that unified space and introduce dual sets of attention coefficients to capture structural graph priors both within and among multi-omics data. This approach enables global omics information to guide the refining of the representations of individual omics. Empirical experiments on seven real-world cancer datasets demonstrate that GTMancer outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Accurate segmentation of femur structures from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is critical for orthopedic diagnosis and surgical planning but remains challenging due to the limitations of existing 2D and 3D deep learning-based segmentation approaches. In this study, we propose XAG-Net, a novel 2.5D U-Net-based architecture that incorporates pixel-wise cross-slice attention (CSA) and skip attention gating (AG) mechanisms to enhance inter-slice contextual modeling and intra-slice feature refinement. Unlike previous CSA-based models, XAG-Net applies pixel-wise softmax attention across adjacent slices at each spatial location for fine-grained inter-slice modeling. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that XAG-Net surpasses baseline 2D, 2.5D, and 3D U-Net models in femur segmentation accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. Ablation studies further validate the critical role of the CSA and AG modules, establishing XAG-Net as a promising framework for efficient and accurate femur MRI segmentation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) still face significant challenges in complex visual tasks (e.g., spatial understanding, fine-grained perception). Prior methods have tried to incorporate visual reasoning, however, they fail to leverage attention correction with spatial cues to iteratively refine their focus on prompt-relevant regions. In this paper, we introduce SIFThinker, a spatially-aware "think-with-images" framework that mimics human visual perception. Specifically, SIFThinker enables attention correcting and image region focusing by interleaving depth-enhanced bounding boxes and natural language. Our contributions are twofold: First, we introduce a reverse-expansion-forward-inference strategy that facilitates the generation of interleaved image-text chains of thought for process-level supervision, which in turn leads to the construction of the SIF-50K dataset. Besides, we propose GRPO-SIF, a reinforced training paradigm that integrates depth-informed visual grounding into a unified reasoning pipeline, teaching the model to dynamically correct and focus on prompt-relevant regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SIFThinker outperforms state-of-the-art methods in spatial understanding and fine-grained visual perception, while maintaining strong general capabilities, highlighting the effectiveness of our method.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative models, especially diffusion and flow-based models, have been promising in offline multi-agent reinforcement learning. However, integrating powerful generative models into this framework poses unique challenges. In particular, diffusion and flow-based policies suffer from low sampling efficiency due to their iterative generation processes, making them impractical in time-sensitive or resource-constrained settings. To tackle these difficulties, we propose OM2P (Offline Multi-Agent Mean-Flow Policy), a novel offline MARL algorithm to achieve efficient one-step action sampling. To address the misalignment between generative objectives and reward maximization, we introduce a reward-aware optimization scheme that integrates a carefully-designed mean-flow matching loss with Q-function supervision. Additionally, we design a generalized timestep distribution and a derivative-free estimation strategy to reduce memory overhead and improve training stability. Empirical evaluations on Multi-Agent Particle and MuJoCo benchmarks demonstrate that OM2P achieves superior performance, with up to a 3.8x reduction in GPU memory usage and up to a 10.8x speed-up in training time. Our approach represents the first to successfully integrate mean-flow model into offline MARL, paving the way for practical and scalable generative policies in cooperative multi-agent settings.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, transformer, generative, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Intent recognition (IR) for speech commands is essential for artificial intelligence (AI) assistant systems; however, most existing approaches are limited to short commands and are predominantly developed for English. This paper addresses these limitations by focusing on IR from speech by elderly German speakers. We propose a novel approach that combines an adapted Whisper ASR model, fine-tuned on elderly German speech (SVC-de), with Transformer-based language models trained on synthetic text datasets generated by three well-known large language models (LLMs): LeoLM, Llama3, and ChatGPT. To evaluate the robustness of our approach, we generate synthetic speech with a text-to-speech model and conduct extensive cross-dataset testing. Our results show that synthetic LLM-generated data significantly boosts classification performance and robustness to different speaking styles and unseen vocabulary. Notably, we find that LeoLM, a smaller, domain-specific 13B LLM, surpasses the much larger ChatGPT (175B) in dataset quality for German intent recognition. Our approach demonstrates that generative AI can effectively bridge data gaps in low-resource domains. We provide detailed documentation of our data generation and training process to ensure transparency and reproducibility.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Indias linguistic diversity poses significant challenges for developing inclusive Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. Traditional multilingual models, which require simultaneous access to all language data, are impractical due to the sequential arrival of data and privacy constraints. Continual Learning (CL) offers a solution by enabling models to learn new languages sequentially without catastrophically forgetting previously learned knowledge. This paper investigates CL for ASR on Indian languages using a subset of the IndicSUPERB benchmark. We employ a Conformer-based hybrid RNN-T/CTC model, initially pretrained on Hindi, which is then incrementally trained on eight additional Indian languages, for a total sequence of nine languages. We evaluate three prominent regularization- and distillation-based CL strategies: Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC), Memory Aware Synapses (MAS), and Learning without Forgetting (LwF), selected for their suitability in no-replay, privacy-conscious scenarios. Performance is analyzed using Word Error Rate (WER) for both RNN-T and CTC paths on clean and noisy data, as well as knowledge retention via Backward Transfer. We also explore the impact of varying the number of training epochs (1, 2, 5, and 10) per task. Results, compared against naive fine-tuning, demonstrate CLs effectiveness in mitigating forgetting, making it a promising approach for scalable ASR in diverse Indian languages under realistic constraints.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, robust, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Neural fields provide a memory-efficient representation of data, which can effectively handle diverse modalities and large-scale data. However, learning to map neural fields often requires large amounts of training data and computations, which can be limited to resource-constrained edge devices. One approach to tackle this limitation is to leverage Federated Meta-Learning (FML), but traditional FML approaches suffer from privacy leakage. To address these issues, we introduce a novel FML approach called FedMeNF. FedMeNF utilizes a new privacy-preserving loss function that regulates privacy leakage in the local meta-optimization. This enables the local meta-learner to optimize quickly and efficiently without retaining the client's private data. Our experiments demonstrate that FedMeNF achieves fast optimization speed and robust reconstruction performance, even with few-shot or non-IID data across diverse data modalities, while preserving client data privacy.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In recent years, concerns about intellectual property (IP) in large language models (LLMs) have grown significantly. Plagiarizing other LLMs (through direct weight copying, upcycling, pruning, or continual pretraining) and claiming authorship without properly attributing to the original license, is a serious misconduct that can lead to significant financial and reputational harm to the original developers. However, existing methods for detecting LLM plagiarism fall short in key areas. They fail to accurately reconstruct weight correspondences, lack the ability to compute statistical significance measures such as $p$-values, and may mistakenly flag models trained on similar data as being related. To address these limitations, we propose Matrix-Driven Instant Review (MDIR), a novel method that leverages matrix analysis and Large Deviation Theory. MDIR achieves accurate reconstruction of weight relationships, provides rigorous $p$-value estimation, and focuses exclusively on weight similarity without requiring full model inference. Experimental results demonstrate that MDIR reliably detects plagiarism even after extensive transformations, such as random permutations and continual pretraining with trillions of tokens. Moreover, all detections can be performed on a single PC within an hour, making MDIR both efficient and accessible.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the advancement of personalized image generation technologies, concerns about forgery attacks that infringe on portrait rights and privacy are growing. To address these concerns, protection perturbation algorithms have been developed to disrupt forgery generation. However, the protection algorithms would become ineffective when forgery attackers apply purification techniques to bypass the protection. To address this issue, we present a novel approach, Anti-Tamper Perturbation (ATP). ATP introduces a tamper-proof mechanism within the perturbation. It consists of protection and authorization perturbations, where the protection perturbation defends against forgery attacks, while the authorization perturbation detects purification-based tampering. Both protection and authorization perturbations are applied in the frequency domain under the guidance of a mask, ensuring that the protection perturbation does not disrupt the authorization perturbation. This design also enables the authorization perturbation to be distributed across all image pixels, preserving its sensitivity to purification-based tampering. ATP demonstrates its effectiveness in defending forgery attacks across various attack settings through extensive experiments, providing a robust solution for protecting individuals' portrait rights and privacy.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, including cardiac MR, is prone to domain shift due to variations in imaging devices and acquisition protocols. This challenge limits the deployment of trained AI models in real-world scenarios, where performance degrades on unseen domains. Traditional solutions involve increasing the size of the dataset through ad-hoc image augmentation or additional online training/transfer learning, which have several limitations. Synthetic data offers a promising alternative, but anatomical/structural consistency constraints limit the effectiveness of generative models in creating image-label pairs. To address this, we propose a diffusion model (DM) trained on a source domain that generates synthetic cardiac MR images that resemble a given reference. The synthetic data maintains spatial and structural fidelity, ensuring similarity to the source domain and compatibility with the segmentation mask. We assess the utility of our generative approach in multi-centre cardiac MR segmentation, using the 2D nnU-Net, 3D nnU-Net and vanilla U-Net segmentation networks. We explore domain generalisation, where, domain-invariant segmentation models are trained on synthetic source domain data, and domain adaptation, where, we shift target domain data towards the source domain using the DM. Both strategies significantly improved segmentation performance on data from an unseen target domain, in terms of surface-based metrics (Welch's t-test, p < 0.01), compared to training segmentation models on real data alone. The proposed method ameliorates the need for transfer learning or online training to address domain shift challenges in cardiac MR image analysis, especially useful in data-scarce settings.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce Unsupervised Partner Design (UPD) - a population-free, multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for robust ad-hoc teamwork that adaptively generates training partners without requiring pretrained partners or manual parameter tuning. UPD constructs diverse partners by stochastically mixing an ego agent's policy with biased random behaviours and scores them using a variance-based learnability metric that prioritises partners near the ego agent's current learning frontier. We show that UPD can be integrated with unsupervised environment design, resulting in the first method enabling fully unsupervised curricula over both level and partner distributions in a cooperative setting. Through extensive evaluations on Overcooked-AI and the Overcooked Generalisation Challenge, we demonstrate that this dynamic partner curriculum is highly effective: UPD consistently outperforms both population-based and population-free baselines as well as ablations. In a user study, we further show that UPD achieves higher returns than all baselines and was perceived as significantly more adaptive, more human-like, a better collaborator, and less frustrating.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Designing socially active streets has long been a goal of urban planning, yet existing quantitative research largely measures pedestrian volume rather than the quality of social interactions. We hypothesize that street view imagery -- an inexpensive data source with global coverage -- contains latent social information that can be extracted and interpreted through established social science theory. As a proof of concept, we analyzed 2,998 street view images from 15 cities using a multimodal large language model guided by Mehta's taxonomy of passive, fleeting, and enduring sociability -- one illustrative example of a theory grounded in urban design that could be substituted or complemented by other sociological frameworks. We then used linear regression models, controlling for factors like weather, time of day, and pedestrian counts, to test whether the inferred sociability measures correlate with city-level place attachment scores from the World Values Survey and with environmental predictors (e.g., green, sky, and water view indices) derived from individual street view images. Results aligned with long-standing urban planning theory: the sky view index was associated with all three sociability types, the green view index predicted enduring sociability, and place attachment was positively associated with fleeting sociability. These results provide preliminary evidence that street view images can be used to infer relationships between specific types of social interactions and built environment variables. Further research could establish street view imagery as a scalable, privacy-preserving tool for studying urban sociability, enabling cross-cultural theory testing and evidence-based design of socially vibrant cities.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Robust loss functions are crucial for training deep neural networks in the presence of label noise, yet existing approaches require extensive, dataset-specific hyperparameter tuning. In this work, we introduce Fractional Classification Loss (FCL), an adaptive robust loss that automatically calibrates its robustness to label noise during training. Built within the active-passive loss framework, FCL employs the fractional derivative of the Cross-Entropy (CE) loss as its active component and the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as its passive loss component. With this formulation, we demonstrate that the fractional derivative order $\mu$ spans a family of loss functions that interpolate between MAE-like robustness and CE-like fast convergence. Furthermore, we integrate $\mu$ into the gradient-based optimization as a learnable parameter and automatically adjust it to optimize the trade-off between robustness and convergence speed. We reveal that FCL's unique property establishes a critical trade-off that enables the stable learning of $\mu$: lower log penalties on difficult or mislabeled examples improve robustness but impose higher penalties on easy or clean data, reducing model confidence in them. Consequently, FCL can dynamically reshape its loss landscape to achieve effective classification performance under label noise. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that FCL achieves state-of-the-art results without the need for manual hyperparameter tuning.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Learning interpretable latent representations from tabular data remains a challenge in deep generative modeling. We introduce SE-VAE (Structural Equation-Variational Autoencoder), a novel architecture that embeds measurement structure directly into the design of a variational autoencoder. Inspired by structural equation modeling, SE-VAE aligns latent subspaces with known indicator groupings and introduces a global nuisance latent to isolate construct-specific confounding variation. This modular architecture enables disentanglement through design rather than through statistical regularizers alone. We evaluate SE-VAE on a suite of simulated tabular datasets and benchmark its performance against a series of leading baselines using standard disentanglement metrics. SE-VAE consistently outperforms alternatives in factor recovery, interpretability, and robustness to nuisance variation. Ablation results reveal that architectural structure, rather than regularization strength, is the key driver of performance. SE-VAE offers a principled framework for white-box generative modeling in scientific and social domains where latent constructs are theory-driven and measurement validity is essential.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Understanding abnormal events in videos is a vital and challenging task that has garnered significant attention in a wide range of applications. Although current video understanding Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are capable of analyzing general videos, they often struggle to handle anomalies due to the spatial and temporal sparsity of abnormal events, where the redundant information always leads to suboptimal outcomes. To address these challenges, exploiting the representation and generalization capabilities of Vison Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose VA-GPT, a novel MLLM designed for summarizing and localizing abnormal events in various videos. Our approach efficiently aligns effective tokens between visual encoders and LLMs through two key proposed modules: Spatial Effective Token Selection (SETS) and Temporal Effective Token Generation (TETG). These modules enable our model to effectively capture and analyze both spatial and temporal information associated with abnormal events, resulting in more accurate responses and interactions. Furthermore, we construct an instruction-following dataset specifically for fine-tuning video-anomaly-aware MLLMs, and introduce a cross-domain evaluation benchmark based on XD-Violence dataset. Our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on various benchmarks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we describe an implementation of the two-phase image segmentation algorithm proposed by Goldstein, Bresson, Osher in \cite{gold:bre}. This algorithm partitions the domain of a given 2d image into foreground and background regions, and each pixel of the image is assigned membership to one of these two regions. The underlying assumption for the segmentation model is that the pixel values of the input image can be summarized by two distinct average values, and that the region boundaries are smooth. Accordingly, the model is defined as an energy in which the variable is a region membership function to assign pixels to either region, originally proposed by Chan and Vese in \cite{chan:vese}. This energy is the sum of image data terms in the regions and a length penalty for region boundaries. Goldstein, Bresson, Osher modify the energy of Chan-Vese in \cite{gold:bre} so that their new energy can be minimized efficiently using the split Bregman method to produce an equivalent two-phase segmentation. We provide a detailed implementation of this method \cite{gold:bre}, and document its performance with several images over a range of algorithm parameters.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Detecting cyberbullying on social media remains a critical challenge due to its subtle and varied expressions. This study investigates whether integrating aggression detection as an auxiliary task within a unified training framework can enhance the generalisation and performance of large language models (LLMs) in cyberbullying detection. Experiments are conducted on five aggression datasets and one cyberbullying dataset using instruction-tuned LLMs. We evaluated multiple strategies: zero-shot, few-shot, independent LoRA fine-tuning, and multi-task learning (MTL). Given the inconsistent results of MTL, we propose an enriched prompt pipeline approach in which aggression predictions are embedded into cyberbullying detection prompts to provide contextual augmentation. Preliminary results show that the enriched prompt pipeline consistently outperforms standard LoRA fine-tuning, indicating that aggression-informed context significantly boosts cyberbullying detection. This study highlights the potential of auxiliary tasks, such as aggression detection, to improve the generalisation of LLMs for safety-critical applications on social networks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely deployed in reasoning, planning, and decision-making tasks, making their trustworthiness a critical concern. The potential for intentional deception, where an LLM deliberately fabricates or conceals information to serve a hidden objective, remains a significant and underexplored threat. Existing studies typically induce such deception by explicitly setting a "hidden" objective through prompting or fine-tuning, which may not fully reflect real-world human-LLM interactions. Moving beyond this human-induced deception, we investigate LLMs' self-initiated deception on benign prompts. To address the absence of ground truth in this evaluation, we propose a novel framework using "contact searching questions." This framework introduces two statistical metrics derived from psychological principles to quantify the likelihood of deception. The first, the Deceptive Intention Score, measures the model's bias towards a hidden objective. The second, Deceptive Behavior Score, measures the inconsistency between the LLM's internal belief and its expressed output. Upon evaluating 14 leading LLMs, we find that both metrics escalate as task difficulty increases, rising in parallel for most models. Building on these findings, we formulate a mathematical model to explain this behavior. These results reveal that even the most advanced LLMs exhibit an increasing tendency toward deception when handling complex problems, raising critical concerns for the deployment of LLM agents in complex and crucial domains.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Achieving precise control over a molecule's biological activity-encompassing targeted activation/inhibition, cooperative multi-target modulation, and off-target toxicity mitigation-remains a critical challenge in de novo drug design. However, existing generative methods primarily focus on producing molecules with a single desired activity, lacking integrated mechanisms for the simultaneous management of multiple intended and unintended molecular interactions. Here, we propose ActivityDiff, a generative approach based on the classifier-guidance technique of diffusion models. It leverages separately trained drug-target classifiers for both positive and negative guidance, enabling the model to enhance desired activities while minimizing harmful off-target effects. Experimental results show that ActivityDiff effectively handles essential drug design tasks, including single-/dual-target generation, fragment-constrained dual-target design, selective generation to enhance target specificity, and reduction of off-target effects. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of classifier-guided diffusion in balancing efficacy and safety in molecular design. Overall, our work introduces a novel paradigm for achieving integrated control over molecular activity, and provides ActivityDiff as a versatile and extensible framework.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text-to-SQL bridges the gap between natural language and structured database language, thus allowing non-technical users to easily query databases. Traditional approaches model text-to-SQL as a direct translation task, where a given Natural Language Query (NLQ) is mapped to an SQL command. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved translation accuracy, however, these methods all require that the target database is pre-specified. This becomes problematic in scenarios with multiple extensive databases, where identifying the correct database becomes a crucial yet overlooked step. In this paper, we propose a three-stage end-to-end text-to-SQL framework to identify the user's intended database before generating SQL queries. Our approach leverages LLMs and prompt engineering to extract implicit information from natural language queries (NLQs) in the form of a ruleset. We then train a large db\_id prediction model, which includes a RoBERTa-based finetuned encoder, to predict the correct Database identifier (db\_id) based on both the NLQ and the LLM-generated rules. Finally, we refine the generated SQL by using critic agents to correct errors. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms the current state-of-the-art models in both database intent prediction and SQL generation accuracy.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in role-playing conversations and providing emotional support as separate research directions. However, there remains a significant research gap in combining these capabilities to enable emotionally supportive interactions with virtual characters. To address this research gap, we focus on anime characters as a case study because of their well-defined personalities and large fan bases. This choice enables us to effectively evaluate how well LLMs can provide emotional support while maintaining specific character traits. We introduce ChatAnime, the first Emotionally Supportive Role-Playing (ESRP) dataset. We first thoughtfully select 20 top-tier characters from popular anime communities and design 60 emotion-centric real-world scenario questions. Then, we execute a nationwide selection process to identify 40 Chinese anime enthusiasts with profound knowledge of specific characters and extensive experience in role-playing. Next, we systematically collect two rounds of dialogue data from 10 LLMs and these 40 Chinese anime enthusiasts. To evaluate the ESRP performance of LLMs, we design a user experience-oriented evaluation system featuring 9 fine-grained metrics across three dimensions: basic dialogue, role-playing and emotional support, along with an overall metric for response diversity. In total, the dataset comprises 2,400 human-written and 24,000 LLM-generated answers, supported by over 132,000 human annotations. Experimental results show that top-performing LLMs surpass human fans in role-playing and emotional support, while humans still lead in response diversity. We hope this work can provide valuable resources and insights for future research on optimizing LLMs in ESRP. Our datasets are available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent progress in 3D reconstruction has enabled realistic 3D models from dense image captures, yet challenges persist with sparse views, often leading to artifacts in unseen areas. Recent works leverage Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) to generate dense observations, filling the gaps when only sparse views are available for 3D reconstruction tasks. A significant limitation of these methods is their slow sampling speed when using VDMs. In this paper, we present FVGen, a novel framework that addresses this challenge by enabling fast novel view synthesis using VDMs in as few as four sampling steps. We propose a novel video diffusion model distillation method that distills a multi-step denoising teacher model into a few-step denoising student model using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and softened reverse KL-divergence minimization. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that, compared to previous works, our framework generates the same number of novel views with similar (or even better) visual quality while reducing sampling time by more than 90%. FVGen significantly improves time efficiency for downstream reconstruction tasks, particularly when working with sparse input views (more than 2) where pre-trained VDMs need to be run multiple times to achieve better spatial coverage.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, defense, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>AI for IT Operations (AIOps) is transforming how organizations manage complex software systems by automating anomaly detection, incident diagnosis, and remediation. Modern AIOps solutions increasingly rely on autonomous LLM-based agents to interpret telemetry data and take corrective actions with minimal human intervention, promising faster response times and operational cost savings. In this work, we perform the first security analysis of AIOps solutions, showing that, once again, AI-driven automation comes with a profound security cost. We demonstrate that adversaries can manipulate system telemetry to mislead AIOps agents into taking actions that compromise the integrity of the infrastructure they manage. We introduce techniques to reliably inject telemetry data using error-inducing requests that influence agent behavior through a form of adversarial reward-hacking; plausible but incorrect system error interpretations that steer the agent's decision-making. Our attack methodology, AIOpsDoom, is fully automated--combining reconnaissance, fuzzing, and LLM-driven adversarial input generation--and operates without any prior knowledge of the target system. To counter this threat, we propose AIOpsShield, a defense mechanism that sanitizes telemetry data by exploiting its structured nature and the minimal role of user-generated content. Our experiments show that AIOpsShield reliably blocks telemetry-based attacks without affecting normal agent performance. Ultimately, this work exposes AIOps as an emerging attack vector for system compromise and underscores the urgent need for security-aware AIOps design.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>High-resolution imagery plays a critical role in improving the performance of visual recognition tasks such as classification, detection, and segmentation. In many domains, including remote sensing and surveillance, low-resolution images can limit the accuracy of automated analysis. To address this, super-resolution (SR) techniques have been widely adopted to attempt to reconstruct high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs. Related traditional approaches focus solely on enhancing image quality based on pixel-level metrics, leaving the relationship between super-resolved image fidelity and downstream classification performance largely underexplored. This raises a key question: can integrating classification objectives directly into the super-resolution process further improve classification accuracy? In this paper, we try to respond to this question by investigating the relationship between super-resolution and classification through the deployment of a specialised algorithmic strategy. We propose a novel methodology that increases the resolution of synthetic aperture radar imagery by optimising loss functions that account for both image quality and classification performance. Our approach improves image quality, as measured by scientifically ascertained image quality indicators, while also enhancing classification accuracy.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advancements in post-training Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly through Reinforcement Learning (RL) and preference optimization methods, are key drivers for enhancing their reasoning capabilities. However, these methods are often plagued by low sample efficiency and a susceptibility to primacy bias, where overfitting to initial experiences degrades policy quality and damages the learning process. To address these challenges, we introduce LLM optimization with Reset Replay (LoRR), a general and powerful plugin designed to enhance sample efficiency in any preference-based optimization framework. LoRR core mechanism enables training at a high replay number, maximizing the utility of each collected data batch. To counteract the risk of overfitting inherent in high-replay training, LoRR incorporates a periodic reset strategy with reusing initial data, which preserves network plasticity. Furthermore, it leverages a hybrid optimization objective, combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference-based losses to further bolster data exploitation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that LoRR significantly boosts the performance of various preference optimization methods on both mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks. Notably, an iterative DPO approach augmented with LoRR achieves comparable performance on challenging math tasks, outperforming some complex and computationally intensive RL-based algorithms. These findings highlight that LoRR offers a practical, sample-efficient, and highly effective paradigm for LLM finetuning, unlocking greater performance from limited data.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, security, privacy, defense, robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enhances large language models (LLMs) by integrating external tools, enabling dynamic aggregation of real-time data to improve task execution. However, its non-isolated execution context introduces critical security and privacy risks. In particular, adversarially crafted content can induce tool poisoning or indirect prompt injection, leading to conversation hijacking, misinformation propagation, or data exfiltration. Existing defenses, such as rule-based filters or LLM-driven detection, remain inadequate due to their reliance on static signatures, computational inefficiency, and inability to quantify conversational hijacking. To address these limitations, we propose SecMCP, a secure framework that detects and quantifies conversation drift, deviations in latent space trajectories induced by adversarial external knowledge. By modeling LLM activation vectors within a latent polytope space, SecMCP identifies anomalous shifts in conversational dynamics, enabling proactive detection of hijacking, misleading, and data exfiltration. We evaluate SecMCP on three state-of-the-art LLMs (Llama3, Vicuna, Mistral) across benchmark datasets (MS MARCO, HotpotQA, FinQA), demonstrating robust detection with AUROC scores exceeding 0.915 while maintaining system usability. Our contributions include a systematic categorization of MCP security threats, a novel latent polytope-based methodology for quantifying conversation drift, and empirical validation of SecMCP's efficacy.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep learning has revolutionized medical imaging, but its effectiveness is severely limited by insufficient labeled training data. This paper introduces a novel GAN-based semi-supervised learning framework specifically designed for low labeled-data regimes, evaluated across settings with 5 to 50 labeled samples per class. Our approach integrates three specialized neural networks -- a generator for class-conditioned image translation, a discriminator for authenticity assessment and classification, and a dedicated classifier -- within a three-phase training framework. The method alternates between supervised training on limited labeled data and unsupervised learning that leverages abundant unlabeled images through image-to-image translation rather than generation from noise. We employ ensemble-based pseudo-labeling that combines confidence-weighted predictions from the discriminator and classifier with temporal consistency through exponential moving averaging, enabling reliable label estimation for unlabeled data. Comprehensive evaluation across eleven MedMNIST datasets demonstrates that our approach achieves statistically significant improvements over six state-of-the-art GAN-based semi-supervised methods, with particularly strong performance in the extreme 5-shot setting where the scarcity of labeled data is most challenging. The framework maintains its superiority across all evaluated settings (5, 10, 20, and 50 shots per class). Our approach offers a practical solution for medical imaging applications where annotation costs are prohibitive, enabling robust classification performance even with minimal labeled data.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) based agents excel at diverse tasks, yet they suffer from brittle procedural memory that is manually engineered or entangled in static parameters. In this work, we investigate strategies to endow agents with a learnable, updatable, and lifelong procedural memory. We propose Memp that distills past agent trajectories into both fine-grained, step-by-step instructions and higher-level, script-like abstractions, and explore the impact of different strategies for Build, Retrieval, and Update of procedural memory. Coupled with a dynamic regimen that continuously updates, corrects, and deprecates its contents, this repository evolves in lockstep with new experience. Empirical evaluation on TravelPlanner and ALFWorld shows that as the memory repository is refined, agents achieve steadily higher success rates and greater efficiency on analogous tasks. Moreover, procedural memory built from a stronger model retains its value: migrating the procedural memory to a weaker model yields substantial performance gains.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large-scale natural image-text datasets, especially those automatically collected from the web, often suffer from loose semantic alignment due to weak supervision, while medical datasets tend to have high cross-modal correlation but low content diversity. These properties pose a common challenge for contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP): they hinder the model's ability to learn robust and generalizable representations. In this work, we propose CLIPin, a unified non-contrastive plug-in that can be seamlessly integrated into CLIP-style architectures to improve multimodal semantic alignment, providing stronger supervision and enhancing alignment robustness. Furthermore, two shared pre-projectors are designed for image and text modalities respectively to facilitate the integration of contrastive and non-contrastive learning in a parameter-compromise manner. Extensive experiments on diverse downstream tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of CLIPin as a plug-and-play component compatible with various contrastive frameworks.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) are transforming social-science research by enabling scalable, precise analysis. Their adaptability raises the question of whether knowledge acquired through fine-tuning in a few languages can transfer to unseen languages that only appeared during pre-training. To examine this, we fine-tune lightweight LLaMA 3.2-3B models on monolingual, bilingual, or multilingual data sets to classify immigration-related tweets from X/Twitter across 13 languages, a domain characterised by polarised, culturally specific discourse. We evaluate whether minimal language-specific fine-tuning enables cross-lingual topic detection and whether adding targeted languages corrects pre-training biases. Results show that LLMs fine-tuned in one or two languages can reliably classify immigration-related content in unseen languages. However, identifying whether a tweet expresses a pro- or anti-immigration stance benefits from multilingual fine-tuning. Pre-training bias favours dominant languages, but even minimal exposure to under-represented languages during fine-tuning (as little as $9.62\times10^{-11}$ of the original pre-training token volume) yields significant gains. These findings challenge the assumption that cross-lingual mastery requires extensive multilingual training: limited language coverage suffices for topic-level generalisation, and structural biases can be corrected with lightweight interventions. By releasing 4-bit-quantised, LoRA fine-tuned models, we provide an open-source, reproducible alternative to proprietary LLMs that delivers 35 times faster inference at just 0.00000989% of the dollar cost of the OpenAI GPT-4o model, enabling scalable, inclusive research.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid rise of Generative AI (GenAI), particularly LLMs, poses concerns for journalistic integrity and authorship. This study examines AI-generated content across over 40,000 news articles from major, local, and college news media, in various media formats. Using three advanced AI-text detectors (e.g., Binoculars, Fast-Detect GPT, and GPTZero), we find substantial increase of GenAI use in recent years, especially in local and college news. Sentence-level analysis reveals LLMs are often used in the introduction of news, while conclusions usually written manually. Linguistic analysis shows GenAI boosts word richness and readability but lowers formality, leading to more uniform writing styles, particularly in local media.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Long-context inference for Large Language Models (LLMs) is heavily limited by high computational demands. While several existing methods optimize attention computation, they still process the full set of hidden states at each layer, limiting overall efficiency. In this work, we propose SlimInfer, an innovative framework that aims to accelerate inference by directly pruning less critical prompt tokens during the forward pass. Our key insight is an information diffusion phenomenon: As information from critical tokens propagates through layers, it becomes distributed across the entire sequence. This diffusion process suggests that LLMs can maintain their semantic integrity when excessive tokens, even including these critical ones, are pruned in hidden states. Motivated by this, SlimInfer introduces a dynamic fine-grained pruning mechanism that accurately removes redundant tokens of hidden state at intermediate layers. This layer-wise pruning naturally enables an asynchronous KV cache manager that prefetches required token blocks without complex predictors, reducing both memory usage and I/O costs. Extensive experiments show that SlimInfer can achieve up to $\mathbf{2.53\times}$ time-to-first-token (TTFT) speedup and $\mathbf{1.88\times}$ end-to-end latency reduction for LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct on a single RTX 4090, without sacrificing performance on LongBench.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods have shown great success in addressing classical domain shifts (e.g., synthetic-to-real), but they still suffer under complex shifts (e.g. geographical shift), where both the background and object appearances differ significantly across domains. Prior works showed that the language modality can help in the adaptation process, exhibiting more robustness to such complex shifts. In this paper, we introduce TRUST, a novel UDA approach that exploits the robustness of the language modality to guide the adaptation of a vision model. TRUST generates pseudo-labels for target samples from their captions and introduces a novel uncertainty estimation strategy that uses normalised CLIP similarity scores to estimate the uncertainty of the generated pseudo-labels. Such estimated uncertainty is then used to reweight the classification loss, mitigating the adverse effects of wrong pseudo-labels obtained from low-quality captions. To further increase the robustness of the vision model, we propose a multimodal soft-contrastive learning loss that aligns the vision and language feature spaces, by leveraging captions to guide the contrastive training of the vision model on target images. In our contrastive loss, each pair of images acts as both a positive and a negative pair and their feature representations are attracted and repulsed with a strength proportional to the similarity of their captions. This solution avoids the need for hardly determining positive and negative pairs, which is critical in the UDA setting. Our approach outperforms previous methods, setting the new state-of-the-art on classical (DomainNet) and complex (GeoNet) domain shifts. The code will be available upon acceptance.</li>

In this study, we investigate the feasibility of integrating text into the Swin-UMamba architecture for the task of lesion segmentation. The publicly available ULS23 DeepLesion dataset was used along with short-form descriptions of the findings from the reports. On the test dataset, a high Dice Score of 82% and low Hausdorff distance of 6.58 (pixels) was obtained for lesion segmentation. The proposed Text-Swin-UMamba model outperformed prior approaches: 37% improvement over the LLM-driven LanGuideMedSeg model (p < 0.001),and surpassed the purely image-based xLSTM-UNet and nnUNet models by 1.74% and 0.22%, respectively.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive fluency and reasoning capabilities, but their potential for misuse has raised growing concern. In this paper, we present ScamAgent, an autonomous multi-turn agent built on top of LLMs, capable of generating highly realistic scam call scripts that simulate real-world fraud scenarios. Unlike prior work focused on single-shot prompt misuse, ScamAgent maintains dialogue memory, adapts dynamically to simulated user responses, and employs deceptive persuasion strategies across conversational turns. We show that current LLM safety guardrails, including refusal mechanisms and content filters, are ineffective against such agent-based threats. Even models with strong prompt-level safeguards can be bypassed when prompts are decomposed, disguised, or delivered incrementally within an agent framework. We further demonstrate the transformation of scam scripts into lifelike voice calls using modern text-to-speech systems, completing a fully automated scam pipeline. Our findings highlight an urgent need for multi-turn safety auditing, agent-level control frameworks, and new methods to detect and disrupt conversational deception powered by generative AI.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The growing legal and ethical scrutiny of large language models (LLMs) necessitates effective machine unlearning, particularly for sensitive or unauthorized data. Existing empirical methods often yield incomplete forgetting or unintended degradation of unrelated knowledge due to poor localization. In this work, we propose GRIN: a modular and targeted framework for LLM unlearning. GRIN introduces a novel gradient-ratio-based metric to identify parameters most responsible for memorizing forget data. We then perform selective noise injection into these parameters prior to fine-tuning, which improves unlearning performance while maintaining model utility. Finally, we propose new evaluation metrics tailored to the LLM setting and validate our approach on standard benchmarks such as TOFU, WMDP, and SafePKU.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Haptic captioning is the task of generating natural language descriptions from haptic signals, such as vibrations, for use in virtual reality, accessibility, and rehabilitation applications. While previous multimodal research has focused primarily on vision and audio, haptic signals for the sense of touch remain underexplored. To address this gap, we formalize the haptic captioning task and propose HapticLLaMA, a multimodal sensory language model that interprets vibration signals into descriptions in a given sensory, emotional, or associative category. We investigate two types of haptic tokenizers, a frequency-based tokenizer and an EnCodec-based tokenizer, that convert haptic signals into sequences of discrete units, enabling their integration with the LLaMA model. HapticLLaMA is trained in two stages: (1) supervised fine-tuning using the LLaMA architecture with LoRA-based adaptation, and (2) fine-tuning via reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). We assess HapticLLaMA's captioning performance using both automated n-gram metrics and human evaluation. HapticLLaMA demonstrates strong capability in interpreting haptic vibration signals, achieving a METEOR score of 59.98 and a BLEU-4 score of 32.06 respectively. Additionally, over 61% of the generated captions received human ratings above 3.5 on a 7-point scale, with RLHF yielding a 10% improvement in the overall rating distribution, indicating stronger alignment with human haptic perception. These findings highlight the potential of large language models to process and adapt to sensory data.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, extraction, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Urbanization, climate change, and agricultural stress are increasing the demand for precise and timely environmental monitoring. Land Surface Temperature (LST) is a key variable in this context and is retrieved from remote sensing satellites. However, these systems face a trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution. While spatio-temporal fusion methods offer promising solutions, few have addressed the estimation of daily LST at 10 m resolution. In this study, we present WGAST, a Weakly-Supervised Generative Network for Daily 10 m LST Estimation via Spatio-Temporal Fusion of Terra MODIS, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2. WGAST is the first end-to-end deep learning framework designed for this task. It adopts a conditional generative adversarial architecture, with a generator composed of four stages: feature extraction, fusion, LST reconstruction, and noise suppression. The first stage employs a set of encoders to extract multi-level latent representations from the inputs, which are then fused in the second stage using cosine similarity, normalization, and temporal attention mechanisms. The third stage decodes the fused features into high-resolution LST, followed by a Gaussian filter to suppress high-frequency noise. Training follows a weakly supervised strategy based on physical averaging principles and reinforced by a PatchGAN discriminator. Experiments demonstrate that WGAST outperforms existing methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Compared to the best-performing baseline, on average, WGAST reduces RMSE by 17.18% and improves SSIM by 11.00%. Furthermore, WGAST is robust to cloud-induced LST and effectively captures fine-scale thermal patterns, as validated against 33 ground-based sensors. The code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Parallel Proof-of-Work (PoW) protocols are suggested to improve the safety guarantees, transaction throughput and confirmation latencies of Nakamoto consensus. In this work, we first consider the existing parallel PoW protocols and develop hard-coded incentive attack structures. Our theoretical results and simulations show that the existing parallel PoW protocols are more vulnerable to incentive attacks than the Nakamoto consensus, e.g., attacks have smaller profitability threshold and they result in higher relative rewards. Next, we introduce a voting-based semi-parallel PoW protocol that outperforms both Nakamoto consensus and the existing parallel PoW protocols from most practical perspectives such as communication overheads, throughput, transaction conflicts, incentive compatibility of the protocol as well as a fair distribution of transaction fees among the voters and the leaders. We use state-of-the-art analysis to evaluate the consistency of the protocol and consider Markov decision process (MDP) models to substantiate our claims about the resilience of our protocol against incentive attacks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Being able to effectively read scientific plots, or chart understanding, is a central part toward building effective agents for science. However, existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs), especially open-source ones, are still falling behind with a typical success rate of 30%-50% on challenging benchmarks. Previous studies on fine-tuning MLLMs with synthetic charts are often restricted by their inadequate similarity to the real charts, which could compromise model training and performance on complex real-world charts. In this study, we show that modularizing chart generation and diversifying visual details improves chart understanding capabilities. In particular, we design a five-step data synthesis pipeline, where we separate data and function creation for single plot generation, condition the generation of later subplots on earlier ones for multi-subplot figures, visually diversify the generated figures, filter out low quality data, and finally generate the question-answer (QA) pairs with GPT-4o. This approach allows us to streamline the generation of fine-tuning datasets and introduce the effective chart dataset (ECD), which contains 10k+ chart images and 300k+ QA pairs, covering 25 topics and featuring 250+ chart type combinations with high visual complexity. We show that ECD consistently improves the performance of various MLLMs on a range of real-world and synthetic test sets. Code, data and models are available at: this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent approaches for 3D relighting have shown promise in integrating 2D image relighting generative priors to alter the appearance of a 3D representation while preserving the underlying structure. Nevertheless, generative priors used for 2D relighting that directly relight from an input image do not take advantage of intrinsic properties of the subject that can be inferred or cannot consider multi-view data at scale, leading to subpar relighting. In this paper, we propose Lightswitch, a novel finetuned material-relighting diffusion framework that efficiently relights an arbitrary number of input images to a target lighting condition while incorporating cues from inferred intrinsic properties. By using multi-view and material information cues together with a scalable denoising scheme, our method consistently and efficiently relights dense multi-view data of objects with diverse material compositions. We show that our 2D relighting prediction quality exceeds previous state-of-the-art relighting priors that directly relight from images. We further demonstrate that LightSwitch matches or outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion inverse rendering methods in relighting synthetic and real objects in as little as 2 minutes.</li>
