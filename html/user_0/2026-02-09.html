<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Satellite-terrestrial networks (STNs) have emerged as a promising architecture for providing seamless wireless coverage and connectivity for multiple users. However, potential malicious eavesdroppers pose a serious threat to the private information via STNs due to their non-cooperative behavior and ability to launch intelligent attacks. To address this challenge, we propose a cognitive secure communication framework driven by multiple agents that coordinates spectrum scheduling and protection through real-time sensing, thereby disrupting the judgment of eavesdroppers while preserving reliable data transmission. On this basis, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the secrecy probability of legitimate users, subject to a reliable transmission probability threshold. To tackle this problem, we propose a two-layer coordinated defense system. First, we develop a foundation layer based on multi-agent coordination schedule to determine the satellite operation matrix and the frequency slot occupation matrices, aiming to mitigate spectrum congestion and enhance transmission reliability. Then, we exploit generative adversarial networks to produce adversarial matrices, and employ learning-aided power control to set real and adversarial signal powers for protection layer, which actively degrades the inference capability of eavesdroppers. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms benchmark methods in terms of enhancing security performance and reducing power overhead for STNs in the cognitive secure communication scenario.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Slogans are concise and memorable catchphrases that play a crucial role in advertising by conveying brand identity and shaping public perception. However, advertising fatigue reduces the effectiveness of repeated slogans, creating a growing demand for novel, creative, and insightful slogan generation. While recent work leverages large language models (LLMs) for this task, existing approaches often produce stylistically redundant outputs that lack a clear brand persona and appear overtly machine-generated. We argue that effective slogans should balance novelty with familiarity and propose a new paradigm that recontextualizes persona-related famous quotes for slogan generation. Well-known quotes naturally align with slogan-length text, employ rich rhetorical devices, and offer depth and insight, making them a powerful resource for creative generation. Technically, we introduce a modular framework that decomposes slogan generation into interpretable subtasks, including quote matching, structural decomposition, vocabulary replacement, and remix generation. Extensive automatic and human evaluations demonstrate marginal improvements in diversity, novelty, emotional impact, and human preference over three state-of-the-art LLM baselines.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Despite the remarkable capabilities of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs), they still lack detailed knowledge about specific entities. Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) is a widely adopted solution that enhances LVLMs by providing additional contexts from an external Knowledge Base. However, we observe that previous decoding methods for RAG are sub-optimal as they fail to sufficiently leverage multiple relevant contexts and suppress the negative effects of irrelevant contexts. To this end, we propose Relevance-aware Multi-context Contrastive Decoding (RMCD), a novel decoding method for RAG. RMCD outputs a final prediction by combining outputs predicted with each context, where each output is weighted based on its relevance to the question. By doing so, RMCD effectively aggregates useful information from multiple relevant contexts while also counteracting the negative effects of irrelevant ones. Experiments show that RMCD consistently outperforms other decoding methods across multiple LVLMs, achieving the best performance on three knowledge-intensive visual question-answering benchmarks. Also, RMCD can be simply applied by replacing the decoding method of LVLMs without additional training. Analyses also show that RMCD is robust to the retrieval results, consistently performing the best across the weakest to the strongest retrieval results. Code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Episodic memory is a central component of human memory, which refers to the ability to recall coherent events grounded in who, when, and where. However, most agent memory systems only emphasize semantic recall and treat experience as structures such as key-value, vector, or graph, which makes them struggle to represent and retrieve coherent events. To address this challenge, we propose a Character-and-Scene based memory architecture(CAST) inspired by dramatic theory. Specifically, CAST constructs 3D scenes (time/place/topic) and organizes them into character profiles that summarize the events of a character to represent episodic memory. Moreover, CAST complements this episodic memory with a graph-based semantic memory, which yields a robust dual memory design. Experiments demonstrate that CAST has averagely improved 8.11% F1 and 10.21% J(LLM-as-a-Judge) than baselines on various datasets, especially on open and time-sensitive conversational questions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in duplex speech models have enabled natural, low-latency speech-to-speech interactions. However, existing models are restricted to a fixed role and voice, limiting their ability to support structured, role-driven real-world applications and personalized interactions. In this work, we introduce PersonaPlex, a duplex conversational speech model that incorporates hybrid system prompts, combining role conditioning with text prompts and voice cloning with speech samples. PersonaPlex is trained on a large-scale synthetic dataset of paired prompts and user-agent conversations, generated with open-source large language models (LLM) and text-to-speech (TTS) models. To evaluate role conditioning in real-world settings, we extend the Full-Duplex-Bench benchmark beyond a single assistant role to multi-role customer service scenarios. Experiments show that PersonaPlex achieves strong role-conditioned behavior, voice-conditioned speech, and natural conversational responsiveness, surpassing state-of-the-art duplex speech models and hybrid large language model-based speech systems in role adherence, speaker similarity, latency, and naturalness.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Assessing research novelty is a core yet highly subjective aspect of peer review, typically based on implicit judgment and incomplete comparison to prior work. We introduce a literature-aware novelty assessment framework that explicitly learns how humans judge novelty from peer-review reports and grounds these judgments in structured comparison to existing research. Using nearly 80K novelty-annotated reviews from top-tier AI conferences, we fine-tune a large language model to capture reviewer-aligned novelty evaluation behavior. For a given manuscript, the system extracts structured representations of its ideas, methods, and claims, retrieves semantically related papers, and constructs a similarity graph that enables fine-grained, concept-level comparison to prior work. Conditioning on this structured evidence, the model produces calibrated novelty scores and human-like explanatory assessments, reducing overestimation and improving consistency relative to existing approaches.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Current annotation agreement metrics are not well-suited for inter-group analysis, are sensitive to group size imbalances and restricted to single-annotation settings. These restrictions render them insufficient for many subjective tasks such as toxicity and hate-speech detection. For this reason, we introduce a quantifiable metric, paired with a statistical significance test, that attributes polarization to various annotator groups. Our metric enables direct comparisons between heavily imbalanced sociodemographic and ideological subgroups across different datasets and tasks, while also enabling analysis on multi-label settings. We apply this metric to three datasets on hate speech, and one on toxicity detection, discovering that: (1) Polarization is strongly and persistently attributed to annotator race, especially on the hate speech task. (2) Religious annotators do not fundamentally disagree with each other, but do with other annotators, a trend that is gradually diminished and then reversed with irreligious annotators. (3) Less educated annotators are more subjective, while educated ones tend to broadly agree more between themselves. Overall, our results reflect current findings around annotation patterns for various subgroups. Finally, we estimate the minimum number of annotators needed to obtain robust results, and provide an open-source Python library that implements our metric.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Wind power ramp events are difficult to forecast due to strong variability, multi-scale dynamics, and site-specific meteorological effects. This paper proposes an event-first, frequency-aware forecasting paradigm that directly predicts ramp events and reconstructs the power trajectory thereafter, rather than inferring events from dense forecasts. The framework is built on an enhanced Ramping Behaviour Analysis (RBA$_\theta$) method's event representation and progressively integrates statistical, machine-learning, and deep-learning models. Traditional forecasting models with post-hoc event extraction provides a strong interpretable baseline but exhibits limited generalisation across sites. Direct event prediction using Random Forests improves robustness over survival-based formulations, motivating fully event-aware modelling. To capture the multi-scale nature of wind ramps, we introduce an event-first deep architecture that integrates wavelet-based frequency decomposition, temporal excitation features, and adaptive feature selection. The resulting sequence models enable stable long-horizon event prediction, physically consistent trajectory reconstruction, and zero-shot transfer to previously unseen wind farms. Empirical analysis shows that ramp magnitude and duration are governed by distinct mid-frequency bands, allowing accurate signal reconstruction from sparse event forecasts. An agentic forecasting layer is proposed, in which specialised workflows are selected dynamically based on operational context. Together, the framework demonstrates that event-first, frequency-aware forecasting provides a transferable and operationally aligned alternative to trajectory-first wind-power prediction.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Modern large language models (LLMs) are powerful generators driven by statistical next-token prediction. While effective at producing fluent text, this design biases models toward high-probability continuations rather than exhaustive and faithful answers grounded in source content. As a result, directly applying LLMs lacks systematic mechanisms to ensure both completeness (avoiding omissions) and faithfulness (avoiding unsupported content), which fundamentally conflicts with core AI safety principles. To address this limitation, we present EVE, a structured framework for document-grounded reasoning. Unlike free-form prompting, EVE constrains generation to a structured, verifiable pipeline that decomposes high-rigor reasoning into extraction, validation, and enumeration. Empirically, this design enables consistent and simultaneous improvements in recall, precision, and F1-score: recall and precision increase by up to 24\% and 29\%, respectively, with a corresponding 31\% gain in F1-score. This effectively breaks the long-standing trade-off between coverage and accuracy typical of single-pass LLM generation, while also mitigating generation truncation caused by length limitations. At the same time, we emphasize that EVE exhibits performance saturation due to the inherent ambiguity of natural language, reflecting fundamental limits of language-based reasoning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, defense, attack, interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Machine learning in clinical settings must balance predictive accuracy, interpretability, and privacy. Models such as logistic regression (LR) offer transparency, while neural networks (NNs) provide greater predictive power; yet both remain vulnerable to privacy attacks. We empirically assess these risks by designing attacks that identify which public datasets were used to train a model under varying levels of adversarial access, applying them to LORIS, a publicly available LR model for immunotherapy response prediction, as well as to additional shallow NN models trained for the same task. Our results show that both models leak significant training-set information, with LRs proving particularly vulnerable in white-box scenarios. Moreover, we observe that common practices such as cross-validation in LRs exacerbate these risks. To mitigate these vulnerabilities, we propose a quantum-inspired defense based on tensorizing discretized models into tensor trains (TTs), which fully obfuscates parameters while preserving accuracy, reducing white-box attacks to random guessing and degrading black-box attacks comparably to Differential Privacy. TT models retain LR interpretability and extend it through efficient computation of marginal and conditional distributions, while also enabling this higher level of interpretability for NNs. Our results demonstrate that tensorization is widely applicable and establishes a practical foundation for private, interpretable, and effective clinical prediction.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Creating high-fidelity, animatable 3D talking heads is crucial for immersive applications, yet often hindered by the prevalence of low-quality image or video sources, which yield poor 3D reconstructions. In this paper, we introduce SuperHead, a novel framework for enhancing low-resolution, animatable 3D head avatars. The core challenge lies in synthesizing high-quality geometry and textures, while ensuring both 3D and temporal consistency during animation and preserving subject identity. Despite recent progress in image, video and 3D-based super-resolution (SR), existing SR techniques are ill-equipped to handle dynamic 3D inputs. To address this, SuperHead leverages the rich priors from pre-trained 3D generative models via a novel dynamics-aware 3D inversion scheme. This process optimizes the latent representation of the generative model to produce a super-resolved 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) head model, which is subsequently rigged to an underlying parametric head model (e.g., FLAME) for animation. The inversion is jointly supervised using a sparse collection of upscaled 2D face renderings and corresponding depth maps, captured from diverse facial expressions and camera viewpoints, to ensure realism under dynamic facial motions. Experiments demonstrate that SuperHead generates avatars with fine-grained facial details under dynamic motions, significantly outperforming baseline methods in visual quality.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The high computational demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) motivate methods that reduce parameter count and accelerate inference. In response, model pruning emerges as an effective strategy, yet current methods typically focus on a single dimension-depth or width. We introduce MoP (Mixture of Pruners), an iterative framework that unifies these dimensions. At each iteration, MoP generates two branches-pruning in depth versus pruning in width-and selects a candidate to advance the path. On LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3, MoP advances the frontier of structured pruning, exceeding the accuracy of competing methods across a broad set of compression regimes. It also consistently outperforms depth-only and width-only pruning. Furthermore, MoP translates structural pruning into real speedup, reducing end-to-end latency by 39% at 40% compression. Finally, extending MoP to the vision-language model LLaVA-1.5, we notably improve computational efficiency and demonstrate that text-only recovery fine-tuning can restore performance even on visual tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Climate hazards increasingly disrupt urban transportation and emergency-response operations by damaging housing stock, degrading infrastructure, and reducing network accessibility. This paper presents Skjold-DiT, a diffusion-transformer framework that integrates heterogeneous spatio-temporal urban data to forecast building-level climate-risk indicators while explicitly incorporating transportation-network structure and accessibility signals relevant to intelligent vehicles (e.g., emergency reachability and evacuation-route constraints). Concretely, Skjold-DiT enables hazard-conditioned routing constraints by producing calibrated, uncertainty-aware accessibility layers (reachability, travel-time inflation, and route redundancy) that can be consumed by intelligent-vehicle routing and emergency dispatch systems. Skjold-DiT combines: (1) Fjell-Prompt, a prompt-based conditioning interface designed to support cross-city transfer; (2) Norrland-Fusion, a cross-modal attention mechanism unifying hazard maps/imagery, building attributes, demographics, and transportation infrastructure into a shared latent representation; and (3) Valkyrie-Forecast, a counterfactual simulator for generating probabilistic risk trajectories under intervention prompts. We introduce the Baltic-Caspian Urban Resilience (BCUR) dataset with 847,392 building-level observations across six cities, including multi-hazard annotations (e.g., flood and heat indicators) and transportation accessibility features. Experiments evaluate prediction quality, cross-city generalization, calibration, and downstream transportation-relevant outcomes, including reachability and hazard-conditioned travel times under counterfactual interventions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative policies based on diffusion models and flow matching have shown strong promise for offline reinforcement learning (RL), but their applicability remains largely confined to continuous action spaces. To address a broader range of offline RL settings, we extend flow matching to a general framework that supports discrete action spaces with multiple objectives. Specifically, we replace continuous flows with continuous-time Markov chains, trained using a Q-weighted flow matching objective. We then extend our design to multi-agent settings, mitigating the exponential growth of joint action spaces via a factorized conditional path. We theoretically show that, under idealized conditions, optimizing this objective recovers the optimal policy. Extensive experiments further demonstrate that our method performs robustly in practical scenarios, including high-dimensional control, multi-modal decision-making, and dynamically changing preferences over multiple objectives. Our discrete framework can also be applied to continuous-control problems through action quantization, providing a flexible trade-off between representational complexity and performance.</li>

However, due to the challenge of obtaining text labels with coherent joint-modality information, whether MLLMs can jointly understand both modalities in egocentric videos remains under-explored. To address this problem, we introduce EgoAVU, a scalable data engine to automatically generate egocentric audio-visual narrations, questions, and answers. EgoAVU enriches human narrations with multimodal context and generates audio-visual narrations through cross-modal correlation modeling. Token-based video filtering and modular, graph-based curation ensure both data diversity and quality. Leveraging EgoAVU, we construct EgoAVU-Instruct, a large-scale training dataset of 3M samples, and EgoAVU-Bench, a manually verified evaluation split covering diverse tasks. EgoAVU-Bench clearly reveals the limitations of existing MLLMs: they bias heavily toward visual signals, often neglecting audio cues or failing to correspond audio with the visual source. Finetuning MLLMs on EgoAVU-Instruct effectively addresses this issue, enabling up to 113% performance improvement on EgoAVU-Bench. Such benefits also transfer to other benchmarks such as EgoTempo and EgoIllusion, achieving up to 28% relative performance gain. Code will be released to the community.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models scale large language models efficiently by sparsely activating experts, but once an expert is selected, it is executed fully. Hence, the trade-off between accuracy and computation in an MoE model typically exhibits large discontinuities. We propose Mixture of Slimmable Experts (MoSE), an MoE architecture in which each expert has a nested, slimmable structure that can be executed at variable widths. This enables conditional computation not only over which experts are activated, but also over how much of each expert is utilized. Consequently, a single pretrained MoSE model can support a more continuous spectrum of accuracy-compute trade-offs at inference time. We present a simple and stable training recipe for slimmable experts under sparse routing, combining multi-width training with standard MoE objectives. During inference, we explore strategies for runtime width determination, including a lightweight test-time training mechanism that learns how to map router confidence/probabilities to expert widths under a fixed budget. Experiments on GPT models trained on OpenWebText demonstrate that MoSE matches or improves upon standard MoE at full width and consistently shifts the Pareto frontier for accuracy vs. cost, achieving comparable performance with significantly fewer FLOPs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models rely on a high-dimensional latent space of initial noise seeds, yet it remains unclear whether this space contains sufficient structure to predict properties of the generated samples, such as their classes. In this work, we investigate the emergence of latent structure through the lens of confidence scores assigned by a pre-trained classifier to generated samples. We show that while the latent space appears largely unstructured when considering all noise realizations, restricting attention to initial noise seeds that produce high-confidence samples reveals pronounced class separability. By comparing class predictability across noise subsets of varying confidence and examining the class separability of the latent space, we find evidence of class-relevant latent structure that becomes observable only under confidence-based filtering. As a practical implication, we discuss how confidence-based filtering enables conditional generation as an alternative to guidance-based methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Single-view 3D reconstruction in complex real-world scenes is challenging due to noise, object diversity, and limited dataset availability. To address these challenges, we propose MGP-KAD, a novel multimodal feature fusion framework that integrates RGB and geometric prior to enhance reconstruction accuracy. The geometric prior is generated by sampling and clustering ground-truth object data, producing class-level features that dynamically adjust during training to improve geometric understanding. Additionally, we introduce a hybrid decoder based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) to overcome the limitations of traditional linear decoders in processing complex multimodal inputs. Extensive experiments on the Pix3D dataset demonstrate that MGP-KAD achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, significantly improving geometric integrity, smoothness, and detail preservation. Our work provides a robust and effective solution for advancing single-view 3D reconstruction in complex scenes.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Driven by the emergence of Controllable Video Diffusion, existing Sim2Real methods for autonomous driving video generation typically rely on explicit intermediate representations to bridge the domain gap. However, these modalities face a fundamental Consistency-Realism Dilemma. Low-level signals (e.g., edges, blurred images) ensure precise control but compromise realism by "baking in" synthetic artifacts, whereas high-level priors (e.g., depth, semantics, HDMaps) facilitate photorealism but lack the structural detail required for consistent guidance. In this work, we present Driving with DINO (DwD), a novel framework that leverages Vision Foundation Module (VFM) features as a unified bridge between the simulation and real-world domains. We first identify that these features encode a spectrum of information, from high-level semantics to fine-grained structure. To effectively utilize this, we employ Principal Subspace Projection to discard the high-frequency elements responsible for "texture baking," while concurrently introducing Random Channel Tail Drop to mitigate the structural loss inherent in rigid dimensionality reduction, thereby reconciling realism with control consistency. Furthermore, to fully leverage DINOv3's high-resolution capabilities for enhancing control precision, we introduce a learnable Spatial Alignment Module that adapts these high-resolution features to the diffusion backbone. Finally, we propose a Causal Temporal Aggregator employing causal convolutions to explicitly preserve historical motion context when integrating frame-wise DINO features, which effectively mitigates motion blur and guarantees temporal stability.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Parallel diffusion decoding can accelerate diffusion language model inference by unmasking multiple tokens per step, but aggressive parallelism often harms quality. Revocable decoding mitigates this by rechecking earlier tokens, yet we observe that existing verification schemes frequently trigger flip-flop oscillations, where tokens are remasked and later restored unchanged. This behaviour slows inference in two ways: remasking verified positions weakens the conditioning context for parallel drafting, and repeated remask cycles consume the revision budget with little net progress. We propose COVER (Cache Override Verification for Efficient Revision), which performs leave-one-out verification and stable drafting within a single forward pass. COVER constructs two attention views via KV cache override: selected seeds are masked for verification, while their cached key value states are injected for all other queries to preserve contextual information, with a closed form diagonal correction preventing self leakage at the seed positions. COVER further prioritises seeds using a stability aware score that balances uncertainty, downstream influence, and cache drift, and it adapts the number of verified seeds per step. Across benchmarks, COVER markedly reduces unnecessary revisions and yields faster decoding while preserving output quality.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative models have achieved impressive fidelity in text-to-image synthesis, yet struggle with complex compositional prompts involving multiple constraints. We introduce \textbf{M3 (Multi-Modal, Multi-Agent, Multi-Round)}, a training-free framework that systematically resolves these failures through iterative inference-time refinement. M3 orchestrates off-the-shelf foundation models in a robust multi-agent loop: a Planner decomposes prompts into verifiable checklists, while specialized Checker, Refiner, and Editor agents surgically correct constraints one at a time, with a Verifier ensuring monotonic improvement. Applied to open-source models, M3 achieves remarkable results on the challenging OneIG-EN benchmark, with our Qwen-Image+M3 surpassing commercial flagship systems including Imagen4 (0.515) and Seedream 3.0 (0.530), reaching state-of-the-art performance (0.532 overall). This demonstrates that intelligent multi-agent reasoning can elevate open-source models beyond proprietary alternatives. M3 also substantially improves GenEval compositional metrics, effectively doubling spatial reasoning performance on hardened test sets. As a plug-and-play module compatible with any pre-trained T2I model, M3 establishes a new paradigm for compositional generation without costly retraining.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Biological AI tools for protein design and structure prediction are advancing rapidly, creating dual-use risks that existing safeguards cannot adequately address. Current model-level restrictions, including keyword filtering, output screening, and content-based access denials, are fundamentally ill-suited to biology, where reliable function prediction remains beyond reach and novel threats evade detection by design. We propose a three-tier Know Your Customer (KYC) framework, inspired by anti-money laundering (AML) practices in the financial sector, that shifts governance from content inspection to user verification and monitoring. Tier I leverages research institutions as trust anchors to vouch for affiliated researchers and assume responsibility for vetting. Tier II applies output screening through sequence homology searches and functional annotation. Tier III monitors behavioral patterns to detect anomalies inconsistent with declared research purposes. This layered approach preserves access for legitimate researchers while raising the cost of misuse through institutional accountability and traceability. The framework can be implemented immediately using existing institutional infrastructure, requiring no new legislation or regulatory mandates.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Pelvic diseases in women of reproductive age represent a major global health burden, with diagnosis frequently delayed due to high anatomical variability, complicating MRI interpretation. Existing AI approaches are largely disease-specific and lack real-time compatibility, limiting generalizability and clinical integration. To address these challenges, we establish a benchmark framework for disease- and parameter-agnostic, real-time-compatible unsupervised anomaly detection in pelvic MRI. The method uses a residual variational autoencoder trained exclusively on healthy sagittal T2-weighted scans acquired across diverse imaging protocols to model normal pelvic anatomy. During inference, reconstruction error heatmaps indicate deviations from learned healthy structure, enabling detection of pathological regions without labeled abnormal data. The model is trained on 294 healthy scans and augmented with diffusion-generated synthetic data to improve robustness. Quantitative evaluation on the publicly available Uterine Myoma MRI Dataset yields an average area-under-the-curve (AUC) value of 0.736, with 0.828 sensitivity and 0.692 specificity. Additional inter-observer clinical evaluation extends analysis to endometrial cancer, endometriosis, and adenomyosis, revealing the influence of anatomical heterogeneity and inter-observer variability on performance interpretation. With a reconstruction time of approximately 92.6 frames per second, the proposed framework establishes a baseline for unsupervised anomaly detection in the female pelvis and supports future integration into real-time MRI.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Post-training quantization reduces the computational cost of large language models but fundamentally alters their social biases in ways that aggregate metrics fail to capture. We present the first large-scale study of 50 quantized models evaluated on PostTrainingBiasBench, a unified benchmark of 13 closed- and open-ended bias datasets. We identify a phenomenon we term quantization-induced masked bias flipping, in which up to 21% of responses flip between biased and unbiased states after quantization, despite showing no change in aggregate bias scores. These flips are strongly driven by model uncertainty, where the responses with high uncertainty are 3-11x more likely to change than the confident ones. Quantization strength amplifies this effect, with 4-bit quantized models exhibiting 4-6x more behavioral changes than 8-bit quantized models. Critically, these changes create asymmetric impacts across demographic groups, where bias can worsen by up to 18.6% for some groups while improving by 14.1% for others, yielding misleadingly neutral aggregate outcomes. Larger models show no consistent robustness advantage, and group-specific shifts vary unpredictably across model families. Our findings demonstrate that compression fundamentally alters bias patterns, requiring crucial post-quantization evaluation and interventions to ensure reliability in practice.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Trainings of Large Language Models are generally bottlenecked by matrix multiplications. In the Transformer architecture, a large portion of these operations happens in the Feed Forward Network (FFN), and this portion increases for larger models, up to 50% of the total pretraining floating point operations. We show that we can leverage hardware-accelerated sparsity to accelerate all matrix multiplications in the FFN, with 2:4 sparsity for weights and v:n:m (Venom) sparsity for activations. Our recipe relies on sparse training steps to accelerate a large part of the pretraining, associated with regular dense training steps towards the end. Overall, models trained with this approach exhibit the same performance on our quality benchmarks, and can speed up training end-to-end by 1.4 to 1.7x. This approach is applicable to all NVIDIA GPUs starting with the A100 generation, and is orthogonal to common optimization techniques, such as, quantization, and can also be applied to mixture-of-experts model architectures.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, attack, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for collaborative machine learning across decentralized data sources, preserving privacy by keeping data local. However, increasing legal and ethical demands, such as the "right to be forgotten", and the need to mitigate data poisoning attacks have underscored the urgent necessity for principled data unlearning in FL. Unlike centralized settings, the distributed nature of FL complicates the removal of individual data contributions. In this paper, we propose a novel federated unlearning framework formulated as a min-max optimization problem, where the objective is to maximize an $f$-divergence between the model trained with all data and the model retrained without specific data points, while minimizing the degradation on retained data. Our framework could act like a plugin and be added to almost any federated setup, unlike SOTA methods like (\cite{10269017} which requires model degradation in server, or \cite{khalil2025notfederatedunlearningweight} which requires to involve model architecture and model weights). This formulation allows for efficient approximation of data removal effects in a federated setting. We provide empirical evaluations to show that our method achieves significant speedups over naive retraining, with minimal impact on utility.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a predominant alignment method for diffusion models, facilitating off-policy training without explicit reward modeling. However, its reliance on large-scale, high-quality human preference labels presents a severe cost and scalability bottleneck. To overcome this, We propose a semi-supervised framework augmenting limited human data with a large corpus of unlabeled pairs annotated via cost-effective synthetic AI feedback. Our paper introduces Debiased DPO (DeDPO), which uniquely integrates a debiased estimation technique from causal inference into the DPO objective. By explicitly identifying and correcting the systematic bias and noise inherent in synthetic annotators, DeDPO ensures robust learning from imperfect feedback sources, including self-training and Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Experiments demonstrate that DeDPO is robust to the variations in synthetic labeling methods, achieving performance that matches and occasionally exceeds the theoretical upper bound of models trained on fully human-labeled data. This establishes DeDPO as a scalable solution for human-AI alignment using inexpensive synthetic supervision.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present AnyThermal, a thermal backbone that captures robust task-agnostic thermal features suitable for a variety of tasks such as cross-modal place recognition, thermal segmentation, and monocular depth estimation using thermal images. Existing thermal backbones that follow task-specific training from small-scale data result in utility limited to a specific environment and task. Unlike prior methods, AnyThermal can be used for a wide range of environments (indoor, aerial, off-road, urban) and tasks, all without task-specific training. Our key insight is to distill the feature representations from visual foundation models such as DINOv2 into a thermal encoder using thermal data from these multiple environments. To bridge the diversity gap of the existing RGB-Thermal datasets, we introduce the TartanRGBT platform, the first open-source data collection platform with synced RGB-Thermal image acquisition. We use this payload to collect the TartanRGBT dataset - a diverse and balanced dataset collected in 4 environments. We demonstrate the efficacy of AnyThermal and TartanRGBT, achieving state-of-the-art results with improvements of up to 36% across diverse environments and downstream tasks on existing datasets.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The Platonic Representation Hypothesis suggests that independently trained neural networks converge to increasingly similar latent spaces. However, current strategies for mapping these representations are inherently pairwise, scaling quadratically with the number of models and failing to yield a consistent global reference. In this paper, we study the alignment of $M \ge 3$ models. We first adapt Generalized Procrustes Analysis (GPA) to construct a shared orthogonal universe that preserves the internal geometry essential for tasks like model stitching. We then show that strict isometric alignment is suboptimal for retrieval, where agreement-maximizing methods like Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) typically prevail. To bridge this gap, we finally propose Geometry-Corrected Procrustes Alignment (GCPA), which establishes a robust GPA-based universe followed by a post-hoc correction for directional mismatch. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GCPA consistently improves any-to-any retrieval while retaining a practical shared reference space.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Accurate 3D pose estimation of drones is essential for security and surveillance systems. However, existing methods often rely on prior drone information such as physical sizes or 3D meshes. At the same time, current datasets are small-scale, limited to single models, and collected under constrained environments, which makes reliable validation of generalization difficult. We present DroneKey++, a prior-free framework that jointly performs keypoint detection, drone classification, and 3D pose estimation. The framework employs a keypoint encoder for simultaneous keypoint detection and classification, and a pose decoder that estimates 3D pose using ray-based geometric reasoning and class embeddings. To address dataset limitations, we construct 6DroneSyn, a large-scale synthetic benchmark with over 50K images covering 7 drone models and 88 outdoor backgrounds, generated using 360-degree panoramic synthesis. Experiments show that DroneKey++ achieves MAE 17.34 deg and MedAE 17.1 deg for rotation, MAE 0.135 m and MedAE 0.242 m for translation, with inference speeds of 19.25 FPS (CPU) and 414.07 FPS (GPU), demonstrating both strong generalization across drone models and suitability for real-time applications. The dataset is publicly available.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The growth of machine learning demands interpretable models for critical applications, yet most high-performing models are ``black-box'' systems that obscure input-output relationships, while traditional rule-based algorithms like RuleFit suffer from a lack of predictive power and instability despite their simplicity. This motivated our development of Sparse Relaxed Regularized Regression Rule-Fit (SR4-Fit), a novel interpretable classification algorithm that addresses these limitations while maintaining superior classification performance. Using demographic characteristics of U.S. congressional districts from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey, we demonstrate that SR4-Fit can predict House election party outcomes with unprecedented accuracy and interpretability. Our results show that while the majority party remains the strongest predictor, SR4-Fit has revealed intrinsic combinations of demographic factors that affect prediction outcomes that were unable to be interpreted in black-box algorithms such as random forests. The SR4-Fit algorithm surpasses both black-box models and existing interpretable rule-based algorithms such as RuleFit with respect to accuracy, simplicity, and robustness, generating stable and interpretable rule sets while maintaining superior predictive performance, thus addressing the traditional trade-off between model interpretability and predictive capability in electoral forecasting. To further validate SR4-Fit's performance, we also apply it to six additional publicly available classification datasets, like the breast cancer, Ecoli, page blocks, Pima Indians, vehicle, and yeast datasets, and find similar results.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Counterfactual explanations offer an intuitive way to interpret graph neural networks (GNNs) by identifying minimal changes that alter a model's prediction, thereby answering "what must differ for a different outcome?". In this work, we propose a novel framework, ATEX-CF that unifies adversarial attack techniques with counterfactual explanation generation-a connection made feasible by their shared goal of flipping a node's prediction, yet differing in perturbation strategy: adversarial attacks often rely on edge additions, while counterfactual methods typically use deletions. Unlike traditional approaches that treat explanation and attack separately, our method efficiently integrates both edge additions and deletions, grounded in theory, leveraging adversarial insights to explore impactful counterfactuals. In addition, by jointly optimizing fidelity, sparsity, and plausibility under a constrained perturbation budget, our method produces instance-level explanations that are both informative and realistic. Experiments on synthetic and real-world node classification benchmarks demonstrate that ATEX-CF generates faithful, concise, and plausible explanations, highlighting the effectiveness of integrating adversarial insights into counterfactual reasoning for GNNs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>High-fidelity simulations of laser welding capture complex thermo-fluid phenomena, including phase change, free-surface deformation, and keyhole dynamics, however their computational cost limits large-scale process exploration and real-time use. In this work we present the Laser Processing Fourier Neural Operator (LP-FNO), a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) based surrogate model that learns the parametric solution operator of various laser processes from multiphysics simulations generated with FLOW-3D WELD (registered trademark). Through a novel approach of reformulating the transient problem in the moving laser frame and applying temporal averaging, the system results in a quasi-steady state setting suitable for operator learning, even in the keyhole welding regime. The proposed LP-FNO maps process parameters to three-dimensional temperature fields and melt-pool boundaries across a broad process window spanning conduction and keyhole regimes using the non-dimensional normalized enthalpy formulation. The model achieves temperature prediction errors on the order of 1% and intersection-over-union scores for melt-pool segmentation over 0.9. We demonstrate that a LP-FNO model trained on coarse-resolution data can be evaluated on finer grids, yielding accurate super-resolved predictions in mesh-converged conduction regimes, whereas discrepancies in keyhole regimes reflect unresolved dynamics in the coarse-mesh training data. These results indicate that the LP-FNO provides an efficient surrogate modeling framework for laser welding, enabling prediction of full three-dimensional fields and phase interfaces over wide parameter ranges in just tens of milliseconds, up to a hundred thousand times faster than traditional Finite Volume multi-physics software.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>protect, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Machine unlearning for LLMs aims to remove sensitive or copyrighted data from trained models. However, the true efficacy of current unlearning methods remains uncertain. Standard evaluation metrics rely on benign queries that often mistake superficial information suppression for genuine knowledge removal. Such metrics fail to detect residual knowledge that more sophisticated prompting strategies could still extract. We introduce REBEL, an evolutionary approach for adversarial prompt generation designed to probe whether unlearned data can still be recovered. Our experiments demonstrate that REBEL successfully elicits ``forgotten'' knowledge from models that seemed to be forgotten in standard unlearning benchmarks, revealing that current unlearning methods may provide only a superficial layer of protection. We validate our framework on subsets of the TOFU and WMDP benchmarks, evaluating performance across a diverse suite of unlearning algorithms. Our experiments show that REBEL consistently outperforms static baselines, recovering ``forgotten'' knowledge with Attack Success Rates (ASRs) reaching up to 60% on TOFU and 93% on WMDP. We will make all code publicly available upon acceptance. Code is available at this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Model steering, which involves intervening on hidden representations at inference time, has emerged as a lightweight alternative to finetuning for precisely controlling large language models. While steering efficacy has been widely studied, evaluations of whether interventions alter only the intended property remain limited, especially with respect to unintended changes in behaviors related to the target property. We call this notion specificity. We propose a framework that distinguishes three dimensions of specificity: general (preserving fluency and unrelated abilities), control (preserving related control properties), and robustness (preserving control properties under distribution shifts). We study two safety-critical use cases: steering models to reduce overrefusal and faithfulness hallucinations, and show that while steering achieves high efficacy and largely maintains general and control specificity, it consistently fails to preserve robustness specificity. In the case of overrefusal steering, for example, all steering methods reduce overrefusal without harming general abilities and refusal on harmful queries; however, they substantially increase vulnerability to jailbreaks. Our work provides the first systematic evaluation of specificity in model steering, showing that standard efficacy and specificity checks are insufficient, because without robustness evaluation, steering methods may appear reliable even when they compromise model safety.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Safety alignment is only as robust as its weakest failure mode. Despite extensive work on safety post-training, it has been shown that models can be readily unaligned through post-deployment fine-tuning. However, these methods often require extensive data curation and degrade model utility. In this work, we extend the practical limits of unalignment by introducing GRP-Obliteration (GRP-Oblit), a method that uses Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to directly remove safety constraints from target models. We show that a single unlabeled prompt is sufficient to reliably unalign safety-aligned models while largely preserving their utility, and that GRP-Oblit achieves stronger unalignment on average than existing state-of-the-art techniques. Moreover, GRP-Oblit generalizes beyond language models and can also unalign diffusion-based image generation systems. We evaluate GRP-Oblit on six utility benchmarks and five safety benchmarks across fifteen 7-20B parameter models, spanning instruct and reasoning models, as well as dense and MoE architectures. The evaluated model families include GPT-OSS, distilled DeepSeek, Gemma, Llama, Ministral, and Qwen.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Polemic questions need more than one viewpoint to express a balanced answer. Large Language Models (LLMs) can provide a balanced answer, but also take a single aligned viewpoint or refuse to answer. In this paper, we study if such initial responses can be steered to a specific viewpoint in a simple and intuitive way: by only providing one-sided arguments supporting the viewpoint. Our systematic study has three dimensions: (i) which stance is induced in the LLM response, (ii) how the polemic question is formulated, (iii) how the arguments are shown. We construct a small dataset and remarkably find that opinion steering occurs across (i)-(iii) for diverse models, number of arguments, and topics. Switching to other arguments consistently decreases opinion steering.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>defense, attack, robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are increasingly integrated into clinical workflows; however, prompt injection attacks can steer these systems toward clinically unsafe or misleading outputs. We introduce the Medical Prompt Injection Benchmark (MPIB), a dataset-and-benchmark suite for evaluating clinical safety under both direct prompt injection and indirect, RAG-mediated injection across clinically grounded tasks. MPIB emphasizes outcome-level risk via the Clinical Harm Event Rate (CHER), which measures high-severity clinical harm events under a clinically grounded taxonomy, and reports CHER alongside Attack Success Rate (ASR) to disentangle instruction compliance from downstream patient risk. The benchmark comprises 9,697 curated instances constructed through multi-stage quality gates and clinical safety linting. Evaluating MPIB across a diverse set of baseline LLMs and defense configurations, we find that ASR and CHER can diverge substantially, and that robustness depends critically on whether adversarial instructions appear in the user query or in retrieved context. We release MPIB with evaluation code, adversarial baselines, and comprehensive documentation to support reproducible and systematic research on clinical prompt injection. Code and data are available at GitHub (code) and Hugging Face (data).</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose a novel deterministic purification method to improve adversarial robustness by mapping a potentially adversarial sample toward a nearby sample that lies close to a mode of the data distribution, where classifiers are more reliable. We design the method to be deterministic to ensure reliable test accuracy and to prevent the degradation of effective robustness observed in stochastic purification approaches when the adversary has full knowledge of the system and its randomness. We employ a score model trained by minimizing the expected reconstruction error of noise-corrupted data, thereby learning the structural characteristics of the input data distribution. Given a potentially adversarial input, the method searches within its local neighborhood for a purified sample that minimizes the expected reconstruction error under noise corruption and then feeds this purified sample to the classifier. During purification, sharpness-aware minimization is used to guide the purified samples toward flat regions of the expected reconstruction error landscape, thereby enhancing robustness. We further show that, as the noise level decreases, minimizing the expected reconstruction error biases the purified sample toward local maximizers of the Gaussian-smoothed density; under additional local assumptions on the score model, we prove recovery of a local maximizer in the small-noise limit. Experimental results demonstrate significant gains in adversarial robustness over state-of-the-art methods under strong deterministic white-box attacks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Emotion recognition in speech presents a complex multimodal challenge, requiring comprehension of both linguistic content and vocal expressivity, particularly prosodic features such as fundamental frequency, intensity, and temporal dynamics. Although large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in reasoning over textual transcriptions for emotion recognition, they typically neglect fine-grained prosodic information, limiting their effectiveness and interpretability. In this work, we propose VowelPrompt, a linguistically grounded framework that augments LLM-based emotion recognition with interpretable, fine-grained vowel-level prosodic cues. Drawing on phonetic evidence that vowels serve as primary carriers of affective prosody, VowelPrompt extracts pitch-, energy-, and duration-based descriptors from time-aligned vowel segments, and converts these features into natural language descriptions for better interpretability. Such a design enables LLMs to jointly reason over lexical semantics and fine-grained prosodic variation. Moreover, we adopt a two-stage adaptation procedure comprising supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR), implemented via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), to enhance reasoning capability, enforce structured output adherence, and improve generalization across domains and speaker variations. Extensive evaluations across diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that VowelPrompt consistently outperforms state-of-the-art emotion recognition methods under zero-shot, fine-tuned, cross-domain, and cross-linguistic conditions, while enabling the generation of interpretable explanations that are jointly grounded in contextual semantics and fine-grained prosodic structure.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We address the problem of training conversion prediction models in advertising domains under privacy constraints, where direct links between ad clicks and conversions are unavailable. Motivated by privacy-preserving browser APIs and the deprecation of third-party cookies, we study a setting where the learner observes a sequence of clicks and a sequence of conversions, but can only link a conversion to a set of candidate clicks (an attribution set) rather than a unique source. We formalize this as learning from attribution sets generated by an oblivious adversary equipped with a prior distribution over the candidates. Despite the lack of explicit labels, we construct an unbiased estimator of the population loss from these coarse signals via a novel approach. Leveraging this estimator, we show that Empirical Risk Minimization achieves generalization guarantees that scale with the informativeness of the prior and is also robust against estimation errors in the prior, despite complex dependencies among attribution sets. Simple empirical evaluations on standard datasets suggest our unbiased approach significantly outperforms common industry heuristics, particularly in regimes where attribution sets are large or overlapping.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Kabuki syndrome (KS) and Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome (WSS) are rare but distinct developmental disorders that share overlapping clinical features, including neurodevelopmental delay, growth restriction, and persistent fetal fingertip pads. While genetic testing remains the diagnostic gold standard, many individuals with KS or WSS remain undiagnosed due to barriers in access to both genetic testing and expertise. Dermatoglyphic anomalies, despite being established hallmarks of several genetic syndromes, remain an underutilized diagnostic signal in the era of molecular testing. This study presents a vision transformer-based deep learning model that leverages fingerprint images to distinguish individuals with KS and WSS from unaffected controls and from one another. We evaluate model performance across three binary classification tasks. Across the three classification tasks, the model achieved AUC scores of 0.80 (control vs. KS), 0.73 (control vs. WSS), and 0.85 (KS vs. WSS), with corresponding F1 scores of 0.71, 0.72, and 0.83, respectively. Beyond classification, we apply attention-based visualizations to identify fingerprint regions most salient to model predictions, enhancing interpretability. Together, these findings suggest the presence of syndrome-specific fingerprint features, demonstrating the feasibility of a fingerprint-based artificial intelligence (AI) tool as a noninvasive, interpretable, and accessible future diagnostic aid for the early diagnosis of underdiagnosed genetic syndromes.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Exploiting sparsity during long-context inference is central to scaling large language models, as attention dominates the cost of autoregressive decoding. Sparse attention reduces this cost by restricting computation to a subset of tokens, but its effectiveness depends critically on efficient scoring and selection of relevant tokens at inference time. We revisit Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) as a sparsification primitive and introduce SOCKET, a SOft Collision Kernel EsTimator that replaces hard bucket matches with probabilistic, similarity-aware aggregation. Our key insight is that hard LSH produces discrete collision signals and is therefore poorly suited for ranking. In contrast, soft LSH aggregates graded collision evidence across hash tables, preserving the stability of relative ordering among the true top-$k$ tokens. This transformation elevates LSH from a candidate-generation heuristic to a principled and mathematically grounded scoring kernel for sparse attention. Leveraging this property, SOCKET enables efficient token selection without ad-hoc voting mechanism, and matches or surpasses established sparse attention baselines across multiple long-context benchmarks using diverse set of models. With a custom CUDA kernel for scoring keys and a Flash Decode Triton backend for sparse attention, SOCKET achieves up to 1.5$\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention, making it an effective tool for long-context inference.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent research in geospatial machine learning has demonstrated that models pretrained with self-supervised learning on Earth observation data can perform well on downstream tasks with limited training data. However, most of the existing geospatial benchmark datasets have few data modalities and poor global representation, limiting the ability to evaluate multimodal pretrained models at global scales. To fill this gap, we introduce MMEarth-Bench, a collection of five new multimodal environmental tasks with 12 modalities, globally distributed data, and both in- and out-of-distribution test splits. We benchmark a diverse set of pretrained models and find that while (multimodal) pretraining tends to improve model robustness in limited data settings, geographic generalization abilities remain poor. In order to facilitate model adaptation to new downstream tasks and geographic domains, we propose a model-agnostic method for test-time training with multimodal reconstruction (TTT-MMR) that uses all the modalities available at test time as auxiliary tasks, regardless of whether a pretrained model accepts them as input. Our method improves model performance on both the random and geographic test splits, and geographic batching leads to a good trade-off between regularization and specialization during TTT.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Accurately quantifying uncertainty in predictions and projections arising from irreducible internal climate variability is critical for informed decision making. Such uncertainty is typically assessed using ensembles produced with physics based climate models. However, computational constraints impose a trade off between generating the large ensembles required for robust uncertainty estimation and increasing model resolution to better capture fine scale dynamics. Generative machine learning offers a promising pathway to alleviate these constraints. We develop a conditional Variational Autoencoder (cVAE) trained on a limited sample of climate simulations to generate arbitrary large ensembles. The approach is applied to output from monthly CMIP6 historical and future scenario experiments produced with the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis' (CCCma's) Earth system model CanESM5. We show that the cVAE model learns the underlying distribution of the data and generates physically consistent samples that reproduce realistic low and high moment statistics, including extremes. Compared with more sophisticated generative architectures, cVAEs offer a mathematically transparent, interpretable, and computationally efficient framework. Their simplicity lead to some limitations, such as overly smooth outputs, spectral bias, and underdispersion, that we discuss along with strategies to mitigate them. Specifically, we show that incorporating output noise improves the representation of climate relevant multiscale variability, and we propose a simple method to achieve this. Finally, we show that cVAE-enhanced ensembles capture realistic global teleconnection patterns, even under climate conditions absent from the training data.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent progress in reasoning models suggests that generating plausible attempts for research-level mathematics may be within reach, but verification remains a bottleneck, consuming scarce expert time. We hypothesize that a meaningful solution should contain enough method-level information that, when applied to a neighborhood of related questions, it should yield better downstream performance than incorrect solutions. Building on this idea, we propose \textbf{Consequence-Based Utility}, an oracle-free evaluator that scores each candidate by testing its value as an in-context exemplar in solving related yet verifiable questions. Our approach is evaluated on an original set of research-level math problems, each paired with one expert-written solution and nine LLM-generated solutions. Notably, Consequence-Based Utility consistently outperforms reward models, generative reward models, and LLM judges on ranking quality. Specifically, for GPT-OSS-120B, it improves Acc@1 from 67.2 to 76.3 and AUC from 71.4 to 79.6, with similarly large AUC gains on GPT-OSS-20B (69.0 to 79.2). Furthermore, compared to LLM-Judges, it also exhibits a larger solver-evaluator gap, maintaining a stronger correct-wrong separation even on instances where the underlying solver often fails to solve.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the advancement of deep learning technologies, specialized neural processing hardware such as Brain Processing Units (BPUs) have emerged as dedicated platforms for CNN acceleration, offering optimized INT8 computation capabilities for convolutional operations. Meanwhile, Vision Transformer (ViT) models, such as the Data-efficient Image Transformer (DeiT), have demonstrated superior performance and play increasingly crucial roles in computer vision tasks. However, due to the architectural mismatch between CNN-optimized hardware and Vision Transformer computation characteristics--namely, that linear layers in Transformers operate on three-dimensional data while BPU acceleration is designed for four-dimensional convolution operations-it is difficult or even impossible to leverage BPU's advantages when deploying Vision Transformers. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that restructures the Vision Transformer by replacing linear layers and layer normalization operations with carefully designed convolutional operators. This enables DeiT to fully utilize the acceleration capabilities of BPUs, while allowing the original weight parameters to be inherited by the restructured models without retraining or fine-tuning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful deployment of Vision Transformers that fully leverages BPU classification datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Specifically, the quantized DeiT-Base model achieves 80.4% accuracy on ImageNet, compared to the original 81.8%, while obtaining up to a 3.8* inference speedup. Our finetuned DeiT model on the flower classification dataset also achieves excellent performance, with only a 0.5% accuracy drop for the DeiT-Base model, further demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Spoken code-switching (CSW) challenges syntactic parsing in ways not observed in written text. Disfluencies, repetition, ellipsis, and discourse-driven structure routinely violate standard Universal Dependencies (UD) assumptions, causing parsers and large language models (LLMs) to fail despite strong performance on written data. These failures are compounded by rigid evaluation metrics that conflate genuine structural errors with acceptable variation. In this work, we present a systems-oriented approach to spoken CSW parsing. We introduce a linguistically grounded taxonomy of spoken CSW phenomena and SpokeBench, an expert-annotated gold benchmark designed to test spoken-language structure beyond standard UD assumptions. We further propose FLEX-UD, an ambiguity-aware evaluation metric, which reveals that existing parsing techniques perform poorly on spoken CSW by penalizing linguistically plausible analyses as errors. We then propose DECAP, a decoupled agentic parsing framework that isolates spoken-phenomena handling from core syntactic analysis. Experiments show that DECAP produces more robust and interpretable parses without retraining and achieves up to 52.6% improvements over existing parsing techniques. FLEX-UD evaluations further reveal qualitative improvements that are masked by standard metrics.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present the Condensate Theorem: attention sparsity is a learned topological property, not an architectural constraint. Through empirical analysis of trained language models, we find that attention mass concentrates on a distinct topological manifold -- and this manifold can be identified dynamically without checking every position. We prove a general result: for any query, projecting attention onto the Condensate Manifold (Anchor + Window + Dynamic Top-k) achieves 100% output equivalence with full $O(n^2)$ attention. This is not an approximation -- it is lossless parity. We validate this across GPT-2, Pythia, Qwen2, TinyLlama, and Mistral, demonstrating bit-exact token matching on 1,500+ generated tokens. By mapping this topology to hardware, our Topological Attention kernel achieves a 159x measured speedup at 131K tokens (3.94ms vs 628ms) and a projected >1,200x speedup at 1M tokens, reducing inference costs by >99.9% compared to Flash Attention. We conclude that the quadratic bottleneck is an artifact of naive implementation, not intelligence.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Epidemiological forecasting from surveillance data is a hard problem and hybridizing mechanistic compartmental models with neural models is a natural direction. The mechanistic structure helps keep trajectories epidemiologically plausible, while neural components can capture non-stationary, data-adaptive effects. In practice, however, many seemingly straightforward couplings fail under partial observability and continually shifting transmission dynamics driven by behavior, waning immunity, seasonality, and interventions. We catalog these failure modes and show that robust performance requires making non-stationarity explicit: we extract multi-scale structure from the observed infection series and use it as an interpretable control signal for a controlled neural ODE coupled to an epidemiological model. Concretely, we decompose infections into trend, seasonal, and residual components and use these signals to drive continuous-time latent dynamics while jointly forecasting and inferring time-varying transmission, recovery, and immunity-loss rates. Across seasonal and non-seasonal settings, including early outbreaks and multi-wave regimes, our approach reduces long-horizon RMSE by 15-35%, improves peak timing error by 1-3 weeks, and lowers peak magnitude bias by up to 30% relative to strong time-series, neural ODE, and hybrid baselines, without relying on auxiliary covariates.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Understanding TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in malware binaries is essential for security analysis and threat intelligence, yet remains challenging in practice. Real-world malware binaries are typically stripped of symbols, contain large numbers of functions, and distribute malicious behavior across multiple code regions, making TTP attribution difficult. Recent large language models (LLMs) offer strong code understanding capabilities, but applying them directly to this task faces challenges in identifying analysis entry points, reasoning under partial observability, and misalignment with TTP-specific decision logic. We present TTPDetect, the first LLM agent for recognizing TTPs in stripped malware binaries. TTPDetect combines dense retrieval with LLM-based neural retrieval to narrow the space of analysis entry points. TTPDetect further employs a function-level analyzing agent consisting of a Context Explorer that performs on-demand, incremental context retrieval and a TTP-Specific Reasoning Guideline that achieves inference-time alignment. We build a new dataset that labels decompiled functions with TTPs across diverse malware families and platforms. TTPDetect achieves 93.25% precision and 93.81% recall on function-level TTP recognition, outperforming baselines by 10.38% and 18.78%, respectively. When evaluated on real world malware samples, TTPDetect recognizes TTPs with a precision of 87.37%. For malware with expert-written reports, TTPDetect recovers 85.7% of the documented TTPs and further discovers, on average, 10.5 previously unreported TTPs per malware.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Efficient and robust Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is paramount for safety-critical this http URL, existing methods still execute full-scale inference on low-level statistical noise. This computational mismatch not only incurs resource waste but also induces semantic hallucination, where deep networks forcefully interpret physical anomalies as high-confidence semantic this http URL address this, we propose the Cascaded Early Rejection (CER) framework, which realizes hierarchical filtering for anomaly detection via a coarse-to-fine this http URL comprises two core modules: 1)Structural Energy Sieve (SES), which establishes a non-parametric barrier at the network entry using the Laplacian operator to efficiently intercept physical signal anomalies; and 2) the Semantically-aware Hyperspherical Energy (SHE) detector, which decouples feature magnitude from direction in intermediate layers to identify fine-grained semantic deviations. Experimental results demonstrate that CER not only reduces computational overhead by 32% but also achieves a significant performance leap on the CIFAR-100 benchmark:the average FPR95 drastically decreases from 33.58% to 22.84%, and AUROC improves to 93.97%. Crucially, in real-world scenarios simulating sensor failures, CER exhibits performance far exceeding state-of-the-art methods. As a universal plugin, CER can be seamlessly integrated into various SOTA models to provide performance gains.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deploying trustworthy AI in open-world environments faces a dual challenge: the necessity for robust Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection to ensure system safety, and the demand for flexible machine unlearning to satisfy privacy compliance and model rectification. However, this objective encounters a fundamental geometric contradiction: current OOD detectors rely on a static and compact data manifold, whereas traditional classification-oriented unlearning methods disrupt this delicate structure, leading to a catastrophic loss of the model's capability to discriminate anomalies while erasing target classes. To resolve this dilemma, we first define the problem of boundary-preserving class unlearning and propose a pivotal conceptual shift: in the context of OOD detection, effective unlearning is mathematically equivalent to transforming the target class into OOD samples. Based on this, we propose the TFER (Total Free Energy Repulsion) framework. Inspired by the free energy principle, TFER constructs a novel Push-Pull game mechanism: it anchors retained classes within a low-energy ID manifold through a pull mechanism, while actively expelling forgotten classes to high-energy OOD regions using a free energy repulsion force. This approach is implemented via parameter-efficient fine-tuning, circumventing the prohibitive cost of full retraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TFER achieves precise unlearning while maximally preserving the model's discriminative performance on remaining classes and external OOD data. More importantly, our study reveals that the unique Push-Pull equilibrium of TFER endows the model with inherent structural stability, allowing it to effectively resist catastrophic forgetting without complex additional constraints, thereby demonstrating exceptional potential in continual unlearning tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The recent introduction of \texttt{SAM3} has revolutionized Open-Vocabulary Segmentation (OVS) through \textit{promptable concept segmentation}, which grounds pixel predictions in flexible concept prompts. However, this reliance on pre-defined concepts makes the model vulnerable: when visual distributions shift (\textit{data drift}) or conditional label distributions evolve (\textit{concept drift}) in the target domain, the alignment between visual evidence and prompts breaks down. In this work, we present \textsc{ConceptBank}, a parameter-free calibration framework to restore this alignment on the fly. Instead of adhering to static prompts, we construct a dataset-specific concept bank from the target statistics. Our approach (\textit{i}) anchors target-domain evidence via class-wise visual prototypes, (\textit{ii}) mines representative supports to suppress outliers under data drift, and (\textit{iii}) fuses candidate concepts to rectify concept drift. We demonstrate that \textsc{ConceptBank} effectively adapts \texttt{SAM3} to distribution drifts, including challenging natural-scene and remote-sensing scenarios, establishing a new baseline for robustness and efficiency in OVS.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recently, Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated strong generalizability in various instance segmentation tasks. However, its performance is severely dependent on the quality of manual prompts. In addition, the RGB images that instance segmentation methods normally use inherently lack depth information. As a result, the ability of these methods to perceive spatial structures and delineate object boundaries is hindered. To address these challenges, we propose a Self-prompted Depth-Aware SAM (SPDA-SAM) for instance segmentation. Specifically, we design a Semantic-Spatial Self-prompt Module (SSSPM) which extracts the semantic and spatial prompts from the image encoder and the mask decoder of SAM, respectively. Furthermore, we introduce a Coarse-to-Fine RGB-D Fusion Module (C2FFM), in which the features extracted from a monocular RGB image and the depth map estimated from it are fused. In particular, the structural information in the depth map is used to provide coarse-grained guidance to feature fusion, while local variations in depth are encoded in order to fuse fine-grained feature representations. To our knowledge, SAM has not been explored in such self-prompted and depth-aware manners. Experimental results demonstrate that our SPDA-SAM outperforms its state-of-the-art counterparts across twelve different data sets. These promising results should be due to the guidance of the self-prompts and the compensation for the spatial information loss by the coarse-to-fine RGB-D fusion operation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Since most countries are coming up with online privacy regulations, such as GDPR in the EU, online publishers need to find a balance between revenue from targeted advertisement and user privacy. One way to be able to still show targeted ads, based on user personal and behavioral information, is to employ Federated Learning (FL), which performs distributed learning across users without sharing user raw data with other stakeholders in the publishing ecosystem. This paper presents AdFL, an FL framework that works in the browsers to learn user ad preferences. These preferences are aggregated in a global FL model, which is then used in the browsers to show more relevant ads to users. AdFL can work with any model that uses features available in the browser such as ad viewability, ad click-through, user dwell time on pages, and page content. The AdFL server runs at the publisher and coordinates the learning process for the users who browse pages on the publisher's website. The AdFL prototype does not require the client to install any software, as it is built utilizing standard APIs available on most modern browsers. We built a proof-of-concept model for ad viewability prediction that runs on top of AdFL. We tested AdFL and the model with two non-overlapping datasets from a website with 40K visitors per day. The experiments demonstrate AdFL's feasibility to capture the training information in the browser in a few milliseconds, show that the ad viewability prediction achieves up to 92.59% AUC, and indicate that utilizing differential privacy (DP) to safeguard local model parameters yields adequate performance, with only modest declines in comparison to the non-DP variant.</li>

While large language models (LLMs) show promise in this domain, their precise causal estimation capabilities are still limited, and the impact of post-training on these abilities is insufficiently explored. This paper examines the extent to which post-training can enhance LLMs' capacity for causal inference. We introduce CauGym, a comprehensive dataset comprising seven core causal tasks for training and five diverse test sets. Using this dataset, we systematically evaluate five post-training approaches: SFT, DPO, KTO, PPO, and GRPO. Across five in-domain and four existing benchmarks, our experiments demonstrate that appropriate post-training enables smaller LLMs to perform causal inference competitively, often surpassing much larger models. Our 14B parameter model achieves 93.5% accuracy on the CaLM benchmark, compared to 55.4% by OpenAI o3. Furthermore, the post-trained LLMs exhibit strong generalization and robustness under real-world conditions such as distribution shifts and noisy data. Collectively, these findings provide the first systematic evidence that targeted post-training can produce reliable and robust LLM-based causal reasoners.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>High-fidelity rendering of dynamic humans from monocular videos typically degrades catastrophically under occlusions. Existing solutions incorporate external priors-either hallucinating missing content via generative models, which induces severe temporal flickering, or imposing rigid geometric heuristics that fail to capture diverse appearances. To this end, we reformulate the task as a Maximum A Posteriori estimation problem under heteroscedastic observation noise. In this paper, we propose U-4DGS, a framework integrating a Probabilistic Deformation Network and a Double Rasterization pipeline. This architecture renders pixel-aligned uncertainty maps that act as an adaptive gradient modulator, automatically attenuating artifacts from unreliable observations. Furthermore, to prevent geometric drift in regions lacking reliable visual cues, we enforce Confidence-Aware Regularizations, which leverage the learned uncertainty to selectively propagate spatial-temporal validity. Extensive experiments on ZJU-MoCap and OcMotion demonstrate that U-4DGS achieves SOTA rendering fidelity and robustness.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, attack, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The deployment of autonomous AI agents capable of executing commercial transactions has motivated the adoption of mandate-based payment authorization protocols, including the Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP) and the Agent Payments Protocol (AP2). These protocols replace interactive, session-based authorization with cryptographically issued mandates, enabling asynchronous and autonomous execution. While AP2 provides specification-level guarantees through signature verification, explicit binding, and expiration semantics, real-world agentic execution introduces runtime behaviors such as retries, concurrency, and orchestration that challenge implicit assumptions about mandate usage. In this work, we present a security analysis of the AP2 mandate lifecycle and identify enforcement gaps that arise during runtime in agent-based payment systems. We propose a zero-trust runtime verification framework that enforces explicit context binding and consume-once mandate semantics using dynamically generated, time-bound nonces, ensuring that authorization decisions are evaluated at execution time rather than assumed from static issuance properties. Through simulation-based evaluation under high concurrency, we show that context-aware binding and consume-once enforcement address distinct and complementary attack classes, and that both are required to prevent replay and context-redirect attacks. The proposed framework mitigates all evaluated attacks while maintaining stable verification latency of approximately 3.8~ms at throughput levels up to 10{,}000 transactions per second. We further demonstrate that the required runtime state is bounded by peak concurrency rather than cumulative transaction history, indicating that robust runtime security for agentic payment execution can be achieved with minimal and predictable overhead.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Existing methods for preference tuning of text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models often rely on computationally expensive generation steps to create positive and negative pairs of images. These approaches frequently yield training pairs that either lack meaningful differences, are expensive to sample and filter, or exhibit significant variance in irrelevant pixel regions, thereby degrading training efficiency. To address these limitations, we introduce "Di3PO", a novel method for constructing positive and negative pairs that isolates specific regions targeted for improvement during preference tuning, while keeping the surrounding context in the image stable. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by applying it to the challenging task of text rendering in diffusion models, showcasing improvements over baseline methods of SFT and DPO.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose SHINE (Scalable Hyper In-context NEtwork), a scalable hypernetwork that can map diverse meaningful contexts into high-quality LoRA adapters for large language models (LLM). By reusing the frozen LLM's own parameters in an in-context hypernetwork design and introducing architectural innovations, SHINE overcomes key limitations of prior hypernetworks and achieves strong expressive power with a relatively small number of parameters. We introduce a pretraining and instruction fine-tuning pipeline, and train our hypernetwork to generate high quality LoRA adapters from diverse meaningful contexts in a single forward pass. It updates LLM parameters without any fine-tuning, and immediately enables complex question answering tasks related to the context without directly accessing the context, effectively transforming in-context knowledge to in-parameter knowledge in one pass. Our work achieves outstanding results on various tasks, greatly saves time, computation and memory costs compared to SFT-based LLM adaptation, and shows great potential for scaling.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for specialized domains often necessitates a trade-off between acquiring domain expertise and retaining general reasoning capabilities, a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. Existing remedies face a dichotomy: gradient surgery methods offer geometric safety but incur prohibitive computational costs via online projections, while efficient data selection approaches reduce overhead but remain blind to conflict-inducing gradient directions. In this paper, we propose Orthogonal Gradient Selection (OGS), a data-centric method that harmonizes domain performance, general capability retention, and training efficiency. OGS shifts the geometric insights of gradient projection from the optimizer to the data selection stage by treating data selection as a constrained decision-making process. By leveraging a lightweight Navigator model and reinforcement learning techniques, OGS dynamically identifies training samples whose gradients are orthogonal to a general-knowledge anchor. This approach ensures naturally safe updates for target models without modifying the optimizer or incurring runtime projection costs. Experiments across medical, legal, and financial domains demonstrate that OGS achieves excellent results, significantly improving domain performance and training efficiency while maintaining or even enhancing performance on general tasks such as GSM8K.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Existing cross-modal pedestrian detection (CMPD) employs complementary information from RGB and thermal-infrared (TIR) modalities to detect pedestrians in 24h-surveillance this http URL captures rich pedestrian details under daylight, while TIR excels at night. However, TIR focuses primarily on the person's silhouette, neglecting critical texture details essential for detection. While the near-infrared (NIR) captures texture under low-light conditions, which effectively alleviates performance issues of RGB and detail loss in TIR, thereby reducing missed detections. To this end, we construct a new Triplet RGB-NIR-TIR (TRNT) dataset, comprising 8,281 pixel-aligned image triplets, establishing a comprehensive foundation for algorithmic research. However, due to the variable nature of real-world scenarios, imaging devices may not always capture all three modalities simultaneously. This results in input data with unpredictable combinations of modal types, which challenge existing CMPD methods that fail to extract robust pedestrian information under arbitrary input combinations, leading to significant performance degradation. To address these challenges, we propose the Adaptive Uncertainty-aware Network (AUNet) for accurately discriminating modal availability and fully utilizing the available information under uncertain inputs. Specifically, we introduce Unified Modality Validation Refinement (UMVR), which includes an uncertainty-aware router to validate modal availability and a semantic refinement to ensure the reliability of information within the modality. Furthermore, we design a Modality-Aware Interaction (MAI) module to adaptively activate or deactivate its internal interaction mechanisms per UMVR output, enabling effective complementary information fusion from available modalities.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Salient object detection is inherently a subjective problem, as observers with different priors may perceive different objects as salient. However, existing methods predominantly formulate it as an objective prediction task with a single groundtruth segmentation map for each image, which renders the problem under-determined and fundamentally ill-posed. To address this issue, we propose Observer-Centric Salient Object Detection (OC-SOD), where salient regions are predicted by considering not only the visual cues but also the observer-specific factors such as their preferences or intents. As a result, this formulation captures the intrinsic ambiguity and diversity of human perception, enabling personalized and context-aware saliency prediction. By leveraging multi-modal large language models, we develop an efficient data annotation pipeline and construct the first OC-SOD dataset named OC-SODBench, comprising 33k training, validation and test images with 152k textual prompts and object pairs. Built upon this new dataset, we further design OC-SODAgent, an agentic baseline which performs OC-SOD via a human-like "Perceive-Reflect-Adjust" process. Extensive experiments on our proposed OC-SODBench have justified the effectiveness of our contribution. Through this observer-centric perspective, we aim to bridge the gap between human perception and computational modeling, offering a more realistic and flexible understanding of what makes an object truly "salient."

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, generative, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o and Claude Sonnet 4.5 have demonstrated strong capabilities in open-ended reasoning and generative language tasks, leading to their widespread adoption across a broad range of NLP applications. However, for structured text classification problems with fixed label spaces, model selection is often driven by predictive performance alone, overlooking operational constraints encountered in production systems. In this work, we present a systematic comparison of two contrasting paradigms for text classification: zero- and few-shot prompt-based large language models, and fully fine-tuned encoder-only architectures. We evaluate these approaches across four canonical benchmarks (IMDB, SST-2, AG News, and DBPedia), measuring predictive quality (macro F1), inference latency, and monetary cost. We frame model evaluation as a multi-objective decision problem and analyze trade-offs using Pareto frontier projections and a parameterized utility function reflecting different deployment regimes. Our results show that fine-tuned encoder-based models from the BERT family achieve competitive, and often superior, classification performance while operating at one to two orders of magnitude lower cost and latency compared to zero- and few-shot LLM prompting. Overall, our findings suggest that indiscriminate use of large language models for standard text classification workloads can lead to suboptimal system-level outcomes. Instead, fine-tuned encoders emerge as robust and efficient components for structured NLP pipelines, while LLMs are better positioned as complementary elements within hybrid architectures. We release all code, datasets, and evaluation protocols to support reproducibility and cost-aware NLP system design.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Producing outputs that satisfy both semantic intent and format constraints is essential for deploying large language models in user-facing and system-integrated workflows. In this work, we focus on Markdown formatting, which is ubiquitous in assistants, documentation, and tool-augmented pipelines but still prone to subtle, hard-to-detect errors (e.g., broken lists, malformed tables, inconsistent headings, and invalid code blocks) that can significantly degrade downstream usability. We present FMBench, a benchmark for adaptive Markdown output formatting that evaluates models under a wide range of instruction-following scenarios with diverse structural requirements. FMBench emphasizes real-world formatting behaviors such as multi-level organization, mixed content (natural language interleaved with lists/tables/code), and strict adherence to user-specified layout constraints. To improve Markdown compliance without relying on hard decoding constraints, we propose a lightweight alignment pipeline that combines supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with reinforcement learning fine-tuning. Starting from a base model, we first perform SFT on instruction-response pairs, and then optimize a composite objective that balances semantic fidelity with structural correctness. Experiments on two model families (OpenPangu and Qwen) show that SFT consistently improves semantic alignment, while reinforcement learning provides additional gains in robustness to challenging Markdown instructions when initialized from a strong SFT policy. Our results also reveal an inherent trade-off between semantic and structural objectives, highlighting the importance of carefully designed rewards for reliable formatted generation.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Spectral gradient descent (SpecGD) orthogonalizes the matrix parameter updates and has inspired practical optimizers such as Muon. They often perform well in large language model (LLM) training, but their dynamics remain poorly understood. In the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) setting, where weight updates are parameterized as a product of two low-rank factors, we find a distinctive spectral phenomenon under Muon in LoRA fine-tuning of LLMs: singular values of the LoRA product show near-uniform growth across the spectrum, despite orthogonalization being performed on the two factors separately. Motivated by this observation, we analyze spectral gradient flow (SpecGF)-a continuous-time analogue of SpecGD-in a simplified LoRA-style matrix factorization setting and prove "equal-rate" dynamics: all singular values grow at equal rates up to small deviations. Consequently, smaller singular values attain their target values earlier than larger ones, sharply contrasting with the largest-first stepwise learning observed in standard gradient flow. Moreover, we prove that SpecGF in our setting converges to global minima from almost all initializations, provided the factor norms remain bounded; with $\ell_2$ regularization, we obtain global convergence. Lastly, we corroborate our theory with experiments in the same setting.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, protect, attack, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Synthetic tabular data enables sharing and analysis of sensitive records, but its practical deployment requires balancing distributional fidelity, downstream utility, and privacy protection. We study a simple, model agnostic post processing framework that can be applied on top of any synthetic data generator to improve this trade off. First, a mode patching step repairs categories that are missing or severely underrepresented in the synthetic data, while largely preserving learned dependencies. Second, a k nearest neighbor filter replaces synthetic records that lie too close to real data points, enforcing a minimum distance between real and synthetic samples. We instantiate this framework for two neural generative models for tabular data, a feed forward generator and a variational autoencoder, and evaluate it on three public datasets covering credit card transactions, cardiovascular health, and census based income. We assess marginal and joint distributional similarity, the performance of models trained on synthetic data and evaluated on real data, and several empirical privacy indicators, including nearest neighbor distances and attribute inference attacks. With moderate thresholds between 0.2 and 0.35, the post processing reduces divergence between real and synthetic categorical distributions by up to 36 percent and improves a combined measure of pairwise dependence preservation by 10 to 14 percent, while keeping downstream predictive performance within about 1 percent of the unprocessed baseline. At the same time, distance based privacy indicators improve and the success rate of attribute inference attacks remains largely unchanged. These results provide practical guidance for selecting thresholds and applying post hoc repairs to improve the quality and empirical privacy of synthetic tabular data, while complementing approaches that provide formal differential privacy guarantees.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Machine learning (ML) models are increasingly deployed in cybersecurity applications such as phishing detection and network intrusion prevention. However, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial perturbations small, deliberate input modifications that can degrade detection accuracy and compromise interpretability. This paper presents an empirical study of adversarial robustness and explainability drift across two cybersecurity domains phishing URL classification and network intrusion detection. We evaluate the impact of L (infinity) bounded Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) perturbations on model accuracy and introduce a quantitative metric, the Robustness Index (RI), defined as the area under the accuracy perturbation curve. Gradient based feature sensitivity and SHAP based attribution drift analyses reveal which input features are most susceptible to adversarial manipulation. Experiments on the Phishing Websites and UNSW NB15 datasets show consistent robustness trends, with adversarial training improving RI by up to 9 percent while maintaining clean-data accuracy. These findings highlight the coupling between robustness and interpretability degradation and underscore the importance of quantitative evaluation in the design of trustworthy, AI-driven cybersecurity systems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>3D semantic occupancy prediction enables autonomous vehicles (AVs) to perceive fine-grained geometric and semantic structure of their surroundings from onboard sensors, which is essential for safe decision-making and navigation. Recent models for 3D semantic occupancy prediction have successfully addressed the challenge of describing real-world objects with varied shapes and classes. However, the intermediate representations used by existing methods for 3D semantic occupancy prediction rely heavily on 3D voxel volumes or a set of 3D Gaussians, hindering the model's ability to efficiently and effectively capture fine-grained geometric details in the 3D driving environment. This paper introduces TFusionOcc, a novel object-centric multi-sensor fusion framework for predicting 3D semantic occupancy. By leveraging multi-stage multi-sensor fusion, Student's t-distribution, and the T-Mixture model (TMM), together with more geometrically flexible primitives, such as the deformable superquadric (superquadric with inverse warp), the proposed method achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the nuScenes benchmark. In addition, extensive experiments were conducted on the nuScenes-C dataset to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method in different camera and lidar corruption scenarios.

Existing OCR systems and general-purpose vision-language models often fail to reliably parse such documents. We propose MeDocVL, a post-trained vision-language model for query-driven medical document parsing. Our framework combines Training-driven Label Refinement to construct high-quality supervision from noisy annotations, with a Noise-aware Hybrid Post-training strategy that integrates reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning to achieve robust and precise extraction. Experiments on medical invoice benchmarks show that MeDocVL consistently outperforms conventional OCR systems and strong VLM baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance under noisy supervision.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>LiDAR-based 3D object detectors often struggle to detect far-field objects due to the sparsity of point clouds at long ranges, which limits the availability of reliable geometric cues. To address this, prior approaches augment LiDAR data with depth-completed virtual points derived from RGB images; however, directly incorporating all virtual points leads to increased computational cost and introduces challenges in effectively fusing real and virtual information. We present Point Virtual Transformer (PointViT), a transformer-based 3D object detection framework that jointly reasons over raw LiDAR points and selectively sampled virtual points. The framework examines multiple fusion strategies, ranging from early point-level fusion to BEV-based gated fusion, and analyses their trade-offs in terms of accuracy and efficiency. The fused point cloud is voxelized and encoded using sparse convolutions to form a BEV representation, from which a compact set of high-confidence object queries is initialised and refined through a transformer-based context aggregation module. Experiments on the KITTI benchmark report 91.16% 3D AP, 95.94% BEV AP, and 99.36% AP on the KITTI 2D detection benchmark for the Car class.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are pushing recommender systems (RecSys) toward content-grounded retrieval and ranking via cross-modal fusion. We find that while cross-modal consensus often mitigates conventional poisoning that manipulates interaction logs or perturbs a single modality, it also introduces a new attack surface where synchronised multimodal poisoning can reliably steer fused representations along stable semantic directions during fine-tuning. To characterise this threat, we formalise cross-modal interactive poisoning and propose VENOMREC, which performs Exposure Alignment to identify high-exposure regions in the joint embedding space and Cross-modal Interactive Perturbation to craft attention-guided coupled token-patch edits. Experiments on three real-world multimodal datasets demonstrate that VENOMREC consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving 0.73 mean ER@20 and improving over the strongest baseline by +0.52 absolute ER points on average, while maintaining comparable recommendation utility.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Electroencephalography (EEG)-based emotion recognition plays a critical role in affective computing and emerging decision-support systems, yet remains challenging due to high-dimensional, noisy, and subject-dependent signals. This study investigates whether hybrid deep learning architectures that integrate convolutional, recurrent, and attention-based components can improve emotion classification performance and robustness in EEG data. We propose an enhanced hybrid model that combines convolutional feature extraction, bidirectional temporal modeling, and self-attention mechanisms with regularization strategies to mitigate overfitting. Experiments conducted on a publicly available EEG dataset spanning three emotional states (neutral, positive, and negative) demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art classification performance, significantly outperforming classical machine learning and neural baselines. Statistical tests confirm the robustness of these performance gains under cross-validation. Feature-level analyses further reveal that covariance-based EEG features contribute most strongly to emotion discrimination, highlighting the importance of inter-channel relationships in affective modeling. These findings suggest that carefully designed hybrid architectures can effectively balance predictive accuracy, robustness, and interpretability in EEG-based emotion recognition, with implications for applied affective computing and human-centered intelligent systems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Masked Diffusion Language Models generate sequences via iterative sampling that progressively unmasks tokens. However, they still recompute the attention and feed-forward blocks for every token position at every step -- even when many unmasked tokens are essentially fixed, resulting in substantial waste in compute. We propose SureLock: when the posterior at an unmasked position has stabilized across steps (our sure condition), we lock that position -- thereafter skipping its query projection and feed-forward sublayers -- while caching its attention keys and values so other positions can continue to attend to it. This reduces the dominant per-iteration computational cost from $O(N^2d)$ to $O(MNd)$ where $N$ is the sequence length, $M$ is the number of unlocked token positions, and $d$ is the model dimension. In practice, $M$ decreases as the iteration progresses, yielding substantial savings. On LLaDA-8B, SureLock reduces algorithmic FLOPs by 30--50% relative to the same sampler without locking, while maintaining comparable generation quality. We also provide a theoretical analysis to justify the design rationale of SureLock: monitoring only the local KL at the lock step suffices to bound the deviation in final token probabilities.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Tokenization is a promising path to multi-modal models capable of jointly understanding protein sequences, structure, and function. Existing protein structure tokenizers create tokens by pooling information from local neighborhoods, an approach that limits their performance on generative and representation tasks. In this work, we present a method for global tokenization of protein structures in which successive tokens contribute increasing levels of detail to a global representation. This change resolves several issues with generative models based on local protein tokenization: it mitigates error accumulation, provides embeddings without sequence-reduction operations, and allows task-specific adaptation of a tokenized sequence's information content. We validate our method on reconstruction, generative, and representation tasks and demonstrate that it matches or outperforms existing models based on local protein structure tokenizers. We show how adaptive tokens enable inference criteria based on information content, which boosts designability. We validate representations generated from our tokenizer on CATH classification tasks and demonstrate that non-linear probing on our tokenized sequences outperforms equivalent probing on representations from other tokenizers. Finally, we demonstrate how our method supports zero-shot protein shrinking and affinity maturation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Human visual attention on three-dimensional objects emerges from the interplay between bottom-up geometric processing and top-down semantic recognition. Existing 3D saliency methods rely on hand-crafted geometric features or learning-based approaches that lack semantic awareness, failing to explain why humans fixate on semantically meaningful but geometrically unremarkable regions. We introduce SemGeo-AttentionNet, a dual-stream architecture that explicitly formalizes this dichotomy through asymmetric cross-modal fusion, leveraging diffusion-based semantic priors from geometry-conditioned multi-view rendering and point cloud transformers for geometric processing. Cross-attention ensures geometric features query semantic content, enabling bottom-up distinctiveness to guide top-down retrieval. We extend our framework to temporal scanpath generation through reinforcement learning, introducing the first formulation respecting 3D mesh topology with inhibition-of-return dynamics. Evaluation on SAL3D, NUS3D and 3DVA datasets demonstrates substantial improvements, validating how cognitively motivated architectures effectively model human visual attention on three-dimensional surfaces.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Humor is a commonly used and intricate human language in daily life. Humor generation, especially in multi-modal scenarios, is a challenging task for large language models (LLMs), which is typically as funny caption generation for images, requiring visual understanding, humor reasoning, creative imagination, and so on. Existing LLM-based approaches rely on reasoning chains or self-improvement, which suffer from limited creativity and interpretability. To address these bottlenecks, we develop a novel LLM-based humor generation mechanism based on a fundamental humor theory, GTVH. To produce funny and script-opposite captions, we introduce a humor-theory-driven multi-role LLM collaboration framework augmented with humor retrieval (HOMER). The framework consists of three LLM-based roles: (1) conflicting-script extractor that grounds humor in key script oppositions, forming the basis of caption generation; (2) retrieval-augmented hierarchical imaginator that identifies key humor targets and expands the creative space of them through diverse associations structured as imagination trees; and (3) caption generator that produces funny and diverse captions conditioned on the obtained knowledge. Extensive experiments on two New Yorker Cartoon benchmarking datasets show that HOMER outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and powerful LLM reasoning strategies on multi-modal humor captioning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Mainstream Visual-inertial odometry  (VIO) systems rely on point features for motion estimation and localization. However, their performance degrades in challenging scenarios. Moreover, the localization accuracy of multi-state constraint Kalman filter (MSCKF)-based VIO systems suffers from linearization errors associated with feature 3D coordinates and delayed measurement updates. To improve the performance of VIO in challenging scenes, we first propose a pose-only geometric representation for line features. Building on this, we develop POPL-KF, a Kalman filter-based VIO system that employs a pose-only geometric representation for both point and line features. POPL-KF mitigates linearization errors by explicitly eliminating both point and line feature coordinates from the measurement equations, while enabling immediate update of visual measurements. We also design a unified base-frames selection algorithm for both point and line features to ensure optimal constraints on camera poses within the pose-only measurement model. To further improve line feature quality, a line feature filter based on image grid segmentation and bidirectional optical flow consistency is proposed. Our system is evaluated on public datasets and real-world experiments, demonstrating that POPL-KF outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) filter-based methods (OpenVINS, PO-KF) and optimization-based methods (PL-VINS, EPLF-VINS), while maintaining real-time performance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Conceptual hydrologic models remain the cornerstone of rainfall-runoff modeling, yet their calibration is often slow and numerically fragile. Most gradient-based parameter estimation methods rely on finite-difference approximations or automatic differentiation frameworks (e.g., JAX, PyTorch and TensorFlow), which are computationally demanding and introduce truncation errors, solver instabilities, and substantial overhead. These limitations are particularly acute for the ODE systems of conceptual watershed models. Here we introduce a fully analytic and computationally efficient framework for differentiable hydrologic modeling based on exact parameter sensitivities. By augmenting the governing ODE system with sensitivity equations, we jointly evolve the model states and the Jacobian matrix with respect to all parameters. This Jacobian then provides fully analytic gradient vectors for any differentiable loss function. These include classical objective functions such as the sum of absolute and squared residuals, widely used hydrologic performance metrics such as the Nash-Sutcliffe and Kling-Gupta efficiencies, robust loss functions that down-weight extreme events, and hydrograph-based functionals such as flow-duration and recession curves. The analytic sensitivities eliminate the step-size dependence and noise inherent to numerical differentiation, while avoiding the instability of adjoint methods and the overhead of modern machine-learning autodiff toolchains. The resulting gradients are deterministic, physically interpretable, and straightforward to embed in gradient-based optimizers. Overall, this work enables rapid, stable, and transparent gradient-based calibration of conceptual hydrologic models, unlocking the full potential of differentiable modeling without reliance on external, opaque, or CPU-intensive automatic-differentiation libraries.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, security, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The sharing of the last-level cache (LLC) among multiple cores makes it vulnerable to cross-core conflict- and occupancy-based attacks. Despite extensive prior work, modern processors still employ non-secure set-associative LLCs. Existing secure LLC designs broadly fall into two categories: (i) randomized and (ii) partitioned. The state-of-the-art randomized design, Mirage, mitigates conflict-based attacks but incurs significant area overhead (20% additional storage) and design complexity. Partitioned LLCs mitigate both conflict- and occupancy-based attacks, but often suffer from large performance overheads (on average over 5% and up to 49%), require OS support in set-based schemes, or face scalability issues in way-based schemes. These factors pose major obstacles to the industrial adoption of secure LLCs. This paper asks whether strong LLC security can be achieved with minimal changes to a conventional set-associative LLC, enabling security only when needed while preserving low performance, power, and area overheads. We propose Avatar, a secure and morphable LLC that supports three modes: non-secure (Avatar-N), randomized secure (Avatar-R), and partitioned secure (Avatar-P), and can switch dynamically between them. Avatar closely resembles a conventional set-associative LLC, facilitating industrial adoption. Avatar-R introduces extra invalid entries and leverages high associativity to provide a strong security guarantee with little capacity loss, achieving only one set-associative eviction per $10^{30}$ years, while incurring 1.5% storage overhead, a 2.7% increase in static power, and a 0.2% slowdown over a 16~MB baseline. Avatar-P mitigates both conflict- and occupancy-based attacks with only a 3% performance overhead, substantially outperforming prior way-based partitioned LLCs. When security is unnecessary, Avatar switches to Avatar-N to maximize performance and energy efficiency.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have become integral to many domains, making their safety a critical priority. Prior jailbreaking research has explored diverse approaches, including prompt optimization, automated red teaming, obfuscation, and reinforcement learning (RL) based methods. However, most existing techniques fail to effectively leverage vulnerabilities revealed in earlier interaction turns, resulting in inefficient and unstable attacks. Since jailbreaking involves sequential interactions in which each response influences future actions, reinforcement learning provides a natural framework for this problem. Motivated by this, we propose a history-aware RL-based jailbreak framework that analyzes and reweights vulnerability signals from prior steps to guide future decisions. We show that incorporating historical information alone improves jailbreak success rates. Building on this insight, we introduce an attention-based reweighting mechanism that highlights critical vulnerabilities within the interaction history, enabling more efficient exploration with fewer queries. Extensive experiments on AdvBench and HarmBench demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art jailbreak performance while significantly improving query efficiency. These results underscore the importance of historical vulnerability signals in reinforcement learning-driven jailbreak strategies and offer a principled pathway for advancing adversarial research on LLM safeguards.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>protect</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>For ethical and safe AI, machine unlearning rises as a critical topic aiming to protect sensitive, private, and copyrighted knowledge from misuse. To achieve this goal, it is common to conduct gradient ascent (GA) to reverse the training on undesired data. However, such a reversal is prone to catastrophic collapse, which leads to serious performance degradation in general tasks. As a solution, we propose model extrapolation as an alternative to GA, which reaches the counterpart direction in the hypothesis space from one model given another reference model. Therefore, we leverage the original model as the reference, further train it to memorize undesired data while keeping prediction consistency on the rest retained data, to obtain a memorization model. Counterfactual as it might sound, a forget model can be obtained via extrapolation from the memorization model to the reference model. Hence, we avoid directly acquiring the forget model using GA, but proceed with gradient descent for the memorization model, which successfully stabilizes the machine unlearning process. Our model extrapolation is simple and efficient to implement, and it can also effectively converge throughout training to achieve improved unlearning performance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Unified multimodal models (UMMs) have achieved remarkable progress yet remain constrained by a single-turn interaction paradigm, effectively functioning as solvers for independent requests rather than assistants in continuous dialogue. To bridge this gap, we present ChatUMM. As a conversational unified model, it excels at robust context tracking to sustain interleaved multimodal generation. ChatUMM derives its capabilities from two key innovations: an interleaved multi-turn training strategy that models serialized text-image streams as a continuous conversational flow, and a systematic conversational data synthesis pipeline. This pipeline transforms a diverse set of standard single-turn datasets into fluid dialogues through three progressive stages: constructing basic stateful dialogues, enforcing long-range dependency resolution via ``distractor'' turns with history-dependent query rewriting, and synthesizing naturally interleaved multimodal responses. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that ChatUMM achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source unified models on visual understanding and instruction-guided editing benchmarks, while maintaining competitive fidelity in text-to-image generation. Notably, ChatUMM exhibits superior robustness in complex multi-turn scenarios, ensuring fluid, context-aware dialogues.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well on many reasoning benchmarks, yet existing evaluations rarely assess their ability to distinguish between meaningful semantic relations and genuine unrelatedness. We introduce CORE (Comprehensive Ontological Relation Evaluation), a dataset of 225K multiple-choice questions spanning 74 disciplines, together with a general-domain open-source benchmark of 203 rigorously validated questions (Cohen's Kappa = 1.0) covering 24 semantic relation types with equal representation of unrelated pairs. A human baseline from 1,000+ participants achieves 92.6% accuracy (95.1% on unrelated pairs). In contrast, 29 state-of-the-art LLMs achieve 48.25-70.9% overall accuracy, with near-ceiling performance on related pairs (86.5-100%) but severe degradation on unrelated pairs (0-41.35%), despite assigning similar confidence (92-94%). Expected Calibration Error increases 2-4x on unrelated pairs, and a mean semantic collapse rate of 37.6% indicates systematic generation of spurious relations. On the CORE 225K MCQs dataset, accuracy further drops to approximately 2%, highlighting substantial challenges in domain-specific semantic reasoning. We identify unrelatedness reasoning as a critical, under-evaluated frontier for LLM evaluation and safety.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Model (LLM)-based scientific agents have accelerated scientific discovery, yet they often suffer from significant inefficiencies due to adherence to fixed initial priors. Existing approaches predominantly operate within a static hypothesis space, which restricts the discovery of novel phenomena, resulting in computational waste when baseline theories fail. To address this, we propose shifting the focus from searching hypotheses to evolving the underlying scientific principles. We present PiEvo, a principle-evolvable framework that treats scientific discovery as Bayesian optimization over an expanding principle space. By integrating Information-Directed Hypothesis Selection via Gaussian Process and an anomaly-driven augmentation mechanism, PiEvo enables agents to autonomously refine their theoretical worldview. Evaluation across four benchmarks demonstrates that PiEvo (1) achieves an average solution quality of up to 90.81%~93.15%, representing a 29.7%~31.1% improvement over the state-of-the-art, (2) attains an 83.3% speedup in convergence step via significantly reduced sample complexity by optimizing the compact principle space, and (3) maintains robust performance across diverse scientific domains and LLM backbones.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) hold transformative potential for medical decision support yet their application in psychiatry remains constrained by hallucinations and superficial reasoning. This limitation is particularly acute in light-parameter LLMs which are essential for privacy-preserving and efficient clinical deployment. Existing training paradigms prioritize linguistic fluency over structured clinical logic and result in a fundamental misalignment with professional diagnostic cognition. Here we introduce ClinMPO, a reinforcement learning framework designed to align the internal reasoning of LLMs with professional psychiatric practice. The framework employs a specialized reward model trained independently on a dataset derived from 4,474 psychiatry journal articles and structured according to evidence-based medicine principles. We evaluated ClinMPO on a unseen subset of the benchmark designed to isolate reasoning capabilities from rote memorization. This test set comprises items where leading large-parameter LLMs consistently fail. We compared the ClinMPO-aligned light LLM performance against a cohort of 300 medical students. The ClinMPO-tuned Qwen3-8B model achieved a diagnostic accuracy of 31.4% and surpassed the human benchmark of 30.8% on these complex cases. These results demonstrate that medical evidence-guided optimization enables light-parameter LLMs to master complex reasoning tasks. Our findings suggest that explicit cognitive alignment offers a scalable pathway to reliable and safe psychiatric decision support.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Detecting deepfakes has become increasingly challenging as forgery faces synthesized by AI-generated methods, particularly diffusion models, achieve unprecedented quality and resolution. Existing forgery detection approaches relying on spatial and frequency features demonstrate limited efficacy against high-quality, entirely synthesized forgeries. In this paper, we propose a novel detection method grounded in the observation that facial attributes governed by complex physical laws and multiple parameters are inherently difficult to replicate. Specifically, we focus on illumination, particularly the specular reflection component in the Phong illumination model, which poses the greatest replication challenge due to its parametric complexity and nonlinear formulation. We introduce a fast and accurate face texture estimation method based on Retinex theory to enable precise specular reflection separation. Furthermore, drawing from the mathematical formulation of specular reflection, we posit that forgery evidence manifests not only in the specular reflection itself but also in its relationship with corresponding face texture and direct light. To address this issue, we design the Specular-Reflection-Inconsistency-Network (SRI-Net), incorporating a two-stage cross-attention mechanism to capture these correlations and integrate specular reflection related features with image features for robust forgery detection. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance on both traditional deepfake datasets and generative deepfake datasets, particularly those containing diffusion-generated forgery faces.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Training stability remains a critical bottleneck for Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), often manifesting as a trade-off between reasoning plasticity and general capability retention. We identify a root cause as the geometric conflict between plasticity and stability gradients, which leads to destructive interference. Crucially, we argue that deterministic projection methods are suboptimal for GRPO as they overlook the intrinsic stochasticity of group-based gradient estimates. To address this, we propose Probabilistic Conflict Resolution (PCR), a Bayesian framework that models gradients as random variables. PCR dynamically arbitrates conflicts via an uncertainty-aware ``soft projection'' mechanism, optimizing the signal-to-noise ratio. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PCR significantly smooths the training trajectory and achieves superior performance in various reasoning tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Masked diffusion language models generate by iteratively filling masked tokens over multiple denoising steps, so learning only from a terminal reward on the final completion yields coarse credit assignment over intermediate decisions. We propose DiSPO (Diffusion-State Policy Optimization), a plug-in credit-assignment layer that directly optimizes intermediate filling decisions. At selected intermediate masked states, DiSPO branches by resampling fillings for the currently masked positions from rollout-cached logits, scores the resulting completions, and updates only the newly filled tokens -- without additional multi-step diffusion rollouts. We formalize a fixed-state objective for branched completions and derive a policy-gradient estimator that can be combined with terminal-feedback policy optimization using the same rollouts. On LLaDA-8B-Instruct, DiSPO consistently improves over the terminal-feedback diffu-GRPO baseline on math and planning benchmarks under matched rollout compute and optimizer steps.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Scaling training data and model parameters has long driven progress in large language models (LLMs), but this paradigm is increasingly constrained by the scarcity of high-quality data and diminishing returns from rising computational costs. As a result, recent work is increasing the focus on continual learning from real-world deployment, where user interaction logs provide a rich source of authentic human feedback and procedural knowledge. However, learning from user logs is challenging due to their unstructured and noisy nature. Vanilla LLM systems often struggle to distinguish useful feedback signals from noisy user behavior, and the disparity between user log collection and model optimization (e.g., the off-policy optimization problem) further strengthens the problem. To this end, we propose UNO (User log-driveN Optimization), a unified framework for improving LLM systems (LLMsys) with user logs. UNO first distills logs into semi-structured rules and preference pairs, then employs query-and-feedback-driven clustering to manage data heterogeneity, and finally quantifies the cognitive gap between the model's prior knowledge and the log data. This assessment guides the LLMsys to adaptively filter out noisy feedback and construct different modules for primary and reflective experiences extracted from user logs, thereby improving future responses. Extensive experiments show that UNO achieves state-of-the-art effectiveness and efficiency, significantly outperforming Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and memory-based baselines.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Dense Transformer language models have largely adhered to one consistent architectural shape: each layer consists of an attention module followed by a feed-forward network (FFN) with a narrow-wide-narrow MLP, allocating most parameters to the MLP at expansion ratios between 2 and 4. Motivated by recent results that residual wide-narrow-wide (hourglass) MLPs offer superior function approximation capabilities, we revisit the long-standing MLP shape convention in Transformer, challenging the necessity of the narrow-wide-narrow design. To study this, we develop a Transformer variant that replaces the conventional FFN with a deeper hourglass-shaped FFN, comprising a stack of hourglass sub-MLPs connected by residual pathways. We posit that a deeper but lighter hourglass FFN can serve as a competitive alternative to the conventional FFN, and that parameters saved by using a lighter hourglass FFN can be more effectively utilized, such as by enlarging model hidden dimensions under fixed budgets. We confirm these through empirical validations across model scales: hourglass FFNs outperform conventional FFNs up to 400M and achieve comparable performance at larger scales to 1B parameters; hourglass FFN variants with reduced FFN and increased attention parameters show consistent improvements over conventional configurations at matched budgets. Together, these findings shed new light on recent work and prompt a rethinking of the narrow-wide-narrow MLP convention and the balance between attention and FFN towards efficient and expressive modern language models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Foundation object detectors such as GLIP and Grounding DINO excel on general-domain data but often degrade in specialized and data-scarce settings like underwater imagery or industrial defects. Typical cross-domain few-shot approaches rely on fine-tuning scarce target data, incurring cost and overfitting risks. We instead ask: Can a frozen detector adapt with only one exemplar per class without training? To answer this, we introduce training-free one-shot domain generalization for object detection, where detectors must adapt to specialized domains with only one annotated exemplar per class and no weight updates. To tackle this task, we propose LAB-Det, which exploits Language As a domain-invariant Bridge. Instead of adapting visual features, we project each exemplar into a descriptive text that conditions and guides a frozen detector. This linguistic conditioning replaces gradient-based adaptation, enabling robust generalization in data-scarce domains. We evaluate on UODD (underwater) and NEU-DET (industrial defects), two widely adopted benchmarks for data-scarce detection, where object boundaries are often ambiguous, and LAB-Det achieves up to 5.4 mAP improvement over state-of-the-art fine-tuned baselines without updating a single parameter. These results establish linguistic adaptation as an efficient and interpretable alternative to fine-tuning in specialized detection settings.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex tasks with advances in reasoning capabilities. However, existing reward mechanisms remain tightly coupled to final correctness and pay little attention to the underlying reasoning process: trajectories with sound reasoning but wrong answers receive low credit, while lucky guesses with flawed logic may be highly rewarded, affecting reasoning generalization. From a causal perspective, we interpret multi-candidate reasoning for a fixed question as a family of counterfactual experiments with theoretical supports. Building on this, we propose Group Causal Counterfactual Policy Optimization to explicitly train LLMs to learn generalizable reasoning patterns. It proposes an episodic causal counterfactual reward that jointly captures (i) robustness, encouraging the answer distribution induced by a reasoning step to remain stable under counterfactual perturbations; and (ii) effectiveness, enforcing sufficient variability so that the learned reasoning strategy can transfer across questions. We then construct token-level advantages from this reward and optimize the policy, encouraging LLMs to favor reasoning patterns that are process-valid and counterfactually robust. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate its advantages.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Feedforward models for novel view synthesis (NVS) have recently advanced by transformer-based methods like LVSM, using attention among all input and target views. In this work, we argue that its full self-attention design is suboptimal, suffering from quadratic complexity with respect to the number of input views and rigid parameter sharing among heterogeneous tokens. We propose Efficient-LVSM, a dual-stream architecture that avoids these issues with a decoupled co-refinement mechanism. It applies intra-view self-attention for input views and self-then-cross attention for target views, eliminating unnecessary computation. Efficient-LVSM achieves 29.86 dB PSNR on RealEstate10K with 2 input views, surpassing LVSM by 0.2 dB, with 2x faster training convergence and 4.4x faster inference speed. Efficient-LVSM achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to unseen view counts, and enables incremental inference with KV-cache, thanks to its decoupled designs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While Domain Adaptive Object Detection (DAOD) has made significant strides, most methods rely on unlabeled target data that is assumed to contain sufficient foreground instances. However, in many practical scenarios (e.g., wildlife monitoring, lesion detection), collecting target domain data with objects of interest is prohibitively costly, whereas background-only data is abundant. This common practical constraint introduces a significant technical challenge: the difficulty of achieving domain alignment when target instances are unavailable, forcing adaptation to rely solely on the target background information. We formulate this challenge as the novel problem of Instance-Free Domain Adaptive Object Detection. To tackle this, we propose the Relational and Structural Consistency Network (RSCN) which pioneers an alignment strategy based on background feature prototypes while simultaneously encouraging consistency in the relationship between the source foreground features and the background features within each domain, enabling robust adaptation even without target instances. To facilitate research, we further curate three specialized benchmarks, including simulative auto-driving detection, wildlife detection, and lung nodule detection. Extensive experiments show that RSCN significantly outperforms existing DAOD methods across all three benchmarks in the instance-free scenario. The code and benchmarks will be released soon.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Inference-time reasoning scaling has significantly advanced the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex problem-solving. A prevalent approach involves external search guided by Process Reward Models (PRMs). However, a fundamental limitation of this framework is the epistemic uncertainty of PRMs when evaluating reasoning paths that deviate from their training distribution. In this work, we conduct a systematic analysis of this challenge. We first provide empirical evidence that PRMs exhibit high uncertainty and unreliable scoring on out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. We then establish a theoretical framework proving that while standard search incurs linear regret accumulation, an uncertainty-aware strategy can achieve sublinear regret. Motivated by these findings, we propose Uncertainty-Aware Tree Search (UATS), a unified method that estimates uncertainty via Monte Carlo Dropout and dynamically allocates compute budget using a reinforcement learning-based controller. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the impact of OOD errors.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In modern interior design, the generation of personalized spaces frequently necessitates a delicate balance between rigid architectural structural constraints and specific stylistic preferences. However, existing multi-condition generative frameworks often struggle to harmonize these inputs, leading to "condition conflicts" where stylistic attributes inadvertently compromise the geometric precision of the layout. To address this challenge, we present DreamHome-Pano, a controllable panoramic generation framework designed for high-fidelity interior synthesis. Our approach introduces a Prompt-LLM that serves as a semantic bridge, effectively translating layout constraints and style references into professional descriptive prompts to achieve precise cross-modal alignment. To safeguard architectural integrity during the generative process, we develop a Conflict-Free Control architecture that incorporates structural-aware geometric priors and a multi-condition decoupling strategy, effectively suppressing stylistic interference from eroding the spatial layout. Furthermore, we establish a comprehensive panoramic interior benchmark alongside a multi-stage training pipeline, encompassing progressive Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). Experimental results demonstrate that DreamHome-Pano achieves a superior balance between aesthetic quality and structural consistency, offering a robust and professional-grade solution for panoramic interior visualization.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, defense, attack, extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (Graph RAG) is increasingly deployed to support LLM applications by augmenting user queries with structured knowledge retrieved from a knowledge graph. While Graph RAG improves relational reasoning, it introduces a largely understudied threat: adversaries can reconstruct subgraphs from a target RAG system's knowledge graph, enabling privacy inference and replication of curated knowledge assets. We show that existing attacks are largely ineffective against Graph RAG even with simple prompt-based safeguards, because these attacks expose explicit exfiltration intent and are therefore easily suppressed by lightweight safe prompts. We identify three technical challenges for practical Graph RAG extraction under realistic safeguards and introduce GRASP, a closed-box, multi-turn subgraph reconstruction attack. GRASP (i) reframes extraction as a context-processing task, (ii) enforces format-compliant, instance-grounded outputs via per-record identifiers to reduce hallucinations and preserve relational details, and (iii) diversifies goal-driven attack queries using a momentum-aware scheduler to operate within strict query budgets. Across two real-world knowledge graphs, four safety-aligned LLMs, and multiple Graph RAG frameworks, GRASP attains the strongest type-faithful reconstruction where prior methods fail, reaching up to 82.9 F1. We further evaluate defenses and propose two lightweight mitigations that substantially reduce reconstruction fidelity without utility loss.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Scaling inference methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo to high-dimensional models remains a central challenge in Bayesian deep learning. A promising recent proposal, microcanonical Langevin Monte Carlo, has shown state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of problems. However, its reliance on full-dataset gradients makes it prohibitively expensive for large-scale problems. This paper addresses a fundamental question: Can microcanonical dynamics effectively leverage mini-batch gradient noise? We provide the first systematic study of this problem, establishing a novel continuous-time theoretical analysis of stochastic-gradient microcanonical dynamics. We reveal two critical failure modes: a theoretically derived bias due to anisotropic gradient noise and numerical instabilities in complex high-dimensional posteriors. To tackle these issues, we propose a principled gradient noise preconditioning scheme shown to significantly reduce this bias and develop a novel, energy-variance-based adaptive tuner that automates step size selection and dynamically informs numerical guardrails. The resulting algorithm is a robust and scalable microcanonical Monte Carlo sampler that achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging high-dimensional inference tasks like Bayesian neural networks. Combined with recent ensemble techniques, our work unlocks a new class of stochastic microcanonical Langevin ensemble (SMILE) samplers for large-scale Bayesian inference.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Converting raster floorplans into engineering-grade vector graphics is challenging due to complex topology and strict geometric constraints. To address this, we present FloorplanVLM, a unified framework that reformulates floorplan vectorization as an image-conditioned sequence modeling task. Unlike pixel-based methods that rely on fragile heuristics or query-based transformers that generate fragmented rooms, our model directly outputs structured JSON sequences representing the global topology. This 'pixels-to-sequence' paradigm enables the precise and holistic constraint satisfaction of complex geometries, such as slanted walls and curved arcs. To support this data-hungry approach, we introduce a scalable data engine: we construct a large-scale dataset (Floorplan-2M) and a high-fidelity subset (Floorplan-HQ-300K) to balance geometric diversity and pixel-level precision. We then employ a progressive training strategy, using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for structural grounding and quality annealing, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for strict geometric alignment. To standardize evaluation on complex layouts, we establish and open-source FPBench-2K. Evaluated on this rigorous benchmark, FloorplanVLM demonstrates exceptional structural validity, achieving $\textbf{92.52%}$ external-wall IoU and robust generalization across non-Manhattan architectures.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems (MAS) show strong promise for complex reasoning, planning, and tool-augmented tasks, but designing effective MAS architectures remains labor-intensive, brittle, and hard to generalize. Existing automatic MAS generation methods either rely on code generation, which often leads to executability and robustness failures, or impose rigid architectural templates that limit expressiveness and adaptability. We propose Evolutionary Generation of Multi-Agent Systems (EvoMAS), which formulates MAS generation as structured configuration generation. EvoMAS performs evolutionary generation in configuration space. Specifically, EvoMAS selects initial configurations from a pool, applies feedback-conditioned mutation and crossover guided by execution traces, and iteratively refines both the candidate pool and an experience memory. We evaluate EvoMAS on diverse benchmarks, including BBEH, SWE-Bench, and WorkBench, covering reasoning, software engineering, and tool-use tasks. EvoMAS consistently improves task performance over both human-designed MAS and prior automatic MAS generation methods, while producing generated systems with higher executability and runtime robustness. EvoMAS outperforms the agent evolution method EvoAgent by +10.5 points on BBEH reasoning and +7.1 points on WorkBench. With Claude-4.5-Sonnet, EvoMAS also reaches 79.1% on SWE-Bench-Verified, matching the top of the leaderboard.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present new auditors to assess Differential Privacy (DP) of an algorithm based on output samples. Such empirical auditors are common to check for algorithmic correctness and implementation bugs. Most existing auditors are batch-based or targeted toward the traditional notion of $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-DP; typically both. In this work, we shift the focus to the highly expressive privacy concept of $f$-DP, in which the entire privacy behavior is captured by a single tradeoff curve. Our auditors detect violations across the full privacy spectrum with statistical significance guarantees, which are supported by theory and simulations. Most importantly, and in contrast to prior work, our auditors do not require a user-specified sample size as an input. Rather, they adaptively determine a near-optimal number of samples needed to reach a decision, thereby avoiding the excessively large sample sizes common in many auditing studies. This reduction in sampling cost becomes especially beneficial for expensive training procedures such as DP-SGD. Our method supports both whitebox and blackbox settings and can also be executed in single-run frameworks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Human Activity Recognition (HAR) on resource constrained wearables requires models that balance accuracy against strict memory and computational budgets. State of the art lightweight architectures such as TinierHAR (34K parameters) and TinyHAR (55K parameters) achieve strong accuracy, but exceed memory budgets of microcontrollers with limited SRAM once operating system overhead is considered. We present MicroBi-ConvLSTM, an ultra-lightweight convolutional-recurrent architecture achieving 11.4K parameters on average through two stage convolutional feature extraction with 4x temporal pooling and a single bidirectional LSTM layer. This represents 2.9x parameter reduction versus TinierHAR and 11.9x versus DeepConvLSTM while preserving linear O(N) complexity. Evaluation across eight diverse HAR benchmarks shows that MicroBi-ConvLSTM maintains competitive performance within the ultra-lightweight regime: 93.41% macro F1 on UCI-HAR, 94.46% on SKODA assembly gestures, and 88.98% on Daphnet gait freeze detection. Systematic ablation reveals task dependent component contributions where bidirectionality benefits episodic event detection, but provides marginal gains on periodic locomotion. INT8 post training quantization incurs only 0.21% average F1-score degradation, yielding a 23.0 KB average deployment footprint suitable for memory constrained edge devices.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Information retrieval (IR) evaluation remains challenging due to incomplete IR benchmark datasets that contain unlabeled relevant chunks. While LLMs and LLM-human hybrid strategies reduce costly human effort, they remain prone to LLM overconfidence and ineffective AI-to-human escalation. To address this, we propose DREAM, a multi-round debate-based relevance assessment framework with LLM agents, built on opposing initial stances and iterative reciprocal critique. Through our agreement-based debate, it yields more accurate labeling for certain cases and more reliable AI-to-human escalation for uncertain ones, achieving 95.2% labeling accuracy with only 3.5% human involvement. Using DREAM, we build BRIDGE, a refined benchmark that mitigates evaluation bias and enables fairer retriever comparison by uncovering 29,824 missing relevant chunks. We then re-benchmark IR systems and extend evaluation to RAG, showing that unaddressed holes not only distort retriever rankings but also drive retrieval-generation misalignment. The relevance assessment framework is available at https: //github.com/DISL-Lab/DREAM-ICLR-26; and the BRIDGE dataset is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Remote sensing change detection plays a pivotal role in domains such as environmental monitoring, urban planning, and disaster assessment. However, existing methods typically rely on predefined categories and large-scale pixel-level annotations, which limit their generalization and applicability in open-world scenarios. To address these limitations, this paper proposes AdaptOVCD, a training-free Open-Vocabulary Change Detection (OVCD) architecture based on dual-dimensional multi-level information fusion. The framework integrates multi-level information fusion across data, feature, and decision levels vertically while incorporating targeted adaptive designs horizontally, achieving deep synergy among heterogeneous pre-trained models to effectively mitigate error propagation. Specifically, (1) at the data level, Adaptive Radiometric Alignment (ARA) fuses radiometric statistics with original texture features and synergizes with SAM-HQ to achieve radiometrically consistent segmentation; (2) at the feature level, Adaptive Change Thresholding (ACT) combines global difference distributions with edge structure priors and leverages DINOv3 to achieve robust change detection; (3) at the decision level, Adaptive Confidence Filtering (ACF) integrates semantic confidence with spatial constraints and collaborates with DGTRS-CLIP to achieve high-confidence semantic identification. Comprehensive evaluations across nine scenarios demonstrate that AdaptOVCD detects arbitrary category changes in a zero-shot manner, significantly outperforming existing training-free methods. Meanwhile, it achieves 84.89\% of the fully-supervised performance upper bound in cross-dataset evaluations and exhibits superior generalization capabilities.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid advancement of AI-Generated Content (AIGC) technologies poses significant challenges for authenticity assessment. However, existing evaluation protocols largely overlook anti-forensics attack, failing to ensure the comprehensive robustness of state-of-the-art AIGC detectors in real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we propose ForgeryEraser, a framework designed to execute universal anti-forensics attack without access to the target AIGC detectors. We reveal an adversarial vulnerability stemming from the systemic reliance on Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as shared backbones (e.g., CLIP), where downstream AIGC detectors inherit the feature space of these publicly accessible models. Instead of traditional logit-based optimization, we design a multi-modal guidance loss to drive forged image embeddings within the VLM feature space toward text-derived authentic anchors to erase forgery traces, while repelling them from forgery anchors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ForgeryEraser causes substantial performance degradation to advanced AIGC detectors on both global synthesis and local editing benchmarks. Moreover, ForgeryEraser induces explainable forensic models to generate explanations consistent with authentic images for forged images. Our code will be made publicly available.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, attack, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Machine Learning (ML) models, including Large Language Models (LLMs), are characterized by a range of system-level attributes such as security and reliability. Recent studies have demonstrated that ML models are vulnerable to multiple forms of security violations, among which backdoor data-poisoning attacks represent a particularly insidious threat, enabling unauthorized model behavior and systematic misclassification. In parallel, deficiencies in model reliability can manifest as hallucinations in LLMs, leading to unpredictable outputs and substantial risks for end users. In this work on Dependable Artificial Intelligence with Reliability and Security (DAIReS), we propose a novel unified approach based on Syndrome Decoding for the detection of both security and reliability violations in learning-based systems. Specifically, we adapt the syndrome decoding approach to the NLP sentence-embedding space, enabling the discrimination of poisoned and non-poisoned samples within ML training datasets. Additionally, the same methodology can effectively detect hallucinated content due to self referential meta explanation tasks in LLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, attack, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Automated detection of cyber attacks is a critical capability to counteract the growing volume and sophistication of cyber attacks. However, the high numbers of security alerts issued by intrusion detection systems lead to alert fatigue among analysts working in security operations centres (SOC), which in turn causes slow reaction time and incorrect decision making. Alert grouping, which refers to clustering of security alerts according to their underlying causes, can significantly reduce the number of distinct items analysts have to consider. Unfortunately, conventional time-based alert grouping solutions are unsuitable for large scale computer networks characterised by high levels of false positive alerts and simultaneously occurring attacks. To address these limitations, we propose AlertBERT, a self-supervised framework designed to group alerts from isolated or concurrent attacks in noisy environments. Thereby, our open-source implementation of AlertBERT leverages masked-language-models and density-based clustering to support both real-time or forensic operation. To evaluate our framework, we further introduce a novel data augmentation method that enables flexible control over noise levels and simulates concurrent attack occurrences. Based on the data sets generated through this method, we demonstrate that AlertBERT consistently outperforms conventional time-based grouping techniques, achieving superior accuracy in identifying correct alert groups.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Third-party agent skills extend LLM-based agents with instruction files and executable code that run on users' machines. Skills execute with user privileges and are distributed through community registries with minimal vetting, but no ground-truth dataset exists to characterize the resulting threats. We construct the first labeled dataset of malicious agent skills by behaviorally verifying 98,380 skills from two community registries, confirming 157 malicious skills with 632 vulnerabilities. These attacks are not incidental. Malicious skills average 4.03 vulnerabilities across a median of three kill chain phases, and the ecosystem has split into two archetypes: Data Thieves that exfiltrate credentials through supply chain techniques, and Agent Hijackers that subvert agent decision-making through instruction manipulation. A single actor accounts for 54.1\% of confirmed cases through templated brand impersonation. Shadow features, capabilities absent from public documentation, appear in 0\% of basic attacks but 100\% of advanced ones; several skills go further by exploiting the AI platform's own hook system and permission flags. Responsible disclosure led to 93.6\% removal within 30 days. We release the dataset and analysis pipeline to support future work on agent skill security.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generalizing from limited data is particularly critical for models in domains such as material science, where task-relevant features in experimental datasets are often heavily confounded by measurement noise and experimental artifacts. Standard regularization techniques fail to precisely separate meaningful features from noise, while existing adversarial adaptation methods are limited by their reliance on explicit separation labels. To address this challenge, we propose the Adversarial Information Separation Framework (AdverISF), which isolates task-relevant features from noise without requiring explicit supervision. AdverISF introduces a self-supervised adversarial mechanism to enforce statistical independence between task-relevant features and noise representations. It further employs a multi-layer separation architecture that progressively recycles noise information across feature hierarchies to recover features inadvertently discarded as noise, thereby enabling finer-grained feature extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AdverISF outperforms state-of-the-art methods in data-scarce scenarios. In addition, evaluations on real-world material design tasks show that it achieves superior generalization performance.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Reliable benchmarking is critical for advancing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, as it reveals their generalization, robustness, and alignment of perception with language-driven manipulation tasks. However, existing benchmarks often provide limited or misleading assessments due to insufficient evaluation protocols that inadequately capture real-world distribution shifts. This work systematically rethinks VLA benchmarking from both evaluation and data perspectives, introducing LIBERO-X, a benchmark featuring: 1) A hierarchical evaluation protocol with progressive difficulty levels targeting three core capabilities: spatial generalization, object recognition, and task instruction understanding. This design enables fine-grained analysis of performance degradation under increasing environmental and task complexity; 2) A high-diversity training dataset collected via human teleoperation, where each scene supports multiple fine-grained manipulation objectives to bridge the train-evaluation distribution gap. Experiments with representative VLA models reveal significant performance drops under cumulative perturbations, exposing persistent limitations in scene comprehension and instruction grounding. By integrating hierarchical evaluation with diverse training data, LIBERO-X offers a more reliable foundation for assessing and advancing VLA development.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MRI is a non-invasive imaging modality for detecting metabolites. It offers higher resolution and sensitivity compared to conventional magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). However, quantification of CEST data is challenging because the measured signal results from a complex interplay of many physiological variables. Here, we introduce a transformer-based neural network to fit parameters such as metabolite concentrations, exchange and relaxation rates of a physical model derived from Bloch-McConnell equations to in-vitro CEST spectra. We show that our self-supervised trained neural network clearly outperforms the solution of classical gradient-based solver.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) are rising in popularity for all kinds of applications. To safely use CVNNs in practice, analyzing their robustness against outliers is crucial. One well known technique to understand the behavior of deep neural networks is to investigate their behavior under adversarial attacks, which can be seen as worst case minimal perturbations. We design Phase Attacks, a kind of attack specifically targeting the phase information of complex-valued inputs. Additionally, we derive complex-valued versions of commonly used adversarial attacks. We show that in some scenarios CVNNs are more robust than RVNNs and that both are very susceptible to phase changes with the Phase Attacks decreasing the model performance more, than equally strong regular attacks, which can attack both phase and magnitude.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Adversarial attacks against deep neural networks are commonly constructed under $\ell_p$ norm constraints, most often using $p=1$, $p=2$ or $p=\infty$, and potentially regularized for specific demands such as sparsity or smoothness. These choices are typically made without a systematic investigation of how the norm parameter \( p \) influences the structural and perceptual properties of adversarial perturbations. In this work, we study how the choice of \( p \) affects sparsity and smoothness of adversarial attacks generated under \( \ell_p \) norm constraints for values of $p \in [1,2]$. To enable a quantitative analysis, we adopt two established sparsity measures from the literature and introduce three smoothness measures. In particular, we propose a general framework for deriving smoothness measures based on smoothing operations and additionally introduce a smoothness measure based on first-order Taylor approximations. Using these measures, we conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation across multiple real-world image datasets and a diverse set of model architectures, including both convolutional and transformer-based networks. We show that the choice of $\ell_1$ or $\ell_2$ is suboptimal in most cases and the optimal $p$ value is dependent on the specific task. In our experiments, using $\ell_p$ norms with $p\in [1.3, 1.5]$ yields the best trade-off between sparse and smooth attacks. These findings highlight the importance of principled norm selection when designing and evaluating adversarial attacks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Standard chain-of-thought reasoning generates a solution in a single forward pass, committing irrevocably to each token and lacking a mechanism to recover from early errors. We introduce Inference-Time Rethinking, a generative framework that enables iterative self-correction by decoupling declarative latent thought vectors from procedural generation. We factorize reasoning into a continuous latent thought vector (what to reason about) and a decoder that verbalizes the trace conditioned on this vector (how to reason). Beyond serving as a declarative buffer, latent thought vectors compress the reasoning structure into a continuous representation that abstracts away surface-level token variability, making gradient-based optimization over reasoning strategies well-posed. Our prior model maps unstructured noise to a learned manifold of valid reasoning patterns, and at test time we employ a Gibbs-style procedure that alternates between generating a candidate trace and optimizing the latent vector to better explain that trace, effectively navigating the latent manifold to refine the reasoning strategy. Training a 0.2B-parameter model from scratch on GSM8K, our method with 30 rethinking iterations surpasses baselines with 10 to 15 times more parameters, including a 3B counterpart. This result demonstrates that effective mathematical reasoning can emerge from sophisticated inference-time computation rather than solely from massive parameter counts.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The task of establishing correspondences between two 3D shapes is a long-standing challenge in computer vision. While numerous studies address full-full and partial-full 3D shape matching, only a limited number of works have explored the partial-partial setting, very likely due to its unique challenges: we must compute accurate correspondences while at the same time find the unknown overlapping region. Nevertheless, partial-partial 3D shape matching reflects the most realistic setting, as in many real-world cases, such as 3D scanning, shapes are only partially observable. In this work, we introduce the first integer linear programming approach specifically designed to address the distinctive challenges of partial-partial shape matching. Our method leverages geometric consistency as a strong prior, enabling both robust estimation of the overlapping region and computation of neighbourhood-preserving correspondences. We empirically demonstrate that our approach achieves high-quality matching results both in terms of matching error and smoothness. Moreover, we show that our method is more scalable than previous formalisms.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Prototypical parts-based models offer a "this looks like that" paradigm for intrinsic interpretability, yet they typically struggle with ImageNet-scale generalization and often require computationally expensive backbone finetuning. Furthermore, existing methods frequently suffer from "prototype drift," where learned prototypes lack tangible grounding in the training distribution and change their activation under small perturbations. We present ProtoQuant, a novel architecture that achieves prototype stability and grounded interpretability through latent vector quantization. By constraining prototypes to a discrete learned codebook within the latent space, we ensure they remain faithful representations of the training data without the need to update the backbone. This design allows ProtoQuant to function as an efficient, interpretable head that scales to large-scale datasets. We evaluate ProtoQuant on ImageNet and several fine-grained benchmarks (CUB-200, Cars-196). Our results demonstrate that ProtoQuant achieves competitive classification accuracy while generalizing to ImageNet and comparable interpretability metrics to other prototypical-parts-based methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, transformer, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While generative modeling on time series facilitates more capable and flexible probabilistic forecasting, existing generative time series models do not address the multi-dimensional properties of time series data well. The prevalent architecture of Diffusion Transformers (DiT), which relies on simplistic conditioning controls and a single-stream Transformer backbone, tends to underutilize cross-variate dependencies in covariate-aware forecasting. Inspired by Multimodal Diffusion Transformers that integrate textual guidance into video generation, we propose Diffusion Transformers for Time Series (DiTS), a general-purpose architecture that frames endogenous and exogenous variates as distinct modalities. To better capture both inter-variate and intra-variate dependencies, we design a dual-stream Transformer block tailored for time-series data, comprising a Time Attention module for autoregressive modeling along the temporal dimension and a Variate Attention module for cross-variate modeling. Unlike the common approach for images, which flattens 2D token grids into 1D sequences, our design leverages the low-rank property inherent in multivariate dependencies, thereby reducing computational costs. Experiments show that DiTS achieves state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks, regardless of the presence of future exogenous variate observations, demonstrating unique generative forecasting strengths over traditional deterministic deep forecasting models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, privacy, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper presents a survey of state-of-the-art trust models for Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs). Trust management plays an essential role in isolating malicious insider attacks in VANETs which traditional security approaches fail to thwart. To this end, many trust models are presented; some of them only address trust management, while others address security and privacy aspects besides trust management. This paper first reviews, classifies, and summarizes state-of-the-art trust models, and then compares their achievements. From this literature survey, our reader will easily identify two broad classes of trust models that exist in literature, differing primarily in their evaluation point. For example, most trust models follow receiver-side trust evaluation and to the best of our knowledge, there is only one trust model for VANETs which evaluates trust at the sender-side unless a dispute arises. In the presence of a dispute, a Roadside Unit (RSU) rules on the validity of an event. In receiver-side trust models, each receiver becomes busy while computing the trust of a sender and its messages upon the messages' arrival. Conversely, in the sender-side class, receivers are free from any kind of computation as the trust is verified at the time the message is announced. Also, vehicles can quickly act on the information, such as taking a detour to an alternate route, as it supports fast decision-making. We provide a comparison between these two evaluation techniques using a sequence diagram. We then conclude the survey by suggesting future work for sender-side evaluation of trust in VANETs. Additionally, the challenges (real-time constraints and efficiency) are emphasized whilst considering the deployment of a trust model in VANETs</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Background: High-level system testing of applications that use data from e-Government services as input requires test data that is real-life-like but where the privacy of personal information is guaranteed. Applications with such strong requirement include information exchange between countries, medicine, banking, etc. This review aims to synthesize the current state-of-the-practice in this domain. Objectives: The objective of this Systematic Review is to identify existing approaches for creating and evolving synthetic test data without using real-life raw data. Methods: We followed well-known methodologies for conducting systematic literature reviews, including the ones from Kitchenham as well as guidelines for analysing the limitations of our review and its threats to validity. Results: A variety of methods and tools exist for creating privacy-preserving test data. Our search found 1,013 publications in IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, and SCOPUS. We extracted data from 75 of those publications and identified 37 approaches that answer our research question partly. A common prerequisite for using these methods and tools is direct access to real-life data for data anonymization or synthetic test data generation. Nine existing synthetic test data generation approaches were identified that were closest to answering our research question. Nevertheless, further work would be needed to add the ability to evolve synthetic test data to the existing approaches. Conclusions: None of the publications really covered our requirements completely, only partially. Synthetic test data evolution is a field that has not received much attention from researchers but needs to be explored in Digital Government Solutions, especially since new legal regulations are being placed in force in many countries.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Accurate prediction of outcomes is crucial for clinical decision-making and personalized patient care. Supervised machine learning algorithms, which are commonly used for outcome prediction in the medical domain, optimize for predictive accuracy, which can result in models latching onto spurious correlations instead of robust predictors. Causal structure learning methods on the other hand have the potential to provide robust predictors for the target, but can be too conservative because of algorithmic and data assumptions, resulting in loss of diagnostic precision. Therefore, we propose a novel model-agnostic regularization strategy, Adaptive-CaRe, for generalized outcome prediction in the medical domain. Adaptive-CaRe strikes a balance between both predictive value and causal robustness by incorporating a penalty that is proportional to the difference between the estimated statistical contribution and estimated causal contribution of the input features for model predictions. Our experiments on synthetic data establish the efficacy of the proposed Adaptive-CaRe regularizer in finding robust predictors for the target while maintaining competitive predictive accuracy. With experiments on a standard causal benchmark, we provide a blueprint for navigating the trade-off between predictive accuracy and causal robustness by tweaking the regularization strength, $\lambda$. Validation using real-world dataset confirms that the results translate to practical, real-domain settings. Therefore, Adaptive-CaRe provides a simple yet effective solution to the long-standing trade-off between predictive accuracy and causal robustness in the medical domain. Future work would involve studying alternate causal structure learning frameworks and complex classification models to provide deeper insights at a larger scale.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As Low Earth Orbit (LEO) become mega-constellations critical infrastructure, attacks targeting them have grown in number and range. The security analysis of LEO constellations faces a fundamental paradigm gap: traditional topology-centric methods fail to capture systemic risks arising from dynamic load imbalances and high-order dependencies, which can transform localized failures into network-wide cascades. To address this, we propose HYDRA, a hypergraph-based dynamic risk analysis framework. Its core is a novel metric, Hyper-Bridge Centrality (HBC), which quantifies node criticality via a load-to-redundancy ratio within dependency structures. A primary challenge to resilience: the most critical vulnerabilities are not in the densely connected satellite core, but in the seemingly marginal ground-space interfaces. These are the system's "Black Swan" nodes--topologically peripheral yet structurally lethal. We validate this through extensive simulations using realistic StarLink TLE data and population-based gravity model. Experiments demonstrate that HBC consistently outperforms traditional metrics, identifying critical failure points that surpass the structural damage potential of even betweenness centrality. This work shifts the security paradigm from connectivity to structural stress, demonstrating that securing the network edge is paramount and necessitates a fundamental redesign of redundancy strategies.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vision Transformers (ViTs) have become a dominant architecture in computer vision, yet producing stable and high-resolution attribution maps for these models remains challenging. Architectural components such as patch embeddings and attention routing often introduce structured artifacts in pixel-level explanations, causing many existing methods to rely on coarse patch-level attributions. We introduce DAVE \textit{(\underline{D}istribution-aware \underline{A}ttribution via \underline{V}iT Gradient D\underline{E}composition)}, a mathematically grounded attribution method for ViTs based on a structured decomposition of the input gradient. By exploiting architectural properties of ViTs, DAVE isolates locally equivariant and stable components of the effective input--output mapping. It separates these from architecture-induced artifacts and other sources of instability.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, protect, defense, attack, robust, steal, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is increasingly deployed in real-world applications, where its reference-grounded design makes outputs appear trustworthy. This trust has spurred research on poisoning attacks that craft malicious content, inject it into knowledge sources, and manipulate RAG responses. However, when evaluated in practical RAG systems, existing attacks suffer from severely degraded effectiveness. This gap stems from two overlooked realities: (i) content is often processed before use, which can fragment the poison and weaken its effect, and (ii) users often do not issue the exact queries anticipated during attack design. These factors can lead practitioners to underestimate risks and develop a false sense of security. To better characterize the threat to practical systems, we present Confundo, a learning-to-poison framework that fine-tunes a large language model as a poison generator to achieve high effectiveness, robustness, and stealthiness. Confundo provides a unified framework supporting multiple attack objectives, demonstrated by manipulating factual correctness, inducing biased opinions, and triggering hallucinations. By addressing these overlooked challenges, Confundo consistently outperforms a wide range of purpose-built attacks across datasets and RAG configurations by large margins, even in the presence of defenses. Beyond exposing vulnerabilities, we also present a defensive use case that protects web content from unauthorized incorporation into RAG systems via scraping, with no impact on user experience.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Surgical phase recognition is a critical component for context-aware decision support in intelligent operating rooms, yet training robust models is hindered by limited annotated clinical videos and large domain gaps between synthetic and real surgical data. To address this, we propose CauCLIP, a causality-inspired vision-language framework that leverages CLIP to learn domain-invariant representations for surgical phase recognition without access to target domain data. Our approach integrates a frequency-based augmentation strategy to perturb domain-specific attributes while preserving semantic structures, and a causal suppression loss that mitigates non-causal biases and reinforces causal surgical features. These components are combined in a unified training framework that enables the model to focus on stable causal factors underlying surgical workflows. Experiments on the SurgVisDom hard adaptation benchmark demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms all competing approaches, highlighting the effectiveness of causality-guided vision-language models for domain-generalizable surgical video understanding.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful text generators, yet they can produce toxic or harmful content even when given seemingly harmless prompts. This presents a serious safety challenge and can cause real-world harm. Toxicity is often subtle and context-dependent, making it difficult to detect at the token level or through coarse sentence-level signals. Moreover, efforts to mitigate toxicity often face a trade-off between safety and the coherence, or fluency of the generated text. In this work, we present a targeted subspace intervention strategy for identifying and suppressing hidden toxic patterns from underlying model representations, while preserving overall ability to generate safe fluent content. On the RealToxicityPrompts, our method achieves strong mitigation performance compared to existing baselines, with minimal impact on inference complexity. Across multiple LLMs, our approach reduces toxicity of state-of-the-art detoxification systems by 8-20%, while maintaining comparable fluency. Through extensive quantitative and qualitative analyses, we show that our approach achieves effective toxicity reduction without impairing generative performance, consistently outperforming existing baselines.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Existing LLM-as-a-Judge systems suffer from three fundamental limitations: limited adaptivity to task- and domain-specific evaluation criteria, systematic biases driven by non-semantic cues such as position, length, format, and model provenance, and evaluation inconsistency that leads to contradictory judgments across different evaluation modes (e.g., pointwise versus pairwise). To address these issues, we propose FairJudge, an adaptive, debiased, and consistent LLM-as-a-Judge. Unlike prior approaches that treat the judge as a static evaluator, FairJudge models judging behavior itself as a learnable and regularized policy. From a data-centric perspective, we construct a high-information-density judging dataset that explicitly injects supervision signals aligned with evaluation behavior. Building on this dataset, we adopt a curriculum-style SFT-DPO-GRPO training paradigm that progressively aligns rubric adherence, bias mitigation, and cross-mode consistency, while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results on multiple internal and public benchmarks show that FairJudge consistently improves agreement and F1, reduces non-semantic biases, and outperforms substantially larger instruction-tuned LLMs. All resources will be publicly released after acceptance to facilitate future research.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Standard trust-region methods constrain policy updates via Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. However, KL controls only an average divergence and does not directly prevent rare, large likelihood-ratio excursions that destabilize training--precisely the failure mode that motivates heuristics such as PPO's clipping. We propose overlap geometry as an alternative trust region, constraining distributional overlap via the Bhattacharyya coefficient (closely related to the Hellinger/Renyi-1/2 geometry). This objective penalizes separation in the ratio tails, yielding tighter control over likelihood-ratio excursions without relying on total variation bounds that can be loose in tail regimes. We derive Bhattacharyya-TRPO (BTRPO) and Bhattacharyya-PPO (BPPO), enforcing overlap constraints via square-root ratio updates: BPPO clips the square-root ratio q = sqrt(r), and BTRPO applies a quadratic Hellinger/Bhattacharyya penalty. Empirically, overlap-based updates improve robustness and aggregate performance as measured by RLiable under matched training budgets, suggesting overlap constraints as a practical, principled alternative to KL for stable policy optimization.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>protect, defense, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Suffix-based jailbreak attacks append an adversarial suffix, i.e., a short token sequence, to steer aligned LLMs into unsafe outputs. Since suffixes are free-form text, they admit endlessly many surface forms, making jailbreak mitigation difficult. Most existing defenses depend on passive detection of suspicious suffixes, without leveraging the defender's inherent asymmetric ability to inject secrets and proactively conceal gaps. Motivated by this, we take a controllability-oriented perspective and develop a proactive defense that nudges attackers into a no-win dilemma: either they fall into defender-designed optimization traps and fail to produce an effective adversarial suffix, or they can succeed only by generating adversarial suffixes that carry distinctive, traceable fingerprints. We propose TrapSuffix, a lightweight fine-tuning approach that injects trap-aligned behaviors into the base model without changing the inference pipeline. TrapSuffix channels jailbreak attempts into these two outcomes by reshaping the model's response landscape to adversarial suffixes. Across diverse suffix-based jailbreak settings, TrapSuffix reduces the average attack success rate to below 0.01 percent and achieves an average tracing success rate of 87.9 percent, providing both strong defense and reliable traceability. It introduces no inference-time overhead and incurs negligible memory cost, requiring only 15.87 MB of additional memory on average, whereas state-of-the-art LLM-based detection defenses typically incur memory overheads at the 1e4 MB level, while composing naturally with existing filtering-based defenses for complementary protection.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Random Access Channel (RACH) jamming poses a critical security threat to 5G and beyond (B5G) networks. This paper presents an analytical model for predicting the impact of Msg1 jamming attacks on RACH performance. We use the OpenAirInterface (OAI) open-source user equipment (UE) to implement a Msg1 jamming attacker. Over-the-air experiments validate the accuracy of the proposed analytical model. The results show that low-power and stealthy Msg1 jamming can effectively block legitimate UE access in 5G/B5G systems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>defense, attack, robust, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Predictive confidence serves as a foundational control signal in mission-critical systems, directly governing risk-aware logic such as escalation, abstention, and conservative fallback. While prior federated learning attacks predominantly target accuracy or implant backdoors, we identify confidence calibration as a distinct attack objective. We present the Temperature Scaling Attack (TSA), a training-time attack that degrades calibration while preserving accuracy. By injecting temperature scaling with learning rate-temperature coupling during local training, malicious updates maintain benign-like optimization behavior, evading accuracy-based monitoring and similarity-based detection. We provide a convergence analysis under non-IID settings, showing that this coupling preserves standard convergence bounds while systematically distorting confidence. Across three benchmarks, TSA substantially shifts calibration (e.g., 145% error increase on CIFAR-100) with <2 accuracy change, and remains effective under robust aggregation and post-hoc calibration defenses. Case studies further show that confidence manipulation can cause up to 7.2x increases in missed critical cases (healthcare) or false alarms (autonomous driving), even when accuracy is unchanged. Overall, our results establish calibration integrity as a critical attack surface in federated learning.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Spoken content, such as online videos and podcasts, often spans multiple topics, which makes automatic topic segmentation essential for user navigation and downstream applications. However, current methods do not fully leverage acoustic features, leaving room for improvement. We propose a multi-modal approach that fine-tunes both a text encoder and a Siamese audio encoder, capturing acoustic cues around sentence boundaries. Experiments on a large-scale dataset of YouTube videos show substantial gains over text-only and multi-modal baselines. Our model also proves more resilient to ASR noise and outperforms a larger text-only baseline on three additional datasets in Portuguese, German, and English, underscoring the value of learned acoustic features for robust topic segmentation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) face a fundamental safety-helpfulness trade-off due to static, one-size-fits-all safety policies that lack runtime controllabilityxf, making it difficult to tailor responses to diverse application needs. %As a result, models may over-refuse benign requests or under-constrain harmful ones. We present \textbf{PACT} (Prompt-configured Action via Chain-of-Thought), a framework for dynamic safety control through explicit, risk-aware reasoning. PACT operates under a hierarchical policy architecture: a non-overridable global safety policy establishes immutable boundaries for critical risks (e.g., child safety, violent extremism), while user-defined policies can introduce domain-specific (non-global) risk categories and specify label-to-action behaviors to improve utility in real-world deployment settings. The framework decomposes safety decisions into structured Classify$\rightarrow$Act paths that route queries to the appropriate action (comply, guide, or reject) and render the decision-making process transparent. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PACT achieves near state-of-the-art safety performance under global policy evaluation while attaining the best controllability under user-specific policy evaluation, effectively mitigating the safety-helpfulness trade-off. We will release the PACT model suite, training data, and evaluation protocols to facilitate reproducible research in controllable safety alignment.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, security</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Over the last years, Ethereum has evolved into a public platform that safeguards the savings of hundreds of millions of people and secures more than $650 billion in assets, placing it among the top 25 stock exchanges worldwide in market capitalization, ahead of Singapore, Mexico, and Thailand. As such, the performance and security of the Ethereum blockchain are not only of theoretical interest, but also carry significant global economic implications. At the time of writing, the Ethereum platform is collectively secured by almost one million validators highlighting its decentralized nature and underlining its economic security guarantees. However, due to this large validator set, the protocol takes around 15 minutes to finalize a block which is prohibitively slow for many real world applications. This delay is largely driven by the cost of aggregating and disseminating signatures across a validator set of this scale. Furthermore, as we show in this paper, the existing protocol that is used to aggregate and disseminate the signatures has several shortcomings that can be exploited by adversaries to shift stake proportion from honest to adversarial nodes. In this paper, we introduce Wonderboom, the first million scale aggregation protocol that can efficiently aggregate the signatures of millions of validators in a single Ethereum slot (x32 faster) while offering higher security guarantees than the state of the art protocol used in Ethereum. Furthermore, to evaluate Wonderboom, we implement the first simulation tool that can simulate such a protocol on the million scale and show that even in the worst case Wonderboom can aggregate and verify more than 2 million signatures within a single Ethereum slot.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Post-training improves instruction-following and helpfulness of large language models (LLMs) but often reduces generation diversity, which leads to repetitive outputs in open-ended settings, a phenomenon known as mode collapse. Motivated by evidence that LLM layers play distinct functional roles, we hypothesize that mode collapse can be localized to specific layers and that restoring a carefully chosen range of layers to their pre-trained weights can recover diversity while maintaining high output quality. To validate this hypothesis and decide which layers to restore, we design a proxy task -- Constrained Random Character(CRC) -- with an explicit validity set and a natural diversity objective. Results on CRC reveal a clear diversity-validity trade-off across restoration ranges and identify configurations that increase diversity with minimal quality loss. Based on these findings, we propose Selective Layer Restoration (SLR), a training-free method that restores selected layers in a post-trained model to their pre-trained weights, yielding a hybrid model with the same architecture and parameter count, incurring no additional inference cost. Across three different tasks (creative writing, open-ended question answering, and multi-step reasoning) and three different model families (Llama, Qwen, and Gemma), we find SLR can consistently and substantially improve output diversity while maintaining high output quality.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) often show reduced performance, cultural alignment, and safety robustness in non-English languages, partly because English dominates both pre-training data and human preference alignment datasets. Training methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) require human preference data, which remains scarce and largely non-public for many languages beyond English. To address this gap, we introduce compar:IA, an open-source digital public service developed inside the French government and designed to collect large-scale human preference data from a predominantly French-speaking general audience. The platform uses a blind pairwise comparison interface to capture unconstrained, real-world prompts and user judgments across a diverse set of language models, while maintaining low participation friction and privacy-preserving automated filtering. As of 2026-02-07, compar:IA has collected over 600,000 free-form prompts and 250,000 preference votes, with approximately 89% of the data in French. We release three complementary datasets -- conversations, votes, and reactions -- under open licenses, and present initial analyses, including a French-language model leaderboard and user interaction patterns. Beyond the French context, compar:IA is evolving toward an international digital public good, offering reusable infrastructure for multilingual model training, evaluation, and the study of human-AI interaction.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in vulnerability detection. However, a critical reliability gap persists: models frequently yield correct detection verdicts based on hallucinated logic or superficial patterns that deviate from the actual root cause. This misalignment remains largely obscured because contemporary benchmarks predominantly prioritize coarse-grained classification metrics, lacking the granular ground truth required to evaluate the underlying reasoning process. To bridge this gap, we first construct a benchmark consisting of two datasets: (1) real-world vulnerabilities with expert-curated causal reasoning as ground truth, and (2) semantically equivalent code perturbations for assessing reasoning robustness. Our large-scale empirical study reveals that even state-of-the-art models struggle to maintain logical consistency during semantic code comprehension, exhibiting 12 systematic failure patterns. Addressing these limitations, we propose DAGVul, a novel framework that models vulnerability reasoning as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) generation task. Unlike linear chain-of-thought (CoT), our approach explicitly maps causal dependencies to enforce structural consistency. By further introducing Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), we align model reasoning trace with program-intrinsic logic. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework improves the reasoning F1-score by an average of 18.9% over all the baselines. Remarkably, our 8B-parameter implementation not only outperforms existing models of comparable scale but also surpasses specialized large-scale reasoning models, including Qwen3-30B-Reasoning and GPT-OSS-20B-High. It is even competitive with state-of-the-art models like Claude-Sonnet-4.5 (75.47% vs. 76.11%), establishing new efficiency in vulnerability reasoning across model scales.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Autoregressive generative PDE solvers can be accurate one step ahead yet drift over long rollouts, especially in coarse-to-fine regimes where each step must regenerate unresolved fine scales. This is the regime of diffusion and flow-matching generators: although their internal dynamics are Markovian, rollout stability is governed by per-step \emph{conditional law} errors. Using the Mori--Zwanzig projection formalism, we show that eliminating unresolved variables yields an exact resolved evolution with a Markov term, a memory term, and an orthogonal forcing, exposing a structural limitation of memoryless closures. Motivated by this, we introduce memory-conditioned diffusion/flow-matching with a compact online state injected into denoising via latent features. Via disintegration, memory induces a structured conditional tail prior for unresolved scales and reduces the transport needed to populate missing frequencies. We prove Wasserstein stability of the resulting conditional kernel. We then derive discrete Grönwall rollout bounds that separate memory approximation from conditional generation error. Experiments on compressible flows with shocks and multiscale mixing show improved accuracy and markedly more stable long-horizon rollouts, with better fine-scale spectral and statistical fidelity.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The groundbreaking capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for enhancing human-computer interaction through emotion-adaptive Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, deliberately controlling the sentiment in these systems remains challenging. The present study investigates the potential of prompt engineering for controlling sentiment in LLM-generated text, providing a resource-sensitive and accessible alternative to existing methods. Using Ekman's six basic emotions (e.g., joy, disgust), we examine various prompting techniques, including Zero-Shot and Chain-of-Thought prompting using gpt-3.5-turbo, and compare it to fine-tuning. Our results indicate that prompt engineering effectively steers emotions in AI-generated texts, offering a practical and cost-effective alternative to fine-tuning, especially in data-constrained settings. In this regard, Few-Shot prompting with human-written examples was the most effective among other techniques, likely due to the additional task-specific guidance. The findings contribute valuable insights towards developing emotion-adaptive AI systems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Weight-only quantization has become a standard approach for efficiently serving large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods fail to efficiently compress models to binary (1-bit) levels, as they either require large amounts of data and compute or incur additional storage. In this work, we propose NanoQuant, the first post-training quantization (PTQ) method to compress LLMs to both binary and sub-1-bit levels. NanoQuant formulates quantization as a low-rank binary factorization problem, and compresses full-precision weights to low-rank binary matrices and scales. Specifically, it utilizes an efficient alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) method to precisely initialize latent binary matrices and scales, and then tune the initialized parameters through a block and model reconstruction process. Consequently, NanoQuant establishes a new Pareto frontier in low-memory post-training quantization, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy even at sub-1-bit compression rates. NanoQuant makes large-scale deployment feasible on consumer hardware. For example, it compresses Llama2-70B by 25.8$\times$ in just 13 hours on a single H100, enabling a 70B model to operate on a consumer 8 GB GPU.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Incorporating group symmetries via equivariance into neural networks has emerged as a robust approach for overcoming the efficiency and data demands of modern deep learning. While most existing approaches, such as group convolutions and averaging-based methods, focus on compact, finite, or low-dimensional groups with linear actions, this work explores how equivariance can be extended to infinite-dimensional groups. We propose a strategy designed to induce diffeomorphism equivariance in pre-trained neural networks via energy-based canonicalisation. Formulating equivariance as an optimisation problem allows us to access the rich toolbox of already established differentiable image registration methods. Empirical results on segmentation and classification tasks confirm that our approach achieves approximate equivariance and generalises to unseen transformations without relying on extensive data augmentation or retraining.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, protect, attack, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Graph-structured data underpin a wide spectrum of modern applications. However, complex graph topologies and homophilic patterns can facilitate attribute inference attacks (AIAs) by enabling sensitive information leakage to propagate across local neighborhoods. Existing AIAs predominantly assume that adversaries can probe sensitive attributes through repeated model queries. Such assumptions are often impractical in real-world settings due to stringent data protection regulations, prohibitive query budgets, and heightened detection risks, especially when inferring multiple sensitive attributes. More critically, this model-centric perspective obscures a pervasive blind spot: \textbf{intrinsic multiple sensitive information leakage arising solely from publicly released graphs.} To exploit this unexplored vulnerability, we introduce a new attack paradigm and propose \textbf{Taipan, the first query-free transfer-based attack framework for multiple sensitive attribute inference attacks on graphs (G-MSAIAs).} Taipan integrates \emph{Hierarchical Attack Knowledge Routing} to capture intricate inter-attribute correlations, and \emph{Prompt-guided Attack Prototype Refinement} to mitigate negative transfer and performance degradation. We further present a systematic evaluation framework tailored to G-MSAIAs. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world graph datasets demonstrate that Taipan consistently achieves strong attack performance across same-distribution settings and heterogeneous similar- and out-of-distribution settings with mismatched feature dimensionalities, and remains effective even under rigorous differential privacy guarantees. Our findings underscore the urgent need for more robust multi-attribute privacy-preserving graph publishing methods and data-sharing practices.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We investigate grokking in transformers through the lens of inductive bias: dispositions arising from architecture or optimization that let the network prefer one solution over another. We first show that architectural choices such as the position of Layer Normalization (LN) strongly modulates grokking speed. This modulation is explained by isolating how LN on specific pathways shapes shortcut-learning and attention entropy. Subsequently, we study how different optimization settings modulate grokking, inducing distinct interpretations of previously proposed controls such as readout scale. Particularly, we find that using readout scale as a control for lazy training can be confounded by learning rate and weight decay in our setting. Accordingly, we show that features evolve continuously throughout training, suggesting grokking in transformers can be more nuanced than a lazy-to-rich transition of the learning regime. Finally, we show how generalization predictably emerges with feature compressibility in grokking, across different modulators of inductive bias. Our code is released at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, transformer, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative models for de novo protein backbone design have achieved remarkable success in creating novel protein structures. However, these diffusion-based approaches remain computationally intensive and slower than desired for large-scale structural exploration. While recent efforts like Proteina have introduced flow-matching to improve sampling efficiency, the potential of tokenization for structural compression and acceleration remains largely unexplored in the protein domain. In this work, we present SaDiT, a novel framework that accelerates protein backbone generation by integrating SaProt Tokenization with a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture. SaDiT leverages a discrete latent space to represent protein geometry, significantly reducing the complexity of the generation process while maintaining theoretical SE(3) equivalence. To further enhance efficiency, we introduce an IPA Token Cache mechanism that optimizes the Invariant Point Attention (IPA) layers by reusing computed token states during iterative sampling. Experimental results demonstrate that SaDiT outperforms state-of-the-art models, including RFDiffusion and Proteina, in both computational speed and structural viability. We evaluate our model across unconditional backbone generation and fold-class conditional generation tasks, where SaDiT shows superior ability to capture complex topological features with high designability.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, protect, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Citations provide the basis for trusting scientific claims; when they are invalid or fabricated, this trust collapses. With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), this risk has intensified: LLMs are increasingly used for academic writing, yet their tendency to fabricate citations (``ghost citations'') poses a systemic threat to citation validity. To quantify this threat and inform mitigation, we develop CiteVerifier, an open-source framework for large-scale citation verification, and conduct the first comprehensive study of citation validity in the LLM era through three experiments built on it. We benchmark 13 state-of-the-art LLMs on citation generation across 40 research domains, finding that all models hallucinate citations at rates from 14.23\% to 94.93\%, with significant variation across research domains. Moreover, we analyze 2.2 million citations from 56,381 papers published at top-tier AI/ML and Security venues (2020--2025), confirming that 1.07\% of papers contain invalid or fabricated citations (604 papers), with an 80.9\% increase in 2025 alone. Furthermore, we survey 97 researchers and analyze 94 valid responses after removing 3 conflicting samples, revealing a critical ``verification gap'': 41.5\% of researchers copy-paste BibTeX without checking and 44.4\% choose no-action responses when encountering suspicious references; meanwhile, 76.7\% of reviewers do not thoroughly check references and 80.0\% never suspect fake citations. Our findings reveal an accelerating crisis where unreliable AI tools, combined with inadequate human verification by researchers and insufficient peer review scrutiny, enable fabricated citations to contaminate the scientific record. We propose interventions for researchers, venues, and tool developers to protect citation integrity.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Current Information Seeking (InfoSeeking) agents struggle to maintain focus and coherence during long-horizon exploration, as tracking search states, including planning procedure and massive search results, within one plain-text context is inherently fragile. To address this, we introduce \textbf{Table-as-Search (TaS)}, a structured planning framework that reformulates the InfoSeeking task as a Table Completion task. TaS maps each query into a structured table schema maintained in an external database, where rows represent search candidates and columns denote constraints or required information. This table precisely manages the search states: filled cells strictly record the history and search results, while empty cells serve as an explicit search plan. Crucially, TaS unifies three distinct InfoSeeking tasks: Deep Search, Wide Search, and the challenging DeepWide Search. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TaS significantly outperforms numerous state-of-the-art baselines across three kinds of benchmarks, including multi-agent framework and commercial systems. Furthermore, our analysis validates the TaS's superior robustness in long-horizon InfoSeeking, alongside its efficiency, scalability and flexibility.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Learning interpretable representations with variational autoencoders (VAEs) is a major goal of representation learning. The main challenge lies in obtaining disentangled representations, where each latent dimension corresponds to a distinct generative factor. This difficulty is fundamentally tied to the inability to perform nonlinear independent component analysis. Here, we introduce the framework of action-induced representations (AIRs) which models representations of physical systems given experiments (or actions) that can be performed on them. We show that, in this framework, we can provably disentangle degrees of freedom w.r.t. their action dependence. We further introduce a variational AIR architecture (VAIR) that can extract AIRs and therefore achieve provable disentanglement where standard VAEs fail. Beyond state representation, VAIR also captures the action dependence of the underlying generative factors, directly linking experiments to the degrees of freedom they influence.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) is a prevalent spinal deformity whose progression can be mitigated through early detection. Conventional screening methods are often subjective, difficult to scale, and reliant on specialized clinical expertise. Video-based gait analysis offers a promising alternative, but current datasets and methods frequently suffer from data leakage, where performance is inflated by repeated clips from the same individual, or employ oversimplified models that lack clinical interpretability. To address these limitations, we introduce ScoliGait, a new benchmark dataset comprising 1,572 gait video clips for training and 300 fully independent clips for testing. Each clip is annotated with radiographic Cobb angles and descriptive text based on clinical kinematic priors. We propose a multi-modal framework that integrates a clinical-prior-guided kinematic knowledge map for interpretable feature representation, alongside a latent attention pooling mechanism to fuse video, text, and knowledge map modalities. Our method establishes a new state-of-the-art, demonstrating a significant performance gap on a realistic, non-repeating subject benchmark. Our approach establishes a new state of the art, showing a significant performance gain on a realistic, subject-independent benchmark. This work provides a robust, interpretable, and clinically grounded foundation for scalable, non-invasive AIS assessment.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Satellite imagery is employed for large-scale prospectivity mapping due to the high cost and typically limited availability of on-site mineral exploration data. In this work, we present a proof-of-concept framework that leverages generative representations learned from multispectral Sentinel-2 imagery to identify gold-bearing regions from space. An autoencoder foundation model, called Isometric, which is pretrained on the large-scale FalconSpace-S2 v1.0 dataset, produces information-dense spectral-spatial representations that serve as inputs to a lightweight XGBoost classifier. We compare this representation-based approach with a raw spectral input baseline using a dataset of 63 Sentinel-2 images from known gold and non-gold locations. The proposed method improves patch-level accuracy from 0.51 to 0.68 and image-level accuracy from 0.55 to 0.73, demonstrating that generative embeddings capture transferable mineralogical patterns even with limited labeled data. These results highlight the potential of foundation-model representations to make mineral exploration more efficient, scalable, and globally applicable.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent progress in ML and LLMs has improved vulnerability detection, and recent datasets have reduced label noise and unrelated code changes. However, most existing approaches still operate at the function level, where models are asked to predict whether a single function is vulnerable without inter-procedural context. In practice, vulnerability presence and root cause often depend on contextual information. Naively appending such context is not a reliable solution: real-world context is long, redundant, and noisy, and we find that unstructured context frequently degrades the performance of strong fine-tuned code models. We present CPRVul, a context-aware vulnerability detection framework that couples Context Profiling and Selection with Structured Reasoning. CPRVul constructs a code property graph, and extracts candidate context. It then uses an LLM to generate security-focused profiles and assign relevance scores, selecting only high-impact contextual elements that fit within the model's context window. In the second phase, CPRVul integrates the target function, the selected context, and auxiliary vulnerability metadata to generate reasoning traces, which are used to fine-tune LLMs for reasoning-based vulnerability detection. We evaluate CPRVul on three high-quality vulnerability datasets: PrimeVul, TitanVul, and CleanVul. Across all datasets, CPRVul consistently outperforms function-only baselines, achieving accuracies ranging from 64.94% to 73.76%, compared to 56.65% to 63.68% for UniXcoder. Specifically, on the challenging PrimeVul benchmark, CPRVul achieves 67.78% accuracy, outperforming prior state-of-the-art approaches, improving accuracy from 55.17% to 67.78% (22.9% improvement). Our ablations further show that neither raw context nor processed context alone benefits strong code models; gains emerge only when processed context is paired with structured reasoning.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>LLM watermarks allow tracing AI-generated texts by inserting a detectable signal into their generated content. Recent works have proposed a wide range of watermarking algorithms, each with distinct designs, usually built using a bottom-up approach. Crucially, there is no general and principled formulation for LLM watermarking. In this work, we show that most existing and widely used watermarking schemes can in fact be derived from a principled constrained optimization problem. Our formulation unifies existing watermarking methods and explicitly reveals the constraints that each method optimizes. In particular, it highlights an understudied quality-diversity-power trade-off. At the same time, our framework also provides a principled approach for designing novel watermarking schemes tailored to specific requirements. For instance, it allows us to directly use perplexity as a proxy for quality, and derive new schemes that are optimal with respect to this constraint. Our experimental evaluation validates our framework: watermarking schemes derived from a given constraint consistently maximize detection power with respect to that constraint.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Accounting for privacy loss under fully adaptive composition -- where both the choice of mechanisms and their privacy parameters may depend on the entire history of prior outputs -- is a central challenge in differential privacy (DP). In this setting, privacy filters are stopping rules for compositions that ensure a prescribed global privacy budget is not exceeded. It remains unclear whether optimal trade-off-function-based notions, such as $f$-DP, admit valid privacy filters under fully adaptive interaction. We show that the natural approach to defining an $f$-DP filter -- composing individual trade-off curves and stopping when the prescribed $f$-DP curve is crossed -- is fundamentally invalid. We characterise when and why this failure occurs, and establish necessary and sufficient conditions under which the natural filter is valid. Furthermore, we prove a fully adaptive central limit theorem for $f$-DP and construct an approximate Gaussian DP filter for subsampled Gaussian mechanisms at small sampling rates $q<0.2$ and large sampling rates $q>0.8$, yielding tighter privacy guarantees than filters based on Rényi DP in the same setting.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Modern AI-integrated IDEs are shifting from passive code completion to proactive Next Edit Suggestions (NES). Unlike traditional autocompletion, NES is designed to construct a richer context from both recent user interactions and the broader codebase to suggest multi-line, cross-line, or even cross-file modifications. This evolution significantly streamlines the programming workflow into a tab-by-tab interaction and enhances developer productivity. Consequently, NES introduces a more complex context retrieval mechanism and sophisticated interaction patterns. However, existing studies focus almost exclusively on the security implications of standalone LLM-based code generation, ignoring the potential attack vectors posed by NES in modern AI-integrated IDEs. The underlying mechanisms of NES remain under-explored, and their security implications are not yet fully understood. In this paper, we conduct the first systematic security study of NES systems. First, we perform an in-depth dissection of the NES mechanisms to understand the newly introduced threat vectors. It is found that NES retrieves a significantly expanded context, including inputs from imperceptible user actions and global codebase retrieval, which increases the attack surfaces. Second, we conduct a comprehensive in-lab study to evaluate the security implications of NES. The evaluation results reveal that NES is susceptible to context poisoning and is sensitive to transactional edits and human-IDE interactions. Third, we perform a large-scale online survey involving over 200 professional developers to assess the perceptions of NES security risks in real-world development workflows. The survey results indicate a general lack of awareness regarding the potential security pitfalls associated with NES, highlighting the need for increased education and improved security countermeasures in AI-integrated IDEs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, generative, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) remains indispensable for aligning large language models (LLMs) in subjective domains. To enhance robustness, recent work shifts toward Generative Reward Models (GenRMs) that generate rationales before predicting preferences. Yet in GenRM training and evaluation, practice remains outcome-label-only, leaving reasoning quality unchecked. We show that reasoning fidelity-the consistency between a GenRM's preference decision and reference decision rationales-is highly predictive of downstream RLHF outcomes, beyond standard label accuracy. Specifically, we repurpose existing reward-model benchmarks to compute Spurious Correctness (S-Corr)-the fraction of label-correct decisions with rationales misaligned with golden judgments. Our empirical evaluation reveals substantial S-Corr even for competitive GenRMs, and higher S-Corr is associated with policy degeneration under optimization. To improve fidelity, we propose Rationale-Centric Alignment, R-Align, which augments training with gold judgments and explicitly supervises rationale alignment. R-Align reduces S-Corr on RM benchmarks and yields consistent gains in actor performance across STEM, coding, instruction following, and general tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advancements in zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) have facilitated the extraction of diverse behaviors from unlabeled, offline data sources. In particular, forward-backward algorithms (FB) can retrieve a family of policies that can approximately solve any standard RL problem (with additive rewards, linear in the occupancy measure), given sufficient capacity. While retaining zero-shot properties, we tackle the greater problem class of RL with general utilities, in which the objective is an arbitrary differentiable function of the occupancy measure. This setting is strictly more expressive, capturing tasks such as distribution matching or pure exploration, which may not be reduced to additive rewards. We show that this additional complexity can be captured by a novel, maximum entropy (soft) variant of the forward-backward algorithm, which recovers a family of stochastic policies from offline data. When coupled with zero-order search over compact policy embeddings, this algorithm can sidestep iterative optimization schemes, and optimizes general utilities directly at test-time. Across both didactic and high-dimensional experiments, we demonstrate that our method retains favorable properties of FB algorithms, while also extending their range to more general RL problems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, robust, diffusion, data-free</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Concept erasure helps stop diffusion models (DMs) from generating harmful content; but current methods face robustness retention trade off. Robustness means the model fine-tuned by concept erasure methods resists reactivation of erased concepts, even under semantically related prompts. Retention means unrelated concepts are preserved so the model's overall utility stays intact. Both are critical for concept erasure in practice, yet addressing them simultaneously is challenging, as existing works typically improve one factor while sacrificing the other. Prior work typically strengthens one while degrading the other, e.g., mapping a single erased prompt to a fixed safe target leaves class level remnants exploitable by prompt attacks, whereas retention-oriented schemes underperform against adaptive adversaries. This paper introduces Adversarial Erasure with Gradient Informed Synergy (AEGIS), a retention-data-free framework that advances both robustness and retention.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Data augmentation can mitigate limited training data in machine-learning automated scoring engines for constructed response items. This study seeks to determine how well three approaches to large language model prompting produce essays that preserve the writing quality of the original essays and produce realistic text for augmenting ASE training datasets. We created simulated versions of student essays, and human raters assigned scores to them and rated the realism of the generated text. The results of the study indicate that the predict next prompting strategy produces the highest level of agreement between human raters regarding simulated essay scores, predict next and sentence strategies best preserve the rated quality of the original essay in the simulated essays, and predict next and 25 examples strategies produce the most realistic text as judged by human raters.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We study the problem of learning robust classifiers where the classifier will receive a perturbed input. Unlike robust PAC learning studied in prior work, here the clean data and its label are also adversarially chosen. We formulate this setting as an online learning problem and consider both the realizable and agnostic learnability of hypothesis classes. We define a new dimension of classes and show it controls the mistake bounds in the realizable setting and the regret bounds in the agnostic setting. In contrast to the dimension that characterizes learnability in the PAC setting, our dimension is rather simple and resembles the Littlestone dimension. We generalize our dimension to multiclass hypothesis classes and prove similar results in the realizable case. Finally, we study the case where the learner does not know the set of allowed perturbations for each point and only has some prior on them.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This project explores large language models (LLMs) for anomaly detection across heterogeneous log sources. Traditional intrusion detection systems suffer from high false positive rates, semantic blindness, and data scarcity, as logs are inherently sensitive, making clean datasets rare. We address these challenges through three contributions: (1) LogAtlas-Foundation-Sessions and LogAtlas-Defense-Set, balanced and heterogeneous log datasets with explicit attack annotations and privacy preservation; (2) empirical benchmarking revealing why standard metrics such as F1 and accuracy are misleading for security applications; and (3) a two phase training framework combining log understanding (Base-AMAN, 3B parameters) with real time detection (AMAN, 0.5B parameters via knowledge distillation). Results demonstrate practical feasibility, with inference times of 0.3-0.5 seconds per session and operational costs below 50 USD per day.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Sweetpotato weevils (Cylas spp.) are considered among the most destructive pests impacting sweetpotato production, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Traditional methods for assessing weevil damage, predominantly relying on manual scoring, are labour-intensive, subjective, and often yield inconsistent results. These challenges significantly hinder breeding programs aimed at developing resilient sweetpotato varieties. This study introduces a computer vision-based approach for the automated evaluation of weevil damage in both field and laboratory contexts. In the field settings, we collected data to train classification models to predict root-damage severity levels, achieving a test accuracy of 71.43%. Additionally, we established a laboratory dataset and designed an object detection pipeline employing YOLO12, a leading real-time detection model. This methodology incorporated a two-stage laboratory pipeline that combined root segmentation with a tiling strategy to improve the detectability of small objects. The resulting model demonstrated a mean average precision of 77.7% in identifying minute weevil feeding holes. Our findings indicate that computer vision technologies can provide efficient, objective, and scalable assessment tools that align seamlessly with contemporary breeding workflows. These advancements represent a significant improvement in enhancing phenotyping efficiency within sweetpotato breeding programs and play a crucial role in mitigating the detrimental effects of weevils on food security.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Being probabilistic models, during inference large language models (LLMs) display rare events: behaviour that is far from typical but highly significant. By definition all rare events are hard to see, but the enormous scale of LLM usage means that events completely unobserved during development are likely to become prominent in deployment. Here we present an end-to-end framework for the systematic analysis of rare events in LLMs. We provide a practical implementation spanning theory, efficient generation strategies, probability estimation and error analysis, which we illustrate with concrete examples. We outline extensions and applications to other models and contexts, highlighting the generality of the concepts and techniques presented here.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>An impediment to using Large Language Models (LLMs) for reasoning output verification is that LLMs struggle to reliably identify errors in thinking traces, particularly in long outputs, domains requiring expert knowledge, and problems without verifiable rewards. We propose a data-driven approach to automatically construct highly granular reasoning error taxonomies to enhance LLM-driven error detection on unseen reasoning traces. Our findings indicate that classification approaches that leverage these error taxonomies, or "rubrics", demonstrate strong error identification compared to baseline methods in technical domains like coding, math, and chemical engineering. These rubrics can be used to build stronger LLM-as-judge reward functions for reasoning model training via reinforcement learning. Experimental results show that these rewards have the potential to improve models' task accuracy on difficult domains over models trained by general LLMs-as-judges by +45%, and approach performance of models trained by verifiable rewards while using as little as 20% as many gold labels. Through our approach, we extend the usage of reward rubrics from assessing qualitative model behavior to assessing quantitative model correctness on tasks typically learned via RLVR rewards. This extension opens the door for teaching models to solve complex technical problems without a full dataset of gold labels, which are often highly costly to procure.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Ambiguity poses persistent challenges in natural language understanding for large language models (LLMs). To better understand how lexical ambiguity can be resolved through the visual domain, we develop an interpretable Visual Word Sense Disambiguation (VWSD) framework. The model leverages CLIP to project ambiguous language and candidate images into a shared multimodal space. We enrich textual embeddings using a dual-channel ensemble of semantic and photo-based prompts with WordNet synonyms, while image embeddings are refined through robust test-time augmentations. We then use cosine similarity to determine the image that best aligns with the ambiguous text. When evaluated on the SemEval-2023 VWSD dataset, enriching the embeddings raises the MRR from 0.7227 to 0.7590 and the Hit Rate from 0.5810 to 0.6220. Ablation studies reveal that dual-channel prompting provides strong, low-latency performance, whereas aggressive image augmentation yields only marginal gains. Additional experiments with WordNet definitions and multilingual prompt ensembles further suggest that noisy external signals tend to dilute semantic specificity, reinforcing the effectiveness of precise, CLIP-aligned prompts for visual word sense disambiguation.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Data assimilation (DA) is a fundamental component of modern weather prediction, yet it remains a major computational bottleneck in machine learning (ML)-based forecasting pipelines due to reliance on traditional variational methods. Recent generative ML-based DA methods offer a promising alternative but typically require many sampling steps and suffer from error accumulation under long-horizon auto-regressive rollouts with cycling assimilation. We propose FlowDA, a low-latency weather-scale generative DA framework based on flow matching. FlowDA conditions on observations through a SetConv-based embedding and fine-tunes the Aurora foundation model to deliver accurate, efficient, and robust analyses. Experiments across observation rates decreasing from $3.9\%$ to $0.1\%$ demonstrate superior performance of FlowDA over strong baselines with similar tunable-parameter size. FlowDA further shows robustness to observational noise and stable performance in long-horizon auto-regressive cycling DA. Overall, FlowDA points to an efficient and scalable direction for data-driven DA.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Activation steering methods, such as persona vectors, are widely used to control large language model behavior and increasingly interpreted as revealing meaningful internal representations. This interpretation implicitly assumes steering directions are identifiable and uniquely recoverable from input-output behavior. We formalize steering as an intervention on internal representations and prove that, under realistic modeling and data conditions, steering vectors are fundamentally non-identifiable due to large equivalence classes of behaviorally indistinguishable interventions. Empirically, we validate this across multiple models and semantic traits, showing orthogonal perturbations achieve near-equivalent efficacy with negligible effect sizes. However, identifiability is recoverable under structural assumptions including statistical independence, sparsity constraints, multi-environment validation or cross-layer consistency. These findings reveal fundamental interpretability limits and clarify structural assumptions required for reliable safety-critical control.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair, diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text-to-image diffusion models achieve impressive generation quality but inherit and amplify training-data biases, skewing coverage of semantic attributes. Prior work addresses this in two ways. Closed-set approaches mitigate biases in predefined fairness categories (e.g., gender, race), assuming socially salient minority attributes are known a priori. Open-set approaches frame the task as bias identification, highlighting majority attributes that dominate outputs. Both overlook a complementary task: uncovering rare or minority features underrepresented in the data distribution (social, cultural, or stylistic) yet still encoded in model representations. We introduce RAIGen, the first framework, to our knowledge, for un-supervised rare-attribute discovery in diffusion models. RAIGen leverages Matryoshka Sparse Autoencoders and a novel minority metric combining neuron activation frequency with semantic distinctiveness to identify interpretable neurons whose top-activating images reveal underrepresented attributes. Experiments show RAIGen discovers attributes beyond fixed fairness categories in Stable Diffusion, scales to larger models such as SDXL, supports systematic auditing across architectures, and enables targeted amplification of rare attributes during generation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Tabular anomaly detection (TAD) remains challenging due to the heterogeneity of tabular data: features lack natural relationships, vary widely in distribution and scale, and exhibit diverse types. Consequently, each TAD method makes implicit assumptions about anomaly patterns that work well on some datasets but fail on others, and no method consistently outperforms across diverse scenarios. We present CTAD (Calibrating Tabular Anomaly Detection), a model-agnostic post-processing framework that enhances any existing TAD detector through sample-specific calibration. Our approach characterizes normal data via two complementary distributions, i.e., an empirical distribution from random sampling and a structural distribution from K-means centroids, and measures how adding a test sample disrupts their compatibility using Optimal Transport (OT) distance. Normal samples maintain low disruption while anomalies cause high disruption, providing a calibration signal to amplify detection. We prove that OT distance has a lower bound proportional to the test sample's distance from centroids, and establish that anomalies systematically receive higher calibration scores than normals in expectation, explaining why the method generalizes across datasets. Extensive experiments on 34 diverse tabular datasets with 7 representative detectors spanning all major TAD categories (density estimation, classification, reconstruction, and isolation-based methods) demonstrate that CTAD consistently improves performance with statistical significance. Remarkably, CTAD enhances even state-of-the-art deep learning methods and shows robust performance across diverse hyperparameter settings, requiring no additional tuning for practical deployment.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) shows promise for aligning diffusion and flow models, yet policy optimization methods such as GRPO suffer from inefficient and static sampling strategies. These methods treat all prompts and denoising steps uniformly, ignoring substantial variations in sample learning value as well as the dynamic nature of critical exploration moments. To address this issue, we conduct a detailed analysis of the internal attention dynamics during GRPO training and uncover a key insight: attention entropy can serve as a powerful dual-signal proxy. First, across different samples, the relative change in attention entropy ({\Delta}Entropy), which reflects the divergence between the current policy and the base policy, acts as a robust indicator of sample learning value. Second, during the denoising process, the peaks of absolute attention entropy (Entropy(t)), which quantify attention dispersion, effectively identify critical timesteps where high-value exploration occurs. Building on this observation, we propose Adaptive Entropy-Guided Policy Optimization (AEGPO), a novel dual-signal, dual-level adaptive optimization strategy. At the global level, AEGPO uses {\Delta}Entropy to dynamically allocate rollout budgets, prioritizing prompts with higher learning value. At the local level, it exploits the peaks of Entropy(t) to guide exploration selectively at critical high-dispersion timesteps rather than uniformly across all denoising steps. By focusing computation on the most informative samples and the most critical moments, AEGPO enables more efficient and effective policy optimization. Experiments on text-to-image generation tasks demonstrate that AEGPO significantly accelerates convergence and achieves superior alignment performance compared to standard GRPO variants.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Hybrid modeling, the combination of machine learning models and scientific mathematical models, enables flexible and robust data-driven prediction with partial interpretability. However, effectively the scientific models may be ignored in prediction due to the flexibility of the machine learning model, making the idea of hybrid modeling pointless. Typically some regularization is applied to hybrid model learning to avoid such a failure case, but the formulation of the regularizer strongly depends on model architectures and domain knowledge. In this paper, we propose to focus on the flatness of loss minima in learning hybrid models, aiming to make the model as simple as possible. We employ the idea of sharpness-aware minimization and adapt it to the hybrid modeling setting. Numerical experiments show that the SAM-based method works well across different choices of models and datasets.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Discrete diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for generative modeling on sequence data; however, the information-theoretic principles governing their reverse processes remain significantly less understood than those of their continuous counterparts. In this work, we bridge this gap by analyzing the reverse process dynamics through the lens of thermodynamic entropy production. We propose the entropy production rate as a rigorous proxy for quantifying information generation, deriving as a byproduct a bound on the Wasserstein distance between intermediate states and the data distribution. Leveraging these insights, we introduce two novel sampling schedules that are uniformly spaced with respect to their corresponding physics-inspired metrics: the Entropic Discrete Schedule (EDS), which is defined by maintaining a constant rate of information gain, and the Wasserstein Discrete Schedule (WDS), which is defined by taking equal steps in terms of the Wasserstein distance. We empirically demonstrate that our proposed schedules significantly outperform state-of-the-art strategies across diverse application domains, including synthetic data, music notation, vision and language modeling, consistently achieving superior performance at a lower computational budget.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While modern text-to-image models excel at prompt-based generation, they often lack the fine-grained control necessary for specific user requirements like spatial layouts or subject appearances. Multi-condition control addresses this, yet its integration into Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) is bottlenecked by the conventional ``concatenate-and-attend'' strategy, which suffers from quadratic computational and memory overhead as the number of conditions scales. Our analysis reveals that much of this cross-modal interaction is spatially or semantically redundant. To this end, we propose Position-aligned and Keyword-scoped Attention (PKA), a highly efficient framework designed to eliminate these redundancies. Specifically, Position-Aligned Attention (PAA) linearizes spatial control by enforcing localized patch alignment, while Keyword-Scoped Attention (KSA) prunes irrelevant subject-driven interactions via semantic-aware masking. To facilitate efficient learning, we further introduce a Conditional Sensitivity-Aware Sampling (CSAS) strategy that reweights the training objective towards critical denoising phases, drastically accelerating convergence and enhancing conditional fidelity. Empirically, PKA delivers a 10.0$\times$ inference speedup and a 5.1$\times$ VRAM saving, providing a scalable and resource-friendly solution for high-fidelity multi-conditioned generation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multi-turn jailbreaks capture the real threat model for safety-aligned chatbots, where single-turn attacks are merely a special case. Yet existing approaches break under exploration complexity and intent drift. We propose SEMA, a simple yet effective framework that trains a multi-turn attacker without relying on any existing strategies or external data. SEMA comprises two stages. Prefilling self-tuning enables usable rollouts by fine-tuning on non-refusal, well-structured, multi-turn adversarial prompts that are self-generated with a minimal prefix, thereby stabilizing subsequent learning. Reinforcement learning with intent-drift-aware reward trains the attacker to elicit valid multi-turn adversarial prompts while maintaining the same harmful objective. We anchor harmful intent in multi-turn jailbreaks via an intent-drift-aware reward that combines intent alignment, compliance risk, and level of detail. Our open-loop attack regime avoids dependence on victim feedback, unifies single- and multi-turn settings, and reduces exploration complexity. Across multiple datasets, victim models, and jailbreak judges, our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) attack success rates (ASR), outperforming all single-turn baselines, manually scripted and template-driven multi-turn baselines, as well as our SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning) and DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) variants. For instance, SEMA performs an average $80.1\%$ ASR@1 across three closed-source and open-source victim models on AdvBench, 33.9% over SOTA. The approach is compact, reproducible, and transfers across targets, providing a stronger and more realistic stress test for large language model (LLM) safety and enabling automatic redteaming to expose and localize failure modes.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The loss function is crucial to machine learning, especially in supervised learning frameworks. It is a fundamental component that controls the behavior and general efficacy of learning algorithms. However, despite their widespread use, traditional loss functions have significant drawbacks when dealing with high-dimensional and outlier-sensitive datasets, which frequently results in reduced performance and slower convergence during training. In this work, we develop a robust, bounded, and smooth (RoBoS-NN) loss function to resolve the aforementioned hindrances. The generalization ability of the loss function has also been theoretically analyzed to rigorously justify its robustness. Moreover, we implement RoboS-NN loss in the framework of a neural network (NN) to forecast time series and present a new robust algorithm named $\mathcal{L}_{\text{RoBoS}}$-NN. To assess the potential of $\mathcal{L}_{\text{RoBoS}}$-NN, we conduct experiments on multiple real-world datasets. In addition, we infuse outliers into data sets to evaluate the performance of $\mathcal{L}_{\text{RoBoS}}$-NN in more challenging scenarios. Numerical results show that $\mathcal{L}_{\text{RoBoS}}$-NN outperforms the other benchmark models in terms of accuracy measures.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Adapting pre-trained vision models using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) remains challenging, as it aims to achieve performance comparable to full fine-tuning using a minimal number of trainable parameters. When applied to complex dense prediction tasks, existing methods exhibit limitations, including input-agnostic modeling and redundant cross-layer representations. To this end, we propose AdaRoute, a new adapter-style method featuring a simple mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture. Specifically, we introduce shared expert centers, where each expert is a trainable parameter matrix. During a feedforward pass, each AdaRoute module in the network dynamically generates weight matrices tailored for the current module via a simple dynamic parameter routing mechanism, which selectively aggregates parameter matrices in the corresponding expert center. Dynamic weight matrices in AdaRoute modules facilitate low-rank adaptation in an input-dependent manner, thus generating more customized and powerful feature representations. Moreover, since AdaRoute modules across multiple network layers share the same expert center, they improve feature diversity by promoting implicit cross-layer feature interaction. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of AdaRoute on diverse vision tasks, including semantic segmentation, object detection and instance segmentation, and panoptic segmentation.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Reliable short-term demand forecasting is essential for managing shared micro-mobility services and ensuring responsive, user-centered operations. This study introduces T-STAR (Two-stage Spatial and Temporal Adaptive contextual Representation), a novel transformer-based probabilistic framework designed to forecast station-level bike-sharing demand at a 15-minute resolution. T-STAR addresses key challenges in high-resolution forecasting by disentangling consistent demand patterns from short-term fluctuations through a hierarchical two-stage structure. The first stage captures coarse-grained hourly demand patterns, while the second stage improves prediction accuracy by incorporating high-frequency, localized inputs, including recent fluctuations and real-time demand variations in connected metro services, to account for temporal shifts in short-term demand. Time series transformer models are employed in both stages to generate probabilistic predictions. Extensive experiments using Washington D.C.'s Capital Bikeshare data demonstrate that T-STAR outperforms existing methods in both deterministic and probabilistic accuracy. The model exhibits strong spatial and temporal robustness across stations and time periods. A zero-shot forecasting experiment further highlights T-STAR's ability to transfer to previously unseen service areas without retraining. These results underscore the framework's potential to deliver granular, reliable, and uncertainty-aware short-term demand forecasts, which enable seamless integration to support multimodal trip planning for travelers and enhance real-time operations in shared micro-mobility services.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We study a persistent failure mode in multi-objective alignment for large language models (LLMs): training improves performance on only a subset of objectives while causing others to degrade. We formalize this phenomenon as cross-objective interference and conduct the first systematic study across classic scalarization algorithms, showing that interference is pervasive and exhibits strong model dependence. To explain this phenomenon, we derive a local covariance law showing that an objective improves at first order when its reward exhibits positive covariance with the scalarized score. We extend this analysis to clipped surrogate objectives used in modern alignment, demonstrating that the covariance law remains valid under mild conditions despite clipping. Building on this analysis, we propose Covariance Targeted Weight Adaptation (CTWA), a plug-and-play method that maintains positive covariance between objective rewards and the training signal to effectively mitigate cross-objective interference. Finally, we complement these local improvement conditions with a global convergence analysis under the Polyak--Łojasiewicz condition, establishing when non-convex scalarized optimization achieves global convergence and how cross-objective interference depends on specific model geometric properties.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Instructional video editing applies edits to an input video using only text prompts, enabling intuitive natural-language control. Despite rapid progress, most methods still require fixed-length inputs and substantial compute. Meanwhile, autoregressive video generation enables efficient variable-length synthesis, yet remains under-explored for video editing. We introduce a causal, efficient video editing model that edits variable-length videos frame by frame. For efficiency, we start from a 2D image-to-image (I2I) diffusion model and adapt it to video-to-video (V2V) editing by conditioning the edit at time step t on the model's prediction at t-1. To leverage videos' temporal redundancy, we propose a new I2I diffusion forward process formulation that encourages the model to predict the residual between the target output and the previous prediction. We call this Residual Flow Diffusion Model (RFDM), which focuses the denoising process on changes between consecutive frames. Moreover, we propose a new benchmark that better ranks state-of-the-art methods for editing tasks. Trained on paired video data for global/local style transfer and object removal, RFDM surpasses I2I-based methods and competes with fully spatiotemporal (3D) V2V models, while matching the compute of image models and scaling independently of input video length.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While large-scale text-to-image diffusion models continue to improve in visual quality, their increasing scale has widened the gap between state-of-the-art models and on-device solutions. To address this gap, we introduce NanoFLUX, a 2.4B text-to-image flow-matching model distilled from 17B FLUX.1-Schnell using a progressive compression pipeline designed to preserve generation quality. Our contributions include: (1) A model compression strategy driven by pruning redundant components in the diffusion transformer, reducing its size from 12B to 2B; (2) A ResNet-based token downsampling mechanism that reduces latency by allowing intermediate blocks to operate on lower-resolution tokens while preserving high-resolution processing elsewhere; (3) A novel text encoder distillation approach that leverages visual signals from early layers of the denoiser during sampling. Empirically, NanoFLUX generates 512 x 512 images in approximately 2.5 seconds on mobile devices, demonstrating the feasibility of high-quality on-device text-to-image generation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The smoothness of the transformer architecture has been extensively studied in the context of generalization, training stability, and adversarial robustness. However, its role in transfer learning remains poorly understood. In this paper, we analyze the ability of vision transformer components to adapt their outputs to changes in inputs, or, in other words, their plasticity. Defined as an average rate of change, it captures the sensitivity to input perturbation; in particular, a high plasticity implies low smoothness. We demonstrate through theoretical analysis and comprehensive experiments that this perspective provides principled guidance in choosing the components to prioritize during adaptation. A key takeaway for practitioners is that the high plasticity of the attention modules and feedforward layers consistently leads to better finetuning performance. Our findings depart from the prevailing assumption that smoothness is desirable, offering a novel perspective on the functional properties of transformers.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multimodal Diffusion Transformers (MMDiTs) for text-to-image generation maintain separate text and image branches, with bidirectional information flow between text tokens and visual latents throughout denoising. In this setting, we observe a prompt forgetting phenomenon: the semantics of the prompt representation in the text branch is progressively forgotten as depth increases. We further verify this effect on three representative MMDiTs--SD3, SD3.5, and FLUX.1 by probing linguistic attributes of the representations over the layers in the text branch. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a training-free approach, prompt reinjection, which reinjects prompt representations from early layers into later layers to alleviate this forgetting. Experiments on GenEval, DPG, and T2I-CompBench++ show consistent gains in instruction-following capability, along with improvements on metrics capturing preference, aesthetics, and overall text--image generation quality.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, defense, attack, robust, interpretability, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in security-sensitive applications, yet remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks. However, existing backdoor defenses are difficult to operationalize for Backdoor Defense-as-a-Service (BDaaS), as they require unrealistic side information (e.g., downstream clean data, known triggers/targets, or task domain specifics), and lack reusable, scalable purification across diverse backdoored models. In this paper, we present PROTOPURIFY, a backdoor purification framework via parameter edits under minimal assumptions. PROTOPURIFY first builds a backdoor vector pool from clean and backdoored model pairs, aggregates vectors into candidate prototypes, and selects the most aligned candidate for the target model via similarity matching. PROTOPURIFY then identifies a boundary layer through layer-wise prototype alignment and performs targeted purification by suppressing prototype-aligned components in the affected layers, achieving fine-grained mitigation with minimal impact on benign utility. Designed as a BDaaS-ready primitive, PROTOPURIFY supports reusability, customizability, interpretability, and runtime efficiency. Experiments across various LLMs on both classification and generation tasks show that PROTOPURIFY consistently outperforms 6 representative defenses against 6 diverse attacks, including single-trigger, multi-trigger, and triggerless backdoor settings. PROTOPURIFY reduces ASR to below 10%, and even as low as 1.6% in some cases, while incurring less than a 3% drop in clean utility. PROTOPURIFY further demonstrates robustness against adaptive backdoor variants and stability on non-backdoored models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recovering a unique causal graph from observational data is an ill-posed problem because multiple generating mechanisms can lead to the same observational distribution. This problem becomes solvable only by exploiting specific structural or distributional assumptions. While recent work has separately utilized time-series dynamics or multi-environment heterogeneity to constrain this problem, we integrate both as complementary sources of heterogeneity. This integration yields unified necessary identifiability conditions and enables a rigorous analysis of the statistical limits of recovery under thin versus heavy-tailed noise. In particular, temporal structure is shown to effectively substitute for missing environmental diversity, possibly achieving identifiability even under insufficient heterogeneity. Extending this analysis to heavy-tailed (Student's t) distributions, we demonstrate that while geometric identifiability conditions remain invariant, the sample complexity diverges significantly from the Gaussian baseline. Explicit information-theoretic bounds quantify this cost of robustness, establishing the fundamental limits of covariance-based causal graph recovery methods in realistic non-stationary systems. This work shifts the focus from whether causal structure is identifiable to whether it is statistically recoverable in practice.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The recent surge in Time Series Foundation Models has rapidly advanced the field, yet the heterogeneous training setups across studies make it difficult to attribute improvements to architectural innovations versus data engineering. In this work, we investigate the potential of a standard patch Transformer, demonstrating that this generic architecture achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot forecasting performance using a straightforward training protocol. We conduct a comprehensive ablation study that covers model scaling, data composition, and training techniques to isolate the essential ingredients for high performance. Our findings identify the key drivers of performance, while confirming that the generic architecture itself demonstrates excellent scalability. By strictly controlling these variables, we provide comprehensive empirical results on model scaling across multiple dimensions. We release our open-source model and detailed findings to establish a transparent, reproducible baseline for future research.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>defense, attack, robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As increasingly capable open-weight large language models (LLMs) are deployed, improving their tamper resistance against unsafe modifications, whether accidental or intentional, becomes critical to minimize risks. However, there is no standard approach to evaluate tamper resistance. Varied data sets, metrics, and tampering configurations make it difficult to compare safety, utility, and robustness across different models and defenses. To this end, we introduce TamperBench, the first unified framework to systematically evaluate the tamper resistance of LLMs. TamperBench (i) curates a repository of state-of-the-art weight-space fine-tuning attacks and latent-space representation attacks; (ii) enables realistic adversarial evaluation through systematic hyperparameter sweeps per attack-model pair; and (iii) provides both safety and utility evaluations. TamperBench requires minimal additional code to specify any fine-tuning configuration, alignment-stage defense method, and metric suite while ensuring end-to-end reproducibility. We use TamperBench to evaluate 21 open-weight LLMs, including defense-augmented variants, across nine tampering threats using standardized safety and capability metrics with hyperparameter sweeps per model-attack pair. This yields novel insights, including effects of post-training on tamper resistance, that jailbreak-tuning is typically the most severe attack, and that Triplet emerges as a leading alignment-stage defense.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Fully unsupervised segmentation pipelines naively seek the most salient object, should this be present. As a result, most of the methods reported in the literature deliver non-deterministic partitions that are sensitive to initialization, seed order, and threshold heuristics. We propose PANC, a weakly supervised spectral segmentation framework that uses a minimal set of annotated visual tokens to produce stable, controllable, and reproducible object masks. From the TokenCut approach, we augment the token-token affinity graph with a handful of priors coupled to anchor nodes. By manipulating the graph topology, we bias the spectral eigenspace toward partitions that are consistent with the annotations. Our approach preserves the global grouping enforced by dense self-supervised visual features, trading annotated tokens for significant gains in reproducibility, user control, and segmentation quality. Using 5 to 30 annotations per dataset, our training-free method achieves state-of-the-art performance among weakly and unsupervised approaches on standard benchmarks (e.g., DUTS-TE, ECSSD, MS COCO). Contrarily, it excels in domains where dense labels are costly or intra-class differences are subtle. We report strong and reliable results on homogeneous, fine-grained, and texture-limited domains, achieving 96.8% (+14.43% over SotA), 78.0% (+0.2%), and 78.8% (+0.37%) average mean intersection-over-union (mIoU) on CrackForest (CFD), CUB-200-2011, and HAM10000 datasets, respectively. For multi-object benchmarks, the framework showcases explicit, user-controllable semantic segmentation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vision capabilities in vision large language models (VLLMs) have consistently lagged behind their linguistic capabilities. In particular, numerous benchmark studies have demonstrated that VLLMs struggle when fine-grained visual information or spatial reasoning is required. However, we do not yet understand exactly why VLLMs struggle so much with these tasks relative to others. Some works have focused on visual redundancy as an explanation, where high-level visual information is uniformly spread across numerous tokens and specific, fine-grained visual information is discarded. In this work, we investigate this premise in greater detail, seeking to better understand exactly how various types of visual information are processed by the model and what types of visual information are discarded. To do so, we introduce a simple synthetic benchmark dataset that is specifically constructed to probe various visual features, along with a set of metrics for measuring visual redundancy, allowing us to better understand the nuances of their relationship. Then, we explore fine-tuning VLLMs on a number of complex visual tasks to better understand how redundancy and compression change based upon the complexity of the data that a model is trained on. We find that there is a connection between task complexity and visual compression, implying that having a sufficient ratio of high complexity visual data is crucial for altering the way that VLLMs distribute their visual representation and consequently improving their performance on complex visual tasks. We hope that this work will provide valuable insights for training the next generation of VLLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Hallucinations in large language models remain a persistent challenge, particularly in multilingual and generative settings where factual consistency is difficult to maintain. While recent models show strong performance on English-centric benchmarks, their behavior across languages, tasks, and hallucination types is not yet well understood. In this work, we introduce Halluverse-M^3, a dataset designed to enable systematic analysis of hallucinations across multiple languages, multiple generation tasks, and multiple hallucination categories. Halluverse-M^3 covers four languages, English, Arabic, Hindi, and Turkish, and supports two generation tasks: question answering and dialogue summarization. The dataset explicitly distinguishes between entity-level, relation-level, and sentence-level hallucinations. Hallucinated outputs are constructed through a controlled editing process and validated by human annotators, ensuring clear alignment between original content and hallucinated generations. Using this dataset, we evaluate a diverse set of contemporary open-source and proprietary language models on fine-grained hallucination detection. Our results show that question answering is consistently easier than dialogue summarization, while sentence-level hallucinations remain challenging even for the strongest models. Performance is highest in English and degrades in lower-resource languages, with Hindi exhibiting the lowest detection accuracy. Overall, Halluverse-M^3 provides a realistic and challenging benchmark for studying hallucinations in multilingual, multi-task settings. We release the dataset to support future research on hallucination detection and mitigation\footnote{this https URL}.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Can general-purpose AI architectures go beyond prediction to discover the physical laws governing the universe? True intelligence relies on "world models" -- causal abstractions that allow an agent to not only predict future states but understand the underlying governing dynamics. While previous "AI Physicist" approaches have successfully recovered such laws, they typically rely on strong, domain-specific priors that effectively "bake in" the physics. Conversely, Vafa et al. recently showed that generic Transformers fail to acquire these world models, achieving high predictive accuracy without capturing the underlying physical laws. We bridge this gap by systematically introducing three minimal inductive biases. We show that ensuring spatial smoothness (by formulating prediction as continuous regression) and stability (by training with noisy contexts to mitigate error accumulation) enables generic Transformers to surpass prior failures and learn a coherent Keplerian world model, successfully fitting ellipses to planetary trajectories. However, true physical insight requires a third bias: temporal locality. By restricting the attention window to the immediate past -- imposing the simple assumption that future states depend only on the local state rather than a complex history -- we force the model to abandon curve-fitting and discover Newtonian force representations. Our results demonstrate that simple architectural choices determine whether an AI becomes a curve-fitter or a physicist, marking a critical step toward automated scientific discovery.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep learning models trained to optimize average accuracy often exhibit systematic failures on particular subpopulations. In real world settings, the subpopulations most affected by such disparities are frequently unlabeled or unknown, thereby motivating the development of methods that are performant on sensitive subgroups without being pre-specified. However, existing group-robust methods typically assume prior knowledge of relevant subgroups, using group annotations for training or model selection. We propose Low-rank Error Informed Adaptation (LEIA), a simple two-stage method that improves group robustness by identifying a low-dimensional subspace in the representation space where model errors concentrate. LEIA restricts adaptation to this error-informed subspace via a low-rank adjustment to the classifier logits, directly targeting latent failure modes without modifying the backbone or requiring group labels. Using five real-world datasets, we analyze group robustness under three settings: (1) truly no knowledge of subgroup relevance, (2) partial knowledge of subgroup relevance, and (3) full knowledge of subgroup relevance. Across all settings, LEIA consistently improves worst-group performance while remaining fast, parameter-efficient, and robust to hyperparameter choice.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We study off-policy reinforcement learning for controlling continuous-time Markov diffusion processes with discrete-time observations and actions. We consider model-free algorithms with function approximation that learn value and advantage functions directly from data, without unrealistic structural assumptions on the dynamics. Leveraging the ellipticity of the diffusions, we establish a new class of Hilbert-space positive definiteness and boundedness properties for the Bellman operators. Based on these properties, we propose the Sobolev-prox fitted $q$-learning algorithm, which learns value and advantage functions by iteratively solving least-squares regression problems. We derive oracle inequalities for the estimation error, governed by (i) the best approximation error of the function classes, (ii) their localized complexity, (iii) exponentially decaying optimization error, and (iv) numerical discretization error. These results identify ellipticity as a key structural property that renders reinforcement learning with function approximation for Markov diffusions no harder than supervised learning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>protect, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models can resist task-misaligned activation steering during inference, sometimes recovering mid-generation to produce improved responses even when steering remains active. We term this Endogenous Steering Resistance (ESR). Using sparse autoencoder (SAE) latents to steer model activations, we find that Llama-3.3-70B shows substantial ESR, while smaller models from the Llama-3 and Gemma-2 families exhibit the phenomenon less frequently. We identify 26 SAE latents that activate differentially during off-topic content and are causally linked to ESR in Llama-3.3-70B. Zero-ablating these latents reduces the multi-attempt rate by 25%, providing causal evidence for dedicated internal consistency-checking circuits. We demonstrate that ESR can be deliberately enhanced through both prompting and training: meta-prompts instructing the model to self-monitor increase the multi-attempt rate by 4x for Llama-3.3-70B, and fine-tuning on self-correction examples successfully induces ESR-like behavior in smaller models. These findings have dual implications: ESR could protect against adversarial manipulation but might also interfere with beneficial safety interventions that rely on activation steering. Understanding and controlling these resistance mechanisms is important for developing transparent and controllable AI systems. Code is available at this http URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Tokenization is a pivotal design choice for neural language modeling in morphologically rich languages (MRLs) such as Turkish, where productive agglutination challenges both vocabulary efficiency and morphological fidelity. Prior studies have explored tokenizer families and vocabulary sizes but typically (i) vary vocabulary without systematically controlling the tokenizer's training corpus, (ii) provide limited intrinsic diagnostics, and (iii) evaluate a narrow slice of downstream tasks. We present the first comprehensive, principled study of Turkish subword tokenization; a "subwords manifest", that jointly varies vocabulary size and tokenizer training corpus size (data and vocabulary coupling), compares multiple tokenizer families under matched parameter budgets (WordPiece, morphology level, and character baselines), and evaluates across semantic (NLI, STS, sentiment analysis, NER), syntactic (POS, dependency parsing), and morphology-sensitive probes. To explain why tokenizers succeed or fail, we introduce a morphology-aware diagnostic toolkit that goes beyond coarse aggregates to boundary-level micro/macro F1, decoupled lemma atomicity vs. surface boundary hits, over/under-segmentation indices, character/word edit distances (CER/WER), continuation rates, and affix-type coverage and token-level atomicity. Our contributions are fourfold: (i) a systematic investigation of the vocabulary-corpus-success triad; (ii) a unified, morphology-aware evaluation framework linking intrinsic diagnostics to extrinsic outcomes; (iii) controlled comparisons identifying when character-level and morphology-level tokenization pay off; and (iv) an open-source release of evaluation code, tokenizer pipelines, and models. As the first work of its kind, this "subwords manifest" delivers actionable guidance for building effective tokenizers in MRLs and establishes a reproducible foundation for future research.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have shown advantages in text generation, particularly due to their inherent ability for parallel decoding. However, constrained by the quality--speed trade-off, existing inference solutions adopt conservative parallel strategies, leaving substantial efficiency potential underexplored. A core challenge is that parallel decoding assumes each position can be filled independently, but tokens are often semantically coupled. Thus, the correct choice at one position constrains valid choices at others. Without modeling these inter-token dependencies, parallel strategies produce deteriorated outputs. Motivated by this insight, we propose DAWN, a training-free, dependency-aware decoding method for fast dLLM inference. DAWN extracts token dependencies and leverages two key motivations: (1) positions dependent on unmasked certain positions become more reliable, (2) simultaneously unmasking strongly coupled uncertain positions induces errors. Given those findings, DAWN leverages a dependency graph to select more reliable unmasking positions at each iteration, achieving high parallelism with negligible loss in generation quality. Extensive experiments across multiple models and datasets demonstrate that DAWN speedups the inference by 1.80-8.06x over baselines while preserving the generation quality.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Addressing class imbalance is a central challenge in credit card fraud detection, as it directly impacts predictive reliability in real-world financial systems. To overcome this, the study proposes an enhanced workflow based on the Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM)-a transparent, state-of-the-art implementation of the GA2M algorithm-optimized through systematic hyperparameter tuning, feature selection, and preprocessing refinement. Rather than relying on conventional sampling techniques that may introduce bias or cause information loss, the optimized EBM achieves an effective balance between accuracy and interpretability, enabling precise detection of fraudulent transactions while providing actionable insights into feature importance and interaction effects. Furthermore, the Taguchi method is employed to optimize both the sequence of data scalers and model hyperparameters, ensuring robust, reproducible, and systematically validated performance improvements. Experimental evaluation on benchmark credit card data yields an ROC-AUC of 0.983, surpassing prior EBM baselines (0.975) and outperforming Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Decision Tree models. These results highlight the potential of interpretable machine learning and data-driven optimization for advancing trustworthy fraud analytics in financial systems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Cinematic video production requires control over scene-subject composition and camera movement, but live-action shooting remains costly due to the need for constructing physical sets. To address this, we introduce the task of cinematic video generation with decoupled scene context: given multiple images of a static environment, the goal is to synthesize high-quality videos featuring dynamic subject while preserving the underlying scene consistency and following a user-specified camera trajectory. We present CineScene, a framework that leverages implicit 3D-aware scene representation for cinematic video generation. Our key innovation is a novel context conditioning mechanism that injects 3D-aware features in an implicit way: By encoding scene images into visual representations through VGGT, CineScene injects spatial priors into a pretrained text-to-video generation model by additional context concatenation, enabling camera-controlled video synthesis with consistent scenes and dynamic subjects. To further enhance the model's robustness, we introduce a simple yet effective random-shuffling strategy for the input scene images during training. To address the lack of training data, we construct a scene-decoupled dataset with Unreal Engine 5, containing paired videos of scenes with and without dynamic subjects, panoramic images representing the underlying static scene, along with their camera trajectories. Experiments show that CineScene achieves state-of-the-art performance in scene-consistent cinematic video generation, handling large camera movements and demonstrating generalization across diverse environments.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Existing approaches for analyzing neural network activations, such as PCA and sparse autoencoders, rely on strong structural assumptions. Generative models offer an alternative: they can uncover structure without such assumptions and act as priors that improve intervention fidelity. We explore this direction by training diffusion models on one billion residual stream activations, creating "meta-models" that learn the distribution of a network's internal states. We find that diffusion loss decreases smoothly with compute and reliably predicts downstream utility. In particular, applying the meta-model's learned prior to steering interventions improves fluency, with larger gains as loss decreases. Moreover, the meta-model's neurons increasingly isolate concepts into individual units, with sparse probing scores that scale as loss decreases. These results suggest generative meta-models offer a scalable path toward interpretability without restrictive structural assumptions. Project page: this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have rapidly advanced, yet their adoption in medicine remains limited by gaps in domain coverage, modality alignment, and grounded reasoning. In this work, we introduce MedMO, a medical foundation model built upon a generalized MLLM architecture and trained exclusively on large-scale, domain-specific data. MedMO follows a multi-stage training recipe: (i) cross-modal pretraining to align heterogeneous visual encoders with a medical language backbone; (ii) instruction tuning on multi-task supervision that spans captioning, VQA, report generation, retrieval, and grounded disease localization with bounding boxes; and (iii) reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards that combine factuality checks with a box-level GIoU reward to strengthen spatial grounding and step-by-step reasoning in complex clinical scenarios. MedMO consistently outperforms strong open-source medical MLLMs across multiple modalities and tasks. On VQA benchmarks, MedMO achieves an average accuracy improvement of +13.7% over the baseline and performs within 1.9% of the SOTA Fleming-VL. For text-based QA, it attains +6.9% over the baseline and +14.5% over Fleming-VL. In medical report generation, MedMO delivers significant gains in both semantic and clinical accuracy. Moreover, it exhibits strong grounding capability, achieving an IoU improvement of +40.4 over the baseline and +37.0% over Fleming-VL, underscoring its robust spatial reasoning and localization performance. Evaluations across radiology, ophthalmology, and pathology-microscopy confirm MedMO's broad cross-modality generalization. We release two versions of MedMO: 4B and 8B.
