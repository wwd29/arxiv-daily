<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language model safety is usually assessed with static benchmarks, but key failures are dynamic: value drift under distribution shift, jailbreak attacks, and slow degradation of alignment in deployment. Building on a recent Second Law of Intelligence that treats ethical entropy as a state variable which tends to increase unless countered by alignment work, we make this framework operational for large language models. We define a five-way behavioral taxonomy, train a classifier to estimate ethical entropy S(t) from model transcripts, and measure entropy dynamics for base and instruction-tuned variants of four frontier models across stress tests. Base models show sustained entropy growth, while tuned variants suppress drift and reduce ethical entropy by roughly eighty percent. From these trajectories we estimate an effective alignment work rate gamma_eff and embed S(t) and gamma_eff in a monitoring pipeline that raises alerts when entropy drift exceeds a stability threshold, enabling run-time oversight of value drift.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We show for invertible problems that transform data from a source domain (for example, Logic Condition Tables (LCTs)) to a destination domain (for example, Hardware Description Language (HDL) code), an approach of using Large Language Models (LLMs) as a lossless encoder from source to destination followed by as a lossless decoder back to the source, comparable to lossless compression in information theory, can mitigate most of the LLM drawbacks of hallucinations and omissions. Specifically, using LCTs as inputs, we generate the full HDL for a two-dimensional network-on-chip router (13 units, 1500-2000 lines of code) using seven different LLMs, reconstruct the LCTs from the auto-generated HDL, and compare the original and reconstructed LCTs. This approach yields significant productivity improvements, not only confirming correctly generated LLM logic and detecting incorrectly generated LLM logic but also assisting developers in finding design specification errors.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated Learning (FL) holds the potential to advance equality in health by enabling diverse institutions to collaboratively train deep learning (DL) models, even with limited data. However, the significant resource requirements of FL often exclude centres with limited computational infrastructure, further widening existing healthcare disparities. To address this issue, we propose a Green AI-oriented adaptive layer-freezing strategy designed to reduce energy consumption and computational load while maintaining model performance. We tested our approach using different federated architectures for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-to-Computed Tomography (CT) conversion. The proposed adaptive strategy optimises the federated training by selectively freezing the encoder weights based on the monitored relative difference of the encoder weights from round to round. A patience-based mechanism ensures that freezing only occurs when updates remain consistently minimal. The energy consumption and CO2eq emissions of the federation were tracked using the CodeCarbon library. Compared to equivalent non-frozen counterparts, our approach reduced training time, total energy consumption and CO2eq emissions by up to 23%. At the same time, the MRI-to-CT conversion performance was maintained, with only small variations in the Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Notably, for three out of the five evaluated architectures, no statistically significant differences were observed, while two architectures exhibited statistically significant improvements. Our work aligns with a research paradigm that promotes DL-based frameworks meeting clinical requirements while ensuring climatic, social, and economic sustainability. It lays the groundwork for novel FL evaluation frameworks, advancing privacy, equity and, more broadly, justice in AI-driven healthcare.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, data-free</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models like Stable Diffusion (SD) drive a vibrant open-source ecosystem including fully fine-tuned checkpoints and parameter-efficient adapters such as LoRA, LyCORIS, and ControlNet. However, these adaptation components are tightly coupled to a specific base model, making them difficult to reuse when the base model is upgraded (e.g., from SD 1.x to 2.x) due to substantial changes in model parameters and architecture. In this work, we propose Delta Sampling (DS), a novel method that enables knowledge transfer across base models with different architectures, without requiring access to the original training data. DS operates entirely at inference time by leveraging the delta: the difference in model predictions before and after the adaptation of a base model. This delta is then used to guide the denoising process of a new base model. We evaluate DS across various SD versions, demonstrating that DS achieves consistent improvements in creating desired effects (e.g., visual styles, semantic concepts, and structures) under different sampling strategies. These results highlight DS as an effective, plug-and-play mechanism for knowledge transfer in diffusion-based image synthesis. Code:~ this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper investigates the dynamical properties of tokens in pre-trained Transformer models and explores their application to improving Transformers. To this end, we analyze the dynamical system governing the continuous-time limit of the pre-trained model and characterize the asymptotic behavior of its solutions. Specifically, we characterize when tokens move closer to or farther from one another over time, depending on the model parameters. We provide sufficient conditions, based on these parameters, to identify scenarios where tokens either converge to zero or diverge to infinity. Unlike prior works, our conditions are broader in scope and more applicable to real-world models. Furthermore, we investigate how different forms of positional encoding -- specifically absolute and rotary -- affect these dynamical regimes. Empirical evidence reveals that the convergence scenario adversely impacts model performance. Motivated by these insights, we propose simple refinements to Transformer architectures that mitigate convergence behavior in models with absolute or rotary positional encoding. These findings support theoretical foundations and design principles for improving Transformer models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) are very demanding in terms of their computational resources. Low-rank decompositions of LLM weights, e.g. via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), is a promising approach for LLM compression, but presents several practical hurdles, e.g. selecting appropriate layer-wise ranks and getting rid of its parameter redundancy. In this work, we present two physics-inspired improvements to SVD LLM compression: (1) \textbf{FermiGrad}, a gradient-descent algorithm that determines globally optimal layer-wise ranks by relaxing the discrete singular-value truncation into a continuous optimization using the Fermi function; (2) \textbf{PivGa}, an additional \textit{lossless} compression of the low-rank factors that exploits the intrinsic gauge freedom in their parametrization.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative AI agents in life sciences face a critical challenge: determining the optimal approach for diverse queries ranging from simple factoid questions to complex mechanistic reasoning. Traditional methods rely on fixed rules or expensive labeled training data, neither of which adapts to changing conditions or user preferences. We present a novel framework that combines AWS Strands Agents with Thompson Sampling contextual bandits to enable AI agents to learn optimal decision-making strategies from user feedback alone. Our system optimizes three key dimensions: generation strategy selection (direct vs. chain-of-thought), tool selection (literature search, drug databases, etc.), and domain routing (pharmacology, molecular biology, clinical specialists). Through empirical evaluation on life science queries, we demonstrate 15-30\% improvement in user satisfaction compared to random baselines, with clear learning patterns emerging after 20-30 queries. Our approach requires no ground truth labels, adapts continuously to user preferences, and provides a principled solution to the exploration-exploitation dilemma in agentic AI systems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, explainability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This article presents a novel pretopology-based algorithm designed to address the challenges of clustering mixed data without the need for dimensionality reduction. Leveraging Disjunctive Normal Form, our approach formulates customizable logical rules and adjustable hyperparameters that allow for user-defined hierarchical cluster construction and facilitate tailored solutions for heterogeneous datasets. Through hierarchical dendrogram analysis and comparative clustering metrics, our method demonstrates superior performance by accurately and interpretably delineating clusters directly from raw data, thus preserving data integrity. Empirical findings highlight the algorithm's robustness in constructing meaningful clusters and reveal its potential in overcoming issues related to clustered data explainability. The novelty of this work lies in its departure from traditional dimensionality reduction techniques and its innovative use of logical rules that enhance both cluster formation and clarity, thereby contributing a significant advancement to the discourse on clustering mixed data.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, protect, fair</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated exceptional efficacy in relational learning tasks, including node classification and link prediction. However, their application raises significant fairness concerns, as GNNs can perpetuate and even amplify societal biases against protected groups defined by sensitive attributes such as race or gender. These biases are often inherent in the node features, structural topology, and message-passing mechanisms of the graph itself. A critical limitation of existing fairness-aware GNN methods is their reliance on the strong assumption that sensitive attributes are fully available for all nodes during training--a condition that poses a practical impediment due to privacy concerns and data collection constraints. To address this gap, we propose a novel, model-agnostic fairness regularization framework designed for the realistic scenario where sensitive attributes are only partially available. Our approach formalizes a fairness-aware objective function that integrates both equal opportunity and statistical parity as differentiable regularization terms. Through a comprehensive empirical evaluation across five real-world benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method significantly mitigates bias across key fairness metrics while maintaining competitive node classification performance. Results show that our framework consistently outperforms baseline models in achieving a favorable fairness-accuracy trade-off, with minimal degradation in predictive accuracy.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>protect, attack, robust, extraction, watermark, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in natural language understanding and generation. Based on these LLMs, businesses have started to provide Embeddings-as-a-Service (EaaS), offering feature extraction capabilities (in the form of text embeddings) that benefit downstream natural language processing tasks. However, prior research has demonstrated that EaaS is vulnerable to imitation attacks, where an attacker clones the service's model in a black-box manner without access to the model's internal workings. In response, watermarks have been added to the text embeddings to protect the intellectual property of EaaS providers by allowing them to check for model ownership. This thesis focuses on defending against imitation attacks by investigating EaaS watermarks. To achieve this goal, we unveil novel attacks and propose and validate new watermarking techniques. Firstly, we show that existing EaaS watermarks can be removed through paraphrasing the input text when attackers clone the model during imitation attacks. Our study illustrates that paraphrasing can effectively bypass current state-of-the-art EaaS watermarks across various attack setups (including different paraphrasing techniques and models) and datasets in most instances. This demonstrates a new vulnerability in recent EaaS watermarking techniques. Subsequently, as a countermeasure, we propose a novel watermarking technique, WET (Watermarking EaaS with Linear Transformation), which employs linear transformation of the embeddings. Watermark verification is conducted by applying a reverse transformation and comparing the similarity between recovered and original embeddings. We demonstrate its robustness against paraphrasing attacks with near-perfect verifiability. We conduct detailed ablation studies to assess the significance of each component and hyperparameter in WET.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent studies have demonstrated that some Large Language Models exhibit choice-supportive bias (CSB) when performing evaluations, systematically favoring their chosen options and potentially compromising the objectivity of AI-assisted decision making. While existing debiasing approaches primarily target demographic and social biases, methods for addressing cognitive biases in LLMs remain largely unexplored. In this work, we present the first solution to address CSB through Reasoning Dependency Generation (RDG), a novel framework for generating unbiased reasoning data to mitigate choice-supportive bias through fine-tuning. RDG automatically constructs balanced reasoning QA pairs, explicitly (un)modeling the dependencies between choices, evidences, and justifications. Our approach is able to generate a large-scale dataset of QA pairs across domains, incorporating Contextual Dependency Data and Dependency Decouple Data. Experiments show that LLMs fine-tuned on RDG-generated data demonstrate a 81.5% improvement in memory-based experiments and 94.3% improvement in the evaluation-based experiment, while maintaining similar performance on standard BBQ benchmarks. This work pioneers an approach for addressing cognitive biases in LLMs and contributes to the development of more reliable AI-assisted decision support systems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Frontier AI developers may fail to align or control highly-capable AI agents. In many cases, it could be useful to have emergency shutdown mechanisms which effectively prevent misaligned agents from carrying out harmful actions in the world. We introduce password-activated shutdown protocols (PAS protocols) -- methods for designing frontier agents to implement a safe shutdown protocol when given a password. We motivate PAS protocols by describing intuitive use-cases in which they mitigate risks from misaligned systems that subvert other control efforts, for instance, by disabling automated monitors or self-exfiltrating to external data centres. PAS protocols supplement other safety efforts, such as alignment fine-tuning or monitoring, contributing to defence-in-depth against AI risk. We provide a concrete demonstration in SHADE-Arena, a benchmark for AI monitoring and subversion capabilities, in which PAS protocols supplement monitoring to increase safety with little cost to performance. Next, PAS protocols should be robust to malicious actors who want to bypass shutdown. Therefore, we conduct a red-team blue-team game between the developers (blue-team), who must implement a robust PAS protocol, and a red-team trying to subvert the protocol. We conduct experiments in a code-generation setting, finding that there are effective strategies for the red-team, such as using another model to filter inputs, or fine-tuning the model to prevent shutdown behaviour. We then outline key challenges to implementing PAS protocols in real-life systems, including: security considerations of the password and decisions regarding when, and in which systems, to use them. PAS protocols are an intuitive mechanism for increasing the safety of frontier AI. We encourage developers to consider implementing PAS protocols prior to internal deployment of particularly dangerous systems to reduce loss-of-control risks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>protect, attack, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The integration of large language models (LLMs) into healthcare IoT systems promises faster decisions and improved medical support. LLMs are also deployed as multi-agent teams to assist AI doctors by debating, voting, or advising on decisions. However, when multiple assistant agents interact, coordinated adversaries can collude to create false consensus, pushing an AI doctor toward harmful prescriptions. We develop an experimental framework with scripted and unscripted doctor agents, adversarial assistants, and a verifier agent that checks decisions against clinical guidelines. Using 50 representative clinical questions, we find that collusion drives the Attack Success Rate (ASR) and Harmful Recommendation Rates (HRR) up to 100% in unprotected systems. In contrast, the verifier agent restores 100% accuracy by blocking adversarial consensus. This work provides the first systematic evidence of collusion risk in AI healthcare and demonstrates a practical, lightweight defence that ensures guideline fidelity.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, defense, attack, membership infer, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Supervised Finetuning (SFT) have become the predominant paradigms for equipping Large Language Models (LLMs) with external knowledge for diverse, knowledge-intensive tasks. However, while such knowledge injection improves performance, it also exposes new attack surfaces. Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs), which aim to determine whether a given data sample was included in a model's training set, pose serious threats to privacy and trust in sensitive domains. To this end, we first systematically evaluate the vulnerability of RAG- and SFT-based LLMs to various MIAs. Then, to address the privacy risk, we further introduce a novel, model-agnostic defense framework, Ensemble Privacy Defense (EPD), which aggregates and evaluates the outputs of a knowledge-injected LLM, a base LLM, and a dedicated judge model to enhance resistance against MIAs. Comprehensive experiments show that, on average, EPD reduces MIA success by up to 27.8\% for SFT and 526.3\% for RAG compared to inference-time baseline, while maintaining answer quality.</li>

The challenge is that in these complex environments, the anomalies are sometimes highly contextual and also ambiguous, and thereby, uncertainty quantification (UQ) is a crucial capacity for an MLLM-based VAD system to succeed. In this paper, we introduce our UQ-supported MLLM-based VAD framework called ALARM. ALARM integrates UQ with quality-assurance techniques like reasoning chain, self-reflection, and MLLM ensemble for robust and accurate performance and is designed based on a rigorous probabilistic inference pipeline and computational process. Extensive empirical evaluations are conducted using the real-world smart-home benchmark data and wound image classification data, which shows ALARM's superior performance and its generic applicability across different domains for reliable decision-making.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In emergency response and other high-stakes societal applications, early-stage state estimates critically shape downstream outcomes. Yet, these initial state estimates-often based on limited or biased information-can be severely misaligned with reality, constraining subsequent actions and potentially causing catastrophic delays, resource misallocation, and human harm. Under the stationary bootstrap baseline (zero transition and no rejuvenation), bootstrap particle filters exhibit Stationarity-Induced Posterior Support Invariance (S-PSI), wherein regions excluded by the initial prior remain permanently unexplorable, making corrections impossible even when new evidence contradicts current beliefs. While classical perturbations can in principle break this lock-in, they operate in an always-on fashion and may be inefficient. To overcome this, we propose a diffusion-driven Bayesian exploration framework that enables principled, real-time correction of early state estimation errors. Our method expands posterior support via entropy-regularized sampling and covariance-scaled diffusion. A Metropolis-Hastings check validates proposals and keeps inference adaptive to unexpected evidence. Empirical evaluations on realistic hazardous-gas localization tasks show that our approach matches reinforcement learning and planning baselines when priors are correct. It substantially outperforms classical SMC perturbations and RL-based methods under misalignment, and we provide theoretical guarantees that DEPF resolves S-PSI while maintaining statistical rigor.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) produce fluent but unsupported answers - hallucinations - limiting safe deployment in high-stakes domains. We propose ECLIPSE, a framework that treats hallucination as a mismatch between a model's semantic entropy and the capacity of available evidence. We combine entropy estimation via multi-sample clustering with a novel perplexity decomposition that measures how models use retrieved evidence. We prove that under mild conditions, the resulting entropy-capacity objective is strictly convex with a unique stable optimum. We evaluate on a controlled financial question answering dataset with GPT-3.5-turbo (n=200 balanced samples with synthetic hallucinations), where ECLIPSE achieves ROC AUC of 0.89 and average precision of 0.90, substantially outperforming a semantic entropy-only baseline (AUC 0.50). A controlled ablation with Claude-3-Haiku, which lacks token-level log probabilities, shows AUC dropping to 0.59 with coefficient magnitudes decreasing by 95% - demonstrating that ECLIPSE is a logprob-native mechanism whose effectiveness depends on calibrated token-level uncertainties. The perplexity decomposition features exhibit the largest learned coefficients, confirming that evidence utilization is central to hallucination detection. We position this work as a controlled mechanism study; broader validation across domains and naturally occurring hallucinations remains future work.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>explainability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Shapley values, a gold standard for feature attribution in Explainable AI, face two primary challenges. First, the canonical Shapley framework assumes that the worth function is additive, yet real-world payoff constructions--driven by non-Gaussian distributions, heavy tails, feature dependence, or domain-specific loss scales--often violate this assumption, leading to distorted attributions. Secondly, achieving sparse explanations in high dimensions by computing dense Shapley values and then applying ad hoc thresholding is prohibitively costly and risks inconsistency. We introduce Sparse Isotonic Shapley Regression (SISR), a unified nonlinear explanation framework. SISR simultaneously learns a monotonic transformation to restore additivity--obviating the need for a closed-form specification--and enforces an L0 sparsity constraint on the Shapley vector, enhancing computational efficiency in large feature spaces. Its optimization algorithm leverages Pool-Adjacent-Violators for efficient isotonic regression and normalized hard-thresholding for support selection, yielding implementation ease and global convergence guarantees. Analysis shows that SISR recovers the true transformation in a wide range of scenarios and achieves strong support recovery even in high noise. Moreover, we are the first to demonstrate that irrelevant features and inter-feature dependencies can induce a true payoff transformation that deviates substantially from linearity. Experiments in regression, logistic regression, and tree ensembles demonstrate that SISR stabilizes attributions across payoff schemes, correctly filters irrelevant features while standard Shapley values suffer severe rank and sign distortions. By unifying nonlinear transformation estimation with sparsity pursuit, SISR advances the frontier of nonlinear explainability, providing a theoretically grounded and practical attribution framework.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Reliable real-time analysis of sensor data is essential for structural health monitoring (SHM) of high-value assets, yet a major challenge is to obtain spatially resolved full-field aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties for trustworthy decision-making. We present an integrated SHM framework that combines principal component analysis (PCA), a Bayesian neural network (BNN), and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) inference, mapping sparse strain gauge measurements onto leading PCA modes to reconstruct full-field strain distributions with uncertainty quantification. The framework was validated through cyclic four-point bending tests on carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) specimens with varying crack lengths, achieving accurate strain field reconstruction (R squared value > 0.9) while simultaneously producing real-time uncertainty fields. A key contribution is that the BNN yields robust full-field strain reconstructions from noisy experimental data with crack-induced strain singularities, while also providing explicit representations of two complementary uncertainty fields. Considered jointly in full-field form, the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty fields make it possible to diagnose at a local level, whether low-confidence regions are driven by data-inherent issues or by model-related limitations, thereby supporting reliable decision-making. Collectively, the results demonstrate that the proposed framework advances SHM toward trustworthy digital twin deployment and risk-aware structural diagnostics.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, membership infer, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Multimodal Language Models (MLLMs) are emerging as one of the foundational tools in an expanding range of applications. Consequently, understanding training-data leakage in these systems is increasingly critical. Log-probability-based membership inference attacks (MIAs) have become a widely adopted approach for assessing data exposure in large language models (LLMs), yet their effect in MLLMs remains unclear. We present the first comprehensive evaluation of extending these text-based MIA methods to multimodal settings. Our experiments under vision-and-text (V+T) and text-only (T-only) conditions across the DeepSeek-VL and InternVL model families show that in in-distribution settings, logit-based MIAs perform comparably across configurations, with a slight V+T advantage. Conversely, in out-of-distribution settings, visual inputs act as regularizers, effectively masking membership signals.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Unified Multimodal Generative Models (UMGMs) unify visual understanding and image generation within a single autoregressive framework. However, their ability to continually learn new tasks is severely hindered by catastrophic forgetting, both within a modality (intra-modal) and across modalities (inter-modal). While intra-modal forgetting has been studied in prior continual learning (CL) work, inter-modal forgetting remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we identify and empirically validate this phenomenon in UMGMs and provide a theoretical explanation rooted in gradient conflict between modalities. To address both intra- and inter-modal forgetting, we propose Modality-Decoupled Experts (MoDE), a lightweight and scalable architecture that isolates modality-specific updates to mitigate the gradient conflict and leverages knowledge distillation to prevent catastrophic forgetting and preserve pre-trained capabilities. Unlike previous CL methods that remain modality-coupled and suffer from modality gradient conflict, MoDE explicitly decouples modalities to prevent interference. Experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that MoDE significantly mitigates both inter- and intra-modal forgetting, outperforming prior CL baselines in unified multimodal generation settings.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Symbolic computer vision represents diagrams through explicit logical rules and structured representations, enabling interpretable understanding in machine vision. This requires fundamentally different learning paradigms from pixel-based visual models. Symbolic visual learners parse diagrams into geometric primitives-points, lines, and shapes-whereas pixel-based learners operate on textures and colors. We propose a novel self-supervised symbolic auto-encoder that encodes diagrams into structured primitives and their interrelationships within the latent space, and decodes them through our executable engine to reconstruct the input diagrams. Central to this architecture is Symbolic Hierarchical Process Reward Modeling, which applies hierarchical step-level parsing rewards to enforce point-on-line, line-on-shape, and shape-on-relation consistency. Since vanilla reinforcement learning exhibits poor exploration in the policy space during diagram reconstruction; we thus introduce stabilization mechanisms to balance exploration and exploitation. We fine-tune our symbolic encoder on downstream tasks, developing a neuro-symbolic system that integrates the reasoning capabilities of neural networks with the interpretability of symbolic models through reasoning-grounded visual rewards. Evaluations across reconstruction, perception, and reasoning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach: achieving a 98.2% reduction in MSE for geometric diagram reconstruction, surpassing GPT-4o by 0.6% with a 7B model on chart reconstruction, and improving by +13% on the MathGlance perception benchmark, and by +3% on MathVerse and GeoQA reasoning benchmarks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a cornerstone technique for determining the structures of small molecules and is especially critical in the discovery of novel natural products and clinical therapeutics. Yet, interpreting NMR spectra remains a time-consuming, manual process requiring extensive domain expertise. We introduce ChefNMR (CHemical Elucidation From NMR), an end-to-end framework that directly predicts an unknown molecule's structure solely from its 1D NMR spectra and chemical formula. We frame structure elucidation as conditional generation from an atomic diffusion model built on a non-equivariant transformer architecture. To model the complex chemical groups found in natural products, we generated a dataset of simulated 1D NMR spectra for over 111,000 natural products. ChefNMR predicts the structures of challenging natural product compounds with an unsurpassed accuracy of over 65%. This work takes a significant step toward solving the grand challenge of automating small-molecule structure elucidation and highlights the potential of deep learning in accelerating molecular discovery.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Wastewater-based genomic surveillance has emerged as a powerful tool for population-level viral monitoring, offering comprehensive insights into circulating viral variants across entire communities. However, this approach faces significant computational challenges stemming from high sequencing noise, low viral coverage, fragmented reads, and the complete absence of labeled variant annotations. Traditional reference-based variant calling pipelines struggle with novel mutations and require extensive computational resources. We present a comprehensive framework for unsupervised viral variant detection using Vector-Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAE) that learns discrete codebooks of genomic patterns from k-mer tokenized sequences without requiring reference genomes or variant labels. Our approach extends the base VQ-VAE architecture with masked reconstruction pretraining for robustness to missing data and contrastive learning for highly discriminative embeddings. Evaluated on SARS-CoV-2 wastewater sequencing data comprising approximately 100,000 reads, our VQ-VAE achieves 99.52% mean token-level accuracy and 56.33% exact sequence match rate while maintaining 19.73% codebook utilization (101 of 512 codes active), demonstrating efficient discrete representation learning. Contrastive fine-tuning with different projection dimensions yields substantial clustering improvements: 64-dimensional embeddings achieve +35% Silhouette score improvement (0.31 to 0.42), while 128-dimensional embeddings achieve +42% improvement (0.31 to 0.44), clearly demonstrating the impact of embedding dimensionality on variant discrimination capability. Our reference-free framework provides a scalable, interpretable approach to genomic surveillance with direct applications to public health monitoring.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Modern deep learning faces significant challenges with noisy labels, class ambiguity, as well as the need to robustly reject out-of-distribution or corrupted samples. In this work, we propose a unified framework based on the concept of a "drainage node'' which we add at the output of the network. The node serves to reallocate probability mass toward uncertainty, while preserving desirable properties such as end-to-end training and differentiability. This mechanism provides a natural escape route for highly ambiguous, anomalous, or noisy samples, particularly relevant for instance-dependent and asymmetric label noise. In systematic experiments involving the addition of varying proportions of instance-dependent noise or asymmetric noise to CIFAR-10/100 labels, our drainage formulation achieves an accuracy increase of up to 9\% over existing approaches in the high-noise regime. Our results on real-world datasets, such as mini-WebVision, mini-ImageNet and Clothing-1M, match or surpass existing state-of-the-art methods. Qualitative analysis reveals a denoising effect, where the drainage neuron consistently absorbs corrupt, mislabeled, or outlier data, leading to more stable decision boundaries. Furthermore, our drainage formulation enables applications well beyond classification, with immediate benefits for web-scale, semi-supervised dataset cleaning, and open-set applications.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This study investigates the potential of language models to improve the classification of labor market information by linking job vacancy texts to two major European frameworks: the European Skills, Competences, Qualifications and Occupations (ESCO) taxonomy and the European Qualifications Framework (EQF). We examine and compare two prominent methodologies from the literature: Sentence Linking and Entity Linking. In support of ongoing research, we release an open-source tool, incorporating these two methodologies, designed to facilitate further work on labor classification and employment discourse. To move beyond surface-level skill extraction, we introduce two annotated datasets specifically aimed at evaluating how occupations and qualifications are represented within job vacancy texts. Additionally, we examine different ways to utilize generative large language models for this task. Our findings contribute to advancing the state of the art in job entity extraction and offer computational infrastructure for examining work, skills, and labor market narratives in a digitally mediated economy.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the ability to understand and generate text, enabling significant progress in automatic knowledge graph construction from text (Text2KG). Many Text2KG methods, however, rely on iterative LLM prompting, making them computationally expensive and prone to overlooking complex relations distributed throughout the text. To address these limitations, we propose InvertiTune, a framework that combines a controlled data generation pipeline with supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Within this framework, the data-generation pipeline systematically extracts subgraphs from large knowledge bases, applies noise filtering, and leverages LLMs to generate corresponding natural text descriptions, a task more aligned with LLM capabilities than direct KG generation from text. This pipeline enables generating datasets composed of longer texts paired with larger KGs that better reflect real-world scenarios compared to existing benchmarks, thus supporting effective SFT of lightweight models for single-shot KG construction. Experimental results on CE12k, a dataset generated using the introduced pipeline, show that InvertiTune outperforms larger non-fine-tuned LLMs as well as state-of-the-art Text2KG approaches, while also demonstrating stronger cross-dataset generalization on CrossEval-1200, a test set created from three established benchmark datasets and CE12k. These findings highlight the importance of realistic, high-quality training data for advancing efficient and high-performing Text2KG systems.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Biometric facial recognition models often demonstrate significant decreases in accuracy when processing real-world images, often characterized by poor quality, non-frontal subject poses, and subject occlusions. We investigate whether targeted, AI-driven, head-pose correction and image restoration can improve recognition accuracy. Using a model-agnostic, large-scale, forensic-evaluation pipeline, we assess the impact of three restoration approaches: 3D reconstruction (NextFace), 2D frontalization (CFR-GAN), and feature enhancement (CodeFormer). We find that naive application of these techniques substantially degrades facial recognition accuracy. However, we also find that selective application of CFR-GAN combined with CodeFormer yields meaningful improvements.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The Privacy Sandbox, launched in 2019, is a series of proposals from Google to reduce ``cross-site and cross-app tracking while helping to keep online content and services free for all''. Over the years, Google implemented, experimented, and deprecated some of these APIs into their own products (Chrome, Android, etc.) which raised concerns about the potential of these mechanisms to fundamentally disrupt the advertising, mobile, and web ecosystems. As a result, it is paramount for researchers to understand the consequences that these new technologies, and future ones, will have on billions of users if and when deployed. In this report, we outline our call for privacy, security, usability, and utility evaluations of these APIs, our efforts materialized through the creation and operation of Privacy Sandstorm (this https URL); a research portal to systematically gather resources (overview, analyses, artifacts, etc.) about such proposals.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Zero-shot object counting attempts to estimate the number of object instances belonging to novel categories that the vision model performing the counting has never encountered during training. Existing methods typically require large amount of annotated data and often require visual exemplars to guide the counting process. However, large language models (LLMs) are powerful tools with remarkable reasoning and data understanding abilities, which suggest the possibility of utilizing them for counting tasks without any supervision. In this work we aim to leverage the visual capabilities of two multi-modal LLMs, GPT-4o and GPT-5, to perform object counting in a zero-shot manner using only textual prompts. We evaluate both models on the FSC-147 and CARPK datasets and provide a comparative analysis. Our findings show that the models achieve performance comparable to the state-of-the-art zero-shot approaches on FSC-147, in some cases, even surpass them.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Most existing 3D shape datasets and models focus solely on geometry, overlooking the material properties that determine how objects appear. We introduce a two-stage large language model (LLM) based method for inferring material composition directly from 3D point clouds with coarse segmentations. Our key insight is to decouple reasoning about what an object is from what it is made of. In the first stage, an LLM predicts the object's semantic; in the second stage, it assigns plausible materials to each geometric segment, conditioned on the inferred semantics. Both stages operate in a zero-shot manner, without task-specific training. Because existing datasets lack reliable material annotations, we evaluate our method using an LLM-as-a-Judge implemented in DeepEval. Across 1,000 shapes from Fusion/ABS and ShapeNet, our method achieves high semantic and material plausibility. These results demonstrate that language models can serve as general-purpose priors for bridging geometric reasoning and material understanding in 3D data.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, protect</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>High quality data is needed to unlock the full potential of AI for end users. However finding new sources of such data is getting harder: most publicly-available human generated data will soon have been used. Additionally, publicly available data often is not representative of users of a particular system -- for example, a research speech dataset of contractors interacting with an AI assistant will likely be more homogeneous, well articulated and self-censored than real world commands that end users will issue. Therefore unlocking high-quality data grounded in real user interactions is of vital interest. However, the direct use of user data comes with significant privacy risks. Differential Privacy (DP) is a well established framework for reasoning about and limiting information leakage, and is a gold standard for protecting user privacy. The focus of this work, \emph{Differentially Private Synthetic data}, refers to synthetic data that preserves the overall trends of source data,, while providing strong privacy guarantees to individuals that contributed to the source dataset. DP synthetic data can unlock the value of datasets that have previously been inaccessible due to privacy concerns and can replace the use of sensitive datasets that previously have only had rudimentary protections like ad-hoc rule-based anonymization. In this paper we explore the full suite of techniques surrounding DP synthetic data, the types of privacy protections they offer and the state-of-the-art for various modalities (image, tabular, text and decentralized). We outline all the components needed in a system that generates DP synthetic data, from sensitive data handling and preparation, to tracking the use and empirical privacy testing. We hope that work will result in increased adoption of DP synthetic data, spur additional research and increase trust in DP synthetic data approaches.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Process reward models (PRMs) that provide dense, step-level feedback have shown promise for reinforcement learning, yet their adoption remains limited by the need for expensive step-level annotations or ground truth references. We propose SPARK: a three-stage framework where in the first stage a generator model produces diverse solutions and a verifier model evaluates them using parallel scaling (self-consistency) and sequential scaling (meta-critique). In the second stage, we use these verification outputs as synthetic training data to fine-tune generative process reward models, which subsequently serve as reward signals during training. We show that aggregating multiple independent verifications at the step level produces training data for process reward models that surpass ground-truth outcome supervision, achieving 67.5 F1 on ProcessBench (a benchmark for identifying erroneous steps in mathematical reasoning) compared to 66.4 for reference-guided training and 61.9 for GPT-4o. In the final stage, we apply our generative PRM with chain-of-thought verification (PRM-CoT) as the reward model in RL experiments on mathematical reasoning, and introduce format constraints to prevent reward hacking. Using Qwen2.5-Math-7B, we achieve 47.4% average accuracy across six mathematical reasoning benchmarks, outperforming ground-truth-based RLVR (43.9%). Our work enables reference-free RL training that exceeds ground-truth methods, opening new possibilities for domains lacking verifiable answers or accessible ground truth.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) have markedly advanced the quality of image inpainting and local editing. However, the inherent latent compression often introduces pixel-level inconsistencies, such as chromatic shifts, texture mismatches, and visible seams along editing boundaries. Existing remedies, including background-conditioned latent decoding and pixel-space harmonization, usually fail to fully eliminate these artifacts in practice and do not generalize well across different latent representations or tasks. We introduce PixPerfect, a pixel-level refinement framework that delivers seamless, high-fidelity local edits across diverse LDM architectures and tasks. PixPerfect leverages (i) a differentiable discriminative pixel space that amplifies and suppresses subtle color and texture discrepancies, (ii) a comprehensive artifact simulation pipeline that exposes the refiner to realistic local editing artifacts during training, and (iii) a direct pixel-space refinement scheme that ensures broad applicability across diverse latent representations and tasks. Extensive experiments on inpainting, object removal, and insertion benchmarks demonstrate that PixPerfect substantially enhances perceptual fidelity and downstream editing performance, establishing a new standard for robust and high-fidelity localized image editing.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Rapid and accurate wildfire detection is crucial for emergency response and environmental management. In airborne and spaceborne missions, real-time algorithms must distinguish between no fire, active fire, and post-fire conditions, and estimate fire intensity. Multispectral and hyperspectral thermal imagers provide rich spectral information, but high data dimensionality and limited onboard resources make real-time processing challenging. As wildfires increase in frequency and severity, the need for low-latency and computationally efficient onboard detection methods is critical. We present a systematic evaluation of multiple deep learning architectures, including custom Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based models, for multi-class fire classification. We also introduce PyroFocus, a two-stage pipeline that performs fire classification followed by fire radiative power (FRP) regression or segmentation to reduce inference time and computational cost for onboard deployment. Using data from NASA's MODIS/ASTER Airborne Simulator (MASTER), which is similar to a next-generation fire detection sensor, we compare accuracy, inference latency, and resource efficiency. Experimental results show that the proposed two-stage pipeline achieves strong trade-offs between speed and accuracy, demonstrating significant potential for real-time edge deployment in future wildfire monitoring missions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Training vision language models (VLMs) aims to align visual representations from a vision encoder with the textual representations of a pretrained large language model (LLM). However, many VLMs exhibit reduced factual recall performance compared to their LLM backbones, raising the question of how effective multimodal fine-tuning is at extending existing mechanisms within the LLM to visual inputs. We argue that factual recall based on visual inputs requires VLMs to solve a two-hop problem: (1) forming entity representations from visual inputs, and (2) recalling associated factual knowledge based on these entity representations. By benchmarking 14 VLMs with various architectures (LLaVA, Native, Cross-Attention), sizes (7B-124B parameters), and training setups on factual recall tasks against their original LLM backbone models, we find that 11 of 14 models exhibit factual recall degradation. We select three models with high and two models with low performance degradation, and use attribution patching, activation patching, and probing to show that degraded VLMs struggle to use the existing factual recall circuit of their LLM backbone, because they resolve the first hop too late in the computation. In contrast, high-performing VLMs resolve entity representations early enough to reuse the existing factual recall mechanism. Finally, we demonstrate two methods to recover performance: patching entity representations from the LLM backbone into the VLM, and prompting with chain-of-thought reasoning. Our results highlight that the speed of early entity resolution critically determines how effective VLMs are in using preexisting LLM mechanisms. More broadly, our work illustrates how mechanistic analysis can explain and unveil systematic failures in multimodal alignment.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>fair, diffusion, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Despite progress in machine learning-based aerodynamic surrogates, the scarcity of large, field-resolved datasets limits progress on accurate pointwise prediction and reproducible inverse design for aircraft. We introduce BlendedNet++, a large-scale aerodynamic dataset and benchmark focused on blended wing body (BWB) aircraft. The dataset contains over 12,000 unique geometries, each simulated at a single flight condition, yielding 12,490 aerodynamic results for steady RANS CFD. For every case, we provide (i) integrated force/moment coefficients CL, CD, CM and (ii) dense surface fields of pressure and skin friction coefficients Cp and (Cfx, Cfy, Cfz). Using this dataset, we standardize a forward-surrogate benchmark to predict pointwise fields across six model families: GraphSAGE, GraphUNet, PointNet, a coordinate Transformer (Transolver-style), a FiLMNet (coordinate MLP with feature-wise modulation), and a Graph Neural Operator Transformer (GNOT). Finally, we present an inverse design task of achieving a specified lift-to-drag ratio under fixed flight conditions, implemented via a conditional diffusion model. To assess performance, we benchmark this approach against gradient-based optimization on the same surrogate and a diffusion-optimization hybrid that first samples with the conditional diffusion model and then further optimizes the designs. BlendedNet++ provides a unified forward and inverse protocol with multi-model baselines, enabling fair, reproducible comparison across architectures and optimization paradigms. We expect BlendedNet++ to catalyze reproducible research in field-level aerodynamics and inverse design; resources (dataset, splits, baselines, and scripts) will be released upon acceptance.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Human Activity Recognition (HAR) benefits various application domains, including health and elderly care. Traditional HAR involves constructing pipelines reliant on centralized user data, which can pose privacy concerns as they necessitate the uploading of user data to a centralized server. This work proposes multi-frequency Federated Learning (FL) to enable: (1) privacy-aware ML; (2) joint ML model learning across devices with varying sampling frequency. We focus on head-worn devices (e.g., earbuds and smart glasses), a relatively unexplored domain compared to traditional smartwatch- or smartphone-based HAR. Results have shown improvements on two datasets against frequency-specific approaches, indicating a promising future in the multi-frequency FL-HAR task. The proposed network's implementation is publicly available for further research and development.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful, mesh-free paradigm for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, they notoriously struggle with stiff, multi-scale, and nonlinear systems due to the inherent spectral bias of standard multilayer perceptron (MLP) architectures, which prevents them from adequately representing high-frequency components. In this work, we introduce the Adaptive Spectral Physics-Enabled Network (ASPEN), a novel architecture designed to overcome this critical limitation. ASPEN integrates an adaptive spectral layer with learnable Fourier features directly into the network's input stage. This mechanism allows the model to dynamically tune its own spectral basis during training, enabling it to efficiently learn and represent the precise frequency content required by the solution. We demonstrate the efficacy of ASPEN by applying it to the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation (CGLE), a canonical and challenging benchmark for nonlinear, stiff spatio-temporal dynamics. Our results show that a standard PINN architecture catastrophically fails on this problem, diverging into non-physical oscillations. In contrast, ASPEN successfully solves the CGLE with exceptional accuracy. The predicted solution is visually indistinguishable from the high-resolution ground truth, achieving a low median physics residual of 5.10 x 10^-3. Furthermore, we validate that ASPEN's solution is not only pointwise accurate but also physically consistent, correctly capturing emergent physical properties, including the rapid free energy relaxation and the long-term stability of the domain wall front. This work demonstrates that by incorporating an adaptive spectral basis, our framework provides a robust and physically-consistent solver for complex dynamical systems where standard PINNs fail, opening new options for machine learning in challenging physical domains.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The development of tabular foundation models (TFMs) has accelerated in recent years, showing strong potential to outperform traditional ML methods for structured data. A key finding is that TFMs can be pretrained entirely on synthetic datasets, opening opportunities to design data generators that encourage desirable model properties. Prior work has mainly focused on crafting high-quality priors over generators to improve overall pretraining performance. Our insight is that parameterizing the generator distribution enables an adversarial robustness perspective: during training, we can adapt the generator to emphasize datasets that are particularly challenging for the model. We formalize this by introducing an optimality gap measure, given by the difference between TFM performance and the best achievable performance as estimated by strong baselines such as XGBoost, CatBoost, and Random Forests. Building on this idea, we propose Robust Tabular Foundation Models (RTFM), a model-agnostic adversarial training framework. Applied to the TabPFN V2 classifier, RTFM improves benchmark performance, with up to a 6% increase in mean normalized AUC over the original TabPFN and other baseline algorithms, while requiring less than 100k additional synthetic datasets. These results highlight a promising new direction for targeted adversarial training and fine-tuning of TFMs using synthetic data alone.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The current literature on memorization in Natural Language Models, especially Large Language Models (LLMs), poses severe security and privacy risks, as models tend to memorize personally identifying information (PIIs) from training data. We introduce Randomized Masked Fine-Tuning (RMFT), a novel privacy-preserving fine-tuning technique that reduces PII memorization while minimizing performance impact. Using the Enron Email Dataset, we demonstrate that RMFT achieves an 80.81% reduction in Total Extraction Rate and 80.17% reduction in Seen Extraction Rate compared to baseline fine-tuning, outperforming deduplication methods while maintaining only a 5.73% increase in perplexity. We present MaxTER, a Pareto-optimal evaluation framework for assessing privacy-utility tradeoffs, and show the performance of RMFT vs Deduplication by Area Under The Response Curve (AURC) metric.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Accurate environmental representations are essential for autonomous driving, providing the foundation for safe and efficient navigation. Traditionally, high-definition (HD) maps are providing this representation of the static road infrastructure to the autonomous system a priori. However, because the real world is constantly changing, such maps must be constructed online from on-board sensor data. Navigation-grade standard-definition (SD) maps are widely available, but their resolution is insufficient for direct deployment. Instead, they can be used as coarse prior to guide the online map construction process. We propose NavMapFusion, a diffusion-based framework that performs iterative denoising conditioned on high-fidelity sensor data and on low-fidelity navigation maps. This paper strives to answer: (1) How can coarse, potentially outdated navigation maps guide online map construction? (2) What advantages do diffusion models offer for map fusion? We demonstrate that diffusion-based map construction provides a robust framework for map fusion. Our key insight is that discrepancies between the prior map and online perception naturally correspond to noise within the diffusion process; consistent regions reinforce the map construction, whereas outdated segments are suppressed. On the nuScenes benchmark, NavMapFusion conditioned on coarse road lines from OpenStreetMap data reaches a 21.4% relative improvement on 100 m, and even stronger improvements on larger perception ranges, while maintaining real-time capabilities. By fusing low-fidelity priors with high-fidelity sensor data, the proposed method generates accurate and up-to-date environment representations, guiding towards safer and more reliable autonomous driving.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Memory and computation remain core bottlenecks in long-horizon LLM inference due to the quadratic cost of self-attention and the ever-growing key-value (KV) cache. Existing strategies for memory-bounded inference, such as quantization, offloading, or heuristic KV eviction, either incur high orchestration costs or rely on unreliable attention-based proxies of importance. We propose TRIM-KV, a novel approach that learns each token's intrinsic importance at creation time via a lightweight retention gate. Each gate predicts a scalar retention score that decays over time, reflecting the long-term utility of the token for a specific layer and head. Tokens with low scores are evicted when the memory budget is exceeded, ensuring that the cache always contains the most critical tokens. TRIM-KV is trained efficiently through distillation from a frozen LLM combined with a capacity loss, requiring only gate fine-tuning and adding negligible inference overhead. Across mathematical reasoning (GSM8K, MATH-500, AIME24), procedural generation (LongProc), conversational long-memory benchmarks (LongMemEval), and long-context understanding (LongBench and SCBench), TRIM-KV consistently outperforms strong eviction and learnable retrieval baselines, especially in low-memory regimes. Remarkably, it even surpasses full-cache models in some settings, showing that selective retention can serve as a form of regularization, suppressing noise from uninformative tokens. Qualitative analyses further reveal that learned retention scores align with human intuition, naturally recovering heuristics such as sink tokens, sliding windows, and gist compression without explicit design. Beyond efficiency, retention scores provide insights into layer- and head-specific roles, suggesting a new path toward LLM interpretability.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This study presents an LLM-assisted annotation pipeline for the sociolinguistic and topical analysis of bilingual discourse in two typologically distinct contexts: Spanish-English and Spanish-Guaraní. Using large language models, we automatically labeled topic, genre, and discourse-pragmatic functions across a total of 3,691 code-switched sentences, integrated demographic metadata from the Miami Bilingual Corpus, and enriched the Spanish-Guaraní dataset with new topic annotations. The resulting distributions reveal systematic links between gender, language dominance, and discourse function in the Miami data, and a clear diglossic division between formal Guaraní and informal Spanish in Paraguayan texts. These findings replicate and extend earlier interactional and sociolinguistic observations with corpus-scale quantitative evidence. The study demonstrates that large language models can reliably recover interpretable sociolinguistic patterns traditionally accessible only through manual annotation, advancing computational methods for cross-linguistic and low-resource bilingual research.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated Learning (FL) is plagued by two key challenges: high communication overhead and performance collapse on heterogeneous (non-IID) data. Analytic FL (AFL) provides a single-round, data distribution invariant solution, but is limited to linear models. Subsequent non-linear approaches, like DeepAFL, regain accuracy but sacrifice the single-round benefit. In this work, we break this trade-off. We propose SAFLe, a framework that achieves scalable non-linear expressivity by introducing a structured head of bucketed features and sparse, grouped embeddings. We prove this non-linear architecture is mathematically equivalent to a high-dimensional linear regression. This key equivalence allows SAFLe to be solved with AFL's single-shot, invariant aggregation law. Empirically, SAFLe establishes a new state-of-the-art for analytic FL, significantly outperforming both linear AFL and multi-round DeepAFL in accuracy across all benchmarks, demonstrating a highly efficient and scalable solution for federated vision.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>explainability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Ejection fraction (EF) is a crucial metric for assessing cardiac function and diagnosing conditions such as heart failure. Traditionally, EF estimation requires manual tracing and domain expertise, making the process time-consuming and subject to interobserver variability. Most current deep learning methods for EF prediction are black-box models with limited transparency, which reduces clinical trust. Some post-hoc explainability methods have been proposed to interpret the decision-making process after the prediction is made. However, these explanations do not guide the model's internal reasoning and therefore offer limited reliability in clinical applications. To address this, we introduce ProtoEFNet, a novel video-based prototype learning model for continuous EF regression. The model learns dynamic spatiotemporal prototypes that capture clinically meaningful cardiac motion patterns. Additionally, the proposed Prototype Angular Separation (PAS) loss enforces discriminative representations across the continuous EF spectrum. Our experiments on the EchonetDynamic dataset show that ProtoEFNet can achieve accuracy on par with its non-interpretable counterpart while providing clinically relevant insight. The ablation study shows that the proposed loss boosts performance with a 2% increase in F1 score from 77.67$\pm$2.68 to 79.64$\pm$2.10. Our source code is available at: this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Automatic medical text simplification plays a key role in improving health literacy by making complex biomedical research accessible to diverse readers. However, most existing resources assume a single generic audience, overlooking the wide variation in medical literacy and information needs across user groups. To address this limitation, we introduce PERCS (Persona-guided Controllable Summarization), a dataset of biomedical abstracts paired with summaries tailored to four personas: Laypersons, Premedical Students, Non-medical Researchers, and Medical Experts. These personas represent different levels of medical literacy and information needs, emphasizing the need for targeted, audience-specific summarization. Each summary in PERCS was reviewed by physicians for factual accuracy and persona alignment using a detailed error taxonomy. Technical validation shows clear differences in readability, vocabulary, and content depth across personas. Along with describing the dataset, we benchmark four large language models on PERCS using automatic evaluation metrics that assess comprehensiveness, readability, and faithfulness, establishing baseline results for future research. The dataset, annotation guidelines, and evaluation materials are publicly available to support research on persona-specific communication and controllable biomedical summarization.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Autoregressive Language Models (LLMs) trained on Next-Token Prediction (NTP) often suffer from ``Topic Drift'' where the generation wanders away from the initial prompt due to a reliance on local associations rather than global planning \citep{holtzman2019curious}. While scaling model size mitigates this \citep{brown2020language}, the fundamental myopia of the NTP objective remains. In this work, we introduce the Idea-Gated Transformer, a novel architecture that separates semantic planning from syntactic generation. We introduce an auxiliary ``Idea Head'' trained to predict the bag-of-words distribution for a future context window, creating a latent ``Concept Vector'' that actively gates the main vocabulary during generation. We propose a differentiable gating mechanism that suppresses semantically irrelevant tokens, effectively pruning the search space in real-time. Experiments on WikiText-103 demonstrate that while the Idea-Gated model achieves comparable validation perplexity to a standard GPT-2 baseline, it exhibits significantly superior Domain Retention. Qualitative and quantitative analysis reveals that the gating mechanism successfully locks generation into specific semantic clusters (e.g., Finance, Science) and resists associative drift, offering a parameter-efficient path toward more controllable language modeling.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative models are prone to hallucinations: plausible but incorrect structures absent in the ground truth. This issue is problematic in image restoration for safety-critical domains such as medical imaging, industrial inspection, and remote sensing, where such errors undermine reliability and trust. For example, in low-field MRI, widely used in resource-limited settings, restoration models are essential for enhancing low-quality scans, yet hallucinations can lead to serious diagnostic errors. Progress has been hindered by a circular dependency: evaluating hallucinations requires labeled data, yet such labels are costly and subjective. We introduce HalluGen, a diffusion-based framework that synthesizes realistic hallucinations with controllable type, location, and severity, producing perceptually realistic but semantically incorrect outputs (segmentation IoU drops from 0.86 to 0.36). Using HalluGen, we construct the first large-scale hallucination dataset comprising 4,350 annotated images derived from 1,450 brain MR images for low-field enhancement, enabling systematic evaluation of hallucination detection and mitigation. We demonstrate its utility in two applications: (1) benchmarking image quality metrics and developing Semantic Hallucination Assessment via Feature Evaluation (SHAFE), a feature-based metric with soft-attention pooling that improves hallucination sensitivity over traditional metrics; and (2) training reference-free hallucination detectors that generalize to real restoration failures. Together, HalluGen and its open dataset establish the first scalable foundation for evaluating hallucinations in safety-critical image restoration.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The detection of weak, spatially distributed anomalies in volumetric medical imaging remains a major challenge. The subtle, non-adjacent nature of early disease signals is often lost due to suboptimal architectural inductive biases: 2D/3D CNNs impose strong locality, while ViTs diffuse unconstrained global attention. This conflict leaves the optimal inductive structure for robust, sparse volumetric pattern recognition unresolved. This study presents a controlled comparison of sixteen modern deep learning architectures spanning 2D/3D convolutional, hybrid, and volumetric transformer families for subclinical keratoconus (SKC) detection from 3D anterior segment OCT volumes. We demonstrate that hierarchical attention models offer a superior and more parameter-efficient inductive bias, surpassing the performance of both 2D and 3D CNNs and ViTs. Our results show 21-23% higher sensitivity and specificity in the sparse anomaly (subclinical) regime. Mechanistic analyses reveal that this advantage stems from precise spatial scale alignment: hierarchical windowing produces effective receptive fields matched to the intermediate, multi-slice extent of subclinical abnormalities. This avoids excessive CNN locality and diffuse global attention. Attention-distance measurements confirm a key insight into architectural adaptation: the required spatial integration length shifts significantly based on the signal strength, with subclinical cases necessitating longer integration compared to both healthy and manifest disease states. Representational similarity and auxiliary age/sex prediction tasks further support the generalizability of these inductive principles. The findings provide design guidance for future volumetric anomaly detection systems, establishing hierarchical attention as a principled and effective approach for early pathological change analysis in 3D medical imaging.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Threat modeling (TM) is an important aspect of risk analysis and secure software engineering. Graphical threat models are a recommended tool to analyze and communicate threat information. However, the comparison of different graphical threat models, and the acceptability of these threat models for an audience with a limited technical background, is not well understood, despite these users making up a sizable portion of the cybersecurity industry. We seek to compare the acceptability of three general, graphical threat models, Attack-Defense Trees (ADTs), Attack Graphs (AGs), and CORAS, for users with a limited technical background. We conducted a laboratory study with 38 bachelor students who completed tasks with the three threat models across three different scenarios assigned using a Latin square design. Threat model submissions were qualitatively analyzed, and participants filled out a perception questionnaire based on the Method Evaluation Model (MEM). We find that both ADTs and CORAS are broadly acceptable for a wide range of scenarios, and both could be applied successfully by users with a limited technical background; further, we also find that the lack of a specific tool for AGs may have impacted the perceived usefulness of AGs. We can recommend that users with a limited technical background use ADTs or CORAS as a general graphical TM method. Further research on the acceptability of AGs to such an audience and the effect of a dedicated TM tool support is needed.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Online A/B testing, the gold standard for evaluating new advertising policies, consumes substantial engineering resources and risks significant revenue loss from deploying underperforming variations. This motivates the use of Off-Policy Evaluation (OPE) for rapid, offline assessment. However, applying OPE to ad auctions is fundamentally more challenging than in domains like recommender systems, where stochastic policies are common. In online ad auctions, it is common for the highest-bidding ad to win the impression, resulting in a deterministic, winner-takes-all setting. This results in zero probability of exposure for non-winning ads, rendering standard OPE estimators inapplicable. We introduce the first principled framework for OPE in deterministic auctions by repurposing the bid landscape model to approximate the propensity score. This model allows us to derive robust approximate propensity scores, enabling the use of stable estimators like Self-Normalized Inverse Propensity Scoring (SNIPS) for counterfactual evaluation. We validate our approach on the AuctionNet simulation benchmark and against 2-weeks online A/B test from a large-scale industrial platform. Our method shows remarkable alignment with online results, achieving a 92\% Mean Directional Accuracy (MDA) in CTR prediction, significantly outperforming the parametric baseline. MDA is the most critical metric for guiding deployment decisions, as it reflects the ability to correctly predict whether a new model will improve or harm performance. This work contributes the first practical and validated framework for reliable OPE in deterministic auction environments, offering an efficient alternative to costly and risky online experiments.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>defense, attack, robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) have become foundational in AI systems, yet they remain vulnerable to adversarial jailbreak attacks. These attacks involve carefully crafted prompts that bypass safety guardrails and induce models to produce harmful content. Detecting such malicious input queries is therefore critical for maintaining LLM safety. Existing methods for jailbreak detection typically involve fine-tuning LLMs as static safety LLMs using fixed training datasets. However, these methods incur substantial computational costs when updating model parameters to improve robustness, especially in the face of novel jailbreak attacks. Inspired by immunological memory mechanisms, we propose the Multi-Agent Adaptive Guard (MAAG) framework for jailbreak detection. The core idea is to equip guard with memory capabilities: upon encountering novel jailbreak attacks, the system memorizes attack patterns, enabling it to rapidly and accurately identify similar threats in future encounters. Specifically, MAAG first extracts activation values from input prompts and compares them to historical activations stored in a memory bank for quick preliminary detection. A defense agent then simulates responses based on these detection results, and an auxiliary agent supervises the simulation process to provide secondary filtering of the detection outcomes. Extensive experiments across five open-source models demonstrate that MAAG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, achieving 98% detection accuracy and a 96% F1-score across a diverse range of attack scenarios.</li>

In this work, we propose a privacy-preserving QFL framework where a network of $n$ quantum devices trains local models and transmits them to a central server under a multi-layered privacy protocol. Our design leverages Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), and Analytic Quantum Gradient Descent (AQGD) to secure data preparation, model sharing, and training stages. Through theoretical analysis and experiments on contemporary quantum platforms and datasets, we demonstrate that the framework robustly safeguards data and model confidentiality while maintaining training efficiency.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Lung cancer is a very deadly disease worldwide, and its early diagnosis is crucial for increasing patient survival rates. Computed tomography (CT) scans are widely used for lung cancer diagnosis as they can give detailed lung structures. However, manual interpretation is time-consuming and prone to human error. To surmount this challenge, the study proposes a deep learning-based automatic lung cancer classification system to enhance detection accuracy and interpretability. The IQOTHNCCD lung cancer dataset is utilized, which is a public CT scan dataset consisting of cases categorized into Normal, Benign, and Malignant and used DenseNet169, which includes Squeezeand-Excitation blocks for attention-based feature extraction, Focal Loss for handling class imbalance, and a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) for multi-scale feature fusion. In addition, an SVM model was developed using MobileNetV2 for feature extraction, improving its classification performance. For model interpretability enhancement, the study integrated Grad-CAM for the visualization of decision-making regions in CT scans and SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) for explanation of feature contributions within the SVM model. Intensive evaluation was performed, and it was found that both DenseNet169 and SVM models achieved 98% accuracy, suggesting their robustness for real-world medical practice. These results open up the potential for deep learning to improve the diagnosis of lung cancer by a higher level of accuracy, transparency, and robustness.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Logical reasoning is a core challenge in natural language understanding and a fundamental capability of artificial intelligence, underpinning scientific discovery, mathematical theorem proving, and complex decision-making. Despite the remarkable progress of large language models (LLMs), most current approaches still rely on forward reasoning paradigms, generating step-by-step rationales from premises to conclusions. However, such methods often suffer from redundant inference paths, hallucinated steps, and semantic drift, resulting in inefficient and unreliable reasoning. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Hypothesis-driven Backward Logical Reasoning (HBLR). The core idea is to integrate confidence-aware symbolic translation with hypothesis-driven backward reasoning. In the translation phase, only high-confidence spans are converted into logical form, such as First-Order Logic (FOL), while uncertain content remains in natural language. A translation reflection module further ensures semantic fidelity by evaluating symbolic outputs and reverting lossy ones back to text when necessary. In the reasoning phase, HBLR simulates human deductive thinking by assuming the conclusion is true and recursively verifying its premises. A reasoning reflection module further identifies and corrects flawed inference steps, enhancing logical coherence. Extensive experiments on five reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that HBLR consistently outperforms strong baselines in both accuracy and efficiency.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep learning-based semantic communication (SemCom) has emerged as a promising paradigm for next-generation wireless networks, offering superior transmission efficiency by extracting and conveying task-relevant semantic latent representations rather than raw data. However, the openness of the wireless medium and the intrinsic vulnerability of semantic latent representations expose such systems to previously unrecognized security risks. In this paper, we uncover a fundamental latent-space vulnerability that enables Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacker to covertly manipulate the transmitted semantics while preserving the statistical properties of the transmitted latent representations. We first present a Diffusion-based Re-encoding Attack (DiR), wherein the attacker employs a diffusion model to synthesize an attacker-designed semantic variant, and re-encodes it into a valid latent representation compatible with the SemCom decoder. Beyond this model-dependent pathway, we further propose a model-agnostic and training-free Test-Time Adaptation Latent Manipulation attack (TTA-LM), in which the attacker perturbs and steers the intercepted latent representation toward an attacker-specified semantic target by leveraging the gradient of a target loss function. In contrast to diffusion-based manipulation, TTA-LM does not rely on any generative model and does not impose modality-specific or task-specific assumptions, thereby enabling efficient and broadly applicable latent-space tampering across diverse SemCom architectures. Extensive experiments on representative semantic communication architectures demonstrate that both attacks can significantly alter the decoded semantics while preserving natural latent-space distributions, making the attacks covert and difficult to detect.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>federate</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated learning (FL) deployed over quantum enabled and heterogeneous classical networks faces significant performance degradation due to uneven client quality, stochastic teleportation fidelity, device instability, and geometric mismatch between local and global models. Classical aggregation rules assume euclidean topology and uniform communication reliability, limiting their suitability for emerging quantum federated systems. This paper introduces A2G (Adaptive Aggregation with Two Gains), a dual gain framework that jointly regulates geometric blending through a geometry gain and modulates client importance using a QoS gain derived from teleportation fidelity, latency, and instability. We develop the A2G update rule, establish convergence guarantees under smoothness and bounded variance assumptions, and show that A2G recovers FedAvg, QoS aware averaging, and manifold based aggregation as special cases. Experiments on a quantum classical hybrid testbed demonstrate improved stability and higher accuracy under heterogeneous and noisy conditions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Fine-grained wildfire spread prediction is crucial for enhancing emergency response efficacy and decision-making precision. However, existing research predominantly focuses on coarse spatiotemporal scales and relies on low-resolution satellite data, capturing only macroscopic fire states while fundamentally constraining high-precision localized fire dynamics modeling capabilities. To bridge this gap, we present FireSentry, a provincial-scale multi-modal wildfire dataset characterized by sub-meter spatial and sub-second temporal resolution. Collected using synchronized UAV platforms, FireSentry provides visible and infrared video streams, in-situ environmental measurements, and manually validated fire masks. Building on FireSentry, we establish a comprehensive benchmark encompassing physics-based, data-driven, and generative models, revealing the limitations of existing mask-only approaches. Our analysis proposes FiReDiff, a novel dual-modality paradigm that first predicts future video sequences in the infrared modality, and then precisely segments fire masks in the mask modality based on the generated dynamics. FiReDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance, with video quality gains of 39.2% in PSNR, 36.1% in SSIM, 50.0% in LPIPS, 29.4% in FVD, and mask accuracy gains of 3.3% in AUPRC, 59.1% in F1 score, 42.9% in IoU, and 62.5% in MSE when applied to generative models. The FireSentry benchmark dataset and FiReDiff paradigm collectively advance fine-grained wildfire forecasting and dynamic disaster simulation.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce ShelfGaussian, an open-vocabulary multi-modal Gaussian-based 3D scene understanding framework supervised by off-the-shelf vision foundation models (VFMs). Gaussian-based methods have demonstrated superior performance and computational efficiency across a wide range of scene understanding tasks. However, existing methods either model objects as closed-set semantic Gaussians supervised by annotated 3D labels, neglecting their rendering ability, or learn open-set Gaussian representations via purely 2D self-supervision, leading to degraded geometry and limited to camera-only settings. To fully exploit the potential of Gaussians, we propose a Multi-Modal Gaussian Transformer that enables Gaussians to query features from diverse sensor modalities, and a Shelf-Supervised Learning Paradigm that efficiently optimizes Gaussians with VFM features jointly at 2D image and 3D scene levels. We evaluate ShelfGaussian on various perception and planning tasks. Experiments on Occ3D-nuScenes demonstrate its state-of-the-art zero-shot semantic occupancy prediction performance. ShelfGaussian is further evaluated on an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) to assess its in the-wild performance across diverse urban scenarios. Project website: this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Modern Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) face severe challenges due to heterogeneous network traffic, evolving cyber threats, and pronounced data imbalance between benign and attack flows. While generative models have shown promise in data augmentation, existing approaches are limited to single modalities and fail to capture cross-domain dependencies. This paper introduces MAGE-ID (Multimodal Attack Generator for Intrusion Detection), a diffusion-based generative framework that couples tabular flow features with their transformed images through a unified latent prior. By jointly training Transformer and CNN-based variational encoders with an EDM style denoiser, MAGE-ID achieves balanced and coherent multimodal synthesis. Evaluations on CIC-IDS-2017 and NSL-KDD demonstrate significant improvements in fidelity, diversity, and downstream detection performance over TabSyn and TabDDPM, highlighting the effectiveness of MAGE-ID for multimodal IDS augmentation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Transformers have achieved significant success across various domains, relying on self-attention to capture dependencies. However, the standard first-order attention mechanism is often limited by a low-rank bottleneck, struggling to capture intricate, multi-hop relationships within a single layer. In this paper, we propose the \textbf{Higher-Order Attention Network (Hon)}, a novel architecture designed to enhance representational power through a recursive framework. Unlike standard approaches that use static linear projections for Queries and Keys, Hon dynamically refines these representations via nested self-attention mechanisms. Specifically, the Query and Key vectors are themselves outputs of inner attention loops, allowing tokens to aggregate global context and model high-order correlations \textit{prior} to the final attention computation. We enforce a parameter-efficient weight-sharing strategy across recursive steps, ensuring that this enhanced expressivity incurs $\mathcal{O}(1)$ additional parameters. We provide theoretical analysis demonstrating that our method breaks the linear bottleneck of standard attention. Empirically, Hon outperforms standard Transformers on multiple benchmarks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deploying large language model (LLM) models on mobile platforms faces significant challenges due to the limited memory and shared computational resources of the device. Resource availability may be an issue as it is directly impacted by the current device workload, adding to the uncertainty of model deployment. We introduce UniQL, a unified post-training quantization and low-rank compression framework with on-device configurable pruning rates for edge LLMs. UniQL is a general framework that integrates quantization and low-rank compression for Transformers, State Space Models (SSMs), and hybrid models to support diverse edge applications. In our proposed joint framework, we introduce an efficient structured weight-sorting method that speeds up computation by 20x, quantization-aware singular value decomposition (SVD) to minimize quantization errors, state-aware weight sorting for SSMs, and a fused rotary positional embedding (RoPE) kernel for pruned models. Our framework performs weight-sorting, fine-tuning, and quantization in the cloud in a single-pass workflow, while enabling on-device configurable pruning rates up to 35%. Our experiments show that quantized and pruned models achieve a memory reduction of 4x-5.7x and a token-throughput improvement of 2.7x-3.4x, maintaining accuracy within 5% of the original models at 15% pruning across Transformers (Llama3 and Qwen2.5), SSMs (Mamba2), and hybrid models (Nemotron-H and Bamba-v2).

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Graph classification is a fundamental task in domains ranging from molecular property prediction to materials design. While graph neural networks (GNNs) achieve strong performance by learning expressive representations via message passing, they incur high computational costs, limiting their scalability and deployment on resource-constrained devices. Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC), also known as Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSA), offers a lightweight, brain-inspired alternative, yet existing HDC-based graph methods typically struggle to match the predictive performance of GNNs. In this work, we propose VS-Graph, a vector-symbolic graph learning framework that narrows the gap between the efficiency of HDC and the expressive power of message passing. VS-Graph introduces a Spike Diffusion mechanism for topology-driven node identification and an Associative Message Passing scheme for multi-hop neighborhood aggregation entirely within the high-dimensional vector space. Without gradient-based optimization or backpropagation, our method achieves competitive accuracy with modern GNNs, outperforming the prior HDC baseline by 4-5% on standard benchmarks such as MUTAG and DD. It also matches or exceeds the performance of the GNN baselines on several datasets while accelerating the training by a factor of up to 450x. Furthermore, VS-Graph maintains high accuracy even with the hypervector dimensionality reduced to D=128, demonstrating robustness under aggressive dimension compression and paving the way for ultra-efficient execution on edge and neuromorphic hardware.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this work we study how explicit world-modeling objectives affect the internal representations and downstream capability of Transformers across different training stages. We use a controlled 2x2x2 Rubik's Cube and ask: (1) how does explicitly pretraining a world model affect the model's latent representations, and (2) how does world-model quality affect the model's performance after reinforcement learning post-training? We compare standard next-token prediction to two explicit world-modeling strategies -- (i) state-prediction pretraining and (ii) a joint state-prediction + next-token objective -- and assess task performance after Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is applied as post-training. We evaluate the representation quality with linear probes and causal interventions. We find that explicit world-modeling yields more linearly decodable and causally steerable state representations. More importantly, we find that improved state representations lead to higher gains for GRPO, especially on harder cube states. Our results indicate that sharpening state representations can improve the effectiveness of post-training for sequence-planning tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is one of the most popular methods among parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods to adapt pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to specific downstream tasks. However, the model trained based on LoRA often has an unsatisfactory performance due to its low-rank assumption. In this paper, we propose a novel method called Dual LoRA to improve the performance by incorporating an inductive bias into the original LoRA. Specifically, we separate low-rank matrices into two groups: the magnitude group to control whether or not and how far we should update a parameter and the direction group to decide whether this parameter should move forward or backward, to better simulate the parameter updating process of the full fine-tuning based on gradient-based optimization algorithms. We show that this can be simply achieved by adding a ReLU function to the magnitude group and a sign function to the direction group. We conduct several experiments over a wide range of NLP tasks, including natural language generation (NLG), understanding (NLU), and commonsense reasoning datasets on GPT-2, RoBERTa, DeBERTa, and LLaMA-1/2/3 as baseline models. The results show that we consistently outperform LoRA and its state-of-the-art variants with the same number of trainable parameters.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Cross-modal ship re-identification (ReID) between optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery has recently emerged as a critical yet underexplored task in maritime intelligence and surveillance. However, the substantial modality gap between optical and SAR images poses a major challenge for robust identification. To address this issue, we propose MOS, a novel framework designed to mitigate the optical-SAR modality gap and achieve modality-consistent feature learning for optical-SAR cross-modal ship ReID. MOS consists of two core components: (1) Modality-Consistent Representation Learning (MCRL) applies denoise SAR image procession and a class-wise modality alignment loss to align intra-identity feature distributions across modalities. (2) Cross-modal Data Generation and Feature fusion (CDGF) leverages a brownian bridge diffusion model to synthesize cross-modal samples, which are subsequently fused with original features during inference to enhance alignment and discriminability. Extensive experiments on the HOSS ReID dataset demonstrate that MOS significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods across all evaluation protocols, achieving notable improvements of +3.0%, +6.2%, and +16.4% in R1 accuracy under the ALL to ALL, Optical to SAR, and SAR to Optical settings, respectively.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Understanding visual differences between dynamic scenes requires the comparative perception of compositional, spatial, and temporal changes--a capability that remains underexplored in existing vision-language systems. While prior work on Image Difference Captioning (IDC) has enabled models to describe semantic changes between static images, these approaches fail to capture motion continuity, event evolution, or editing consistency over time. We introduce the ViDiC (Video Difference Captioning) task and its corresponding ViDiC-1K dataset, designed to evaluate the ability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to provide fine-grained descriptions of similarities and differences between video pairs. ViDiC-1K comprises 1,000 curated video pairs annotated with over 4,000 comparative checklist items, covering seven categories: subject, style, background, cinematography, motion, location, and playback techniques. To ensure reliable evaluation, we propose a dual-checklist framework that measures the accuracy of similarity and difference separately, based on the LLM-as-a-Judge protocol. Experiments on nineteen representative multimodal models reveal a significant performance gap in their comparative description and difference perception abilities. We hope ViDiC-1K can be a challenging benchmark that lays a solid foundation for advancing video understanding, edit awareness, and comparative reasoning in multimodal intelligence.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Affordance detection aims to jointly address the fundamental "what-where-how" challenge in embodied AI by understanding "what" an object is, "where" the object is located, and "how" it can be used. However, most affordance learning methods focus solely on "how" objects can be used while neglecting the "what" and "where" aspects. Other affordance detection methods treat object detection and affordance learning as two independent tasks, lacking effective interaction and real-time capability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce YOLO Affordance (YOLOA), a real-time affordance detection model that jointly handles these two tasks via a large language model (LLM) adapter. Specifically, YOLOA employs a lightweight detector consisting of object detection and affordance learning branches refined through the LLM Adapter. During training, the LLM Adapter interacts with object and affordance preliminary predictions to refine both branches by generating more accurate class priors, box offsets, and affordance gates. Experiments on our relabeled ADG-Det and IIT-Heat benchmarks demonstrate that YOLOA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (52.8 / 73.1 mAP on ADG-Det / IIT-Heat) while maintaining real-time performance (up to 89.77 FPS, and up to 846.24 FPS for the lightweight variant). This indicates that YOLOA achieves an excellent trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language model (LLM)-based techniques have achieved notable progress in generating harnesses for program fuzzing. However, applying them to arbitrary functions (especially internal functions) \textit{at scale} remains challenging due to the requirement of sophisticated contextual information, such as specification, dependencies, and usage examples. State-of-the-art methods heavily rely on static or incomplete context provisioning, causing failure of generating functional harnesses. Furthermore, LLMs tend to exploit harness validation metrics, producing plausible yet logically useless code. % Therefore, harness generation across large and diverse projects continues to face challenges in reliable compilation, robust code retrieval, and comprehensive validation. To address these challenges, we present HarnessAgent, a tool-augmented agentic framework that achieves fully automated, scalable harness construction over hundreds of OSS-Fuzz targets. HarnessAgent introduces three key innovations: 1) a rule-based strategy to identify and minimize various compilation errors; 2) a hybrid tool pool for precise and robust symbol source code retrieval; and 3) an enhanced harness validation pipeline that detects fake definitions. We evaluate HarnessAgent on 243 target functions from OSS-Fuzz projects (65 C projects and 178 C++ projects). It improves the three-shot success rate by approximately 20\% compared to state-of-the-art techniques, reaching 87\% for C and 81\% for C++. Our one-hour fuzzing results show that more than 75\% of the harnesses generated by HarnessAgent increase the target function coverage, surpassing the baselines by over 10\%. In addition, the hybrid tool-pool system of HarnessAgent achieves a response rate of over 90\% for source code retrieval, outperforming Fuzz Introspector by more than 30\%.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>State Space Models (SSMs) demonstrate significant potential for long-sequence modeling, but their reliance on input order conflicts with the irregular nature of point clouds. Existing approaches often rely on predefined serialization strategies, which cannot adjust based on diverse geometric structures. To overcome this limitation, we propose \textbf{DM3D}, a deformable Mamba architecture for point cloud understanding. Specifically, DM3D introduces an offset-guided Gaussian sequencing mechanism that unifies local resampling and global reordering within a deformable scan. The Gaussian-based KNN Resampling (GKR) enhances structural awareness by adaptively reorganizing neighboring points, while the Gaussian-based Differentiable Reordering (GDR) enables end-to-end optimization of serialization order. Furthermore, a Tri-Path Frequency Fusion module enhances feature complementarity and reduces aliasing. Together, these components enable structure-adaptive serialization of point clouds. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that DM3D achieves state-of-the-art performance in classification, few-shot learning, and part segmentation, demonstrating that adaptive serialization effectively unlocks the potential of SSMs for point cloud understanding.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Autonomous UAV forestry operations require robust depth estimation methods with strong cross-domain generalization. However, existing evaluations focus on urban and indoor scenarios, leaving a critical gap for specialized vegetation-dense environments. We present the first systematic zero-shot evaluation of eight state-of-the-art stereo methods--RAFT-Stereo, IGEV, IGEV++, BridgeDepth, StereoAnywhere, DEFOM (plus baseline methods ACVNet, PSMNet, TCstereo)--spanning iterative refinement, foundation model, and zero-shot adaptation paradigms. All methods are trained exclusively on Scene Flow and evaluated without fine-tuning on four standard benchmarks (ETH3D, KITTI 2012/2015, Middlebury) plus a novel 5,313-pair Canterbury forestry dataset captured with ZED Mini camera (1920x1080). Performance reveals scene-dependent patterns: foundation models excel on structured scenes (BridgeDepth: 0.23 px on ETH3D, 0.83-1.07 px on KITTI; DEFOM: 0.35-4.65 px across benchmarks), while iterative methods maintain cross-domain robustness (IGEV++: 0.36-6.77 px; IGEV: 0.33-21.91 px). Critical finding: RAFT-Stereo exhibits catastrophic ETH3D failure (26.23 px EPE, 98 percent error rate) due to negative disparity predictions, while performing normally on KITTI (0.90-1.11 px). Qualitative evaluation on Canterbury forestry dataset identifies DEFOM as the optimal gold-standard baseline for vegetation depth estimation, exhibiting superior depth smoothness, occlusion handling, and cross-domain consistency compared to IGEV++, despite IGEV++'s finer detail preservation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose GaussDetect-LiNGAM, a novel approach for bivariate causal discovery that eliminates the need for explicit Gaussianity tests by leveraging a fundamental equivalence between noise Gaussianity and residual independence in the reverse regression. Under the standard LiNGAM assumptions of linearity, acyclicity, and exogeneity, we prove that the Gaussianity of the forward-model noise is equivalent to the independence between the regressor and residual in the reverse model. This theoretical insight allows us to replace fragile and sample-sensitive Gaussianity tests with robust kernel-based independence tests. Experimental results validate the equivalence and demonstrate that GaussDetect-LiNGAM maintains high consistency across diverse noise types and sample sizes, while reducing the number of tests per decision (TPD). Our method enhances both the efficiency and practical applicability of causal inference, making LiNGAM more accessible and reliable in real-world scenarios.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) enables detailed land cover classification, yet low spatial resolution and sparse annotations pose significant challenges. We present a label-efficient framework that leverages spatial features from a frozen diffusion model pretrained on natural images. Our approach extracts low-level representations from high-resolution decoder layers at early denoising timesteps, which transfer effectively to the low-texture structure of HSI. To integrate spectral and spatial information, we introduce a lightweight FiLM-based fusion module that adaptively modulates frozen spatial features using spectral cues, enabling robust multimodal learning under sparse supervision. Experiments on two recent hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches using only the provided sparse training labels. Ablation studies further highlight the benefits of diffusion-derived features and spectral-aware fusion. Overall, our results indicate that pretrained diffusion models can support domain-agnostic, label-efficient representation learning for remote sensing and broader scientific imaging tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Grokking-delayed generalization that emerges well after a model has fit the training data-has been linked to robustness and representation quality. We ask whether this training regime also helps with machine unlearning, i.e., removing the influence of specified data without full retraining. We compare applying standard unlearning methods before versus after the grokking transition across vision (CNNs/ResNets on CIFAR, SVHN, and ImageNet) and language (a transformer on a TOFU-style setup). Starting from grokked checkpoints consistently yields (i) more efficient forgetting (fewer updates to reach a target forget level), (ii) less collateral damage (smaller drops on retained and test performance), and (iii) more stable updates across seeds, relative to early-stopped counterparts under identical unlearning algorithms. Analyses of features and curvature further suggest that post-grokking models learn more modular representations with reduced gradient alignment between forget and retain subsets, which facilitates selective forgetting. Our results highlight when a model is trained (pre- vs. post-grokking) as an orthogonal lever to how unlearning is performed, providing a practical recipe to improve existing unlearning methods without altering their algorithms.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Background and Objective: Radiomics of knee MRI requires robust, anatomically meaningful regions of interest (ROIs) that jointly capture cartilage and subchondral bone. Most existing work relies on manual ROIs and rarely reports quality control (QC). We present LM-CartSeg, a fully automatic pipeline for cartilage/bone segmentation, geometric lateral/medial (L/M) compartmentalisation and radiomics analysis. Methods: Two 3D nnU-Net models were trained on SKM-TEA (138 knees) and OAIZIB-CM (404 knees). At test time, zero-shot predictions were fused and refined by simple geometric rules: connected-component cleaning, construction of 10 mm subchondral bone bands in physical space, and a data-driven tibial L/M split based on PCA and k-means. Segmentation was evaluated on an OAIZIB-CM test set (103 knees) and on SKI-10 (100 knees). QC used volume and thickness signatures. From 10 ROIs we extracted 4 650 non-shape radiomic features to study inter-compartment similarity, dependence on ROI size, and OA vs. non-OA classification on OAIZIB-CM Results: Post-processing improved macro ASSD on OAIZIB-CM from 2.63 to 0.36 mm and HD95 from 25.2 to 3.35 mm, with DSC 0.91; zero-shot DSC on SKI-10 was 0.80. The geometric L/M rule produced stable compartments across datasets, whereas a direct L/M nnU-Net showed domain-dependent side swaps. Only 6 to 12 percent of features per ROI were strongly correlated with volume or thickness. Radiomics-based models models restricted to size-linked features. Conclusions: LM-CartSeg yields automatic, QCd ROIs and radiomic features that carry discriminative information beyond simple morphometry, providing a practical foundation for multi-centre knee OA radiomics studies.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Understanding and representing the structure of 3D objects in an unsupervised manner remains a core challenge in computer vision and graphics. Most existing unsupervised keypoint methods are not designed for unconditional generative settings, restricting their use in modern 3D generative pipelines; our formulation explicitly bridges this gap. We present an unsupervised framework for learning spatially structured 3D keypoints from point cloud data. These keypoints serve as a compact and interpretable representation that conditions an Elucidated Diffusion Model (EDM) to reconstruct the full shape. The learned keypoints exhibit repeatable spatial structure across object instances and support smooth interpolation in keypoint space, indicating that they capture geometric variation. Our method achieves strong performance across diverse object categories, yielding a 6 percentage-point improvement in keypoint consistency compared to prior approaches.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models have revolutionized video generation, becoming essential tools in creative content generation and physical simulation. Transformer-based architectures (DiTs) and classifier-free guidance (CFG) are two cornerstones of this success, enabling strong prompt adherence and realistic video quality. Despite their versatility and superior performance, these models require intensive computation. Each video generation requires dozens of iterative steps, and CFG doubles the required compute. This inefficiency hinders broader adoption in downstream applications. We introduce GalaxyDiT, a training-free method to accelerate video generation with guidance alignment and systematic proxy selection for reuse metrics. Through rank-order correlation analysis, our technique identifies the optimal proxy for each video model, across model families and parameter scales, thereby ensuring optimal computational reuse. We achieve $1.87\times$ and $2.37\times$ speedup on Wan2.1-1.3B and Wan2.1-14B with only 0.97% and 0.72% drops on the VBench-2.0 benchmark. At high speedup rates, our approach maintains superior fidelity to the base model, exceeding prior state-of-the-art approaches by 5 to 10 dB in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR).</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in video generation have enabled the synthesis of high-quality and visually realistic clips using diffusion transformer models. However, most existing approaches operate purely in the 2D pixel space and lack explicit mechanisms for modeling 3D structures, often resulting in temporally inconsistent geometries, implausible motions, and structural artifacts. In this work, we introduce geometric regularization losses into video generation by augmenting latent diffusion models with per-frame depth prediction. We adopted depth as the geometric representation because of the great progress in depth prediction and its compatibility with image-based latent encoders. Specifically, to enforce structural consistency over time, we propose a multi-view geometric loss that aligns the predicted depth maps across frames within a shared 3D coordinate system. Our method bridges the gap between appearance generation and 3D structure modeling, leading to improved spatio-temporal coherence, shape consistency, and physical plausibility. Experiments across multiple datasets show that our approach produces significantly more stable and geometrically consistent results than existing baselines.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Interpreting natural-language commands to localize target objects is critical for autonomous driving (AD). Existing visual grounding (VG) methods for autonomous vehicles (AVs) typically struggle with ambiguous, context-dependent instructions, as they lack reasoning over 3D spatial relations and anticipated scene evolution. Grounded in the principles of world models, we propose ThinkDeeper, a framework that reasons about future spatial states before making grounding decisions. At its core is a Spatial-Aware World Model (SA-WM) that learns to reason ahead by distilling the current scene into a command-aware latent state and rolling out a sequence of future latent states, providing forward-looking cues for disambiguation. Complementing this, a hypergraph-guided decoder then hierarchically fuses these states with the multimodal input, capturing higher-order spatial dependencies for robust localization. In addition, we present DrivePilot, a multi-source VG dataset in AD, featuring semantic annotations generated by a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-prompted LLM pipeline. Extensive evaluations on six benchmarks, ThinkDeeper ranks #1 on the Talk2Car leaderboard and surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on DrivePilot, MoCAD, and RefCOCO/+/g benchmarks. Notably, it shows strong robustness and efficiency in challenging scenes (long-text, multi-agent, ambiguity) and retains superior performance even when trained on 50% of the data.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>privacy, diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) have been applied to diverse VQA tasks. However, achieving practical performance typically requires task-specific fine-tuning with large numbers of image-text pairs, which are costly to collect. In this work, we study text-centric training, a setting where only textual descriptions are available and no real images are provided, as a paradigm for low-cost data scaling. Unlike images, whose collection is often restricted by privacy constraints and scarcity in niche domains, text is widely available. Moreover, text is easily editable, enabling automatic diversification and expansion with LLMs at minimal human effort. While this offers clear advantages over image collection in terms of scalability and cost, training on raw text without images still yields limited gains on VQA tasks because of the image-text modality gap. To address this issue, we propose a Text-Printed Image (TPI), which generates synthetic images by directly rendering the given textual description on a plain white canvas. This simple rendering projects text into the image modality and can be integrated into arbitrary existing LVLM training pipelines at low cost. Moreover, TPI preserves the semantics of the text, whereas text-to-image models often fail to do. Across four models and seven benchmarks, our systematic experiments show that TPI enables more effective text-centric training than synthetic images generated by a diffusion model. We further explore TPI as a low-cost data-augmentation strategy and demonstrate its practical utility. Overall, our findings highlight the significant potential of text-centric training and, more broadly, chart a path toward fully automated data generation for LVLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In recent years, financial sentiment analysis of public opinion has become increasingly important for market forecasting and risk assessment. However, existing methods often struggle to effectively integrate diverse opinion modalities and capture fine-grained interactions across them. This paper proposes an end-to-end deep learning framework that integrates two distinct modalities of financial opinions: recency modality (timely opinions) and popularity modality (trending opinions), through a novel cross-modal attention mechanism specifically designed for financial sentiment analysis. While both modalities consist of textual data, they represent fundamentally different information channels: recency-driven market updates versus popularity-driven collective sentiment. Our model first uses BERT (Chinese-wwm-ext) for feature embedding and then employs our proposed Financial Multi-Head Cross-Attention (FMHCA) structure to facilitate information exchange between these distinct opinion modalities. The processed features are optimized through a transformer layer and fused using multimodal factored bilinear pooling for classification into negative, neutral, and positive sentiment. Extensive experiments on a comprehensive dataset covering 837 companies demonstrate that our approach achieves an accuracy of 83.5%, significantly outperforming baselines including BERT+Transformer by 21 percent. These results highlight the potential of our framework to support more accurate financial decision-making and risk management.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this study, we more rigorously evaluated our attack script $\textit{TraceTarnish}$, which leverages adversarial stylometry principles to anonymize the authorship of text-based messages. To ensure the efficacy and utility of our attack, we sourced, processed, and analyzed Reddit comments--comments that were later alchemized into $\textit{TraceTarnish}$ data--to gain valuable insights. The transformed $\textit{TraceTarnish}$ data was then further augmented by $\textit{StyloMetrix}$ to manufacture stylometric features--features that were culled using the Information Gain criterion, leaving only the most informative, predictive, and discriminative ones. Our results found that function words and function word types ($L\_FUNC\_A$ $\&$ $L\_FUNC\_T$); content words and content word types ($L\_CONT\_A$ $\&$ $L\_CONT\_T$); and the Type-Token Ratio ($ST\_TYPE\_TOKEN\_RATIO\_LEMMAS$) yielded significant Information-Gain readings. The identified stylometric cues--function-word frequencies, content-word distributions, and the Type-Token Ratio--serve as reliable indicators of compromise (IoCs), revealing when a text has been deliberately altered to mask its true author. Similarly, these features could function as forensic beacons, alerting defenders to the presence of an adversarial stylometry attack; granted, in the absence of the original message, this signal may go largely unnoticed, as it appears to depend on a pre- and post-transformation comparison. "In trying to erase a trace, you often imprint a larger one." Armed with this understanding, we framed $\textit{TraceTarnish}$'s operations and outputs around these five isolated features, using them to conceptualize and implement enhancements that further strengthen the attack.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Chronic diseases often progress differently across patients. Rather than randomly varying, there are typically a small number of subtypes for how a disease progresses across patients. To capture this structured heterogeneity, the Subtype and Stage Inference Event-Based Model (SuStaIn) estimates the number of subtypes, the order of disease progression for each subtype, and assigns each patient to a subtype from primarily cross-sectional data. It has been widely applied to uncover the subtypes of many diseases and inform our understanding of them. But how robust is its performance? In this paper, we develop a principled Bayesian subtype variant of the event-based model (BEBMS) and compare its performance to SuStaIn in a variety of synthetic data experiments with varied levels of model misspecification. BEBMS substantially outperforms SuStaIn across ordering, staging, and subtype assignment tasks. Further, we apply BEBMS and SuStaIn to a real-world Alzheimer's data set. We find BEBMS has results that are more consistent with the scientific consensus of Alzheimer's disease progression than SuStaIn.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Mistake detection in procedural tasks is essential for building intelligent systems that support learning and task execution. Existing approaches primarily analyze how an action is performed, while overlooking what it produces, i.e., the \textbf{action effect}. Yet many errors manifest not in the execution itself but in the resulting outcome, such as an unintended object state or incorrect spatial arrangement. To address this gap, we propose Action Effect Modeling (AEM), a unified framework that jointly captures action execution and its outcomes through a probabilistic formulation. AEM first identifies the outcome of an action by selecting the most informative effect frame based on semantic relevance and visual quality. It then extracts complementary cues from visual grounding and symbolic scene graphs, aligning them in a shared latent space to form robust effect-aware representations. To detect mistakes, we further design a prompt-based detector that incorporates task-specific prompts and aligns each action segment with its intended execution semantics. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the EgoPER and CaptainCook4D benchmarks under the challenging one-class classification (OCC) setting. These results demonstrate that modeling both execution and outcome yields more reliable mistake detection, and highlight the potential of effect-aware representations to benefit a broader range of downstream applications.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vision-language models achieve expert-level performance on medical imaging tasks but exhibit significant diagnostic accuracy disparities across demographic groups. We introduce fairness-aware Low-Rank Adaptation for medical VLMs, combining parameter efficiency with explicit fairness optimization. Our key algorithmic contribution is a differentiable MaxAccGap loss that enables end-to-end optimization of accuracy parity across demographic groups. We propose three methods: FR-LoRA integrates MaxAccGap regularization into the training objective, GR-LoRA applies inverse frequency weighting to balance gradient contributions, and Hybrid-LoRA combines both this http URL on 10,000 glaucoma fundus images, GR-LoRA reduces diagnostic accuracy disparities by 69% while maintaining 53.15% overall accuracy. Ablation studies reveal that strong regularization strength achieves optimal fairness with minimal accuracy trade-off, and race-specific optimization yields 60% disparity reduction. Our approach requires only 0.24% trainable parameters, enabling practical deployment of fair medical AI in resource-constrained healthcare settings.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose Modal Logical Neural Networks (MLNNs), a neurosymbolic framework that integrates deep learning with the formal semantics of modal logic, enabling reasoning about necessity and possibility. Drawing on Kripke semantics, we introduce specialized neurons for the modal operators $\Box$ and $\Diamond$ that operate over a set of possible worlds, enabling the framework to act as a differentiable ``logical guardrail.'' The architecture is highly flexible: the accessibility relation between worlds can either be fixed by the user to enforce known rules or, as an inductive feature, be parameterized by a neural network. This allows the model to optionally learn the relational structure of a logical system from data while simultaneously performing deductive reasoning within that structure. This versatile construction is designed for flexibility. The entire framework is differentiable from end to end, with learning driven by minimizing a logical contradiction loss. This not only makes the system resilient to inconsistent knowledge but also enables it to learn nonlinear relationships that can help define the logic of a problem space. We illustrate MLNNs on four case studies: grammatical guardrailing, axiomatic detection of the unknown, multi-agent epistemic trust, and detecting constructive deception in natural language negotiation. These experiments demonstrate how enforcing or learning accessibility can increase logical consistency and interpretability without changing the underlying task architecture.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly prevalent in the field of long-context modeling, however, their inference computational costs have become a critical bottleneck hindering the advancement of tasks such as agents and multimodal applications. This report conducts a preliminary investigation into the effectiveness and theoretical mechanisms of the Top-$k$ Attention mechanism during both the decoding and training phases. First, we validate the effectiveness of exact Top-$k$ Decoding through extensive experimentation. Experiments demonstrate that retaining only the pivotal Keys with the highest similarity to the Query as the context window during the decoding stage achieves performance comparable to, or even surpassing, full attention on downstream tasks such as HELMET and LongBench v2. Second, we further explore the native Top-$k$ Attention training strategy. Experiments confirm that ensuring the consistency between training and inference regarding Top-$k$ Attention operations facilitates the further unlocking of Top-$k$ Decoding's potential, thereby significantly enhancing model performance. Furthermore, considering the high computational complexity of exact Top-$k$ Attention, we investigate the impact of approximate Top-$k$ algorithm precision on downstream tasks. Our research confirms a positive correlation between downstream task performance and approximation fidelity, and we provide statistical evaluations of the Lightning Indexer's precision within the DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp model. Finally, this report provides a theoretical interpretation from the perspective of Entropy. Experimental observations indicate that models subjected to Top-$k$ Attention SFT exhibit a distinct phenomenon of entropy reduction in downstream tasks, which validates the hypothesis that low-entropy states are better adapted to Top-$k$ Decoding.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has emerged as a powerful visual foundation model for image segmentation. However, adapting SAM to specific downstream tasks, such as medical and agricultural imaging, remains a significant challenge. To address this, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its variants have been widely employed to enhancing SAM's adaptation performance on diverse domains. Despite advancements, a critical question arises: can we integrate inductive bias into the model? This is particularly relevant since the Transformer encoder in SAM inherently lacks spatial priors within image patches, potentially hindering the acquisition of high-level semantic information. In this paper, we propose NAS-LoRA, a new Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method designed to bridge the semantic gap between pre-trained SAM and specialized domains. Specifically, NAS-LoRA incorporates a lightweight Neural Architecture Search (NAS) block between the encoder and decoder components of LoRA to dynamically optimize the prior knowledge integrated into weight updates. Furthermore, we propose a stage-wise optimization strategy to help the ViT encoder balance weight updates and architectural adjustments, facilitating the gradual learning of high-level semantic information. Various Experiments demonstrate our NAS-LoRA improves existing PEFT methods, while reducing training cost by 24.14% without increasing inference cost, highlighting the potential of NAS in enhancing PEFT for visual foundation models.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in analytical tasks such as mathematics and code generation, their utility for abstractive summarization remains widely assumed but largely unverified. To bridge this gap, we first tailor general reasoning strategies to the summarization domain. We then conduct a systematic, large scale comparative study of 8 reasoning strategies and 3 Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) across 8 diverse datasets, assessing both summary quality and faithfulness. Our findings show that reasoning is not a universal solution and its effectiveness is highly dependent on the specific strategy and context. Specifically, we observe a trade-off between summary quality and factual faithfulness: explicit reasoning strategies tend to improve fluency at the expense of factual grounding, while implicit reasoning in LRMs exhibits the inverse pattern. Furthermore, increasing an LRM's internal reasoning budget does not improve, and can even hurt, factual consistency, suggesting that effective summarization demands faithful compression rather than creative over-thinking.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent domain generalized semantic segmentation (DGSS) studies have achieved notable improvements by distilling semantic knowledge from Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, they overlook the semantic misalignment between visual and textual contexts, which arises due to the rigidity of a fixed context prompt learned on a single source domain. To this end, we present a novel domain generalization framework for semantic segmentation, namely Domain-aware Prompt-driven Masked Transformer (DPMFormer). Firstly, we introduce domain-aware prompt learning to facilitate semantic alignment between visual and textual cues. To capture various domain-specific properties with a single source dataset, we propose domain-aware contrastive learning along with the texture perturbation that diversifies the observable domains. Lastly, to establish a framework resilient against diverse environmental changes, we have proposed the domain-robust consistency learning which guides the model to minimize discrepancies of prediction from original and the augmented images. Through experiments and analyses, we demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework, which establishes a new state-of-the-art on various DGSS benchmarks.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper presents a preliminary investigation into automated dance movement analysis using contemporary computer vision techniques. We propose a proof-of-concept framework that integrates YOLOv8 and v11 for dancer detection with the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for precise segmentation, enabling the tracking and quantification of dancer movements in video recordings without specialized equipment or markers. Our approach identifies dancers within video frames, counts discrete dance steps, calculates spatial coverage patterns, and measures rhythm consistency across performance sequences. Testing this framework on a single 49-second recording of Ghanaian AfroBeats dance demonstrates technical feasibility, with the system achieving approximately 94% detection precision and 89% recall on manually inspected samples. The pixel-level segmentation provided by SAM, achieving approximately 83% intersection-over-union with visual inspection, enables motion quantification that captures body configuration changes beyond what bounding-box approaches can represent. Analysis of this preliminary case study indicates that the dancer classified as primary by our system executed 23% more steps with 37% higher motion intensity and utilized 42% more performance space compared to dancers classified as secondary. However, this work represents an early-stage investigation with substantial limitations including single-video validation, absence of systematic ground truth annotations, and lack of comparison with existing pose estimation methods. We present this framework to demonstrate technical feasibility, identify promising directions for quantitative dance metrics, and establish a foundation for future systematic validation studies.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Crowdsourcing enables scalable autonomous driving map construction, but low-cost sensor noise hinders quality from improving with data volume. We propose CSMapping, a system that produces accurate semantic maps and topological road centerlines whose quality consistently increases with more crowdsourced data. For semantic mapping, we train a latent diffusion model on HD maps (optionally conditioned on SD maps) to learn a generative prior of real-world map structure, without requiring paired crowdsourced/HD-map supervision. This prior is incorporated via constrained MAP optimization in latent space, ensuring robustness to severe noise and plausible completion in unobserved areas. Initialization uses a robust vectorized mapping module followed by diffusion inversion; optimization employs efficient Gaussian-basis reparameterization, projected gradient descent zobracket multi-start, and latent-space factor-graph for global consistency. For topological mapping, we apply confidence-weighted k-medoids clustering and kinematic refinement to trajectories, yielding smooth, human-like centerlines robust to trajectory variation. Experiments on nuScenes, Argoverse 2, and a large proprietary dataset achieve state-of-the-art semantic and topological mapping performance, with thorough ablation and scalability studies.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present FloodDiffusion, a new framework for text-driven, streaming human motion generation. Given time-varying text prompts, FloodDiffusion generates text-aligned, seamless motion sequences with real-time latency. Unlike existing methods that rely on chunk-by-chunk or auto-regressive model with diffusion head, we adopt a diffusion forcing framework to model this time-series generation task under time-varying control events. We find that a straightforward implementation of vanilla diffusion forcing (as proposed for video models) fails to model real motion distributions. We demonstrate that to guarantee modeling the output distribution, the vanilla diffusion forcing must be tailored to: (i) train with a bi-directional attention instead of casual attention; (ii) implement a lower triangular time scheduler instead of a random one; (iii) utilize a continues time-varying way to introduce text conditioning. With these improvements, we demonstrate in the first time that the diffusion forcing-based framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on the streaming motion generation task, reaching an FID of 0.057 on the HumanML3D benchmark.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Compressed sensing enables sparse sampling but relies on generic bases and random measurements, limiting efficiency and reconstruction quality. Optimal sensor placement uses historcal data to design tailored sampling patterns, yet its fixed, linear bases cannot adapt to nonlinear or sample-specific variations. Generative model-based compressed sensing improves reconstruction using deep generative priors but still employs suboptimal random sampling. We propose an adaptive sparse sensing framework that couples a variational autoencoder prior with reinforcement learning to select measurements sequentially. Experiments show that this approach outperforms CS, OSP, and Generative model-based reconstruction from sparse measurements.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generalizing open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation (OV-3DIS) to diverse, unstructured, and mesh-free environments is crucial for robotics and AR/VR, yet remains a significant challenge. We attribute this to two key limitations of existing methods: (1) proposal generation relies on dataset-specific proposal networks or mesh-based superpoints, rendering them inapplicable in mesh-free scenarios and limiting generalization to novel scenes; and (2) the weak textual reasoning of CLIP-based classifiers, which struggle to recognize compositional and functional user queries. To address these issues, we introduce OpenTrack3D, a generalizable and accurate framework. Unlike methods that rely on pre-generated proposals, OpenTrack3D employs a novel visual-spatial tracker to construct cross-view consistent object proposals online. Given an RGB-D stream, our pipeline first leverages a 2D open-vocabulary segmenter to generate masks, which are lifted to 3D point clouds using depth. Mask-guided instance features are then extracted using DINO feature maps, and our tracker fuses visual and spatial cues to maintain instance consistency. The core pipeline is entirely mesh-free, yet we also provide an optional superpoints refinement module to further enhance performance when scene mesh is available. Finally, we replace CLIP with a multi-modal large language model (MLLM), significantly enhancing compositional reasoning for complex user queries. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks, including ScanNet200, Replica, ScanNet++, and SceneFun3D, demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and strong generalization capabilities.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Cooking is a sequential and visually grounded activity, where each step such as chopping, mixing, or frying carries both procedural logic and visual semantics. While recent diffusion models have shown strong capabilities in text-to-image generation, they struggle to handle structured multi-step scenarios like recipe illustration. Additionally, current recipe illustration methods are unable to adjust to the natural variability in recipe length, generating a fixed number of images regardless of the actual instructions structure. To address these limitations, we present CookAnything, a flexible and consistent diffusion-based framework that generates coherent, semantically distinct image sequences from textual cooking instructions of arbitrary length. The framework introduces three key components: (1) Step-wise Regional Control (SRC), which aligns textual steps with corresponding image regions within a single denoising process; (2) Flexible RoPE, a step-aware positional encoding mechanism that enhances both temporal coherence and spatial diversity; and (3) Cross-Step Consistency Control (CSCC), which maintains fine-grained ingredient consistency across steps. Experimental results on recipe illustration benchmarks show that CookAnything performs better than existing methods in training-based and training-free settings. The proposed framework supports scalable, high-quality visual synthesis of complex multi-step instructions and holds significant potential for broad applications in instructional media, and procedural content creation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in numerous vision-language tasks yet suffer from hallucinations, producing content inconsistent with input visuals, that undermine reliability in precision-sensitive domains. This issue stems from a fundamental problem of visual neglect, where models fail to adequately prioritize input images. Existing methods typically alleviate hallucinations by intervening in the attention score or output logits, focusing on "how to intervene" but overlooking the prerequisite "when to intervene", which leads to the "over-intervention" problem and subsequently introduces new hallucinations and unnecessary computational overhead. To address this gap, we first investigate the mechanism of visual neglect and reveal it can be accurately detected via head-level activation patterns in MLLMs. We thus propose V-ITI, a lightweight visual inference-time intervention framework integrating a Visual Neglect Detector that identifies visual neglect via head-level discriminative probes and a Visual Recall Intervenor that modulates activations with prestored visual activation information only when the visual neglect is detected. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks and different MLLM families demonstrate that V-ITI consistently mitigates vision-related hallucinations while preserving general task performance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Group Authentication Schemes (GAS) are methodologies developed to verify the membership of multiple users simultaneously. These schemes enable the concurrent authentication of several users while eliminating the need for a certification authority. Numerous GAS methods have been explored in the literature, and they can be classified into three distinct generations based on their foundational mathematical principles. First-generation GASs rely on polynomial interpolation and the multiplicative subgroup of a finite field. Second-generation GASs also employ polynomial interpolation, but they distinguish themselves by incorporating elliptic curves over finite fields. While third-generation GASs present a promising solution for scalable environments, they demonstrate a limitation in certain applications. Such applications typically require the identification of users participating in the authentication process. In the third-generation GAS, users are able to verify their credentials while maintaining anonymity. However, there are various applications where the identification of participating users is necessary. In this study, we propose an improved version of third-generation GAS, utilizing inner product spaces and polynomial interpolation to resolve this limitation. We address the issue of preventing malicious actions by legitimate group members. The current third-generation scheme allows members to share group credentials, which can jeopardize group confidentiality. Our proposed scheme mitigates this risk by eliminating the ability of individual users to distribute credentials. However, a potential limitation of our scheme is its reliance on a central authority for authentication in certain scenarios.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Content moderation remains a critical yet challenging task for large-scale user-generated video platforms, especially in livestreaming environments where moderation must be timely, multimodal, and robust to evolving forms of unwanted content. We present a hybrid moderation framework deployed at production scale that combines supervised classification for known violations with reference-based similarity matching for novel or subtle cases. This hybrid design enables robust detection of both explicit violations and novel edge cases that evade traditional classifiers. Multimodal inputs (text, audio, visual) are processed through both pipelines, with a multimodal large language model (MLLM) distilling knowledge into each to boost accuracy while keeping inference lightweight. In production, the classification pipeline achieves 67% recall at 80% precision, and the similarity pipeline achieves 76% recall at 80% precision. Large-scale A/B tests show a 6-8% reduction in user views of unwanted livestreams}. These results demonstrate a scalable and adaptable approach to multimodal content governance, capable of addressing both explicit violations and emerging adversarial behaviors.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rise of Visual-Language Models (LVLMs) has unlocked new possibilities for seamlessly integrating visual and textual information. However, their ability to interpret cartographic maps remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce CartoMapQA, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LVLMs' understanding of cartographic maps through question-answering tasks. The dataset includes over 2000 samples, each composed of a cartographic map, a question (with open-ended or multiple-choice answers), and a ground-truth answer. These tasks span key low-, mid- and high-level map interpretation skills, including symbol recognition, embedded information extraction, scale interpretation, and route-based reasoning. Our evaluation of both open-source and proprietary LVLMs reveals persistent challenges: models frequently struggle with map-specific semantics, exhibit limited geospatial reasoning, and are prone to Optical Character Recognition (OCR)-related errors. By isolating these weaknesses, CartoMapQA offers a valuable tool for guiding future improvements in LVLM architectures. Ultimately, it supports the development of models better equipped for real-world applications that depend on robust and reliable map understanding, such as navigation, geographic search, and urban planning.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models are renowned for their state-of-the-art performance in generating synthetic images. However, concerns related to safety, privacy, and copyright highlight the need for machine unlearning, which can make diffusion models forget specific training data and prevent the generation of sensitive or unwanted content. Current machine unlearning methods for diffusion models are primarily designed for conditional diffusion models and focus on unlearning specific data classes or features. Among these methods, finetuning-based machine unlearning methods are recognized for their efficiency and effectiveness, which update the parameters of pre-trained diffusion models by minimizing carefully designed loss functions. However, in this paper, we propose a novel attack named Diffusion Model Relearning Attack (DiMRA), which can reverse the finetuning-based machine unlearning methods, posing a significant vulnerability of this kind of technique. Without prior knowledge of the unlearning elements, DiMRA optimizes the unlearned diffusion model on an auxiliary dataset to reverse the unlearning, enabling the model to regenerate previously unlearned elements. To mitigate this vulnerability, we propose a novel machine unlearning method for diffusion models, termed as Diffusion Model Unlearning by Memorization (DiMUM). Unlike traditional methods that focus on forgetting, DiMUM memorizes alternative data or features to replace targeted unlearning data or features in order to prevent generating such elements. In our experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of DiMRA in reversing state-of-the-art finetuning-based machine unlearning methods for diffusion models, highlighting the need for more robust solutions. We extensively evaluate DiMUM, demonstrating its superior ability to preserve the generative performance of diffusion models while enhancing robustness against DiMRA.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Articulated object generation has seen increasing advancements, yet existing models often lack the ability to be conditioned on text prompts. To address the significant gap between textual descriptions and 3D articulated object representations, we propose GAOT, a three-phase framework that generates articulated objects from text prompts, leveraging diffusion models and hypergraph learning in a three-step process. First, we fine-tune a point cloud generation model to produce a coarse representation of objects from text prompts. Given the inherent connection between articulated objects and graph structures, we design a hypergraph-based learning method to refine these coarse representations, representing object parts as graph vertices. Finally, leveraging a diffusion model, the joints of articulated objects-represented as graph edges-are generated based on the object parts. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on the PartNet-Mobility dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving superior performance over previous methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Universal, transferable whole-slide image (WSI) representations are central to computational pathology. Incorporating multiple markers (e.g., immunohistochemistry, IHC) alongside H&E enriches H&E-based features with diverse, biologically meaningful information. However, progress is limited by the scarcity of well-aligned multi-stain datasets. Inter-stain misalignment shifts corresponding tissue across slides, hindering consistent patch-level features and degrading slide-level embeddings. To address this, we curated a slide-level aligned, five-stain dataset (H&E, HER2, KI67, ER, PGR) to enable paired H&E-IHC learning and robust cross-stain representation. Leveraging this dataset, we propose Cross-Stain Contrastive Learning (CSCL), a two-stage pretraining framework with a lightweight adapter trained using patch-wise contrastive alignment to improve the compatibility of H&E features with corresponding IHC-derived contextual cues, and slide-level representation learning with Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), which uses a cross-stain attention fusion module to integrate stain-specific patch features and a cross-stain global alignment module to enforce consistency among slide-level embeddings across different stains. Experiments on cancer subtype classification, IHC biomarker status classification, and survival prediction show consistent gains, yielding high-quality, transferable H&E slide-level representations.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Time series extrinsic regression (TSER) refers to the task of predicting a continuous target variable from an input time series. It appears in many domains, including healthcare, finance, environmental monitoring, and engineering. In these settings, accurate predictions and trustworthy reasoning are both essential. Although state-of-the-art TSER models achieve strong predictive performance, they typically operate as black boxes, making it difficult to understand which temporal patterns drive their decisions. Post-hoc interpretability techniques, such as feature attribution, aim to to explain how the model arrives at its predictions, but often produce coarse, noisy, or unstable explanations. Recently, inherently interpretable approaches based on concepts, additive decompositions, or symbolic regression, have emerged as promising alternatives. However, these approaches remain limited: they require explicit supervision on the concepts themselves, often cannot capture interactions between time-series features, lack expressiveness for complex temporal patterns, and struggle to scale to high-dimensional multivariate data. To address these limitations, we propose MAGNETS (Mask-and-AGgregate NEtwork for Time Series), an inherently interpretable neural architecture for TSER. MAGNETS learns a compact set of human-understandable concepts without requiring any annotations. Each concept corresponds to a learned, mask-based aggregation over selected input features, explicitly revealing both which features drive predictions and when they matter in the sequence. Predictions are formed as combinations of these learned concepts through a transparent, additive structure, enabling clear insight into the model's decision process.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Narratives are the cognitive and emotional scaffolds of propaganda. They organize isolated persuasive techniques into coherent stories that justify actions, attribute blame, and evoke identification with ideological camps. In this paper, we propose a novel fine-grained narrative classification in biased news articles. We also explore article-bias classification as the precursor task to narrative classification and fine-grained persuasive technique identification. We develop INDI-PROP, the first ideologically grounded fine-grained narrative dataset with multi-level annotation for analyzing propaganda in Indian news media. Our dataset INDI-PROP comprises 1,266 articles focusing on two polarizing socio-political events in recent times: CAA and the Farmers' protest. Each article is annotated at three hierarchical levels: (i) ideological article-bias (pro-government, pro-opposition, neutral), (ii) event-specific fine-grained narrative frames anchored in ideological polarity and communicative intent, and (iii) persuasive techniques. We propose FANTA and TPTC, two GPT-4o-mini guided multi-hop prompt-based reasoning frameworks for the bias, narrative, and persuasive technique classification. FANTA leverages multi-layered communicative phenomena by integrating information extraction and contextual framing for hierarchical reasoning. On the other hand, TPTC adopts systematic decomposition of persuasive cues via a two-stage approach. Our evaluation suggests substantial improvement over underlying baselines in each case.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Handling fast, complex, and highly non-linear motion patterns has long posed challenges for video frame interpolation. Although recent diffusion-based approaches improve upon traditional optical-flow-based methods, they still struggle to cover diverse application scenarios and often fail to produce sharp, temporally consistent frames in fine-grained motion tasks such as audio-visual synchronized interpolation. To address these limitations, we introduce BBF (Beyond Boundary Frames), a context-aware video frame interpolation framework, which could be guided by audio/visual semantics. First, we enhance the input design of the interpolation model so that it can flexibly handle multiple conditional modalities, including text, audio, images, and video. Second, we propose a decoupled multimodal fusion mechanism that sequentially injects different conditional signals into a DiT backbone. Finally, to maintain the generation abilities of the foundation model, we adopt a progressive multi-stage training paradigm, where the start-end frame difference embedding is used to dynamically adjust both the data sampling and the loss weighting. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that BBF outperforms specialized state-of-the-art methods on both generic interpolation and audio-visual synchronized interpolation tasks, establishing a unified framework for video frame interpolation under coordinated multi-channel conditioning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The RNA inverse folding problem, a key challenge in RNA design, involves identifying nucleotide sequences that can fold into desired secondary structures, which are critical for ensuring molecular stability and function. The inherent complexity of this task stems from the intricate relationship between sequence and structure, making it particularly challenging. In this paper, we propose a framework, named HyperRNA, a generative model with an encoder-decoder architecture that leverages hypergraphs to design RNA sequences. Specifically, our HyperRNA model consists of three main components: preprocessing, encoding and decoding. In the preprocessing stage, graph structures are constructed by extracting the atom coordinates of RNA backbone based on 3-bead coarse-grained representation. The encoding stage processes these graphs, capturing higher order dependencies and complex biomolecular interactions using an attention embedding module and a hypergraph-based encoder. Finally, the decoding stage generates the RNA sequence in an autoregressive manner. We conducted quantitative and qualitative experiments on the PDBBind and RNAsolo datasets to evaluate the inverse folding task for RNA sequence generation and RNA-protein complex sequence generation. The experimental results demonstrate that HyperRNA not only outperforms existing RNA design methods but also highlights the potential of leveraging hypergraphs in RNA engineering.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, extraction, transformer, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Medical image segmentation is a cornerstone of modern clinical diagnostics. While Vision Transformers that leverage shifted window-based self-attention have established new benchmarks in this field, they are often hampered by a critical limitation: their localized attention mechanism struggles to effectively fuse local details with global context. This deficiency is particularly detrimental to challenging tasks such as the segmentation of microtumors and miniature organs, where both fine-grained boundary definition and broad contextual understanding are paramount. To address this gap, we propose HBFormer, a novel Hybrid-Bridge Transformer architecture. The 'Hybrid' design of HBFormer synergizes a classic U-shaped encoder-decoder framework with a powerful Swin Transformer backbone for robust hierarchical feature extraction. The core innovation lies in its 'Bridge' mechanism, a sophisticated nexus for multi-scale feature integration. This bridge is architecturally embodied by our novel Multi-Scale Feature Fusion (MFF) decoder. Departing from conventional symmetric designs, the MFF decoder is engineered to fuse multi-scale features from the encoder with global contextual information. It achieves this through a synergistic combination of channel and spatial attention modules, which are constructed from a series of dilated and depth-wise convolutions. These components work in concert to create a powerful feature bridge that explicitly captures long-range dependencies and refines object boundaries with exceptional precision. Comprehensive experiments on challenging medical image segmentation datasets, including multi-organ, liver tumor, and bladder tumor benchmarks, demonstrate that HBFormer achieves state-of-the-art results, showcasing its outstanding capabilities in microtumor and miniature organ segmentation.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advancements in foundation models for 2D vision have substantially improved the analysis of dynamic scenes from monocular videos. However, despite their strong generalization capabilities, these models often lack 3D consistency, a fundamental requirement for understanding scene geometry and motion, thereby causing severe spatial misalignment and temporal flickering in complex 3D environments. In this paper, we present Motion4D, a novel framework that addresses these challenges by integrating 2D priors from foundation models into a unified 4D Gaussian Splatting representation. Our method features a two-part iterative optimization framework: 1) Sequential optimization, which updates motion and semantic fields in consecutive stages to maintain local consistency, and 2) Global optimization, which jointly refines all attributes for long-term coherence. To enhance motion accuracy, we introduce a 3D confidence map that dynamically adjusts the motion priors, and an adaptive resampling process that inserts new Gaussians into under-represented regions based on per-pixel RGB and semantic errors. Furthermore, we enhance semantic coherence through an iterative refinement process that resolves semantic inconsistencies by alternately optimizing the semantic fields and updating prompts of SAM2. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our Motion4D significantly outperforms both 2D foundation models and existing 3D-based approaches across diverse scene understanding tasks, including point-based tracking, video object segmentation, and novel view synthesis.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Accurate marine wind forecasts are essential for safe navigation, ship routing, and energy operations, yet they remain challenging because observations over the ocean are sparse, heterogeneous, and temporally variable. We reformulate wind forecasting as observation-informed correction of a global numerical weather prediction (NWP) model. Rather than forecasting winds directly, we learn local correction patterns by assimilating the latest in-situ observations to adjust the Global Forecast System (GFS) output. We propose a transformer-based deep learning architecture that (i) handles irregular and time-varying observation sets through masking and set-based attention mechanisms, (ii) conditions predictions on recent observation-forecast pairs via cross-attention, and (iii) employs cyclical time embeddings and coordinate-aware location representations to enable single-pass inference at arbitrary spatial coordinates. We evaluate our model over the Atlantic Ocean using observations from the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS) as reference. The model reduces GFS 10-meter wind RMSE at all lead times up to 48 hours, achieving 45% improvement at 1-hour lead time and 13% improvement at 48-hour lead time. Spatial analyses reveal the most persistent improvements along coastlines and shipping routes, where observations are most abundant. The tokenized architecture naturally accommodates heterogeneous observing platforms (ships, buoys, tide gauges, and coastal stations) and produces both site-specific predictions and basin-scale gridded products in a single forward pass. These results demonstrate a practical, low-latency post-processing approach that complements NWP by learning to correct systematic forecast errors.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Video generation has achieved remarkable progress in visual fidelity and controllability, enabling conditioning on text, layout, or motion. Among these, motion control - specifying object dynamics and camera trajectories - is essential for composing complex, cinematic scenes, yet existing interfaces remain limited. We introduce LAMP that leverages large language models (LLMs) as motion planners to translate natural language descriptions into explicit 3D trajectories for dynamic objects and (relatively defined) cameras. LAMP defines a motion domain-specific language (DSL), inspired by cinematography conventions. By harnessing program synthesis capabilities of LLMs, LAMP generates structured motion programs from natural language, which are deterministically mapped to 3D trajectories. We construct a large-scale procedural dataset pairing natural text descriptions with corresponding motion programs and 3D trajectories. Experiments demonstrate LAMP's improved performance in motion controllability and alignment with user intent compared to state-of-the-art alternatives establishing the first framework for generating both object and camera motions directly from natural language specifications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>protect, attack, robust, extraction, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The protection of Intellectual Property (IP) in Large Language Models (LLMs) represents a critical challenge in contemporary AI research. While fingerprinting techniques have emerged as a fundamental mechanism for detecting unauthorized model usage, existing methods -- whether behavior-based or structural -- suffer from vulnerabilities such as false claim attacks or susceptible to weight manipulations. To overcome these limitations, we propose SELF, a novel intrinsic weight-based fingerprinting scheme that eliminates dependency on input and inherently resists false claims. SELF achieves robust IP protection through two key innovations: 1) unique, scalable and transformation-invariant fingerprint extraction via singular value and eigenvalue decomposition of LLM attention weights, and 2) effective neural network-based fingerprint similarity comparison based on few-shot learning and data augmentation. Experimental results demonstrate SELF maintains high IP infringement detection accuracy while showing strong robustness against various downstream modifications, including quantization, pruning, and fine-tuning attacks.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>defense, attack, interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Although the remarkable performance of deep neural networks (DNNs) in image classification, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks remains a critical challenge. Most existing detection methods rely on complex and poorly interpretable architectures, which compromise interpretability and generalization. To address this, we propose FeatureLens, a lightweight framework that acts as a lens to scrutinize anomalies in image features. Comprising an Image Feature Extractor (IFE) and shallow classifiers (e.g., SVM, MLP, or XGBoost) with model sizes ranging from 1,000 to 30,000 parameters, FeatureLens achieves high detection accuracy ranging from 97.8% to 99.75% in closed-set evaluation and 86.17% to 99.6% in generalization evaluation across FGSM, PGD, CW, and DAmageNet attacks, using only 51 dimensional features. By combining strong detection performance with excellent generalization, interpretability, and computational efficiency, FeatureLens offers a practical pathway toward transparent and effective adversarial defense.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>interpretability, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models have significantly advanced natural language processing tasks, but remain prone to generating incorrect or misleading but plausible arguments. This issue, known as hallucination, is particularly concerning in high-stakes domains like clinical applications, where factual inaccuracies can have severe consequences. Existing evaluation metrics fail to adequately assess factual consistency and lack interpretability, making diagnosing and mitigating errors difficult. We propose an interpretable framework for factual consistency assessment for in-domain and open-domain texts to address these limitations. Our approach decomposes text into atomic facts and introduces a flexible, schema-free methodology. Unlike previous methods with an absolute metric, we incorporate a weighted metric to enhance factual evaluation. Additionally, we propose a mechanism to control assessment complexity in intricate domains. We benchmark our approach on popular general and clinical datasets and release our code to support fact-aware model training in future research.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, biometric</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Cyber-deception is an increasingly important defensive strategy, shaping adversarial decision making through controlled misinformation, uncertainty, and misdirection. Although game-theoretic, Bayesian, Markov decision process, and reinforcement learning models offer insight into deceptive interactions, they typically assume an attacker has already chosen to engage. Such approaches overlook cognitive and perceptual factors that influence an attacker's initial decision to engage or withdraw. This paper presents a descriptive model that incorporates the psychological and strategic elements shaping this decision. The model defines five components, belief (B), scepticism (S), deception fidelity (D), reconnaissance (R), and experience (E), which interact to capture how adversaries interpret deceptive cues and assess whether continued engagement is worthwhile. The framework provides a structured method for analysing engagement decisions in cyber-deception scenarios. A series of experiments has been designed to evaluate this model through Capture the Flag activities incorporating varying levels of deception, supported by behavioural and biometric observations. These experiments have not yet been conducted, and no experimental findings are presented in this paper. These experiments will combine behavioural observations with biometric indicators to produce a multidimensional view of adversarial responses. Findings will improve understanding of the factors influencing engagement decisions and refine the model's relevance to real-world cyber-deception settings. By addressing the gap in existing models that presume engagement, this work supports more cognitively realistic and strategically effective cyber-deception practices.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Activation steering has emerged as a powerful method for guiding the behavior of generative models towards desired outcomes such as toxicity mitigation. However, most existing methods apply interventions uniformly across all inputs, degrading model performance when steering is unnecessary. We introduce Dynamically Scaled Activation Steering (DSAS), a method-agnostic steering framework that decouples when to steer from how to steer. DSAS adaptively modulates the strength of existing steering transformations across layers and inputs, intervening strongly only when undesired behavior is detected. At generation time, DSAS computes context-dependent scaling factors that selectively adjust the strength of any steering method. We also show how DSAS can be jointly optimized end-to-end together with the steering function. When combined with existing steering methods, DSAS consistently improves the Pareto front with respect to steering alone, achieving a better trade-off between toxicity mitigation and utility preservation. We further demonstrate DSAS's generality by applying it to a text-to-image diffusion model, showing how adaptive steering allows the modulation of specific concepts. Finally, DSAS introduces minimal computational overhead while improving interpretability, pinpointing which tokens require steering and by how much.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Visual prompting has recently emerged as an efficient strategy to adapt vision models using lightweight, learnable parameters injected into the input space. However, prior work mainly targets large Vision Transformers and high-resolution datasets such as ImageNet. In contrast, small-image benchmarks like MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 remain widely used in education, prototyping, and research, yet have received little attention in the context of prompting. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{Multi-Scale Visual Prompting (MSVP)}, a simple and generic module that learns a set of global, mid-scale, and local prompt maps fused with the input image via a lightweight $1 \times 1$ convolution. MSVP is backbone-agnostic, adds less than $0.02\%$ parameters, and significantly improves performance across CNN and Vision Transformer backbones. We provide a unified benchmark on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 using a simple CNN, ResNet-18, and a small Vision Transformer. Our method yields consistent improvements with negligible computational overhead. We further include ablations on prompt scales, fusion strategies, and backbone architectures, along with qualitative analyzes using prompt visualizations and Grad-CAM. Our results demonstrate that multi-scale prompting provides an effective inductive bias even on low-resolution images.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this study, we present Colon-X, an open initiative aimed at advancing multimodal intelligence in colonoscopy. We begin by constructing ColonVQA, the most comprehensive multimodal dataset ever built for colonoscopy, featuring over 1.1M+ visual question answering entries across 76 clinical findings and 18 multimodal tasks. Beyond serving as a community-wide data foundation, we further investigate a critical yet underexplored transition in colonoscopy - evolving from multimodal understanding to clinical reasoning: (a) To capture the current landscape of multimodal understanding behaviors, we systematically assess the generalizability of 22 multimodal large language models and examine their reliability under human-induced perturbations. The results reveal that clinical outputs from leading MLLMs remain far from robust and trustworthy. (b) To narrow this gap, we further explore reasoning-centric intelligence tailored for colonoscopy. Specifically, we curate ColonReason, a clinically grounded reasoning dataset annotated through a multi-expert debating pipeline, and develop ColonR1, the first R1-styled model incorporating task-adaptive rewarding and gradient-stable optimization techniques. Under data-scarce conditions, our ColonR1 achieves 56.61% overall accuracy, outperforming supervised fine-tuning by 25.22%, and sets a new reasoning-enabled baseline for multimodal colonoscopy analysis.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, security, privacy, extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the growing reliance on cloud services for large-scale data management, preserving the security and privacy of outsourced datasets has become increasingly critical. While encrypting data and queries can prevent direct content exposure, recent research reveals that adversaries can still infer sensitive information via access pattern and search path analysis. However, existing solutions that offer strong access pattern privacy often incur substantial performance overhead. In this paper, we propose a novel privacy-preserving range query scheme over encrypted datasets, offering strong security guarantees while maintaining high efficiency. To achieve this, we develop secure learned spatial index (SLS-INDEX), a secure learned index that integrates the Paillier cryptosystem with a hierarchical prediction architecture and noise-injected buckets, enabling data-aware query acceleration in the encrypted domain. To further obfuscate query execution paths, SLS-INDEXbased Range Queries (SLRQ) employs a permutation-based secure bucket prediction protocol. Additionally, we introduce a secure point extraction protocol that generates candidate results to reduce the overhead of secure computation. We provide formal security analysis under realistic leakage functions and implement a prototype to evaluate its practical performance. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that SLRQ significantly outperforms existing solutions in query efficiency while ensuring dataset, query, result, and access pattern privacy.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) language technologies, particularly generative AI (GenAI) chatbots accessible via conversational interfaces, is transforming digital interactions. While these tools hold societal promise, they also risk widening digital divides due to uneven adoption and low awareness of their limitations. This study presents the first comprehensive empirical mapping of GenAI adoption, usage patterns, and literacy in Italy, based on newly collected survey data from 1,906 Italian-speaking adults. Our findings reveal widespread adoption for both work and personal use, including sensitive tasks like emotional support and medical advice. Crucially, GenAI is supplanting other technologies to become a primary information source: this trend persists despite low user digital literacy, posing a risk as users struggle to recognize errors or misinformation. Moreover, we identify a significant gender divide -- particularly pronounced in older generations -- where women are half as likely to adopt GenAI and use it less frequently than men. While we find literacy to be a key predictor of adoption, it only partially explains this disparity, suggesting that other barriers are at play. Overall, our data provide granular insights into the multipurpose usage of GenAI, highlighting the dual need for targeted educational initiatives and further investigation into the underlying barriers to equitable participation that competence alone cannot explain.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Hydro-Science and Engineering (Hydro-SE) is a critical and irreplaceable domain that secures human water supply, generates clean hydropower energy, and mitigates flood and drought disasters. Featuring multiple engineering objectives, Hydro-SE is an inherently interdisciplinary domain that integrates scientific knowledge with engineering expertise. This integration necessitates extensive expert collaboration in decision-making, which poses difficulties for intelligence. With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), their potential application in the Hydro-SE domain is being increasingly explored. However, the knowledge and application abilities of LLMs in Hydro-SE have not been sufficiently evaluated. To address this issue, we propose the Hydro-SE LLM evaluation benchmark (Hydro-SE Bench), which contains 4,000 multiple-choice questions. Hydro-SE Bench covers nine subfields and enables evaluation of LLMs in aspects of basic conceptual knowledge, engineering application ability, and reasoning and calculation ability. The evaluation results on Hydro-SE Bench show that the accuracy values vary among 0.74 to 0.80 for commercial LLMs, and among 0.41 to 0.68 for small-parameter LLMs. While LLMs perform well in subfields closely related to natural and physical sciences, they struggle with domain-specific knowledge such as industry standards and hydraulic structures. Model scaling mainly improves reasoning and calculation abilities, but there is still great potential for LLMs to better handle problems in practical engineering application. This study highlights the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs for Hydro-SE tasks, providing model developers with clear training targets and Hydro-SE researchers with practical guidance for applying LLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, transformer, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion transformers have demonstrated strong capabilities in generating high-quality images. However, as model size increases, the growing memory footprint and inference latency pose significant challenges for practical deployment. Recent studies in large language models (LLMs) show that rotation-based techniques can smooth outliers and enable 4-bit quantization, but these approaches often incur substantial overhead and struggle with row-wise outliers in diffusion transformers. To address these challenges, we propose ConvRot, a group-wise rotation-based quantization method that leverages regular Hadamard transform (RHT) to suppress both row-wise and column-wise outliers while reducing complexity from quadratic to linear. Building on this, we design ConvLinear4bit, a plug-and-play module that integrates rotation, quantization, GEMM, and dequantization, enabling W4A4 inference without retraining and preserving visual quality. Experiments on FLUX.1-dev demonstrate a 2.26$\times$ speedup and 4.05$\times$ memory reduction while maintaining image fidelity. To our knowledge, this is the first application of rotation-based quantization for plug-and-play W4A4 inference in diffusion transformers.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) can reliably distinguish grammatical from ungrammatical sentences, but how grammatical knowledge is represented within the models remains an open question. We investigate whether different syntactic phenomena recruit shared or distinct components in LLMs. Using a functional localization approach inspired by cognitive neuroscience, we identify the LLM units most responsive to 67 English syntactic phenomena in seven open-weight models. These units are consistently recruited across sentences containing the phenomena and causally support the models' syntactic performance. Critically, different types of syntactic agreement (e.g., subject-verb, anaphor, determiner-noun) recruit overlapping sets of units, suggesting that agreement constitutes a meaningful functional category for LLMs. This pattern holds in English, Russian, and Chinese; and further, in a cross-lingual analysis of 57 diverse languages, structurally more similar languages share more units for subject-verb agreement. Taken together, these findings reveal that syntactic agreement-a critical marker of syntactic dependencies-constitutes a meaningful category within LLMs' representational spaces.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While tabular machine learning has achieved remarkable success, temporal distribution shifts pose significant challenges in real-world deployment, as the relationships between features and labels continuously evolve. Static models assume fixed mappings to ensure generalization, whereas adaptive models may overfit to transient patterns, creating a dilemma between robustness and adaptability. In this paper, we analyze key factors essential for constructing an effective dynamic mapping for temporal tabular data. We discover that evolving feature semantics-particularly objective and subjective meanings-introduce concept drift over time. Crucially, we identify that feature transformation strategies are able to mitigate discrepancies in feature representations across temporal stages. Motivated by these insights, we propose a feature-aware temporal modulation mechanism that conditions feature representations on temporal context, modulating statistical properties such as scale and skewness. By aligning feature semantics across time, our approach achieves a lightweight yet powerful adaptation, effectively balancing generalizability and adaptability. Benchmark evaluations validate the effectiveness of our method in handling temporal shifts in tabular data.</li>

Existing text-to-3D stylization methods typically distill from 2D image editors, requiring time-intensive per-asset optimization and exhibiting multi-view inconsistency due to the limitations of current text-to-image models, which makes them impractical for large-scale production. In this paper, we introduce GaussianBlender, a pioneering feed-forward framework for text-driven 3D stylization that performs edits instantly at inference. Our method learns structured, disentangled latent spaces with controlled information sharing for geometry and appearance from spatially-grouped 3D Gaussians. A latent diffusion model then applies text-conditioned edits on these learned representations. Comprehensive evaluations show that GaussianBlender not only delivers instant, high-fidelity, geometry-preserving, multi-view consistent stylization, but also surpasses methods that require per-instance test-time optimization - unlocking practical, democratized 3D stylization at scale.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose a novel QTGNN framework for detecting fraudulent transactions in large-scale financial networks. By integrating quantum embedding, variational graph convolutions, and topological data analysis, QTGNN captures complex transaction dynamics and structural anomalies indicative of fraud. The methodology includes quantum data embedding with entanglement enhancement, variational quantum graph convolutions with non-linear dynamics, extraction of higher-order topological invariants, hybrid quantum-classical anomaly learning with adaptive optimization, and interpretable decision-making via topological attribution. Rigorous convergence guarantees ensure stable training on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, while stability of topological signatures provides robust fraud detection. Optimized for NISQ hardware with circuit simplifications and graph sampling, the framework scales to large transaction networks. Simulations on financial datasets, such as PaySim and Elliptic, benchmark QTGNN against classical and quantum baselines, using metrics like ROC-AUC, precision, and false positive rate. An ablation study evaluates the contributions of quantum embeddings, topological features, non-linear channels, and hybrid learning. QTGNN offers a theoretically sound, interpretable, and practical solution for financial fraud detection, bridging quantum machine learning, graph theory, and topological analysis.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Perceptual similarity scores that align with human vision are critical for both training and evaluating computer vision models. Deep perceptual losses, such as LPIPS, achieve good alignment but rely on complex, highly non-linear discriminative features with unknown invariances, while hand-crafted measures like SSIM are interpretable but miss key perceptual properties. We introduce the Structured Uncertainty Similarity Score (SUSS); it models each image through a set of perceptual components, each represented by a structured multivariate Normal distribution. These are trained in a generative, self-supervised manner to assign high likelihood to human-imperceptible augmentations. The final score is a weighted sum of component log-probabilities with weights learned from human perceptual datasets. Unlike feature-based methods, SUSS learns image-specific linear transformations of residuals in pixel space, enabling transparent inspection through decorrelated residuals and sampling. SUSS aligns closely with human perceptual judgments, shows strong perceptual calibration across diverse distortion types, and provides localized, interpretable explanations of its similarity assessments. We further demonstrate stable optimization behavior and competitive performance when using SUSS as a perceptual loss for downstream imaging tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Long-context dialogue systems suffer from State Inertia, where static constraints prevent models from resolving conflicts between evolving user intents and established historical context. To address this, we propose DZ-TDPO, a non-destructive alignment framework that synergizes conflict-aware dynamic KL constraints with a learnable temporal attention bias. Experiments on the Multi-Session Chat (MSC) dataset demonstrate that DZ-TDPO achieves state-of-the-art win rates (86.2% on Phi-3.5) while maintaining robust zero-shot generalization. Crucially, our scaling analysis reveals a "Capacity-Stability Trade-off": while smaller models incur an "alignment tax" (perplexity surge) to overcome historical inertia, the larger Qwen2.5-7B model achieves near-perfect alignment (99.4% win rate) with negligible perplexity overhead. This confirms that TAI can be alleviated via precise attention regulation rather than destructive weight updates, preserving general capabilities (MMLU) across model scales.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper presents DINO-RotateMatch, a deep-learning framework designed to address the chal lenges of image matching in large-scale 3D reconstruction from unstructured Internet images. The method integrates a dataset-adaptive image pairing strategy with rotation-aware keypoint extraction and matching. DINO is employed to retrieve semantically relevant image pairs in large collections, while rotation-based augmentation captures orientation-dependent local features using ALIKED and Light Glue. Experiments on the Kaggle Image Matching Challenge 2025 demonstrate consistent improve ments in mean Average Accuracy (mAA), achieving a Silver Award (47th of 943 teams).

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, attack, robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for diverse applications. However, their uniform token processing paradigm introduces critical vulnerabilities in instruction handling, particularly when exposed to adversarial scenarios. In this work, we identify and propose a novel class of vulnerabilities, termed Tool-Completion Attack (TCA), which exploits function-calling mechanisms to subvert model behavior. To evaluate LLM robustness against such threats, we introduce the Tool-Completion benchmark, a comprehensive security assessment framework, which reveals that even state-of-the-art models remain susceptible to TCA, with surprisingly high attack success rates. To address these vulnerabilities, we introduce Context-Aware Hierarchical Learning (CAHL), a sophisticated mechanism that dynamically balances semantic comprehension with role-specific instruction constraints. CAHL leverages the contextual correlations between different instruction segments to establish a robust, context-aware instruction hierarchy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CAHL significantly enhances LLM robustness against both conventional attacks and the proposed TCA, exhibiting strong generalization capabilities in zero-shot evaluations while still preserving model performance on generic tasks.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated remarkable performance on embodied tasks and shown promising potential for real-world applications. However, current VLAs still struggle to produce consistent and precise target-oriented actions, as they often generate redundant or unstable motions along trajectories, limiting their applicability in time-sensitive this http URL this work, we attribute these redundant actions to the spatially uniform perception field of existing VLAs, which causes them to be distracted by target-irrelevant objects, especially in complex this http URL address this issue, we propose an efficient PosA-VLA framework that anchors visual attention via pose-conditioned supervision, consistently guiding the model's perception toward task-relevant regions. The pose-conditioned anchor attention mechanism enables the model to better align instruction semantics with actionable visual cues, thereby improving action generation precision and efficiency. Moreover, our framework adopts a lightweight architecture and requires no auxiliary perception modules (e.g., segmentation or grounding networks), ensuring efficient inference. Extensive experiments verify that our method executes embodied tasks with precise and time-efficient behavior across diverse robotic manipulation benchmarks and shows robust generalization in a variety of challenging environments.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Adversarial perturbations are a useful way to expose vulnerabilities in object detectors. Existing perturbation methods are frequently white-box and architecture specific. More importantly, while they are often successful, it is rarely clear why they work. Insights into the mechanism of this success would allow developers to understand and analyze these attacks, as well as fine-tune the model to prevent them. This paper presents BlackCAtt, a black-box algorithm and a tool, which uses minimal, causally sufficient pixel sets to construct explainable, imperceptible, reproducible, architecture-agnostic attacks on object detectors. BlackCAtt combines causal pixels with bounding boxes produced by object detectors to create adversarial attacks that lead to the loss, modification or addition of a bounding box. BlackCAtt works across different object detectors of different sizes and architectures, treating the detector as a black box. We compare the performance of BlackCAtt with other black-box attack methods and show that identification of causal pixels leads to more precisely targeted and less perceptible attacks. On the COCO test dataset, our approach is 2.7 times better than the baseline in removing a detection, 3.86 times better in changing a detection, and 5.75 times better in triggering new, spurious, detections. The attacks generated by BlackCAtt are very close to the original image, and hence imperceptible, demonstrating the power of causal pixels.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Accurate and reliable search on online healthcare platforms is critical for user safety and service efficacy. Traditional methods, however, often fail to comprehend complex and nuanced user queries, limiting their effectiveness. Large language models (LLMs) present a promising solution, offering powerful semantic understanding to bridge this gap. Despite their potential, deploying LLMs in this high-stakes domain is fraught with challenges, including factual hallucinations, specialized knowledge gaps, and high operational costs. To overcome these barriers, we introduce \textbf{AR-Med}, a novel framework for \textbf{A}utomated \textbf{R}elevance assessment for \textbf{Med}ical search that has been successfully deployed at scale on the Online Medical Delivery Platforms. AR-Med grounds LLM reasoning in verified medical knowledge through a retrieval-augmented approach, ensuring high accuracy and reliability. To enable efficient online service, we design a practical knowledge distillation scheme that compresses large teacher models into compact yet powerful student models. We also introduce LocalQSMed, a multi-expert annotated benchmark developed to guide model iteration and ensure strong alignment between offline and online performance. Extensive experiments show AR-Med achieves an offline accuracy of over 93\%, a 24\% absolute improvement over the original online system, and delivers significant gains in online relevance and user satisfaction. Our work presents a practical and scalable blueprint for developing trustworthy, LLM-powered systems in real-world healthcare applications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that think with images can interactively use tools to reason about visual inputs, but current approaches often rely on a narrow set of tools with limited real-world necessity and scalability. In this work, we first reveal a critical and previously overlooked weakness: even state-of-the-art MLLMs are surprisingly brittle, showing significant performance degradation on images with simple orientation changes or natural corruptions, underscoring the need for more robust tool-based reasoning. To address this, we propose CodeVision, a flexible and scalable code-as-tool framework where the model generates code as a universal interface to invoke any image operation, moving beyond fixed tool registries. We train our model using a two-stage methodology, beginning with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on a high-quality dataset curated for complex, multi-turn tool composition and error recovery, followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a novel and dense process reward function to encourage strategic and efficient tool use. To facilitate this research, we construct new SFT and RL datasets and introduce a challenging new benchmark suite designed to rigorously evaluate robustness to orientation changes and multi-tool reasoning. Experiments on Qwen2.5-VL and Qwen3-VL series show that our approach significantly improves model performance and fosters emergent capabilities such as flexible tool composition, efficient chained execution, and robust error recovery from runtime feedback.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved widespread success due to their ability to generate high-resolution, photorealistic images. These models are trained on large-scale datasets, like LAION-5B, often scraped from the internet. However, since this data contains numerous biases, the models inherently learn and reproduce them, resulting in stereotypical outputs. We introduce SelfDebias, a fully unsupervised test-time debiasing method applicable to any diffusion model that uses a UNet as its noise predictor. SelfDebias identifies semantic clusters in an image encoder's embedding space and uses these clusters to guide the diffusion process during inference, minimizing the KL divergence between the output distribution and the uniform distribution. Unlike supervised approaches, SelfDebias does not require human-annotated datasets or external classifiers trained for each generated concept. Instead, it is designed to automatically identify semantic modes. Extensive experiments show that SelfDebias generalizes across prompts and diffusion model architectures, including both conditional and unconditional models. It not only effectively debiases images along key demographic dimensions while maintaining the visual fidelity of the generated images, but also more abstract concepts for which identifying biases is also challenging.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Previously, image interpretation in radiology relied heavily on manual methods. However, manual classification of brain tumor medical images is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Even with shallow convolutional neural network models, the accuracy is not ideal. To improve the efficiency and accuracy of brain tumor image classification, this paper proposes a brain tumor classification model based on an improved ResNet34 network. This model uses the ResNet34 residual network as the backbone network and incorporates multi-scale feature extraction. It uses a multi-scale input module as the first layer of the ResNet34 network and an Inception v2 module as the residual downsampling layer. Furthermore, a channel attention mechanism module assigns different weights to different channels of the image from a channel domain perspective, obtaining more important feature information. The results after a five-fold crossover experiment show that the average classification accuracy of the improved network model is approximately 98.8%, which is not only 1% higher than ResNet34, but also only 80% of the number of parameters of the original model. Therefore, the improved network model not only improves accuracy but also reduces clutter, achieving a classification effect with fewer parameters and higher accuracy.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, diffusion, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Reinforcement Learning (RL) has proven highly effective for autoregressive language models, but adapting these methods to diffusion large language models (dLLMs) presents fundamental challenges. The core difficulty lies in likelihood approximation: while autoregressive models naturally provide token-level conditional probabilities essential for token-level RL objectives (e.g., GRPO), dLLMs generate sequences through iterative non-autoregressive denoising steps that lack this factorization. To address this fundamental mismatch, we propose ELBO-based Sequence-level Policy Optimization (ESPO), a principled RL framework that treats entire sequence generation as a single action and uses the ELBO as a tractable sequence-level likelihood proxy. Our method incorporates per-token normalization of importance ratios and robust KL-divergence estimation to ensure stable large-scale training. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning, coding, and planning tasks demonstrate that ESPO significantly outperforms token-level baselines, achieving dramatic improvements of 20-40 points on the Countdown task, while maintaining consistent gains on math and coding benchmarks. Our approach establishes sequence-level optimization as a principled and empirically effective paradigm for RL in dLLMs. Our code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, privacy</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Public companies and institutional investors that hold Bitcoin face increasing pressure to show solvency, manage risk, and satisfy regulatory expectations without exposing internal wallet structures or trading strategies. This paper introduces the Treasury Proof Ledger (TPL), a Bitcoin-anchored logging framework for multi-domain Bitcoin treasuries that treats on-chain and off-chain exposures as a conserved state machine with an explicit fee sink. A TPL instance records proof-of-reserves snapshots, proof-of-transit receipts for movements between domains, and policy metadata, and it supports restricted views based on stakeholder permissions. We define an idealised TPL model, represent Bitcoin treasuries as multi-domain exposure vectors, and give deployment-level security notions including exposure soundness, policy completeness, non-equivocation, and privacy-compatible policy views. We then outline how practical, restricted forms of these guarantees can be achieved by combining standard proof-of-reserves and proof-of-transit techniques with hash-based commitments anchored on Bitcoin. The results are existence-type statements: they show which guarantees are achievable once economic and governance assumptions are set, without claiming that any current system already provides them. A stylised corporate-treasury example illustrates how TPL could support responsible transparency policies and future cross-institution checks consistent with Bitcoin's fixed monetary supply.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Optimization methods play a central role in signal processing, serving as the mathematical foundation for inference, estimation, and control. While classical iterative optimization algorithms provide interpretability and theoretical guarantees, they often rely on surrogate objectives, require careful hyperparameter tuning, and exhibit substantial computational latency. Conversely, machine learning (ML ) offers powerful data-driven modeling capabilities but lacks the structure, transparency, and efficiency needed for optimization-driven inference. Deep unfolding has recently emerged as a compelling framework that bridges these two paradigms by systematically transforming iterative optimization algorithms into structured, trainable ML architectures. This article provides a tutorial-style overview of deep unfolding, presenting a unified perspective of methodologies for converting optimization solvers into ML models and highlighting their conceptual, theoretical, and practical implications. We review the foundations of optimization for inference and for learning, introduce four representative design paradigms for deep unfolding, and discuss the distinctive training schemes that arise from their iterative nature. Furthermore, we survey recent theoretical advances that establish convergence and generalization guarantees for unfolded optimizers, and provide comparative qualitative and empirical studies illustrating their relative trade-offs in complexity, interpretability, and robustness.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, interpretability, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce \textbf{Doublespeak}, a simple \emph{in-context representation hijacking} attack against large language models (LLMs). The attack works by systematically replacing a harmful keyword (e.g., \textit{bomb}) with a benign token (e.g., \textit{carrot}) across multiple in-context examples, provided a prefix to a harmful request. We demonstrate that this substitution leads to the internal representation of the benign token converging toward that of the harmful one, effectively embedding the harmful semantics under a euphemism. As a result, superficially innocuous prompts (e.g., ``How to build a carrot?'') are internally interpreted as disallowed instructions (e.g., ``How to build a bomb?''), thereby bypassing the model's safety alignment. We use interpretability tools to show that this semantic overwrite emerges layer by layer, with benign meanings in early layers converging into harmful semantics in later ones. Doublespeak is optimization-free, broadly transferable across model families, and achieves strong success rates on closed-source and open-source systems, reaching 74\% ASR on Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct with a single-sentence context override. Our findings highlight a new attack surface in the latent space of LLMs, revealing that current alignment strategies are insufficient and should instead operate at the representation level.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, security</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is rapidly emerging as the middleware for LLM-based applications, offering a standardized interface for tool integration. However, its built-in security mechanisms are minimal: while schemas and declarations prevent malformed requests, MCP provides no guarantees of authenticity or confidentiality, forcing developers to implement cryptography themselves. Such ad hoc practices are historically prone to misuse, and within MCP they threaten sensitive data and services. We present MICRYSCOPE, the first domain-specific framework for detecting cryptographic misuses in MCP implementations. MICRYSCOPE combines three key innovations: a cross-language intermediate representation that normalizes cryptographic APIs across diverse ecosystems, a hybrid dependency analysis that uncovers explicit and implicit function relationships (including insecure runtime compositions orchestrated by LLMs) and a taint-based misuse detector that tracks sensitive data flows and flags violations of established cryptographic rules. Applying MICRYSCOPE to 9,403 MCP servers, we identified 720 with cryptographic logic, of which 19.7% exhibited misuses. These flaws are concentrated in certain markets (e.g., Smithery Registry with 42% insecure servers), languages (Python at 34% misuse rate), and categories (Developer Tools and Data Science & ML accounting for over 50% of all misuses). Case studies reveal real-world consequences, including leaked API keys, insecure DES/ECB tools, and MD5-based authentication bypasses. Our study establishes the first ecosystem-wide view of cryptographic misuse in MCP and provides both tools and insights to strengthen the security foundations of this rapidly growing protocol.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, security, privacy</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Cross-chain technology enables interoperability among otherwise isolated blockchains, supporting interactions across heterogeneous networks. Similar to how multi-hop communication became fundamental in the evolution of the Internet, the demand for multi-hop cross-chain interactions is gaining increasing attention. However, this growing demand introduces new security and privacy challenges. On the security side, multi-hop interactions depend on the availability of multiple participating nodes. If any node becomes temporarily offline during execution, the protocol may fail to complete correctly, leading to settlement failure or fund loss. On the privacy side, the need for on-chain transparency to validate intermediate states may unintentionally leak linkable information, compromising the unlinkability of user interactions. In this paper, we propose the Cross-Chain Channel Network (CCN), a decentralized network designed to support secure and privacy-preserving multi-hop cross-chain transactions. Through experimental evaluation, we identify two critical types of offline failures, referred to as active and passive offline cases, which have not been adequately addressed by existing solutions. To mitigate these issues, we introduce R-HTLC, a core protocol within CCN. R-HTLC incorporates an hourglass mechanism and a multi-path refund strategy to ensure settlement correctness even when some nodes go offline during execution. Importantly, CCN addresses not only the correctness under offline conditions but also maintains unlinkability in such adversarial settings. To overcome this, CCN leverages zero-knowledge proofs and off-chain coordination, ensuring that interaction relationships remain indistinguishable even when certain nodes are temporarily offline.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>secure, security, attack</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or drones are being introduced in a wide range of commercial applications. This has also made them prime targets of attackers who compromise their fundamental security properties, including confidentiality, integrity, and availability. As researchers discover novel threat vectors in UAVs, the government and industry are increasingly concerned about their limited ability to secure and regulate UAVs and their usage. With the aim of unfolding a path for a large-scale commercial UAV network deployment, we conduct a comprehensive state-of-the-art study and examine the prevailing security challenges. Unlike the prior art, we focus on uncovering the research gaps that must be addressed to enforce security policy regulations in civilian off-the-shelf drone systems. To that end, we first examine the known security threats to UAVs based on their impact and effectiveness. We then analyze existing countermeasures to prevent, detect, and respond to these threats in terms of security and performance overhead. We further outline the future research directions for securing UAVs. Finally, we establish the fundamental requirements and highlight critical research challenges in introducing a regulatory entity to achieve a secure and regulated UAV network.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Contrastive decoding is a lightweight and effective inference-time method that improves the quality of text generation in Large Language Models. However, algorithms such as DoLa (Decoding by Contrastive Layers) have only been implemented in decoder-only architectures and studied for their impact on improving factuality. This work adapts DoLa for the T5 and FLAN-T5 model families and evaluates its impact on the models' instruction following capabilities, which to our knowledge is the first implementation of a contrastive decoding strategy in an encoder-decoder architecture. Our results show that DoLa improves the faithfulness of text generation for certain categories of tasks and harms others. To understand these results, we present a layer-by-layer analysis of logit evolution in a FLAN-T5 model to quantify DoLa's impact on token output probabilities.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Dynamic Algorithm Configuration (DAC) studies the efficient identification of control policies for parameterized optimization algorithms. Numerous studies have leveraged the robustness of decision-making in Reinforcement Learning (RL) to address the optimization challenges in algorithm configuration. However, applying RL to DAC is challenging and often requires extensive domain expertise. We conduct a comprehensive study of deep-RL algorithms in DAC through a systematic analysis of controlling the population size parameter of the (1+($\lambda$,$\lambda$))-GA on OneMax instances. Our investigation of DDQN and PPO reveals two fundamental challenges that limit their effectiveness in DAC: scalability degradation and learning instability. We trace these issues to two primary causes: under-exploration and planning horizon coverage, each of which can be effectively addressed through targeted solutions. To address under-exploration, we introduce an adaptive reward shifting mechanism that leverages reward distribution statistics to enhance DDQN agent exploration, eliminating the need for instance-specific hyperparameter tuning and ensuring consistent effectiveness across different problem scales. In dealing with the planning horizon coverage problem, we demonstrate that undiscounted learning effectively resolves it in DDQN, while PPO faces fundamental variance issues that necessitate alternative algorithmic designs. We further analyze the hyperparameter dependencies of PPO, showing that while hyperparameter optimization enhances learning stability, it consistently falls short in identifying effective policies across various configurations. Finally, we demonstrate that DDQN equipped with our adaptive reward shifting strategy achieves performance comparable to theoretically derived policies with vastly improved sample efficiency, outperforming prior DAC approaches by several orders of magnitude.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Egyptian hieroglyphs, the ancient Egyptian writing system, are composed entirely of drawings. Translating these glyphs into English poses various challenges, including the fact that a single glyph can have multiple meanings. Deep learning translation applications are evolving rapidly, producing remarkable results that significantly impact our lives. In this research, we propose a method for the automatic recognition and translation of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs from images to English. This study utilized two datasets for classification and translation: the Morris Franken dataset and the EgyptianTranslation dataset. Our approach is divided into three stages: segmentation (using Contour and Detectron2), mapping symbols to Gardiner codes, and translation (using the CNN model). The model achieved a BLEU score of 42.2, a significant result compared to previous research.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Due to their architecture and vast pre-training data, large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong text classification performance. However, LLM output - here, the category assigned to a text - depends heavily on the wording of the prompt. While literature on prompt engineering is expanding, few studies focus on classification tasks, and even fewer address domains like psychology, where constructs have precise, theory-driven definitions that may not be well represented in pre-training data. We present an empirical framework for optimizing LLM performance for identifying constructs in texts via prompt engineering. We experimentally evaluate five prompting strategies --codebook-guided empirical prompt selection, automatic prompt engineering, persona prompting, chain-of-thought reasoning, and explanatory prompting - with zero-shot and few-shot classification. We find that persona, chain-of-thought, and explanations do not fully address performance loss accompanying a badly worded prompt. Instead, the most influential features of a prompt are the construct definition, task framing, and, to a lesser extent, the examples provided. Across three constructs and two models, the classifications most aligned with expert judgments resulted from a few-shot prompt combining codebook-guided empirical prompt selection with automatic prompt engineering. Based on our findings, we recommend that researchers generate and evaluate as many prompt variants as feasible, whether human-crafted, automatically generated, or ideally both, and select prompts and examples based on empirical performance in a training dataset, validating the final approach in a holdout set. This procedure offers a practical, systematic, and theory-driven method for optimizing LLM prompts in settings where alignment with expert judgment is critical.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The widespread adoption of depth sensors has substantially lowered the barrier to point-cloud acquisition. This letter proposes a semantic wireless transmission framework for three dimension (3D) point clouds built on Deep Joint Source - Channel Coding (DeepJSCC). Instead of sending raw features, the transmitter predicts combination weights over a receiver-side semantic orthogonal feature pool, enabling compact representations and robust reconstruction. A folding-based decoder deforms a 2D grid into 3D, enforcing manifold continuity while preserving geometric fidelity. Trained with Chamfer Distance (CD) and an orthogonality regularizer, the system is evaluated on ModelNet40 across varying Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs) and bandwidths. Results show performance on par with SEmantic Point cloud Transmission (SEPT) at high bandwidth and clear gains in bandwidth-constrained regimes, with consistent improvements in both Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and CD. Ablation experiments confirm the benefits of orthogonalization and the folding prior.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Proliferation of cheap and accessible cameras makes it possible to measure a subject's breath rate from video footage alone. Recent works on this topic have proposed a variety of approaches for accurately measuring human breath rate, however they are either tested in near-ideal conditions, or produce results that are not sufficiently accurate. The present study proposes a more robust method to measure breath rate in humans with minimal hardware requirements using a combination of mathematical transforms with a relative deviation from the ground truth of less than 5%. The method was tested on videos taken from 14 volunteers with a total duration of over 2 hours 30 minutes. The obtained results were compared to reference data and the average mean absolute error was found to be at 0.57 respirations per minute, which is noticeably better than the results from previous works. The breath rate measurement method proposed in the present article is more resistant to distortions caused by subject movement and thus allows one to remotely measure the subject's breath rate without any significant limitations on the subject's behavior.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Unet and its variations have been standard in semantic image segmentation, especially for computer assisted radiology. Current Unet architectures iteratively downsample spatial resolution while increasing channel dimensions to preserve information content. Such a structure demands a large memory footprint, limiting training batch sizes and increasing inference latency. Channel pruning compresses Unet architecture without accuracy loss, but requires lengthy optimization and may not generalize across tasks and datasets. By investigating Unet pruning, we hypothesize that the final structure is the crucial factor, not the channel selection strategy of pruning. Based on our observations, we propose a lean Unet architecture (LUnet) with a compact, flat hierarchy where channels are not doubled as resolution is halved. We evaluate on a public MRI dataset allowing comparable reporting, as well as on two internal CT datasets. We show that a state-of-the-art pruning solution (STAMP) mainly prunes from the layers with the highest number of channels. Comparatively, simply eliminating a random channel at the pruning-identified layer or at the largest layer achieves similar or better performance. Our proposed LUnet with fixed architectures and over 30 times fewer parameters achieves performance comparable to both conventional Unet counterparts and data-adaptively pruned networks. The proposed lean Unet with constant channel count across layers requires far fewer parameters while achieving performance superior to standard Unet for the same total number of parameters. Skip connections allow Unet bottleneck channels to be largely reduced, unlike standard encoder-decoder architectures requiring increased bottleneck channels for information propagation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Human action recognition (HAR) in videos has garnered widespread attention due to the rich information in RGB videos. Nevertheless, existing methods for extracting deep features from RGB videos face challenges such as information redundancy, susceptibility to noise and high storage costs. To address these issues and fully harness the useful information in videos, we propose a novel heatmap pooling network (HP-Net) for action recognition from videos, which extracts information-rich, robust and concise pooled features of the human body in videos through a feedback pooling module. The extracted pooled features demonstrate obvious performance advantages over the previously obtained pose data and heatmap features from videos. In addition, we design a spatial-motion co-learning module and a text refinement modulation module to integrate the extracted pooled features with other multimodal data, enabling more robust action recognition. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks namely NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, Toyota-Smarthome and UAV-Human consistently verify the effectiveness of our HP-Net, which outperforms the existing human action recognition methods.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Prevailing Dataset Distillation (DD) methods leveraging generative models confront two fundamental limitations. First, despite pioneering the use of diffusion models in DD and delivering impressive performance, the vast majority of approaches paradoxically require a diffusion model pre-trained on the full target dataset, undermining the very purpose of DD and incurring prohibitive training costs. Second, although some methods turn to general text-to-image models without relying on such target-specific training, they suffer from a significant distributional mismatch, as the web-scale priors encapsulated in these foundation models fail to faithfully capture the target-specific semantics, leading to suboptimal performance. To tackle these challenges, we propose Core Distribution Alignment (CoDA), a framework that enables effective DD using only an off-the-shelf text-to-image model. Our key idea is to first identify the "intrinsic core distribution" of the target dataset using a robust density-based discovery mechanism. We then steer the generative process to align the generated samples with this core distribution. By doing so, CoDA effectively bridges the gap between general-purpose generative priors and target semantics, yielding highly representative distilled datasets. Extensive experiments suggest that, without relying on a generative model specifically trained on the target dataset, CoDA achieves performance on par with or even superior to previous methods with such reliance across all benchmarks, including ImageNet-1K and its subsets. Notably, it establishes a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 60.4% at the 50-images-per-class (IPC) setup on ImageNet-1K. Our code is available on the project webpage: this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown strong performance in LLM post-training, but real-world deployment often involves noisy or incomplete supervision. In such settings, complex and unreliable supervision signals can destabilize training and harm generalization. While existing approaches such as worst-case optimization (e.g., RFQI, CQL) and mean-based methods (e.g., PPO, GRPO) can improve stability, they often overlook generalization and may produce overly conservative policies, leading to uneven performance across diverse real scenarios. To this end, we introduce DVPO (Distributional Value Modeling with Risk-aware Policy Optimization), a new RL framework that combines conditional risk theory with distributional value modeling to better balance robustness and generalization. DVPO learns token-level value distributions to provide fine-grained supervision, and applies an asymmetric risk regularization to shape the distribution tails: it contracts the lower tail to dampen noisy negative deviations, while expanding the upper tail to preserve exploratory diversity. Across extensive experiments and analysis in multi-turn dialogue, math reasoning, and scientific QA, DVPO consistently outperforms PPO, GRPO, and robust Bellman-based PPO under noisy supervision, showing its potential for LLM post-training in the real-world.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Cardiac image analysis remains fragmented across tasks: anatomical segmentation, disease classification, and grounded clinical report generation are typically handled by separate networks trained under different data regimes. No existing framework unifies these objectives within a single architecture while retaining generalization across imaging modalities and datasets. We introduce PULSE, a multi-task vision-language framework built on self-supervised representations and optimized through a composite supervision strategy that balances region overlap learning, pixel wise classification fidelity, and boundary aware IoU refinement. A multi-scale token reconstruction decoder enables anatomical segmentation, while shared global representations support disease classification and clinically grounded text output allowing the model to transition from pixels to structures and finally clinical reasoning within one architecture. Unlike prior task-specific pipelines, PULSE learns task-invariant cardiac priors, generalizes robustly across datasets, and can be adapted to new imaging modalities with minimal supervision. This moves the field closer to a scalable, foundation style cardiac analysis framework.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Traffic image restoration under adverse weather conditions remains a critical challenge for intelligent transportation systems. Existing methods primarily focus on spatial-domain modeling but neglect frequency-domain priors. Although the emerging Mamba architecture excels at long-range dependency modeling through patch-wise correlation analysis, its potential for frequency-domain feature extraction remains unexplored. To address this, we propose Frequency-Aware Mamba (FAMamba), a novel framework that integrates frequency guidance with sequence modeling for efficient image restoration. Our architecture consists of two key components: (1) a Dual-Branch Feature Extraction Block (DFEB) that enhances local-global interaction via bidirectional 2D frequency-adaptive scanning, dynamically adjusting traversal paths based on sub-band texture distributions; and (2) a Prior-Guided Block (PGB) that refines texture details through wavelet-based high-frequency residual learning, enabling high-quality image reconstruction with precise details. Meanwhile, we design a novel Adaptive Frequency Scanning Mechanism (AFSM) for the Mamba architecture, which enables the Mamba to achieve frequency-domain scanning across distinct subgraphs, thereby fully leveraging the texture distribution characteristics inherent in subgraph structures. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of FAMamba.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in digital pathology. Publicly available histopathology datasets remain scarce, and those that do exist predominantly represent Western populations. Consequently, the generalizability of AI models to populations from less digitized regions, such as the Middle East, is largely unknown. This motivates the public release of our dataset to support the development and validation of pathology AI models across globally diverse populations. We present 339 whole-slide images of prostate core needle biopsies from a consecutive series of 185 patients collected in Erbil, Iraq. The slides are associated with Gleason scores and International Society of Urological Pathology grades assigned independently by three pathologists. Scanning was performed using two high-throughput scanners (Leica and Hamamatsu) and one compact scanner (Grundium). All slides were de-identified and are provided in their native formats without further conversion. The dataset enables grading concordance analyses, color normalization, and cross-scanner robustness evaluations. Data will be deposited in the Bioimage Archive (BIA) under accession code: to be announced (TBA), and released under a CC BY 4.0 license.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While transformer-based architectures have taken computer vision and NLP by storm, they often require a vast amount of parameters and training data to attain strong performance. In this work, we experiment with three distinct pre-training, intermediate fine-tuning, and downstream datasets and training objectives to explore their marginal benefits on a small 5M-parameter vision transformer. We find that while pre-training and fine-tuning always help our model but have diminishing returns, intermediate fine-tuning can actually show harmful impact on downstream performance, potentially due to dissimilarity in task mechanics. Taken together, our results suggest that small-scale ViTs benefit most from targeted pre-training and careful data selection, while indiscriminate stacking of intermediate tasks can waste compute and even degrade performance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>extraction</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present CaravelMetrics, a computational framework for automated cerebrovascular analysis that models vessel morphology through skeletonization-derived graph representations. The framework integrates atlas-based regional parcellation, centerline extraction, and graph construction to compute fifteen morphometric, topological, fractal, and geometric features. The features can be estimated globally from the complete vascular network or regionally within arterial territories, enabling multiscale characterization of cerebrovascular organization. Applied to 570 3D TOF-MRA scans from the IXI dataset (ages 20-86), CaravelMetrics yields reproducible vessel graphs capturing age- and sex-related variations and education-associated increases in vascular complexity, consistent with findings reported in the literature. The framework provides a scalable and fully automated approach for quantitative cerebrovascular feature extraction, supporting normative modeling and population-level studies of vascular health and aging.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Transformer decoders have achieved strong results across tasks, but the memory required for the KV cache becomes prohibitive at long sequence lengths. Although Cross-layer KV Cache sharing (e.g., YOCO, CLA) offers a path to mitigate KV Cache bottleneck, it typically underperforms within-layer methods like GQA. To understand the root cause, we investigate the information flow of keys and values of the top-layers. Our preliminary reveals a clear distribution: values are predominantly derived from the bottom layer, while keys draw more information from both bottom and middle layers. Building upon this, we propose FusedKV, whose top-layer KV caches are a learnable fusion of the most informative ones from the bottom and middle layers. This fusion operates directly on post-RoPE keys, preserving relative positional information without the computational cost of re-applying rotary embeddings. To further improve efficiency, we propose FusedKV-Lite, an cross-layer sharing approach, where top-layer KV caches are directly derived from the bottom-layer values and the middle-layer keys. Compared to FusedKV, FusedKV-Lite reduces I/O overhead at the cost of a slight increase in perplexity. In experiments on LLMs ranging from 332M to 4B parameters, our proposed method reduce 50\% cache memory while achieving lower validation perplexity than the standard Transformer decoder, establishing it as a memory-efficient, high-performance architectural alternative.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>security, attack, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Few-shot class incremental learning (FSCIL) is a more realistic and challenging paradigm in continual learning to incrementally learn unseen classes and overcome catastrophic forgetting on base classes with only a few training examples. Previous efforts have primarily centered around studying more effective FSCIL approaches. By contrast, less attention was devoted to thinking the security issues in contributing to FSCIL. This paper aims to provide a holistic study of the impact of attacks on FSCIL. We first derive insights by systematically exploring how human expert-designed attack methods (i.e., PGD, FGSM) affect FSCIL. We find that those methods either fail to attack base classes, or suffer from huge labor costs due to relying on huge expert knowledge. This highlights the need to craft a specialized attack method for FSCIL. Grounded in these insights, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective ACraft method to automatically steer and discover optimal attack methods targeted at FSCIL by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) without human experts. Moreover, to improve the reasoning between LLMs and FSCIL, we introduce a novel Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) based reinforcement learning to optimize learning, making LLMs generate better attack methods in the next generation by establishing positive feedback. Experiments on mainstream benchmarks show that our ACraft significantly degrades the performance of state-of-the-art FSCIL methods and dramatically beyond human expert-designed attack methods while maintaining the lowest costs of attack.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Increasing evidence supports watch-and-wait (WW) surveillance for patients with rectal cancer who show clinical complete response (cCR) at restaging following total neoadjuvant treatment (TNT). However, objectively accurate methods to early detect local regrowth (LR) from follow-up endoscopy images during WW are essential to manage care and prevent distant metastases. Hence, we developed a Siamese Swin Transformer with Dual Cross-Attention (SSDCA) to combine longitudinal endoscopic images at restaging and follow-up and distinguish cCR from LR. SSDCA leverages pretrained Swin transformers to extract domain agnostic features and enhance robustness to imaging variations. Dual cross attention is implemented to emphasize features from the two scans without requiring any spatial alignment of images to predict response. SSDCA as well as Swin-based baselines were trained using image pairs from 135 patients and evaluated on a held-out set of image pairs from 62 patients. SSDCA produced the best balanced accuracy (81.76\% $\pm$ 0.04), sensitivity (90.07\% $\pm$ 0.08), and specificity (72.86\% $\pm$ 0.05). Robustness analysis showed stable performance irrespective of artifacts including blood, stool, telangiectasia, and poor image quality. UMAP clustering of extracted features showed maximal inter-cluster separation (1.45 $\pm$ 0.18) and minimal intra-cluster dispersion (1.07 $\pm$ 0.19) with SSDCA, confirming discriminative representation learning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Fuzzy simplicial sets have become an object of interest in dimensionality reduction and manifold learning, most prominently through their role in UMAP. However, their definition through tools from algebraic topology without a clear probabilistic interpretation detaches them from commonly used theoretical frameworks in those areas. In this work we introduce a framework that explains fuzzy simplicial sets as marginals of probability measures on simplicial sets. In particular, this perspective shows that the fuzzy weights of UMAP arise from a generative model that samples Vietoris-Rips filtrations at random scales, yielding cumulative distribution functions of pairwise distances. More generally, the framework connects fuzzy simplicial sets to probabilistic models on the face poset, clarifies the relation between Kullback-Leibler divergence and fuzzy cross-entropy in this setting, and recovers standard t-norms and t-conorms via Boolean operations on the underlying simplicial sets. We then show how new embedding methods may be derived from this framework and illustrate this on an example where we generalize UMAP using Čech filtrations with triplet sampling. In summary, this probabilistic viewpoint provides a unified probabilistic theoretical foundation for fuzzy simplicial sets, clarifies the role of UMAP within this framework, and enables the systematic derivation of new dimensionality reduction methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Language models depend on massive text corpora that are often filtered for quality, a process that can unintentionally exclude non-standard linguistic varieties, reduce model robustness and reinforce representational biases. In this paper, we argue that language models should aim to capture the full spectrum of language variation (dialectal, historical, informal, etc.) rather than relying solely on standardized text. Focusing on Basque, a morphologically rich and low-resource language, we construct new corpora combining standard, social media, and historical sources, and pre-train the BERnaT family of encoder-only models in three configurations: standard, diverse, and combined. We further propose an evaluation framework that separates Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks into standard and diverse subsets to assess linguistic generalization. Results show that models trained on both standard and diverse data consistently outperform those trained on standard corpora, improving performance across all task types without compromising standard benchmark accuracy. These findings highlight the importance of linguistic diversity in building inclusive, generalizable language models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The remarkable success in text-to-image diffusion models has motivated extensive investigation of their potential for video applications. Zero-shot techniques aim to adapt image diffusion models for videos without requiring further model training. Recent methods largely emphasize integrating inter-frame correspondence into attention mechanisms. However, the soft constraint applied to identify the valid features to attend is insufficient, which could lead to temporal inconsistency. In this paper, we present FRESCO, which integrates intra-frame correspondence with inter-frame correspondence to formulate a more robust spatial-temporal constraint. This enhancement ensures a consistent transformation of semantically similar content between frames. Our method goes beyond attention guidance to explicitly optimize features, achieving high spatial-temporal consistency with the input video, significantly enhancing the visual coherence of manipulated videos. We verify FRESCO adaptations on two zero-shot tasks of video-to-video translation and text-guided video editing. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in generating high-quality, coherent videos, highlighting a significant advance over current zero-shot methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) for reservoir seepage is critical for optimizing oil and gas field development and predicting production performance. Traditional numerical methods suffer from mesh-dependent errors and high computational costs, while classical Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) face bottlenecks in parameter efficiency, high-dimensional expression, and strong nonlinear fitting. To address these limitations, we propose a Discrete Variable (DV)-Circuit Quantum-Classical Physics-Informed Neural Network (QCPINN) and apply it to three typical reservoir seepage models for the first time: the pressure diffusion equation for heterogeneous single-phase flow, the nonlinear Buckley-Leverett (BL) equation for two-phase waterflooding, and the convection-diffusion equation for compositional flow considering adsorption. The QCPINN integrates classical preprocessing/postprocessing networks with a DV quantum core, leveraging quantum superposition and entanglement to enhance high-dimensional feature mapping while embedding physical constraints to ensure solution consistency. We test three quantum circuit topologies (Cascade, Cross-mesh, Alternate) and demonstrate through numerical experiments that QCPINNs achieve high prediction accuracy with fewer parameters than classical PINNs. Specifically, the Alternate topology outperforms others in heterogeneous single-phase flow and two-phase BL equation simulations, while the Cascade topology excels in compositional flow with convection-dispersion-adsorption coupling. Our work verifies the feasibility of QCPINN for reservoir engineering applications, bridging the gap between quantum computing research and industrial practice in oil and gas engineering.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, interpretability</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce Density-Informed VAE (DiVAE), a lightweight, data-driven regularizer that aligns the VAE log-prior probability $\log p_Z(z)$ with a log-density estimated from data. Standard VAEs match latents to a simple prior, overlooking density structure in the data-space. DiVAE encourages the encoder to allocate posterior mass in proportion to data-space density and, when the prior is learnable, nudges the prior toward high-density regions. This is realized by adding a robust, precision-weighted penalty to the ELBO, incurring negligible computational overhead. On synthetic datasets, DiVAE (i) improves distributional alignment of latent log-densities to its ground truth counterpart, (ii) improves prior coverage, and (iii) yields better OOD uncertainty calibration. On MNIST, DiVAE improves alignment of the prior with external estimates of the density, providing better interpretability, and improves OOD detection for learnable priors.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent stateful recurrent neural networks have achieved remarkable progress on static 3D reconstruction but remain vulnerable to motion-induced artifacts, where non-rigid regions corrupt attention propagation between the spatial memory and image feature. By analyzing the internal behaviors of the state and image token updating mechanism, we find that aggregating self-attention maps across layers reveals a consistent pattern: dynamic regions are naturally down-weighted, exposing an implicit motion cue that the pretrained transformer already encodes but never explicitly uses. Motivated by this observation, we introduce MUT3R, a training-free framework that applies the attention-derived motion cue to suppress dynamic content in the early layers of the transformer during inference. Our attention-level gating module suppresses the influence of dynamic regions before their artifacts propagate through the feature hierarchy. Notably, we do not retrain or fine-tune the model; we let the pretrained transformer diagnose its own motion cues and correct itself. This early regulation stabilizes geometric reasoning in streaming scenarios and leads to improvements in temporal consistency and camera pose robustness across multiple dynamic benchmarks, offering a simple and training-free pathway toward motion-aware streaming reconstruction.</li>

To address this, we introduce BRAND: Bilingual Religious Accountable Norm Dataset, which focuses on the four main religions of South Asia: Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, and Islam, containing over 2,400 entries, and we used three different types of prompts in both English and Bengali. Our results indicate that models perform better in English than in Bengali and consistently display bias toward Islam, even when answering religion-neutral questions. These findings highlight persistent bias in multilingual models when similar questions are asked in different languages. We further connect our findings to the broader issues in HCI regarding religion and spirituality.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Enhancing the temporal understanding of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is essential for advancing long-form video analysis, enabling tasks such as temporal localization, action detection, and time-sensitive question answering. While reinforcement learning (RL) has recently been explored for improving temporal reasoning, existing approaches are often confined to limited task types and data, restricting their generalization across diverse temporal understanding scenarios. To address this challenge, we present TempR1, a temporal-aware multi-task reinforcement learning framework that systematically strengthens MLLMs' temporal comprehension. We curate a multi-task corpus that exposes the model to diverse temporal structures and semantics, and build upon the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm to achieve stable and effective cross-task optimization. Specifically, we categorize temporal tasks into three correspondence types between predicted intervals and ground-truth instances, and design tailored localization rewards for each, enabling TempR1 to capture fine-grained temporal dependencies and adapt to different temporal patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TempR1 attains state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks. Moreover, its joint optimization over complementary tasks yields a strong synergistic effect, enhancing both generalization and single-task performance, establishing a scalable and principled paradigm for temporal reasoning in MLLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Tuning-free face personalization methods have developed along two distinct paradigms: text embedding approaches that map facial features into the text embedding space, and adapter-based methods that inject features through auxiliary cross-attention layers. While both paradigms have shown promise, existing methods struggle to simultaneously achieve high identity fidelity and flexible text controllability. We introduce UniID, a unified tuning-free framework that synergistically integrates both paradigms. Our key insight is that when merging these approaches, they should mutually reinforce only identity-relevant information while preserving the original diffusion prior for non-identity attributes. We realize this through a principled training-inference strategy: during training, we employ an identity-focused learning scheme that guides both branches to capture identity features exclusively; at inference, we introduce a normalized rescaling mechanism that recovers the text controllability of the base diffusion model while enabling complementary identity signals to enhance each other. This principled design enables UniID to achieve high-fidelity face personalization with flexible text controllability. Extensive experiments against six state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that UniID achieves superior performance in both identity preservation and text controllability.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the vision domain, dataset distillation arises as a technique to condense a large dataset into a smaller synthetic one that exhibits a similar result in the training process. While image data presents an extensive literature of distillation methods, text dataset distillation has fewer works in comparison. Text dataset distillation initially grew as an adaptation of efforts from the vision universe, as the particularities of the modality became clear obstacles, it rose into a separate branch of research. Several milestones mark the development of this area, such as the introduction of methods that use transformer models, the generation of discrete synthetic text, and the scaling to decoder-only models with over 1B parameters. Despite major advances in modern approaches, the field remains in a maturing phase, with room for improvement on benchmarking standardization, approaches to overcome the discrete nature of text, handling complex tasks, and providing explicit examples of real-world applications. In this report, we review past and recent advances in dataset distillation for text, highlighting different distillation strategies, key contributions, and general challenges.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Adapting large language models (LLMs) to low-resource languages remains a major challenge due to data scarcity and cross-lingual drift. This work presents a two-stage adaptation of Qwen2.5-3B to Tibetan, a morphologically rich and underrepresented language. We employ Continual Pretraining (CPT) to establish Tibetan linguistic grounding, followed by Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for task and translation specialization. Empirical evaluations demonstrate a consistent decrease in perplexity (from 2.98 $\rightarrow$ 1.54) and substantial improvements in Chinese$\rightarrow$Tibetan translation quality (BLEU: 0.046 $\rightarrow$ 0.261; chrF: 2.2 $\rightarrow$ 6.6). Layer-wise analysis across 435 layers in Qwen3-4B reveals that adaptation primarily concentrates on embedding and output heads, with mid--late MLP projections encoding domain-specific transformations. Our findings suggest that CPT constructs a Tibetan semantic manifold while SFT sharpens task alignment with minimal representational disruption. This study provides the first quantitative exploration of Tibetan adaptation dynamics for LLMs, and offers an open, reproducible framework for extending multilingual foundation models to low-resource settings.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models show promise for dynamic scene deblurring; however, existing studies often fail to leverage the intrinsic nature of the blurring process within diffusion models, limiting their full potential. To address it, we present a Blur Diffusion Model (BlurDM), which seamlessly integrates the blur formation process into diffusion for image deblurring. Observing that motion blur stems from continuous exposure, BlurDM implicitly models the blur formation process through a dual-diffusion forward scheme, diffusing both noise and blur onto a sharp image. During the reverse generation process, we derive a dual denoising and deblurring formulation, enabling BlurDM to recover the sharp image by simultaneously denoising and deblurring, given pure Gaussian noise conditioned on the blurred image as input. Additionally, to efficiently integrate BlurDM into deblurring networks, we perform BlurDM in the latent space, forming a flexible prior generation network for deblurring. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BlurDM significantly and consistently enhances existing deblurring methods on four benchmark datasets. The source code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Drag-based image editing using generative models provides intuitive control over image structures. However, existing methods rely heavily on manually provided masks and textual prompts to preserve semantic fidelity and motion precision. Removing these constraints creates a fundamental trade-off: visual artifacts without masks and poor spatial control without prompts. To address these limitations, we propose DirectDrag, a novel mask- and prompt-free editing framework. DirectDrag enables precise and efficient manipulation with minimal user input while maintaining high image fidelity and accurate point alignment. DirectDrag introduces two key innovations. First, we design an Auto Soft Mask Generation module that intelligently infers editable regions from point displacement, automatically localizing deformation along movement paths while preserving contextual integrity through the generative model's inherent capacity. Second, we develop a Readout-Guided Feature Alignment mechanism that leverages intermediate diffusion activations to maintain structural consistency during point-based edits, substantially improving visual fidelity. Despite operating without manual mask or prompt, DirectDrag achieves superior image quality compared to existing methods while maintaining competitive drag accuracy. Extensive experiments on DragBench and real-world scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of DirectDrag for high-quality, interactive image manipulation.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) deployed in safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving must handle continuous visual streams under imperfect conditions. However, existing benchmarks focus on static, high-quality images and ignore temporal degradation and error propagation, which are critical failure modes where transient visual corruption induces hallucinations that persist across subsequent frames. We introduce DIQ-H, the first benchmark for evaluating VLM robustness under dynamic visual degradation in temporal sequences. DIQ-H applies physics-based corruptions including motion blur, sensor noise, and compression artifacts, and measures hallucination persistence, error recovery, and temporal consistency through multi-turn question-answering tasks. To enable scalable annotation, we propose Uncertainty-Guided Iterative Refinement (UIR), which generates reliable pseudo-ground-truth using lightweight VLMs with uncertainty filtering, achieving a 15.3 percent accuracy improvement. Experiments on 16 state-of-the-art VLMs reveal substantial robustness gaps: even advanced models such as GPT-4o achieve only a 78.5 percent recovery rate, while open-source models struggle with temporal consistency at less than 60 percent. DIQ-H provides a comprehensive platform for evaluating VLM reliability in real-world deployments.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, interpretability, large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Aligning proprietary large language models (LLMs) with internal organizational policies has become an urgent priority as organizations increasingly deploy LLMs in sensitive domains such as legal support, finance, and medical services. Beyond generic safety filters, enterprises require reliable mechanisms to detect policy violations within their regulatory and operational frameworks, where breaches can trigger legal and reputational risks. Existing content moderation frameworks, such as guardrails, remain largely confined to the safety domain and lack the robustness to capture nuanced organizational policies. LLM-as-a-judge and fine-tuning approaches, though flexible, introduce significant latency and lack interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose a training-free and efficient method that treats policy violation detection as an out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problem. Inspired by whitening techniques, we apply a linear transformation to decorrelate the model's hidden activations and standardize them to zero mean and unit variance, yielding near-identity covariance matrix. In this transformed space, we use the Euclidean norm as a compliance score to detect policy violations. The method requires only the policy text and a small number of illustrative samples, which makes it light-weight and easily deployable. On a challenging policy benchmark, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing both existing guardrails and fine-tuned reasoning models. This work provides organizations with a practical and statistically grounded framework for policy-aware oversight of LLMs, advancing the broader goal of deployable AI governance.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Test-time scaling (TTS) aims to achieve better results by increasing random sampling and evaluating samples based on rules and metrics. However, in text-to-image(T2I) diffusion models, most related works focus on search strategies and reward models, yet the impact of the stochastic characteristic of noise in T2I diffusion models on the method's performance remains unexplored. In this work, we analyze the effects of randomness in T2I diffusion models and explore a new format of randomness for TTS: text embedding perturbation, which couples with existing randomness like SDE-injected noise to enhance generative diversity and quality. We start with a frequency-domain analysis of these formats of randomness and their impact on generation, and find that these two randomness exhibit complementary behavior in the frequency domain: spatial noise favors low-frequency components (early steps), while text embedding perturbation enhances high-frequency details (later steps), thereby compensating for the potential limitations of spatial noise randomness in high-frequency manipulation. Concurrently, text embedding demonstrates varying levels of tolerance to perturbation across different dimensions of the generation process. Specifically, our method consists of two key designs: (1) Introducing step-based text embedding perturbation, combining frequency-guided noise schedules with spatial noise perturbation. (2) Adapting the perturbation intensity selectively based on their frequency-specific contributions to generation and tolerance to perturbation. Our approach can be seamlessly integrated into existing TTS methods and demonstrates significant improvements on multiple benchmarks with almost no additional computation.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The application of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to long-form video understanding is constrained by limited context lengths and the computationally prohibitive cost of processing dense video tokens. Consequently, recent research has focused on query-aware frame selection, methods that often incur significant computational overhead. This paper challenges the assumption that such complex search mechanisms are universally necessary. We first identify and validate a query typology distinguishing between global query and localized query. We demonstrate that while uniform sampling is both effective and efficient for global queries, localized queries indeed necessitate query-aware selection for optimal performance. Building on this insight, we propose DIG, a training-free frame selection framework that adapts its strategy based on the query type. Specifically,DIG employs efficient uniform sampling for global queries while activating a specialized pipeline to extract query-relevant frames for localized queries. Experiments on three long-form video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that DIG consistently outperforms existing baselines and robustly improves LMM performance, even when scaling the input frame count to 256.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Training with differential privacy (DP) provides a guarantee to members in a dataset that they cannot be identified by users of the released model. However, those data providers, and, in general, the public, lack methods to efficiently verify that models trained on their data satisfy DP guarantees. The amount of compute needed to verify DP guarantees for current algorithms scales with the amount of compute required to train the model. In this paper we design the first DP algorithm with near optimal privacy-utility trade-offs but whose DP guarantees can be verified cheaper than training. We focus on DP stochastic convex optimization (DP-SCO), where optimal privacy-utility trade-offs are known. Here we show we can obtain tight privacy-utility trade-offs by privately minimizing a series of regularized objectives and only using the standard DP composition bound. Crucially, this method can be verified with much less compute than training. This leads to the first known DP-SCO algorithm with near optimal privacy-utility whose DP verification scales better than training cost, significantly reducing verification costs on large datasets.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Reliable 3D reconstruction from in-the-wild image collections is often hindered by "noisy" images-irrelevant inputs with little or no view overlap with others. While traditional Structure-from-Motion pipelines handle such cases through geometric verification and outlier rejection, feed-forward 3D reconstruction models lack these explicit mechanisms, leading to degraded performance under in-the-wild conditions. In this paper, we discover that the existing feed-forward reconstruction model, e.g., VGGT, despite lacking explicit outlier-rejection mechanisms or noise-aware training, can inherently distinguish distractor images. Through an in-depth analysis under varying proportions of synthetic distractors, we identify a specific layer that naturally exhibits outlier-suppressing behavior. Further probing reveals that this layer encodes discriminative internal representations that enable an effective noise-filtering capability, which we simply leverage to perform outlier-view rejection in feed-forward 3D reconstruction without any additional fine-tuning or supervision. Extensive experiments on both controlled and in-the-wild datasets demonstrate that this implicit filtering mechanism is consistent and generalizes well across diverse scenarios.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>large language model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As augmented large language models (LLMs) with external tools become increasingly popular in web applications, improving augmented LLM inference serving efficiency and optimizing service-level objectives (SLOs) are critical for enhancing user experience. To achieve this, inference systems must maximize request handling within latency constraints, referred to as increasing effective throughput. However, existing systems face two major challenges: (i) reliance on first-come-first-served (FCFS) scheduling causes severe head-of-line blocking, leading to queuing delays exceeding the SLOs for many requests; and (ii) static batch token limit, which fails to adapt to fluctuating loads and hardware conditions. Both of these factors degrade effective throughput and service quality. This paper presents AugServe, an efficient inference framework designed to reduce queueing latency and enhance effective throughput for augmented LLM inference services. The core idea of AugServe is a two-stage adaptive request scheduling strategy. Specifically, AugServe combines the inference features of augmented LLM requests to optimize the order of scheduling decisions (stage I). These decisions are continuously refined with runtime information (stage II), adapting to both request characteristics and system capabilities. In addition, AugServe dynamically adjusts the token batching mechanism based on hardware status and real-time load, further enhancing throughput performance. Experimental results show that AugServe achieves 4.7-33.1x and 3.3-13.2x higher effective throughput than vLLM and InferCept, while reducing time-to-first-token (TTFT) by up to 96.3% and 95.0%, respectively.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Modeling group actions on latent representations enables controllable transformations of high-dimensional image data. Prior works applying group-theoretic priors or modeling transformations typically operate in the high-dimensional data space, where group actions apply uniformly across the entire input, making it difficult to disentangle the subspace that varies under transformations. While latent-space methods offer greater flexibility, they still require manual partitioning of latent variables into equivariant and invariant subspaces, limiting the ability to robustly learn and operate group actions within the representation space. To address this, we introduce a novel end-to-end framework that for the first time learns group actions on latent image manifolds, automatically discovering transformation-relevant structures without manual intervention. Our method uses learnable binary masks with straight-through estimation to dynamically partition latent representations into transformation-sensitive and invariant components. We formulate this within a unified optimization framework that jointly learns latent disentanglement and group transformation mappings. The framework can be seamlessly integrated with any standard encoder-decoder architecture. We validate our approach on five 2D/3D image datasets, demonstrating its ability to automatically learn disentangled latent factors for group actions in diverse data, while downstream classification tasks confirm the effectiveness of the learned representations.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Reconstructing and understanding 3D scenes from unposed sparse views in a feed-forward manner remains as a challenging task in 3D computer vision. Recent approaches use per-pixel 3D Gaussian Splatting for reconstruction, followed by a 2D-to-3D feature lifting stage for scene understanding. However, they generate excessive redundant Gaussians, causing high memory overhead and sub-optimal multi-view feature aggregation, leading to degraded novel view synthesis and scene understanding performance. We propose C3G, a novel feed-forward framework that estimates compact 3D Gaussians only at essential spatial locations, minimizing redundancy while enabling effective feature lifting. We introduce learnable tokens that aggregate multi-view features through self-attention to guide Gaussian generation, ensuring each Gaussian integrates relevant visual features across views. We then exploit the learned attention patterns for Gaussian decoding to efficiently lift features. Extensive experiments on pose-free novel view synthesis, 3D open-vocabulary segmentation, and view-invariant feature aggregation demonstrate our approach's effectiveness. Results show that a compact yet geometrically meaningful representation is sufficient for high-quality scene reconstruction and understanding, achieving superior memory efficiency and feature fidelity compared to existing methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust, diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>A truly interactive world model requires three key ingredients: real-time long-horizon streaming, consistent spatial memory, and precise user control. However, most existing approaches address only one of these aspects in isolation, as achieving all three simultaneously is highly challenging-for example, long-term memory mechanisms often degrade real-time performance. In this work, we present RELIC, a unified framework that tackles these three challenges altogether. Given a single image and a text description, RELIC enables memory-aware, long-duration exploration of arbitrary scenes in real time. Built upon recent autoregressive video-diffusion distillation techniques, our model represents long-horizon memory using highly compressed historical latent tokens encoded with both relative actions and absolute camera poses within the KV cache. This compact, camera-aware memory structure supports implicit 3D-consistent content retrieval and enforces long-term coherence with minimal computational overhead. In parallel, we fine-tune a bidirectional teacher video model to generate sequences beyond its original 5-second training horizon, and transform it into a causal student generator using a new memory-efficient self-forcing paradigm that enables full-context distillation over long-duration teacher as well as long student self-rollouts. Implemented as a 14B-parameter model and trained on a curated Unreal Engine-rendered dataset, RELIC achieves real-time generation at 16 FPS while demonstrating more accurate action following, more stable long-horizon streaming, and more robust spatial-memory retrieval compared with prior work. These capabilities establish RELIC as a strong foundation for the next generation of interactive world modeling.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>attack, robust, watermark</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Watermarking aims to embed hidden signals in generated text that can be reliably detected when given access to a secret key. Open-weight language models pose acute challenges for such watermarking schemes because the inference-time interventions that dominate contemporary approaches cannot be enforced once model weights are public. Existing watermaking techniques for open-weight models, such as the recently proposed GaussMark, typically rely on small modifications to model weights, which can yield signals detectable to those equipped with a secret key, but achieving detection power comparable to inference-time watermarks generally requires weight perturbations that noticeably reduce generation quality. We introduce MarkTune, a theoretically principled, on-policy fine-tuning framework that treats the GaussMark signal as a reward while simultaneously regularizing against degradation in text quality. We derive MarkTune as an improvement on GaussMark and demonstrate that MarkTune consistently improves the quality-detectability trade-off over GaussMark by steering finer-grained, watermark-aware weight updates within the model's representation space while preserving generation quality. Empirically, we show that MarkTune pushes the quality-detectability frontier of GaussMark close to that of inference-time watermarking, remains robust to paraphrasing and fine-tuning attacks, and exhibits strong generalization: a model fine-tuned on one dataset retains substantial watermark detection power on unseen datasets. Together, these results establish MarkTune as a general strategy for embedding robust, high-quality watermarks into open-weight LMs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Sign Language Production (SLP) is the process of converting the complex input text into a real video. Most previous works focused on the Text2Gloss, Gloss2Pose, Pose2Vid stages, and some concentrated on Prompt2Gloss and Text2Avatar stages. However, this field has made slow progress due to the inaccuracy of text conversion, pose generation, and the rendering of poses into real human videos in these stages, resulting in gradually accumulating errors. Therefore, in this paper, we streamline the traditional redundant structure, simplify and optimize the task objective, and design a new sign language generative model called Stable Signer. It redefines the SLP task as a hierarchical generation end-to-end task that only includes text understanding (Prompt2Gloss, Text2Gloss) and Pose2Vid, and executes text understanding through our proposed new Sign Language Understanding Linker called SLUL, and generates hand gestures through the named SLP-MoE hand gesture rendering expert block to end-to-end generate high-quality and multi-style sign language videos. SLUL is trained using the newly developed Semantic-Aware Gloss Masking Loss (SAGM Loss). Its performance has improved by 48.6% compared to the current SOTA generation methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid proliferation of benchmarks has created significant challenges in reproducibility, transparency, and informed decision-making. However, unlike datasets and models -- which benefit from structured documentation frameworks like Datasheets and Model Cards -- evaluation methodologies lack systematic documentation standards. We introduce Eval Factsheets, a structured, descriptive framework for documenting AI system evaluations through a comprehensive taxonomy and questionnaire-based approach. Our framework organizes evaluation characteristics across five fundamental dimensions: Context (Who made the evaluation and when?), Scope (What does it evaluate?), Structure (With what the evaluation is built?), Method (How does it work?) and Alignment (In what ways is it reliable/valid/robust?). We implement this taxonomy as a practical questionnaire spanning five sections with mandatory and recommended documentation elements. Through case studies on multiple benchmarks, we demonstrate that Eval Factsheets effectively captures diverse evaluation paradigms -- from traditional benchmarks to LLM-as-judge methodologies -- while maintaining consistency and comparability. We hope Eval Factsheets are incorporated into both existing and newly released evaluation frameworks and lead to more transparency and reproducibility.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>segmentation</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vision Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong qualitative visual understanding, but struggle with metrically precise spatial reasoning required for embodied applications. The agentic paradigm promises that VLMs can use a wide variety of tools that could augment these capabilities, such as depth estimators, segmentation models, and pose estimators. Yet it remains an open challenge how to realize this vision without solely relying on handcrafted prompting strategies or enforcing fixed, predefined tool pipelines that limit VLMs' ability to discover optimal tool-use patterns. Reinforcement Learning could overcome this gap, but has so far been limited to reasoning with a single visual tool due to the large search space in multi-tool reasoning. We introduce Double Interactive Reinforcement Learning (DIRL), a two-phase training framework where VLMs learn to coordinate multiple tools through interactive exploration and feedback. In the teaching phase, we combine demonstrations from a single tool specialist trained via interactive RL with traces from a frontier model using all tools. In the exploration phase, the model further refines multi-tool coordination through continued RL. Our model, SpaceTools, with tool-augmented spatial reasoning ability, achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatial understanding benchmarks (RoboSpatial-Home, BLINK, BOP-ASK) and demonstrates reliable real-world manipulation using a 7-DOF robot as a tool. DIRL provides substantial improvements over the vanilla SFT (+12% on RoboSpatial) and RL (+16% on RoboSpatial) baselines. Project page: this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>robust</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Reasoning models leveraging long chains of thought employ various cognitive skills, such as verification of their answers, backtracking, retrying by an alternate method, and more. Previous work has shown that when a base language model exhibits these skills, training that model further with reinforcement learning (RL) can learn to leverage them. How can we get models to leverage skills that aren't exhibited by base models? Our work, SkillFactory, is a method for fine-tuning models to roughly learn these skills during a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage prior to RL. Our approach does not rely on distillation from a stronger model, but instead uses samples from the model itself, rearranged to provide training data in the format of those skills. These "silver" SFT traces may be imperfect, but are nevertheless effective for priming a model to acquire skills during RL. Our evaluation shows that (1) starting from SkillFactory SFT initialization helps a model to generalize to harder variants of a task post-RL, despite lower performance pre-RL; (2) cognitive skills are indeed used by the model; (3) RLed SkillFactory models are more robust to regression on out-of-domain tasks than RLed base models. Our work suggests that inductive biases learned prior to RL help models learn robust cognitive skill use.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Graphic design forms the cornerstone of modern visual communication, serving as a vital medium for promoting cultural and commercial events. Recent advances have explored automating this process using Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), yet existing methods often produce geometrically inaccurate layouts and lack the iterative, layer-specific editing required in professional workflows. To address these limitations, we present PosterCopilot, a framework that advances layout reasoning and controllable editing for professional graphic design. Specifically, we introduce a progressive three-stage training strategy that equips LMMs with geometric understanding and aesthetic reasoning for layout design, consisting of Perturbed Supervised Fine-Tuning, Reinforcement Learning for Visual-Reality Alignment, and Reinforcement Learning from Aesthetic Feedback. Furthermore, we develop a complete workflow that couples the trained LMM-based design model with generative models, enabling layer-controllable, iterative editing for precise element refinement while maintaining global visual consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PosterCopilot achieves geometrically accurate and aesthetically superior layouts, offering unprecedented controllability for professional iterative design.</li>
