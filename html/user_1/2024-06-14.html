<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper presents a novel anomaly detection methodology termed Statistical Aggregated Anomaly Detection (SAAD). The SAAD approach integrates advanced statistical techniques with machine learning, and its efficacy is demonstrated through validation on real sensor data from a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) environment within the automotive domain. The key innovation of SAAD lies in its ability to significantly enhance the accuracy and robustness of anomaly detection when combined with Fully Connected Networks (FCNs) augmented by dropout layers. Comprehensive experimental evaluations indicate that the standalone statistical method achieves an accuracy of 72.1%, whereas the deep learning model alone attains an accuracy of 71.5%. In contrast, the aggregated method achieves a superior accuracy of 88.3% and an F1 score of 0.921, thereby outperforming the individual models. These results underscore the effectiveness of SAAD, demonstrating its potential for broad application in various domains, including automotive systems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion Transformers (DiT) excel at image and video generation but face computational challenges due to self-attention's quadratic complexity. We propose DiTFastAttn, a novel post-training compression method to alleviate DiT's computational bottleneck. We identify three key redundancies in the attention computation during DiT inference: 1. spatial redundancy, where many attention heads focus on local information; 2. temporal redundancy, with high similarity between neighboring steps' attention outputs; 3. conditional redundancy, where conditional and unconditional inferences exhibit significant similarity. To tackle these redundancies, we propose three techniques: 1. Window Attention with Residual Caching to reduce spatial redundancy; 2. Temporal Similarity Reduction to exploit the similarity between steps; 3. Conditional Redundancy Elimination to skip redundant computations during conditional generation. To demonstrate the effectiveness of DiTFastAttn, we apply it to DiT, PixArt-Sigma for image generation tasks, and OpenSora for video generation tasks. Evaluation results show that for image generation, our method reduces up to 88\% of the FLOPs and achieves up to 1.6x speedup at high resolution generation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) necessitates robust and challenging benchmarks. Leaderboards like Chatbot Arena rank LLMs based on how well their responses align with human preferences. However, many tasks such as those related to emotional intelligence, creative writing, or persuasiveness, are highly subjective and often lack majoritarian human agreement. Judges may have irreconcilable disagreements about what constitutes a better response. To address the challenge of ranking LLMs on highly subjective tasks, we propose a novel benchmarking framework, the Language Model Council (LMC). The LMC operates through a democratic process to: 1) formulate a test set through equal participation, 2) administer the test among council members, and 3) evaluate responses as a collective jury. We deploy a council of 20 newest LLMs on an open-ended emotional intelligence task: responding to interpersonal dilemmas. Our results show that the LMC produces rankings that are more separable, robust, and less biased than those from any individual LLM judge, and is more consistent with a human-established leaderboard compared to other benchmarks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Due to the high potential for abuse of GenAI systems, the task of detecting synthetic images has recently become of great interest to the research community. Unfortunately, existing image-space detectors quickly become obsolete as new high-fidelity text-to-image models are developed at blinding speed. In this work, we propose a new synthetic image detector that uses features obtained by inverting an open-source pre-trained Stable Diffusion model. We show that these inversion features enable our detector to generalize well to unseen generators of high visual fidelity (e.g., DALL-E 3) even when the detector is trained only on lower fidelity fake images generated via Stable Diffusion. This detector achieves new state-of-the-art across multiple training and evaluation setups. Moreover, we introduce a new challenging evaluation protocol that uses reverse image search to mitigate stylistic and thematic biases in the detector evaluation. We show that the resulting evaluation scores align well with detectors' in-the-wild performance, and release these datasets as public benchmarks for future research.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Argument Mining (AM) is a crucial aspect of computational argumentation, which deals with the identification and extraction of Argumentative Components (ACs) and their corresponding Argumentative Relations (ARs). Most prior works have solved these problems by dividing them into multiple subtasks. And the available end-to-end setups are mostly based on the dependency parsing approach. This work proposes a unified end-to-end framework based on a generative paradigm, in which the argumentative structures are framed into label-augmented text, called Augmented Natural Language (ANL). Additionally, we explore the role of different types of markers in solving AM tasks. Through different marker-based fine-tuning strategies, we present an extensive study by integrating marker knowledge into our generative model. The proposed framework achieves competitive results to the state-of-the-art (SoTA) model and outperforms several baselines.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Self-supervised speech models (S3Ms) have become an effective backbone for speech applications. Various analyses suggest that S3Ms encode linguistic properties. In this work, we seek a more fine-grained analysis of the word-level linguistic properties encoded in S3Ms. Specifically, we curate a novel dataset of near homophone (phonetically similar) and synonym (semantically similar) word pairs and measure the similarities between S3M word representation pairs. Our study reveals that S3M representations consistently and significantly exhibit more phonetic than semantic similarity. Further, we question whether widely used intent classification datasets such as Fluent Speech Commands and Snips Smartlights are adequate for measuring semantic abilities. Our simple baseline, using only the word identity, surpasses S3M-based models. This corroborates our findings and suggests that high scores on these datasets do not necessarily guarantee the presence of semantic content.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Video generation has many unique challenges beyond those of image generation. The temporal dimension introduces extensive possible variations across frames, over which consistency and continuity may be violated. In this study, we move beyond evaluating simple actions and argue that generated videos should incorporate the emergence of new concepts and their relation transitions like in real-world videos as time progresses. To assess the Temporal Compositionality of video generation models, we propose TC-Bench, a benchmark of meticulously crafted text prompts, corresponding ground truth videos, and robust evaluation metrics. The prompts articulate the initial and final states of scenes, effectively reducing ambiguities for frame development and simplifying the assessment of transition completion. In addition, by collecting aligned real-world videos corresponding to the prompts, we expand TC-Bench's applicability from text-conditional models to image-conditional ones that can perform generative frame interpolation. We also develop new metrics to measure the completeness of component transitions in generated videos, which demonstrate significantly higher correlations with human judgments than existing metrics. Our comprehensive experimental results reveal that most video generators achieve less than 20% of the compositional changes, highlighting enormous space for future improvement. Our analysis indicates that current video generation models struggle to interpret descriptions of compositional changes and synthesize various components across different time steps.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While diffusion models have shown impressive performance in 2D image/video generation, diffusion-based Text-to-Multi-view-Video (T2MVid) generation remains underexplored. The new challenges posed by T2MVid generation lie in the lack of massive captioned multi-view videos and the complexity of modeling such multi-dimensional distribution. To this end, we propose a novel diffusion-based pipeline that generates high-quality multi-view videos centered around a dynamic 3D object from text. Specifically, we factor the T2MVid problem into viewpoint-space and time components. Such factorization allows us to combine and reuse layers of advanced pre-trained multi-view image and 2D video diffusion models to ensure multi-view consistency as well as temporal coherence for the generated multi-view videos, largely reducing the training cost. We further introduce alignment modules to align the latent spaces of layers from the pre-trained multi-view and the 2D video diffusion models, addressing the reused layers' incompatibility that arises from the domain gap between 2D and multi-view data. In support of this and future research, we further contribute a captioned multi-view video dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates high-quality multi-view videos, exhibiting vivid motions, temporal coherence, and multi-view consistency, given a variety of text prompts.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative AI offers a simple, prompt-based alternative to fine-tuning smaller BERT-style LLMs for text classification tasks. This promises to eliminate the need for manually labeled training data and task-specific model training. However, it remains an open question whether tools like ChatGPT can deliver on this promise. In this paper, we show that smaller, fine-tuned LLMs (still) consistently and significantly outperform larger, zero-shot prompted models in text classification. We compare three major generative AI models (ChatGPT with GPT-3.5/GPT-4 and Claude Opus) with several fine-tuned LLMs across a diverse set of classification tasks (sentiment, approval/disapproval, emotions, party positions) and text categories (news, tweets, speeches). We find that fine-tuning with application-specific training data achieves superior performance in all cases. To make this approach more accessible to a broader audience, we provide an easy-to-use toolkit alongside this paper. Our toolkit, accompanied by non-technical step-by-step guidance, enables users to select and fine-tune BERT-like LLMs for any classification task with minimal technical and computational effort.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multimodal Large Language Models (mLLMs) are trained on a large amount of text-image data. While most mLLMs are trained on caption-like data only, Alayrac et al. [2022] showed that additionally training them on interleaved sequences of text and images can lead to the emergence of in-context learning capabilities. However, the dataset they used, M3W, is not public and is only in English. There have been attempts to reproduce their results but the released datasets are English-only. In contrast, current multilingual and multimodal datasets are either composed of caption-like only or medium-scale or fully private data. This limits mLLM research for the 7,000 other languages spoken in the world. We therefore introduce mOSCAR, to the best of our knowledge the first large-scale multilingual and multimodal document corpus crawled from the web. It covers 163 languages, 315M documents, 214B tokens and 1.2B images. We carefully conduct a set of filtering and evaluation steps to make sure mOSCAR is sufficiently safe, diverse and of good quality. We additionally train two types of multilingual model to prove the benefits of mOSCAR: (1) a model trained on a subset of mOSCAR and captioning data and (2) a model train on captioning data only. The model additionally trained on mOSCAR shows a strong boost in few-shot learning performance across various multilingual image-text tasks and benchmarks, confirming previous findings for English-only mLLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this position paper, we explore standard language ideology in language generated by large language models (LLMs). First, we outline how standard language ideology is reflected and reinforced in LLMs. We then present a taxonomy of open problems regarding standard language ideology in AI-generated language with implications for minoritized language communities. We introduce the concept of standard AI-generated language ideology, the process by which AI-generated language regards Standard American English (SAE) as a linguistic default and reinforces a linguistic bias that SAE is the most "appropriate" language. Finally, we discuss tensions that remain, including reflecting on what desirable system behavior looks like, as well as advantages and drawbacks of generative AI tools imitating--or often not--different English language varieties. Throughout, we discuss standard language ideology as a manifestation of existing global power structures in and through AI-generated language before ending with questions to move towards alternative, more emancipatory digital futures.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have exhibited noteworthy advancements across various applications, including medical imaging. While numerous state-of-the-art Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) architectures are renowned for their proficient feature extraction, this paper investigates their efficacy in the context of medical image deepfake detection. The primary objective is to effectively distinguish real from tampered or manipulated medical images by employing a comprehensive evaluation of 13 state-of-the-art DCNNs. Performance is assessed across diverse evaluation metrics, encompassing considerations of time efficiency and computational resource requirements. Our findings reveal that ResNet50V2 excels in precision and specificity, whereas DenseNet169 is distinguished by its accuracy, recall, and F1-score. We investigate the specific scenarios in which one model would be more favorable than another. Additionally, MobileNetV3Large offers competitive performance, emerging as the swiftest among the considered DCNN models while maintaining a relatively small parameter count. We also assess the latent space separability quality across the examined DCNNs, showing superiority in both the DenseNet and EfficientNet model families and entailing a higher understanding of medical image deepfakes. The experimental analysis in this research contributes valuable insights to the field of deepfake image detection in the medical imaging domain.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has proven beneficial for efficiently fine-tuning large models, LoRA fine-tuned text-to-image diffusion models lack diversity in the generated images, as the model tends to copy data from the observed training samples. This effect becomes more pronounced at higher values of adapter strength and for adapters with higher ranks which are fine-tuned on smaller datasets. To address these challenges, we present FouRA, a novel low-rank method that learns projections in the Fourier domain along with learning a flexible input-dependent adapter rank selection strategy. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we show that FouRA successfully solves the problems related to data copying and distribution collapse while significantly improving the generated image quality. We demonstrate that FouRA enhances the generalization of fine-tuned models thanks to its adaptive rank selection. We further show that the learned projections in the frequency domain are decorrelated and prove effective when merging multiple adapters. While FouRA is motivated for vision tasks, we also demonstrate its merits for language tasks on the GLUE benchmark.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The field of portrait image animation, driven by speech audio input, has experienced significant advancements in the generation of realistic and dynamic portraits. This research delves into the complexities of synchronizing facial movements and creating visually appealing, temporally consistent animations within the framework of diffusion-based methodologies. Moving away from traditional paradigms that rely on parametric models for intermediate facial representations, our innovative approach embraces the end-to-end diffusion paradigm and introduces a hierarchical audio-driven visual synthesis module to enhance the precision of alignment between audio inputs and visual outputs, encompassing lip, expression, and pose motion. Our proposed network architecture seamlessly integrates diffusion-based generative models, a UNet-based denoiser, temporal alignment techniques, and a reference network. The proposed hierarchical audio-driven visual synthesis offers adaptive control over expression and pose diversity, enabling more effective personalization tailored to different identities. Through a comprehensive evaluation that incorporates both qualitative and quantitative analyses, our approach demonstrates obvious enhancements in image and video quality, lip synchronization precision, and motion diversity.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised, anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Most existing anomaly detection methods require a dedicated model for each category. Such a paradigm, despite its promising results, is computationally expensive and inefficient, thereby failing to meet the requirements for real-world applications. Inspired by how humans detect anomalies, by comparing a query image to known normal ones, this paper proposes a novel few-shot anomaly detection (FSAD) framework. Using a training set of normal images from various categories, registration, aiming to align normal images of the same categories, is leveraged as the proxy task for self-supervised category-agnostic representation learning. At test time, an image and its corresponding support set, consisting of a few normal images from the same category, are supplied, and anomalies are identified by comparing the registered features of the test image to its corresponding support image features. Such a setup enables the model to generalize to novel test categories. It is, to our best knowledge, the first FSAD method that requires no model fine-tuning for novel categories: enabling a single model to be applied to all categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Particularly, it improves the current state-of-the-art for FSAD by 11.3% and 8.3% on the MVTec and MPDD benchmarks, respectively. The source code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Video editing is an emerging task, in which most current methods adopt the pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model to edit the source video in a zero-shot manner. Despite extensive efforts, maintaining the temporal consistency of edited videos remains challenging due to the lack of temporal constraints in the regular T2I diffusion model. To address this issue, we propose COrrespondence-guided Video Editing (COVE), leveraging the inherent diffusion feature correspondence to achieve high-quality and consistent video editing. Specifically, we propose an efficient sliding-window-based strategy to calculate the similarity among tokens in the diffusion features of source videos, identifying the tokens with high correspondence across frames. During the inversion and denoising process, we sample the tokens in noisy latent based on the correspondence and then perform self-attention within them. To save GPU memory usage and accelerate the editing process, we further introduce the temporal-dimensional token merging strategy, which can effectively reduce redundancy. COVE can be seamlessly integrated into the pre-trained T2I diffusion model without the need for extra training or optimization. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that COVE achieves the start-of-the-art performance in various video editing scenarios, outperforming existing methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Self-supervised learning (SSL) representations from massively multilingual models offer a promising solution for low-resource language speech tasks. Despite advancements, language adaptation in TTS systems remains an open problem. This paper explores the language adaptation capability of ZMM-TTS, a recent SSL-based multilingual TTS system proposed in our previous work. We conducted experiments on 12 languages using limited data with various fine-tuning configurations. We demonstrate that the similarity in phonetics between the pre-training and target languages, as well as the language category, affects the target language's adaptation performance. Additionally, we find that the fine-tuning dataset size and number of speakers influence adaptability. Surprisingly, we also observed that using paired data for fine-tuning is not always optimal compared to audio-only data. Beyond speech intelligibility, our analysis covers speaker similarity, language identification, and predicted MOS.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Self-supervised monocular depth estimation aims to infer depth information without relying on labeled data. However, the lack of labeled information poses a significant challenge to the model's representation, limiting its ability to capture the intricate details of the scene accurately. Prior information can potentially mitigate this issue, enhancing the model's understanding of scene structure and texture. Nevertheless, solely relying on a single type of prior information often falls short when dealing with complex scenes, necessitating improvements in generalization performance. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel self-supervised monocular depth estimation model that leverages multiple priors to bolster representation capabilities across spatial, context, and semantic dimensions. Specifically, we employ a hybrid transformer and a lightweight pose network to obtain long-range spatial priors in the spatial dimension. Then, the context prior attention is designed to improve generalization, particularly in complex structures or untextured areas. In addition, semantic priors are introduced by leveraging semantic boundary loss, and semantic prior attention is supplemented, further refining the semantic features extracted by the decoder. Experiments on three diverse datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. It integrates multiple priors to comprehensively enhance the representation ability, improving the accuracy and reliability of depth estimation. Codes are available at: \url{this https URL}</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present Piva (Preserving Identity with Variational Score Distillation), a novel optimization-based method for editing images and 3D models based on diffusion models. Specifically, our approach is inspired by the recently proposed method for 2D image editing - Delta Denoising Score (DDS). We pinpoint the limitations in DDS for 2D and 3D editing, which causes detail loss and over-saturation. To address this, we propose an additional score distillation term that enforces identity preservation. This results in a more stable editing process, gradually optimizing NeRF models to match target prompts while retaining crucial input characteristics. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in zero-shot image and neural field editing. Our method successfully alters visual attributes, adds both subtle and substantial structural elements, translates shapes, and achieves competitive results on standard 2D and 3D editing benchmarks. Additionally, our method imposes no constraints like masking or pre-training, making it compatible with a wide range of pre-trained diffusion models. This allows for versatile editing without needing neural field-to-mesh conversion, offering a more user-friendly experience.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Following the success of the in-context learning paradigm in large-scale language and computer vision models, the recently emerging field of in-context reinforcement learning is experiencing a rapid growth. However, its development has been held back by the lack of challenging benchmarks, as all the experiments have been carried out in simple environments and on small-scale datasets. We present \textbf{XLand-100B}, a large-scale dataset for in-context reinforcement learning based on the XLand-MiniGrid environment, as a first step to alleviate this problem. It contains complete learning histories for nearly $30,000$ different tasks, covering $100$B transitions and $2.5$B episodes. It took $50,000$ GPU hours to collect the dataset, which is beyond the reach of most academic labs. Along with the dataset, we provide the utilities to reproduce or expand it even further. With this substantial effort, we aim to democratize research in the rapidly growing field of in-context reinforcement learning and provide a solid foundation for further scaling.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Fused Magnesium Furnace (FMF) is a crucial industrial equipment in the production of magnesia, and anomaly detection plays a pivotal role in ensuring its efficient, stable, and secure operation. Existing anomaly detection methods primarily focus on analyzing dominant anomalies using the process variables (such as arc current) or constructing neural networks based on abnormal visual features, while overlooking the intrinsic correlation of cross-modal information. This paper proposes a cross-modal Transformer (dubbed FmFormer), designed to facilitate anomaly detection in fused magnesium smelting processes by exploring the correlation between visual features (video) and process variables (current). Our approach introduces a novel tokenization paradigm to effectively bridge the substantial dimensionality gap between the 3D video modality and the 1D current modality in a multiscale manner, enabling a hierarchical reconstruction of pixel-level anomaly detection. Subsequently, the FmFormer leverages self-attention to learn internal features within each modality and bidirectional cross-attention to capture correlations across modalities. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we also present a pioneering cross-modal benchmark of the fused magnesium smelting process, featuring synchronously acquired video and current data for over 2.2 million samples. Leveraging cross-modal learning, the proposed FmFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance in detecting anomalies, particularly under extreme interferences such as current fluctuations and visual occlusion caused by heavy water mist. The presented methodology and benchmark may be applicable to other industrial applications with some amendments. The benchmark will be released at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Digital watermarking techniques are crucial for copyright protection and source identification of images, especially in the era of generative AI models. However, many existing watermarking methods, particularly content-agnostic approaches that embed fixed patterns regardless of image content, are vulnerable to steganalysis attacks that can extract and remove the watermark with minimal perceptual distortion. In this work, we categorize watermarking algorithms into content-adaptive and content-agnostic ones, and demonstrate how averaging a collection of watermarked images could reveal the underlying watermark pattern. We then leverage this extracted pattern for effective watermark removal under both graybox and blackbox settings, even when the collection contains multiple watermark patterns. For some algorithms like Tree-Ring watermarks, the extracted pattern can also forge convincing watermarks on clean images. Our quantitative and qualitative evaluations across twelve watermarking methods highlight the threat posed by steganalysis to content-agnostic watermarks and the importance of designing watermarking techniques resilient to such analytical attacks. We propose security guidelines calling for using content-adaptive watermarking strategies and performing security evaluation against steganalysis. We also suggest multi-key assignments as potential mitigations against steganalysis vulnerabilities.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Facial expressions, vital in non-verbal human communication, have found applications in various computer vision fields like virtual reality, gaming, and emotional AI assistants. Despite advancements, many facial expression generation models encounter challenges such as low resolution (e.g., 32x32 or 64x64 pixels), poor quality, and the absence of background details. In this paper, we introduce FacEnhance, a novel diffusion-based approach addressing constraints in existing low-resolution facial expression generation models. FacEnhance enhances low-resolution facial expression videos (64x64 pixels) to higher resolutions (192x192 pixels), incorporating background details and improving overall quality. Leveraging conditional denoising within a diffusion framework, guided by a background-free low-resolution video and a single neutral expression high-resolution image, FacEnhance generates a video incorporating the facial expression from the low-resolution video performed by the individual with background from the neutral image. By complementing lightweight low-resolution models, FacEnhance strikes a balance between computational efficiency and desirable image resolution and quality. Extensive experiments on the MUG facial expression database demonstrate the efficacy of FacEnhance in enhancing low-resolution model outputs to state-of-the-art quality while preserving content and identity consistency. FacEnhance represents significant progress towards resource-efficient, high-fidelity facial expression generation, Renewing outdated low-resolution methods to up-to-date standards.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The typical process for developing LLMs involves pre-training a general foundation model on massive data, followed by fine-tuning on task-specific data to create specialized experts. Serving these experts poses challenges, as loading all experts onto devices is impractical, and frequent switching between experts in response to user requests incurs substantial I/O costs, increasing latency and expenses. Previous approaches decompose expert weights into pre-trained model weights and residual delta weights, then quantize the delta weights to reduce model size. However, these methods often lead to significant quantization errors at extremely low bitwidths and assume the appropriate model for a user request is known in advance, which is not practical. To address these issues, we introduce ME-Switch, a memory-efficient expert switching framework for LLM serving. ME-Switch uses mixed-precision quantization, selectively quantizing non-salient input channels of delta weights to extremely low bits while keeping salient ones intact, significantly reducing storage demands while maintaining performance. Additionally, we develop a routing method that efficiently directs user queries to the most suitable expert by transforming the model selection problem into a domain classification problem. Extensive experiments show ME-Switch's promising memory efficiency and routing performance. For example, when serving three models from the Mistral-7B family, ME-Switch reduces model size by 1.74x while maintaining nearly lossless performance on instruction, mathematical reasoning, and code generation tasks. Furthermore, ME-Switch can efficiently serve 16 models from the Mistral-7B family on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Continual learning is a challenging problem in machine learning, especially for image classification tasks with imbalanced datasets. It becomes even more challenging when it involves learning new classes incrementally. One method for incremental class learning, addressing dataset imbalance, is rehearsal using previously stored data. In rehearsal-based methods, access to previous data is required for either training the classifier or the generator, but it may not be feasible due to storage, legal, or data access constraints. Although there are many rehearsal-free alternatives for class incremental learning, such as parameter or loss regularization, knowledge distillation, and dynamic architectures, they do not consistently achieve good results, especially on imbalanced data. This paper proposes a new approach called Data-Free Generative Replay (DFGR) for class incremental learning, where the generator is trained without access to real data. In addition, DFGR also addresses dataset imbalance in continual learning of an image classifier. Instead of using training data, DFGR trains a generator using mean and variance statistics of batch-norm and feature maps derived from a pre-trained classification model. The results of our experiments demonstrate that DFGR performs significantly better than other data-free methods and reveal the performance impact of specific parameter settings. DFGR achieves up to 88.5% and 46.6% accuracy on MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets, respectively. Our code is available at this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) can learn optimal policies from pre-collected offline datasets without interacting with the environment, but the sampled actions of the agent cannot often cover the action distribution under a given state, resulting in the extrapolation error issue. Recent works address this issue by employing generative adversarial networks (GANs). However, these methods often suffer from insufficient constraints on policy exploration and inaccurate representation of behavior policies. Moreover, the generator in GANs fails in fooling the discriminator while maximizing the expected returns of a policy. Inspired by the diffusion, a generative model with powerful feature expressiveness, we propose a new offline RL method named Diffusion Policies with Generative Adversarial Networks (DiffPoGAN). In this approach, the diffusion serves as the policy generator to generate diverse distributions of actions, and a regularization method based on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is developed to generate data that approximate the distribution of behavior policies. Besides, we introduce an additional regularization term based on the discriminator output to effectively constrain policy exploration for policy improvement. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on the datasets for deep data-driven reinforcement learning (D4RL), and experimental results show that DiffPoGAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in offline RL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper describes our submission to the MEDIQA-CORR 2024 shared task for automatically detecting and correcting medical errors in clinical notes. We report results for three methods of few-shot In-Context Learning (ICL) augmented with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and reason prompts using a large language model (LLM). In the first method, we manually analyse a subset of train and validation dataset to infer three CoT prompts by examining error types in the clinical notes. In the second method, we utilise the training dataset to prompt the LLM to deduce reasons about their correctness or incorrectness. The constructed CoTs and reasons are then augmented with ICL examples to solve the tasks of error detection, span identification, and error correction. Finally, we combine the two methods using a rule-based ensemble method. Across the three sub-tasks, our ensemble method achieves a ranking of 3rd for both sub-task 1 and 2, while securing 7th place in sub-task 3 among all submissions.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Weakly-supervised anomaly detection can outperform existing unsupervised methods with the assistance of a very small number of labeled anomalies, which attracts increasing attention from researchers. However, existing weakly-supervised anomaly detection methods are limited as these methods do not factor in the multimodel nature of the real-world data distribution. To mitigate this, we propose the Weakly-supervised Variational-mixture-model-based Anomaly Detector (WVAD). WVAD excels in multimodal datasets. It consists of two components: a deep variational mixture model, and an anomaly score estimator. The deep variational mixture model captures various features of the data from different clusters, then these features are delivered to the anomaly score estimator to assess the anomaly levels. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate WVAD's superiority.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Self-supervised learning (SSL)-based speech models are extensively used for full-stack speech processing. However, it has been observed that improving SSL-based speech representations using unlabeled speech for content-related tasks is challenging and computationally expensive. Recent attempts have been made to address this issue with cost-effective self-supervised fine-tuning (SSFT) approaches. Continuing in this direction, a cost-effective SSFT method named "LASER: Learning by Aligning Self-supervised Representations" is presented. LASER is based on the soft-DTW alignment loss with temporal regularisation term. Experiments are conducted with HuBERT and WavLM models and evaluated on the SUPERB benchmark for two content-related tasks: automatic speech recognition (ASR) and phoneme recognition (PR). A relative improvement of 3.7% and 8.2% for HuBERT, and 4.1% and 11.7% for WavLM are observed, for the ASR and PR tasks respectively, with only < 3 hours of fine-tuning on a single GPU.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, revolutionizing the integration of AI in daily life applications. However, they are prone to hallucinations, generating claims that contradict established facts, deviating from prompts, and producing inconsistent responses when the same prompt is presented multiple times. Addressing these issues is challenging due to the lack of comprehensive and easily assessable benchmark datasets. Most existing datasets are small and rely on multiple-choice questions, which are inadequate for evaluating the generative prowess of LLMs. To measure hallucination in LLMs, this paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark dataset comprising over 75,000 prompts across eight domains. These prompts are designed to elicit definitive, concise, and informative answers. The dataset is divided into two segments: one publicly available for testing and assessing LLM performance and a hidden segment for benchmarking various LLMs. In our experiments, we tested six LLMs-GPT-3.5, LLama 2, LLama 3, Gemini, Mixtral, and Zephyr-revealing that overall factual hallucination ranges from 59% to 82% on the public dataset and 57% to 76% in the hidden benchmark. Prompt misalignment hallucination ranges from 6% to 95% in the public dataset and 17% to 94% in the hidden counterpart. Average consistency ranges from 21% to 61% and 22% to 63%, respectively. Domain-wise analysis shows that LLM performance significantly deteriorates when asked for specific numeric information while performing moderately with person, location, and date queries. Our dataset demonstrates its efficacy and serves as a comprehensive benchmark for LLM performance evaluation.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we work towards extending Audio-Visual Question Answering (AVQA) to multilingual settings. Existing AVQA research has predominantly revolved around English and replicating it for addressing AVQA in other languages requires a substantial allocation of resources. As a scalable solution, we leverage machine translation and present two multilingual AVQA datasets for eight languages created from existing benchmark AVQA datasets. This prevents extra human annotation efforts of collecting questions and answers manually. To this end, we propose, MERA framework, by leveraging state-of-the-art (SOTA) video, audio, and textual foundation models for AVQA in multiple languages. We introduce a suite of models namely MERA-L, MERA-C, MERA-T with varied model architectures to benchmark the proposed datasets. We believe our work will open new research directions and act as a reference benchmark for future works in multilingual AVQA.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advancements in image generation have enabled the creation of high-quality images from text conditions. However, when facing multi-modal conditions, such as text combined with reference appearances, existing methods struggle to balance multiple conditions effectively, typically showing a preference for one modality over others. To address this challenge, we introduce EMMA, a novel image generation model accepting multi-modal prompts built upon the state-of-the-art text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model, ELLA. EMMA seamlessly incorporates additional modalities alongside text to guide image generation through an innovative Multi-modal Feature Connector design, which effectively integrates textual and supplementary modal information using a special attention mechanism. By freezing all parameters in the original T2I diffusion model and only adjusting some additional layers, we reveal an interesting finding that the pre-trained T2I diffusion model can secretly accept multi-modal prompts. This interesting property facilitates easy adaptation to different existing frameworks, making EMMA a flexible and effective tool for producing personalized and context-aware images and even videos. Additionally, we introduce a strategy to assemble learned EMMA modules to produce images conditioned on multiple modalities simultaneously, eliminating the need for additional training with mixed multi-modal prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of EMMA in maintaining high fidelity and detail in generated images, showcasing its potential as a robust solution for advanced multi-modal conditional image generation tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has catalyzed the deployment of LLM-powered agents across numerous applications, raising new concerns regarding their safety and trustworthiness. Existing methods for enhancing the safety of LLMs are not directly transferable to LLM-powered agents due to their diverse objectives and output modalities. In this paper, we propose GuardAgent, the first LLM agent as a guardrail to other LLM agents. Specifically, GuardAgent oversees a target LLM agent by checking whether its inputs/outputs satisfy a set of given guard requests defined by the users. GuardAgent comprises two steps: 1) creating a task plan by analyzing the provided guard requests, and 2) generating guardrail code based on the task plan and executing the code by calling APIs or using external engines. In both steps, an LLM is utilized as the core reasoning component, supplemented by in-context demonstrations retrieved from a memory module. Such knowledge-enabled reasoning allows GuardAgent to understand various textual guard requests and accurately "translate" them into executable code that provides reliable guardrails. Furthermore, GuardAgent is equipped with an extendable toolbox containing functions and APIs and requires no additional LLM training, which underscores its generalization capabilities and low operational overhead. Additionally, we propose two novel benchmarks: an EICU-AC benchmark for assessing privacy-related access control for healthcare agents and a Mind2Web-SC benchmark for safety evaluation for web agents. We show the effectiveness of GuardAgent on these two benchmarks with 98.7% and 90.0% accuracy in moderating invalid inputs and outputs for the two types of agents, respectively. We also show that GuardAgent is able to define novel functions in adaption to emergent LLM agents and guard requests, which underscores its strong generalization capabilities.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Self-supervised speech representations can hugely benefit downstream speech technologies, yet the properties that make them useful are still poorly understood. Two candidate properties related to the geometry of the representation space have been hypothesized to correlate well with downstream tasks: (1) the degree of orthogonality between the subspaces spanned by the speaker centroids and phone centroids, and (2) the isotropy of the space, i.e., the degree to which all dimensions are effectively utilized. To study them, we introduce a new measure, Cumulative Residual Variance (CRV), which can be used to assess both properties. Using linear classifiers for speaker and phone ID to probe the representations of six different self-supervised models and two untrained baselines, we ask whether either orthogonality or isotropy correlate with linear probing accuracy. We find that both measures correlate with phonetic probing accuracy, though our results on isotropy are more nuanced.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We investigate what linguistic factors affect the performance of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models.

To examine this, we fine-tune the multilingual self-supervised pretrained model Wav2Vec2-XLSR-53 on 25 languages with 15 writing systems, and we compare their ASR accuracy, number of graphemes, unigram grapheme entropy, logographicity (how much word/morpheme-level information is encoded in the writing system), and number of phonemes. The results demonstrate that orthographic complexities significantly correlate with low ASR accuracy, while phonological complexity shows no significant correlation.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The Open Whisper-style Speech Model (OWSM) series was introduced to achieve full transparency in building advanced speech-to-text (S2T) foundation models. To this end, OWSM models are trained on 25 public speech datasets, which are heterogeneous in multiple ways. In this study, we advance the OWSM series by introducing OWSM v3.2, which improves on prior models by investigating and addressing the impacts of this data heterogeneity. Our study begins with a detailed analysis of each dataset, from which we derive two key strategies: data filtering with proxy task to enhance data quality, and the incorporation of punctuation and true-casing using an open large language model (LLM). With all other configurations staying the same, OWSM v3.2 improves performance over the OWSM v3.1 baseline while using 15% less training data.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We address the problem of multi-object 3D pose control in image diffusion models. Instead of conditioning on a sequence of text tokens, we propose to use a set of per-object representations, Neural Assets, to control the 3D pose of individual objects in a scene. Neural Assets are obtained by pooling visual representations of objects from a reference image, such as a frame in a video, and are trained to reconstruct the respective objects in a different image, e.g., a later frame in the video. Importantly, we encode object visuals from the reference image while conditioning on object poses from the target frame. This enables learning disentangled appearance and pose features. Combining visual and 3D pose representations in a sequence-of-tokens format allows us to keep the text-to-image architecture of existing models, with Neural Assets in place of text tokens. By fine-tuning a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model with this information, our approach enables fine-grained 3D pose and placement control of individual objects in a scene. We further demonstrate that Neural Assets can be transferred and recomposed across different scenes. Our model achieves state-of-the-art multi-object editing results on both synthetic 3D scene datasets, as well as two real-world video datasets (Objectron, Waymo Open).</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce StableMaterials, a novel approach for generating photorealistic physical-based rendering (PBR) materials that integrate semi-supervised learning with Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs). Our method employs adversarial training to distill knowledge from existing large-scale image generation models, minimizing the reliance on annotated data and enhancing the diversity in generation. This distillation approach aligns the distribution of the generated materials with that of image textures from an SDXL model, enabling the generation of novel materials that are not present in the initial training dataset. Furthermore, we employ a diffusion-based refiner model to improve the visual quality of the samples and achieve high-resolution generation. Finally, we distill a latent consistency model for fast generation in just four steps and propose a new tileability technique that removes visual artifacts typically associated with fewer diffusion steps. We detail the architecture and training process of StableMaterials, the integration of semi-supervised training within existing LDM frameworks and show the advantages of our approach. Comparative evaluations with state-of-the-art methods show the effectiveness of StableMaterials, highlighting its potential applications in computer graphics and beyond.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Self-Supervised learning (SSL) with Joint-Embedding Architectures (JEA) has led to outstanding performances. All instantiations of this paradigm were trained using strong and well-established hand-crafted data augmentations, leading to the general belief that they are required for the proper training and performance of such models. On the other hand, generative reconstruction-based models such as BEIT and MAE or Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures such as I-JEPA have shown strong performance without using data augmentations except masking. In this work, we challenge the importance of invariance and data-augmentation in JEAs at scale. By running a case-study on a recent SSL foundation model - DINOv2 - we show that strong image representations can be obtained with JEAs and only cropping without resizing provided the training data is large enough, reaching state-of-the-art results and using the least amount of augmentation in the literature. Through this study, we also discuss the impact of compute constraints on the outcomes of experimental deep learning research, showing that they can lead to very different conclusions.</li>

Through a detailed evaluation, we illustrate the improved AL performance on these challenging datasets, highlighting the strategic advantage of merging parameter efficient fine tuning methods with foundation models.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In subject-driven text-to-image generation, recent works have achieved superior performance by training the model on synthetic datasets containing numerous image pairs. Trained on these datasets, generative models can produce text-aligned images for specific subject from arbitrary testing image in a zero-shot manner. They even outperform methods which require additional fine-tuning on testing images. However, the cost of creating such datasets is prohibitive for most researchers. To generate a single training pair, current methods fine-tune a pre-trained text-to-image model on the subject image to capture fine-grained details, then use the fine-tuned model to create images for the same subject based on creative text prompts. Consequently, constructing a large-scale dataset with millions of subjects can require hundreds of thousands of GPU hours. To tackle this problem, we propose Toffee, an efficient method to construct datasets for subject-driven editing and generation. Specifically, our dataset construction does not need any subject-level fine-tuning. After pre-training two generative models, we are able to generate infinite number of high-quality samples. We construct the first large-scale dataset for subject-driven image editing and generation, which contains 5 million image pairs, text prompts, and masks. Our dataset is 5 times the size of previous largest dataset, yet our cost is tens of thousands of GPU hours lower. To test the proposed dataset, we also propose a model which is capable of both subject-driven image editing and generation. By simply training the model on our proposed dataset, it obtains competitive results, illustrating the effectiveness of the proposed dataset construction framework.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Entity matching is the task of linking records from different sources that refer to the same real-world entity. Past work has primarily treated entity linking as a standard supervised learning problem. However, supervised entity matching models often do not generalize well to new data, and collecting exhaustive labeled training data is often cost prohibitive. Further, recent efforts have adopted LLMs for this task in few/zero-shot settings, exploiting their general knowledge. But LLMs are prohibitively expensive for performing inference at scale for real-world entity matching tasks. As an efficient alternative, we re-cast entity matching as a conditional generation task as opposed to binary classification. This enables us to "distill" LLM reasoning into smaller entity matching models via natural language explanations. This approach achieves strong performance, especially on out-of-domain generalization tests (10.85% F-1) where standalone generative methods struggle. We perform ablations that highlight the importance of explanations, both for performance and model robustness.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The integration of pre-trained text-based large language models (LLM) with speech input has enabled instruction-following capabilities for diverse speech tasks. This integration requires the use of a speech encoder, a speech adapter, and an LLM, trained on diverse tasks. We propose the use of discrete speech units (DSU), rather than continuous-valued speech encoder outputs, that are converted to the LLM token embedding space using the speech adapter. We generate DSU using a self-supervised speech encoder followed by k-means clustering. The proposed model shows robust performance on speech inputs from seen/unseen domains and instruction-following capability in spoken question answering. We also explore various types of DSU extracted from different layers of the self-supervised speech encoder, as well as Mel frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC). Our findings suggest that the ASR task and datasets are not crucial in instruction-tuning for spoken question answering tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Transformer architectures have been widely adopted in foundation models. Due to their high inference costs, there is renewed interest in exploring the potential of efficient recurrent architectures (RNNs). In this paper, we analyze the differences in the representational capabilities of Transformers and RNNs across several tasks of practical relevance, including index lookup, nearest neighbor, recognizing bounded Dyck languages, and string equality. For the tasks considered, our results show separations based on the size of the model required for different architectures. For example, we show that a one-layer Transformer of logarithmic width can perform index lookup, whereas an RNN requires a hidden state of linear size. Conversely, while constant-size RNNs can recognize bounded Dyck languages, we show that one-layer Transformers require a linear size for this task. Furthermore, we show that two-layer Transformers of logarithmic size can perform decision tasks such as string equality or disjointness, whereas both one-layer Transformers and recurrent models require linear size for these tasks. We also show that a log-size two-layer Transformer can implement the nearest neighbor algorithm in its forward pass; on the other hand recurrent models require linear size. Our constructions are based on the existence of $N$ nearly orthogonal vectors in $O(\log N)$ dimensional space and our lower bounds are based on reductions from communication complexity problems. We supplement our theoretical results with experiments that highlight the differences in the performance of these architectures on practical-size sequences.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models have demonstrated effectiveness in generating natural images and have been extended to generate diverse data types, including graphs. This new generation of diffusion-based graph generative models has demonstrated significant performance improvements over methods that rely on variational autoencoders or generative adversarial networks. It's important to recognize, however, that most of these models employ Gaussian or categorical diffusion processes, which can struggle with sparse and long-tailed data distributions. In our work, we introduce Graph Beta Diffusion (GBD), a diffusion-based generative model particularly adept at capturing diverse graph structures. GBD utilizes a beta diffusion process, tailored for the sparse and range-bounded characteristics of graph adjacency matrices. Furthermore, we have developed a modulation technique that enhances the realism of the generated graphs by stabilizing the generation of critical graph structures, while preserving flexibility elsewhere. The outstanding performance of GBD across three general graph benchmarks and two biochemical graph benchmarks highlights its capability to effectively capture the complexities of real-world graph data.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Colloquially speaking, image generation models based upon diffusion processes are frequently said to exhibit "hallucinations," samples that could never occur in the training data. But where do such hallucinations come from? In this paper, we study a particular failure mode in diffusion models, which we term mode interpolation. Specifically, we find that diffusion models smoothly "interpolate" between nearby data modes in the training set, to generate samples that are completely outside the support of the original training distribution; this phenomenon leads diffusion models to generate artifacts that never existed in real data (i.e., hallucinations). We systematically study the reasons for, and the manifestation of this phenomenon. Through experiments on 1D and 2D Gaussians, we show how a discontinuous loss landscape in the diffusion model's decoder leads to a region where any smooth approximation will cause such hallucinations. Through experiments on artificial datasets with various shapes, we show how hallucination leads to the generation of combinations of shapes that never existed. Finally, we show that diffusion models in fact know when they go out of support and hallucinate. This is captured by the high variance in the trajectory of the generated sample towards the final few backward sampling process. Using a simple metric to capture this variance, we can remove over 95% of hallucinations at generation time while retaining 96% of in-support samples. We conclude our exploration by showing the implications of such hallucination (and its removal) on the collapse (and stabilization) of recursive training on synthetic data with experiments on MNIST and 2D Gaussians dataset.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Maximum Manifold Capacity Representations (MMCR) is a recent multi-view self-supervised learning (MVSSL) method that matches or surpasses other leading MVSSL methods. MMCR is intriguing because it does not fit neatly into any of the commonplace MVSSL lineages, instead originating from a statistical mechanical perspective on the linear separability of data manifolds. In this paper, we seek to improve our understanding and our utilization of MMCR. To better understand MMCR, we leverage tools from high dimensional probability to demonstrate that MMCR incentivizes alignment and uniformity of learned embeddings. We then leverage tools from information theory to show that such embeddings maximize a well-known lower bound on mutual information between views, thereby connecting the geometric perspective of MMCR to the information-theoretic perspective commonly discussed in MVSSL. To better utilize MMCR, we mathematically predict and experimentally confirm non-monotonic changes in the pretraining loss akin to double descent but with respect to atypical hyperparameters. We also discover compute scaling laws that enable predicting the pretraining loss as a function of gradients steps, batch size, embedding dimension and number of views. We then show that MMCR, originally applied to image data, is performant on multimodal image-text data. By more deeply understanding the theoretical and empirical behavior of MMCR, our work reveals insights on improving MVSSL methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Advanced image editing techniques, particularly inpainting, are essential for seamlessly removing unwanted elements while preserving visual integrity. Traditional GAN-based methods have achieved notable success, but recent advancements in diffusion models have produced superior results due to their training on large-scale datasets, enabling the generation of remarkably realistic inpainted images. Despite their strengths, diffusion models often struggle with object removal tasks without explicit guidance, leading to unintended hallucinations of the removed object. To address this issue, we introduce CLIPAway, a novel approach leveraging CLIP embeddings to focus on background regions while excluding foreground elements. CLIPAway enhances inpainting accuracy and quality by identifying embeddings that prioritize the background, thus achieving seamless object removal. Unlike other methods that rely on specialized training datasets or costly manual annotations, CLIPAway provides a flexible, plug-and-play solution compatible with various diffusion-based inpainting techniques.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Learning 3D head priors from large 2D image collections is an important step towards high-quality 3D-aware human modeling. A core requirement is an efficient architecture that scales well to large-scale datasets and large image resolutions. Unfortunately, existing 3D GANs struggle to scale to generate samples at high resolutions due to their relatively slow train and render speeds, and typically have to rely on 2D superresolution networks at the expense of global 3D consistency. To address these challenges, we propose Generative Gaussian Heads (GGHead), which adopts the recent 3D Gaussian Splatting representation within a 3D GAN framework. To generate a 3D representation, we employ a powerful 2D CNN generator to predict Gaussian attributes in the UV space of a template head mesh. This way, GGHead exploits the regularity of the template's UV layout, substantially facilitating the challenging task of predicting an unstructured set of 3D Gaussians. We further improve the geometric fidelity of the generated 3D representations with a novel total variation loss on rendered UV coordinates. Intuitively, this regularization encourages that neighboring rendered pixels should stem from neighboring Gaussians in the template's UV space. Taken together, our pipeline can efficiently generate 3D heads trained only from single-view 2D image observations. Our proposed framework matches the quality of existing 3D head GANs on FFHQ while being both substantially faster and fully 3D consistent. As a result, we demonstrate real-time generation and rendering of high-quality 3D-consistent heads at $1024^2$ resolution for the first time.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the advent and recent ubiquity of foundation models, continual learning (CL) has recently shifted from continual training from scratch to the continual adaptation of pretrained models, seeing particular success on rehearsal-free CL benchmarks (RFCL). To achieve this, most proposed methods adapt and restructure parameter-efficient finetuning techniques (PEFT) to suit the continual nature of the problem. Based most often on input-conditional query-mechanisms or regularizations on top of prompt- or adapter-based PEFT, these PEFT-style RFCL (P-RFCL) approaches report peak performances; often convincingly outperforming existing CL techniques. However, on the other end, critical studies have recently highlighted competitive results by training on just the first task or via simple non-parametric baselines. Consequently, questions arise about the relationship between methodological choices in P-RFCL and their reported high benchmark scores. In this work, we tackle these questions to better understand the true drivers behind strong P-RFCL performances, their placement w.r.t. recent first-task adaptation studies, and their relation to preceding CL standards such as EWC or SI. In particular, we show: (1) P-RFCL techniques relying on input-conditional query mechanisms work not because, but rather despite them by collapsing towards standard PEFT shortcut solutions. (2) Indeed, we show how most often, P-RFCL techniques can be matched by a simple and lightweight PEFT baseline. (3) Using this baseline, we identify the implicit bound on tunable parameters when deriving RFCL approaches from PEFT methods as a potential denominator behind P-RFCL efficacy. Finally, we (4) better disentangle continual versus first-task adaptation, and (5) motivate standard RFCL techniques s.a. EWC or SI in light of recent P-RFCL methods.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vision-Language Foundation Models (VLFMs) have made remarkable progress on various multimodal tasks, such as image captioning, image-text retrieval, visual question answering, and visual grounding. However, most methods rely on training with general image datasets, and the lack of geospatial data leads to poor performance on earth observation. Numerous geospatial image-text pair datasets and VLFMs fine-tuned on them have been proposed recently. These new approaches aim to leverage large-scale, multimodal geospatial data to build versatile intelligent models with diverse geo-perceptive capabilities, which we refer to as Vision-Language Geo-Foundation Models (VLGFMs). This paper thoroughly reviews VLGFMs, summarizing and analyzing recent developments in the field. In particular, we introduce the background and motivation behind the rise of VLGFMs, highlighting their unique research significance. Then, we systematically summarize the core technologies employed in VLGFMs, including data construction, model architectures, and applications of various multimodal geospatial tasks. Finally, we conclude with insights, issues, and discussions regarding future research directions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive literature review of VLGFMs. We keep tracing related works at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Controllable synthetic data generation can substantially lower the annotation cost of training data in autonomous driving research and development. Prior works use diffusion models to generate driving images conditioned on the 3D object layout. However, those models are trained on small-scale datasets like nuScenes, which lack appearance and layout diversity. Moreover, the trained models can only generate images based on the real-world layout data from the validation set of the same dataset, where overfitting might happen. In this work, we introduce a simulator-conditioned scene generation framework called SimGen that can learn to generate diverse driving scenes by mixing data from the simulator and the real world. It uses a novel cascade diffusion pipeline to address challenging sim-to-real gaps and multi-condition conflicts. A driving video dataset DIVA is collected to enhance the generative diversity of SimGen, which contains over 147.5 hours of real-world driving videos from 73 locations worldwide and simulated driving data from the MetaDrive simulator. SimGen achieves superior generation quality and diversity while preserving controllability based on the text prompt and the layout pulled from a simulator. We further demonstrate the improvements brought by SimGen for synthetic data augmentation on the BEV detection and segmentation task and showcase its capability in safety-critical data generation. Code, data, and models will be made available.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present WonderWorld, a novel framework for \emph{interactive} 3D scene extrapolation that enables users to explore and shape virtual environments based on a single input image and user-specified text. While significant improvements have been made to the visual quality of scene generation, existing methods are run offline, taking tens of minutes to hours to generate a scene. By leveraging Fast Gaussian Surfels and a guided diffusion-based depth estimation method, WonderWorld generates geometrically consistent extrapolation while significantly reducing computational time. Our framework generates connected and diverse 3D scenes in less than 10 seconds on a single A6000 GPU, enabling real-time user interaction and exploration. We demonstrate the potential of WonderWorld for applications in virtual reality, gaming, and creative design, where users can quickly generate and navigate immersive, potentially infinite virtual worlds from a single image. Our approach represents a significant advancement in interactive 3D scene generation, opening up new possibilities for user-driven content creation and exploration in virtual environments.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent improvements in generative AI made synthesizing fake images easy; as they can be used to cause harm, it is crucial to develop accurate techniques to identify them. This paper introduces "Locally Aware Deepfake Detection Algorithm" (LaDeDa), that accepts a single 9x9 image patch and outputs its deepfake score. The image deepfake score is the pooled score of its patches. With merely patch-level information, LaDeDa significantly improves over the state-of-the-art, achieving around 99% mAP on current benchmarks. Owing to the patch-level structure of LaDeDa, we hypothesize that the generation artifacts can be detected by a simple model. We therefore distill LaDeDa into Tiny-LaDeDa, a highly efficient model consisting of only 4 convolutional layers. Remarkably, Tiny-LaDeDa has 375x fewer FLOPs and is 10,000x more parameter-efficient than LaDeDa, allowing it to run efficiently on edge devices with a minor decrease in accuracy. These almost-perfect scores raise the question: is the task of deepfake detection close to being solved? Perhaps surprisingly, our investigation reveals that current training protocols prevent methods from generalizing to real-world deepfakes extracted from social media. To address this issue, we introduce WildRF, a new deepfake detection dataset curated from several popular social networks. Our method achieves the top performance of 93.7% mAP on WildRF, however the large gap from perfect accuracy shows that reliable real-world deepfake detection is still unsolved.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Tokenizer, serving as a translator to map the intricate visual data into a compact latent space, lies at the core of visual generative models. Based on the finding that existing tokenizers are tailored to image or video inputs, this paper presents OmniTokenizer, a transformer-based tokenizer for joint image and video tokenization. OmniTokenizer is designed with a spatial-temporal decoupled architecture, which integrates window and causal attention for spatial and temporal modeling. To exploit the complementary nature of image and video data, we further propose a progressive training strategy, where OmniTokenizer is first trained on image data on a fixed resolution to develop the spatial encoding capacity and then jointly trained on image and video data on multiple resolutions to learn the temporal dynamics. OmniTokenizer, for the first time, handles both image and video inputs within a unified framework and proves the possibility of realizing their synergy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniTokenizer achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) reconstruction performance on various image and video datasets, e.g., 1.11 reconstruction FID on ImageNet and 42 reconstruction FVD on UCF-101, beating the previous SOTA methods by 13% and 26%, respectively. Additionally, we also show that when integrated with OmniTokenizer, both language model-based approaches and diffusion models can realize advanced visual synthesis performance, underscoring the superiority and versatility of our method.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper proposes Instruct 4D-to-4D that achieves 4D awareness and spatial-temporal consistency for 2D diffusion models to generate high-quality instruction-guided dynamic scene editing results. Traditional applications of 2D diffusion models in dynamic scene editing often result in inconsistency, primarily due to their inherent frame-by-frame editing methodology. Addressing the complexities of extending instruction-guided editing to 4D, our key insight is to treat a 4D scene as a pseudo-3D scene, decoupled into two sub-problems: achieving temporal consistency in video editing and applying these edits to the pseudo-3D scene. Following this, we first enhance the Instruct-Pix2Pix (IP2P) model with an anchor-aware attention module for batch processing and consistent editing. Additionally, we integrate optical flow-guided appearance propagation in a sliding window fashion for more precise frame-to-frame editing and incorporate depth-based projection to manage the extensive data of pseudo-3D scenes, followed by iterative editing to achieve convergence. We extensively evaluate our approach in various scenes and editing instructions, and demonstrate that it achieves spatially and temporally consistent editing results, with significantly enhanced detail and sharpness over the prior art. Notably, Instruct 4D-to-4D is general and applicable to both monocular and challenging multi-camera scenes. Code and more results are available at this http URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper proposes ConsistDreamer - a novel framework that lifts 2D diffusion models with 3D awareness and 3D consistency, thus enabling high-fidelity instruction-guided scene editing. To overcome the fundamental limitation of missing 3D consistency in 2D diffusion models, our key insight is to introduce three synergetic strategies that augment the input of the 2D diffusion model to become 3D-aware and to explicitly enforce 3D consistency during the training process. Specifically, we design surrounding views as context-rich input for the 2D diffusion model, and generate 3D-consistent, structured noise instead of image-independent noise. Moreover, we introduce self-supervised consistency-enforcing training within the per-scene editing procedure. Extensive evaluation shows that our ConsistDreamer achieves state-of-the-art performance for instruction-guided scene editing across various scenes and editing instructions, particularly in complicated large-scale indoor scenes from ScanNet++, with significantly improved sharpness and fine-grained textures. Notably, ConsistDreamer stands as the first work capable of successfully editing complex (e.g., plaid/checkered) patterns. Our project page is at this http URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Current multimodal and multitask foundation models like 4M or UnifiedIO show promising results, but in practice their out-of-the-box abilities to accept diverse inputs and perform diverse tasks are limited by the (usually rather small) number of modalities and tasks they are trained on. In this paper, we expand upon the capabilities of them by training a single model on tens of highly diverse modalities and by performing co-training on large-scale multimodal datasets and text corpora. This includes training on several semantic and geometric modalities, feature maps from recent state of the art models like DINOv2 and ImageBind, pseudo labels of specialist models like SAM and 4DHumans, and a range of new modalities that allow for novel ways to interact with the model and steer the generation, for example image metadata or color palettes. A crucial step in this process is performing discrete tokenization on various modalities, whether they are image-like, neural network feature maps, vectors, structured data like instance segmentation or human poses, or data that can be represented as text. Through this, we expand on the out-of-the-box capabilities of multimodal models and specifically show the possibility of training one model to solve at least 3x more tasks/modalities than existing ones and doing so without a loss in performance. This enables more fine-grained and controllable multimodal generation capabilities and allows us to study the distillation of models trained on diverse data and objectives into a unified model. We successfully scale the training to a three billion parameter model using tens of modalities and different datasets. The resulting models and training code are open sourced at this http URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We investigate the space of weights spanned by a large collection of customized diffusion models. We populate this space by creating a dataset of over 60,000 models, each of which is a base model fine-tuned to insert a different person's visual identity. We model the underlying manifold of these weights as a subspace, which we term weights2weights. We demonstrate three immediate applications of this space -- sampling, editing, and inversion. First, as each point in the space corresponds to an identity, sampling a set of weights from it results in a model encoding a novel identity. Next, we find linear directions in this space corresponding to semantic edits of the identity (e.g., adding a beard). These edits persist in appearance across generated samples. Finally, we show that inverting a single image into this space reconstructs a realistic identity, even if the input image is out of distribution (e.g., a painting). Our results indicate that the weight space of fine-tuned diffusion models behaves as an interpretable latent space of identities.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This work presents Depth Anything V2. Without pursuing fancy techniques, we aim to reveal crucial findings to pave the way towards building a powerful monocular depth estimation model. Notably, compared with V1, this version produces much finer and more robust depth predictions through three key practices: 1) replacing all labeled real images with synthetic images, 2) scaling up the capacity of our teacher model, and 3) teaching student models via the bridge of large-scale pseudo-labeled real images. Compared with the latest models built on Stable Diffusion, our models are significantly more efficient (more than 10x faster) and more accurate. We offer models of different scales (ranging from 25M to 1.3B params) to support extensive scenarios. Benefiting from their strong generalization capability, we fine-tune them with metric depth labels to obtain our metric depth models. In addition to our models, considering the limited diversity and frequent noise in current test sets, we construct a versatile evaluation benchmark with precise annotations and diverse scenes to facilitate future research.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This work does not introduce a new method. Instead, we present an interesting finding that questions the necessity of the inductive bias -- locality in modern computer vision architectures. Concretely, we find that vanilla Transformers can operate by directly treating each individual pixel as a token and achieve highly performant results. This is substantially different from the popular design in Vision Transformer, which maintains the inductive bias from ConvNets towards local neighborhoods (e.g. by treating each 16x16 patch as a token). We mainly showcase the effectiveness of pixels-as-tokens across three well-studied tasks in computer vision: supervised learning for object classification, self-supervised learning via masked autoencoding, and image generation with diffusion models. Although directly operating on individual pixels is less computationally practical, we believe the community must be aware of this surprising piece of knowledge when devising the next generation of neural architectures for computer vision.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper presents innovative enhancements to diffusion models by integrating a novel multi-resolution network and time-dependent layer normalization. Diffusion models have gained prominence for their effectiveness in high-fidelity image generation. While conventional approaches rely on convolutional U-Net architectures, recent Transformer-based designs have demonstrated superior performance and scalability. However, Transformer architectures, which tokenize input data (via "patchification"), face a trade-off between visual fidelity and computational complexity due to the quadratic nature of self-attention operations concerning token length. While larger patch sizes enable attention computation efficiency, they struggle to capture fine-grained visual details, leading to image distortions. To address this challenge, we propose augmenting the Diffusion model with the Multi-Resolution network (DiMR), a framework that refines features across multiple resolutions, progressively enhancing detail from low to high resolution. Additionally, we introduce Time-Dependent Layer Normalization (TD-LN), a parameter-efficient approach that incorporates time-dependent parameters into layer normalization to inject time information and achieve superior performance. Our method's efficacy is demonstrated on the class-conditional ImageNet generation benchmark, where DiMR-XL variants outperform prior diffusion models, setting new state-of-the-art FID scores of 1.70 on ImageNet 256 x 256 and 2.89 on ImageNet 512 x 512.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Score distillation sampling (SDS) has proven to be an important tool, enabling the use of large-scale diffusion priors for tasks operating in data-poor domains. Unfortunately, SDS has a number of characteristic artifacts that limit its usefulness in general-purpose applications. In this paper, we make progress toward understanding the behavior of SDS and its variants by viewing them as solving an optimal-cost transport path from a source distribution to a target distribution. Under this new interpretation, these methods seek to transport corrupted images (source) to the natural image distribution (target). We argue that current methods' characteristic artifacts are caused by (1) linear approximation of the optimal path and (2) poor estimates of the source distribution. We show that calibrating the text conditioning of the source distribution can produce high-quality generation and translation results with little extra overhead. Our method can be easily applied across many domains, matching or beating the performance of specialized methods. We demonstrate its utility in text-to-2D, text-based NeRF optimization, translating paintings to real images, optical illusion generation, and 3D sketch-to-real. We compare our method to existing approaches for score distillation sampling and show that it can produce high-frequency details with realistic colors.</li>
