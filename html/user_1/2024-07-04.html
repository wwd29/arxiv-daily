<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Cyber threats are constantly evolving. Extracting actionable insights from unstructured Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) data is essential to guide cybersecurity decisions. Increasingly, organizations like Microsoft, Trend Micro, and CrowdStrike are using generative AI to facilitate CTI extraction. This paper addresses the challenge of automating the extraction of actionable CTI using advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Knowledge Graphs (KGs). We explore the application of state-of-the-art open-source LLMs, including the Llama 2 series, Mistral 7B Instruct, and Zephyr for extracting meaningful triples from CTI texts. Our methodology evaluates techniques such as prompt engineering, the guidance framework, and fine-tuning to optimize information extraction and structuring. The extracted data is then utilized to construct a KG, offering a structured and queryable representation of threat intelligence. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in extracting relevant information, with guidance and fine-tuning showing superior performance over prompt engineering. However, while our methods prove effective in small-scale tests, applying LLMs to large-scale data for KG construction and Link Prediction presents ongoing challenges.</li>

          Towards the Next Frontier in Speech Representation Learning Using Disentanglement(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The popular frameworks for self-supervised learning of speech representations have largely focused on frame-level masked prediction of speech regions. While this has shown promising downstream task performance for speech recognition and related tasks, this has largely ignored factors of speech that are encoded at coarser level, like characteristics of the speaker or channel that remain consistent through-out a speech utterance. In this work, we propose a framework for Learning Disentangled Self Supervised (termed as Learn2Diss) representations of speech, which consists of frame-level and an utterance-level encoder modules. The two encoders are initially learned independently, where the frame-level model is largely inspired by existing self supervision techniques, thereby learning pseudo-phonemic representations, while the utterance-level encoder is inspired by constrastive learning of pooled embeddings, thereby learning pseudo-speaker representations. The joint learning of these two modules consists of disentangling the two encoders using a mutual information based criterion. With several downstream evaluation experiments, we show that the proposed Learn2Diss achieves state-of-the-art results on a variety of tasks, with the frame-level encoder representations improving semantic tasks, while the utterance-level representations improve non-semantic tasks.</li>

          Diffusion Models for Tabular Data Imputation and Synthetic Data Generation(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Data imputation and data generation have important applications for many domains, like healthcare and finance, where incomplete or missing data can hinder accurate analysis and decision-making. Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative models capable of capturing complex data distributions across various data modalities such as image, audio, and time series data. Recently, they have been also adapted to generate tabular data. In this paper, we propose a diffusion model for tabular data that introduces three key enhancements: (1) a conditioning attention mechanism, (2) an encoder-decoder transformer as the denoising network, and (3) dynamic masking. The conditioning attention mechanism is designed to improve the model's ability to capture the relationship between the condition and synthetic data. The transformer layers help model interactions within the condition (encoder) or synthetic data (decoder), while dynamic masking enables our model to efficiently handle both missing data imputation and synthetic data generation tasks within a unified framework. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation by comparing the performance of diffusion models with transformer conditioning against state-of-the-art techniques, such as Variational Autoencoders, Generative Adversarial Networks and Diffusion Models, on benchmark datasets. Our evaluation focuses on the assessment of the generated samples with respect to three important criteria, namely: (1) Machine Learning efficiency, (2) statistical similarity, and (3) privacy risk mitigation. For the task of data imputation, we consider the efficiency of the generated samples across different levels of missing features.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce Meta 3D Gen (3DGen), a new state-of-the-art, fast pipeline for text-to-3D asset generation. 3DGen offers 3D asset creation with high prompt fidelity and high-quality 3D shapes and textures in under a minute. It supports physically-based rendering (PBR), necessary for 3D asset relighting in real-world applications. Additionally, 3DGen supports generative retexturing of previously generated (or artist-created) 3D shapes using additional textual inputs provided by the user. 3DGen integrates key technical components, Meta 3D AssetGen and Meta 3D TextureGen, that we developed for text-to-3D and text-to-texture generation, respectively. By combining their strengths, 3DGen represents 3D objects simultaneously in three ways: in view space, in volumetric space, and in UV (or texture) space. The integration of these two techniques achieves a win rate of 68% with respect to the single-stage model. We compare 3DGen to numerous industry baselines, and show that it outperforms them in terms of prompt fidelity and visual quality for complex textual prompts, while being significantly faster.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Classifier-free guidance (CFG) has become the standard method for enhancing the quality of conditional diffusion models. However, employing CFG requires either training an unconditional model alongside the main diffusion model or modifying the training procedure by periodically inserting a null condition. There is also no clear extension of CFG to unconditional models. In this paper, we revisit the core principles of CFG and introduce a new method, independent condition guidance (ICG), which provides the benefits of CFG without the need for any special training procedures. Our approach streamlines the training process of conditional diffusion models and can also be applied during inference on any pre-trained conditional model. Additionally, by leveraging the time-step information encoded in all diffusion networks, we propose an extension of CFG, called time-step guidance (TSG), which can be applied to any diffusion model, including unconditional ones. Our guidance techniques are easy to implement and have the same sampling cost as CFG. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that ICG matches the performance of standard CFG across various conditional diffusion models. Moreover, we show that TSG improves generation quality in a manner similar to CFG, without relying on any conditional information.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The cybersecurity of connected cars, integral to the broader Internet of Things (IoT) landscape, has become of paramount concern. Cyber-attacks, including hijacking and spoofing, pose significant threats to these technological advancements, potentially leading to unauthorized control over vehicular networks or creating deceptive identities. Given the difficulty of deploying comprehensive defensive logic across all vehicles, this paper presents a novel approach for identifying potential attacks through Radio Access Network (RAN) event monitoring. The major contribution of this paper is a location anomaly detection module that identifies aberrant devices that appear in multiple locations simultaneously - a potential indicator of a hijacking attack. We demonstrate how RAN-event based location anomaly detection is effective in combating malicious activity targeting connected cars. Using RAN data generated by tens of millions of connected cars, we developed a fast and efficient method for identifying potential malicious or rogue devices. The implications of this research are far-reaching. By increasing the security of connected cars, we can enhance the safety of users, provide robust defenses for the automotive industry, and improve overall cybersecurity practices for IoT devices.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Surgical skill assessment is paramount for ensuring patient safety and enhancing surgical outcomes. This study addresses the need for efficient and objective evaluation methods by introducing ZEAL (surgical skill assessment with Zero-shot surgical tool segmentation with a unifiEd foundAtion modeL). ZEAL uses segmentation masks of surgical instruments obtained through a unified foundation model for proficiency assessment. Through zero-shot inference with text prompts, ZEAL predicts segmentation masks, capturing essential features of both instruments and surroundings. Utilizing sparse convolutional neural networks and segmentation masks, ZEAL extracts feature vectors for foreground (instruments) and background. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks encode temporal dynamics, modeling sequential data and dependencies in surgical videos. Combining LSTM-encoded vectors, ZEAL produces a surgical skill score, offering an objective measure of proficiency. Comparative analysis with conventional methods using open datasets demonstrates ZEAL's superiority, affirming its potential in advancing surgical training and evaluation. This innovative approach to surgical skill assessment addresses challenges in traditional supervised learning techniques, paving the way for enhanced surgical care quality and patient outcomes.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Though adversarial erasing has prevailed in weakly supervised semantic segmentation to help activate integral object regions, existing approaches still suffer from the dilemma of under-activation and over-expansion due to the difficulty in determining when to stop erasing. In this paper, we propose a \textbf{K}nowledge \textbf{T}ransfer with \textbf{S}imulated Inter-Image \textbf{E}rasing (KTSE) approach for weakly supervised semantic segmentation to alleviate the above problem. In contrast to existing erasing-based methods that remove the discriminative part for more object discovery, we propose a simulated inter-image erasing scenario to weaken the original activation by introducing extra object information. Then, object knowledge is transferred from the anchor image to the consequent less activated localization map to strengthen network localization ability. Considering the adopted bidirectional alignment will also weaken the anchor image activation if appropriate constraints are missing, we propose a self-supervised regularization module to maintain the reliable activation in discriminative regions and improve the inter-class object boundary recognition for complex images with multiple categories of objects. In addition, we resort to intra-image erasing and propose a multi-granularity alignment module to gently enlarge the object activation to boost the object knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on PASCAL VOC 2012 and COCO datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach. Source codes and models are available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Words change their meaning over time as well as in different contexts. The sense-aware contextualised word embeddings (SCWEs) such as the ones produced by XL-LEXEME by fine-tuning masked langauge models (MLMs) on Word-in-Context (WiC) data attempt to encode such semantic changes of words within the contextualised word embedding (CWE) spaces. Despite the superior performance of SCWEs in contextual/temporal semantic change detection (SCD) benchmarks, it remains unclear as to how the meaning changes are encoded in the embedding space. To study this, we compare pre-trained CWEs and their fine-tuned versions on contextual and temporal semantic change benchmarks under Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) transformations. Our experimental results reveal several novel insights such as (a) although there exist a smaller number of axes that are responsible for semantic changes of words in the pre-trained CWE space, this information gets distributed across all dimensions when fine-tuned, and (b) in contrast to prior work studying the geometry of CWEs, we find that PCA to better represent semantic changes than ICA.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Conditional Generative Adversarial Nets (CGAN) is often used to improve conditional image generation performance. However, there is little research on Representation learning with CGAN for causal inference. This paper proposes a new method for finding representation learning functions by adopting the adversarial idea. We apply the pattern of CGAN and theoretically emonstrate the feasibility of finding a suitable representation function in the context of two distributions being balanced. The theoretical result shows that when two distributions are balanced, the ideal representation function can be found and thus can be used to further research.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Sign language, essential for the deaf and hard-of-hearing, presents unique challenges in translation and production due to its multimodal nature and the inherent ambiguity in mapping sign language motion to spoken language words. Previous methods often rely on gloss annotations, requiring time-intensive labor and specialized expertise in sign language. Gloss-free methods have emerged to address these limitations, but they often depend on external sign language data or dictionaries, failing to completely eliminate the need for gloss annotations. There is a clear demand for a comprehensive approach that can supplant gloss annotations and be utilized for both Sign Language Translation (SLT) and Sign Language Production (SLP). We introduce Universal Gloss-level Representation (UniGloR), a unified and self-supervised solution for both SLT and SLP, trained on multiple datasets including PHOENIX14T, How2Sign, and NIASL2021. Our results demonstrate UniGloR's effectiveness in the translation and production tasks. We further report an encouraging result for the Sign Language Recognition (SLR) on previously unseen data. Our study suggests that self-supervised learning can be made in a unified manner, paving the way for innovative and practical applications in future research.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This study investigates the efficacy of machine learning models, specifically Random Forest, in anomaly detection systems when trained on complete flow records and tested on partial flow data. We explore the performance disparity that arises when models are applied to incomplete data typical in real-world, real-time network environments. Our findings demonstrate a significant decline in model performance, with precision and recall dropping by up to 30\% under certain conditions when models trained on complete flows are tested against partial flows. Conversely, models trained and tested on consistently complete or partial datasets maintain robustness, highlighting the importance of dataset consistency in training. The study reveals that a minimum of 7 packets in the test set is required for maintaining reliable detection rates. These results underscore the need for tailored training strategies that can effectively adapt to the dynamics of partial data, enhancing the practical applicability of anomaly detection systems in operational settings.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Due to their large size, generative Large Language Models (LLMs) require significant computing and storage resources. This paper introduces a new post-training quantization method, GPTQT, to reduce memory usage and enhance processing speed by expressing the weight of LLM in 3bit/2bit. Practice has shown that minimizing the quantization error of weights is ineffective, leading to overfitting. Therefore, GPTQT employs a progressive two-step approach: initially quantizing weights using Linear quantization to a relatively high bit, followed by converting obtained int weight to lower bit binary coding. A re-explore strategy is proposed to optimize initial scaling factor. During inference, these steps are merged into pure binary coding, enabling efficient computation. Testing across various models and datasets confirms GPTQT's effectiveness. Compared to the strong 3-bit quantization baseline, GPTQT further reduces perplexity by 4.01 on opt-66B and increases speed by 1.24 times on opt-30b. The results on Llama2 show that GPTQT is currently the best binary coding quantization method for such kind of LLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present RS-Diffusion, the first Diffusion Models-based method for single-frame Rolling Shutter (RS) correction. RS artifacts compromise visual quality of frames due to the row wise exposure of CMOS sensors. Most previous methods have focused on multi-frame approaches, using temporal information from consecutive frames for the motion rectification. However, few approaches address the more challenging but important single frame RS correction. In this work, we present an ``image-to-motion'' framework via diffusion techniques, with a designed patch-attention module. In addition, we present the RS-Real dataset, comprised of captured RS frames alongside their corresponding Global Shutter (GS) ground-truth pairs. The GS frames are corrected from the RS ones, guided by the corresponding Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) gyroscope data acquired during capture. Experiments show that our RS-Diffusion surpasses previous single RS correction methods. Our method and proposed RS-Real dataset lay a solid foundation for advancing the field of RS correction.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>One persistent obstacle in industrial quality inspection is the detection of anomalies. In real-world use cases, two problems must be addressed: anomalous data is sparse and the same types of anomalies need to be detected on previously unseen objects. Current anomaly detection approaches can be trained with sparse nominal data, whereas domain generalization approaches enable detecting objects in previously unseen domains. Utilizing those two observations, we introduce the hybrid task of domain generalization on sparse classes. To introduce an accompanying dataset for this task, we present a modification of the well-established MVTec AD dataset by generating three new datasets. In addition to applying existing methods for benchmark, we design two embedding-based approaches, Spatial Embedding MLP (SEMLP) and Labeled PatchCore. Overall, SEMLP achieves the best performance with an average image-level AUROC of 87.2 % vs. 80.4 % by MIRO. The new and openly available datasets allow for further research to improve industrial anomaly detection.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Neural rendering-based urban scene reconstruction methods commonly rely on images collected from driving vehicles with cameras facing and moving forward. Although these methods can successfully synthesize from views similar to training camera trajectory, directing the novel view outside the training camera distribution does not guarantee on-par performance. In this paper, we tackle the Extrapolated View Synthesis (EVS) problem by evaluating the reconstructions on views such as looking left, right or downwards with respect to training camera distributions. To improve rendering quality for EVS, we initialize our model by constructing dense LiDAR map, and propose to leverage prior scene knowledge such as surface normal estimator and large-scale diffusion model. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on EVS. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to address the EVS problem in urban scene reconstruction.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While standard evaluation scores for generative models are mostly reference-based, a reference-dependent assessment of generative models could be generally difficult due to the unavailability of applicable reference datasets. Recently, the reference-free entropy scores, VENDI and RKE, have been proposed to evaluate the diversity of generated data. However, estimating these scores from data leads to significant computational costs for large-scale generative models. In this work, we leverage the random Fourier features framework to reduce the computational price and propose the Fourier-based Kernel Entropy Approximation (FKEA) method. We utilize FKEA's approximated eigenspectrum of the kernel matrix to efficiently estimate the mentioned entropy scores. Furthermore, we show the application of FKEA's proxy eigenvectors to reveal the method's identified modes in evaluating the diversity of produced samples. We provide a stochastic implementation of the FKEA assessment algorithm with a complexity $O(n)$ linearly growing with sample size $n$. We extensively evaluate FKEA's numerical performance in application to standard image, text, and video datasets. Our empirical results indicate the method's scalability and interpretability applied to large-scale generative models. The codebase is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the rapid advances in deep learning and smart manufacturing in Industry 4.0, there is an imperative for high-throughput, high-performance, and fully integrated visual inspection systems. Most anomaly detection approaches using defect detection datasets, such as MVTec AD, employ one-class models that require fitting separate models for each class. On the contrary, unified models eliminate the need for fitting separate models for each class and significantly reduce cost and memory requirements. Thus, in this work, we experiment with considering a unified multi-class setup. Our experimental study shows that multi-class models perform at par with one-class models for the standard MVTec AD dataset. Hence, this indicates that there may not be a need to learn separate object/class-wise models when the object classes are significantly different from each other, as is the case of the dataset considered. Furthermore, we have deployed three different unified lightweight architectures on the CPU and an edge device (NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX). We analyze the quantized multi-class anomaly detection models in terms of latency and memory requirements for deployment on the edge device while comparing quantization-aware training (QAT) and post-training quantization (PTQ) for performance at different precision widths. In addition, we explored two different methods of calibration required in post-training scenarios and show that one of them performs notably better, highlighting its importance for unsupervised tasks. Due to quantization, the performance drop in PTQ is further compensated by QAT, which yields at par performance with the original 32-bit Floating point in two of the models considered.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Guardrails have emerged as an alternative to safety alignment for content moderation of large language models (LLMs). Existing model-based guardrails have not been designed for resource-constrained computational portable devices, such as mobile phones, more and more of which are running LLM-based applications locally. We introduce LoRA-Guard, a parameter-efficient guardrail adaptation method that relies on knowledge sharing between LLMs and guardrail models. LoRA-Guard extracts language features from the LLMs and adapts them for the content moderation task using low-rank adapters, while a dual-path design prevents any performance degradation on the generative task. We show that LoRA-Guard outperforms existing approaches with 100-1000x lower parameter overhead while maintaining accuracy, enabling on-device content moderation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>What do deep neural speech models know about phonology? Existing work has examined the encoding of individual linguistic units such as phonemes in these models. Here we investigate interactions between units. Inspired by classic experiments on human speech perception, we study how Wav2Vec2 resolves phonotactic constraints. We synthesize sounds on an acoustic continuum between /l/ and /r/ and embed them in controlled contexts where only /l/, only /r/, or neither occur in English. Like humans, Wav2Vec2 models show a bias towards the phonotactically admissable category in processing such ambiguous sounds. Using simple measures to analyze model internals on the level of individual stimuli, we find that this bias emerges in early layers of the model's Transformer module. This effect is amplified by ASR finetuning but also present in fully self-supervised models. Our approach demonstrates how controlled stimulus designs can help localize specific linguistic knowledge in neural speech models.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recently, large-scale text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have emerged as a powerful tool for image-to-image translation (I2I), allowing open-domain image translation via user-provided text prompts. This paper proposes frequency-controlled diffusion model (FCDiffusion), an end-to-end diffusion-based framework that contributes a novel solution to text-guided I2I from a frequency-domain perspective. At the heart of our framework is a feature-space frequency-domain filtering module based on Discrete Cosine Transform, which filters the latent features of the source image in the DCT domain, yielding filtered image features bearing different DCT spectral bands as different control signals to the pre-trained Latent Diffusion Model. We reveal that control signals of different DCT spectral bands bridge the source image and the T2I generated image in different correlations (e.g., style, structure, layout, contour, etc.), and thus enable versatile I2I applications emphasizing different I2I correlations, including style-guided content creation, image semantic manipulation, image scene translation, and image style translation. Different from related approaches, FCDiffusion establishes a unified text-guided I2I framework suitable for diverse image translation tasks simply by switching among different frequency control branches at inference time. The effectiveness and superiority of our method for text-guided I2I are demonstrated with extensive experiments both qualitatively and quantitatively.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative modeling seeks to approximate the statistical properties of real data, enabling synthesis of new data that closely resembles the original distribution. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) represent significant advancements in generative modeling, drawing inspiration from game theory and thermodynamics, respectively. Nevertheless, the exploration of generative modeling through the lens of biological evolution remains largely untapped. In this paper, we introduce a novel family of models termed Generative Cellular Automata (GeCA), inspired by the evolution of an organism from a single cell. GeCAs are evaluated as an effective augmentation tool for retinal disease classification across two imaging modalities: Fundus and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT). In the context of OCT imaging, where data is scarce and the distribution of classes is inherently skewed, GeCA significantly boosts the performance of 11 different ophthalmological conditions, achieving a 12% increase in the average F1 score compared to conventional baselines. GeCAs outperform both diffusion methods that incorporate UNet or state-of-the art variants with transformer-based denoising models, under similar parameter constraints.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Contemporary face recognition systems use feature templates extracted from face images to identify persons. To enhance privacy, face template protection techniques are widely employed to conceal sensitive identity and appearance information stored in the template. This paper identifies an emerging privacy attack form utilizing diffusion models that could nullify prior protection, referred to as inversion attacks. The attack can synthesize high-quality, identity-preserving face images from templates, revealing persons' appearance. Based on studies of the diffusion model's generative capability, this paper proposes a defense to deteriorate the attack, by rotating templates to a noise-like distribution. This is achieved efficiently by spherically and linearly interpolating templates, or slerp, on their located hypersphere. This paper further proposes to group-wisely divide and drop out templates' feature dimensions, to enhance the irreversibility of rotated templates. The division of groups and dropouts within each group are learned in a recognition-favored way. The proposed techniques are concretized as a novel face template protection technique, SlerpFace. Extensive experiments show that SlerpFace provides satisfactory recognition accuracy and comprehensive privacy protection against inversion and other attack forms, superior to prior arts.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While synthetic tabular data generation using Deep Generative Models (DGMs) offers a compelling solution to data scarcity and privacy concerns, their effectiveness relies on substantial training data, often unavailable in real-world applications. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a novel methodology for generating realistic and reliable synthetic tabular data with DGMs in limited real-data environments. Our approach proposes several ways to generate an artificial inductive bias in a DGM through transfer learning and meta-learning techniques. We explore and compare four different methods within this framework, demonstrating that transfer learning strategies like pre-training and model averaging outperform meta-learning approaches, like Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning, and Domain Randomized Search. We validate our approach using two state-of-the-art DGMs, namely, a Variational Autoencoder and a Generative Adversarial Network, to show that our artificial inductive bias fuels superior synthetic data quality, as measured by Jensen-Shannon divergence, achieving relative gains of up to 50\% when using our proposed approach. This methodology has broad applicability in various DGMs and machine learning tasks, particularly in areas like healthcare and finance, where data scarcity is often a critical issue.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) have emerged as an innovative learning paradigm designed to address the challenge of sampling from an unnormalized probability distribution, called the reward function. This framework learns a policy on a constructed graph, which enables sampling from an approximation of the target probability distribution through successive steps of sampling from the learned policy. To achieve this, GFlowNets can be trained with various objectives, each of which can lead to the model s ultimate goal. The aspirational strength of GFlowNets lies in their potential to discern intricate patterns within the reward function and their capacity to generalize effectively to novel, unseen parts of the reward function. This paper attempts to formalize generalization in the context of GFlowNets, to link generalization with stability, and also to design experiments that assess the capacity of these models to uncover unseen parts of the reward function. The experiments will focus on length generalization meaning generalization to states that can be constructed only by longer trajectories than those seen in training.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the realm of practical Anomaly Detection (AD) tasks, manual labeling of anomalous pixels proves to be a costly endeavor. Consequently, many AD methods are crafted as one-class classifiers, tailored for training sets completely devoid of anomalies, ensuring a more cost-effective approach. While some pioneering work has demonstrated heightened AD accuracy by incorporating real anomaly samples in training, this enhancement comes at the price of labor-intensive labeling processes. This paper strikes the balance between AD accuracy and labeling expenses by introducing ADClick, a novel Interactive Image Segmentation (IIS) algorithm. ADClick efficiently generates "ground-truth" anomaly masks for real defective images, leveraging innovative residual features and meticulously crafted language prompts. Notably, ADClick showcases a significantly elevated generalization capacity compared to existing state-of-the-art IIS approaches. Functioning as an anomaly labeling tool, ADClick generates high-quality anomaly labels (AP $= 94.1\%$ on MVTec AD) based on only $3$ to $5$ manual click annotations per training image. Furthermore, we extend the capabilities of ADClick into ADClick-Seg, an enhanced model designed for anomaly detection and localization. By fine-tuning the ADClick-Seg model using the weak labels inferred by ADClick, we establish the state-of-the-art performances in supervised AD tasks (AP $= 86.4\%$ on MVTec AD and AP $= 78.4\%$, PRO $= 98.6\%$ on KSDD2).</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As diffusion models are deployed in real-world settings, data attribution is needed to ensure fair acknowledgment for contributors of high-quality training data and to identify sources of harmful content. Previous work focuses on identifying individual training samples important for the generation of a given image. However, instead of focusing on a given generated image, some use cases require understanding global properties of the distribution learned by a diffusion model (e.g., demographic diversity). Furthermore, training data for diffusion models are often contributed in groups rather than separately (e.g., multiple artworks from the same artist). Hence, here we tackle the problem of attributing global properties of diffusion models to groups of training data. Specifically, we develop a method to efficiently estimate Shapley values by leveraging model pruning and fine-tuning. We empirically demonstrate the utility of our method with three use cases: (i) global image quality for a DDPM trained on a CIFAR dataset, (ii) demographic diversity for an LDM trained on CelebA-HQ, and (iii) overall aesthetic quality for a Stable Diffusion model LoRA-finetuned on Post-Impressionist artworks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Portrait Animation aims to synthesize a lifelike video from a single source image, using it as an appearance reference, with motion (i.e., facial expressions and head pose) derived from a driving video, audio, text, or generation. Instead of following mainstream diffusion-based methods, we explore and extend the potential of the implicit-keypoint-based framework, which effectively balances computational efficiency and controllability. Building upon this, we develop a video-driven portrait animation framework named LivePortrait with a focus on better generalization, controllability, and efficiency for practical usage. To enhance the generation quality and generalization ability, we scale up the training data to about 69 million high-quality frames, adopt a mixed image-video training strategy, upgrade the network architecture, and design better motion transformation and optimization objectives. Additionally, we discover that compact implicit keypoints can effectively represent a kind of blendshapes and meticulously propose a stitching and two retargeting modules, which utilize a small MLP with negligible computational overhead, to enhance the controllability. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our framework even compared to diffusion-based methods. The generation speed remarkably reaches 12.8ms on an RTX 4090 GPU with PyTorch.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We focus on Text-to-SQL semantic parsing from the perspective of Large Language Models. Motivated by challenges related to the size of commercial database schemata and the deployability of business intelligence solutions, we propose an approach that dynamically retrieves input database information and uses abstract syntax trees to select few-shot examples for in-context learning. Furthermore, we investigate the extent to which an in-parallel semantic parser can be leveraged for generating $\textit{approximated}$ versions of the expected SQL queries, to support our retrieval. We take this approach to the extreme--we adapt a model consisting of less than $500$M parameters, to act as an extremely efficient approximator, enhancing it with the ability to process schemata in a parallelised manner. We apply our approach to monolingual and cross-lingual benchmarks for semantic parsing, showing improvements over state-of-the-art baselines. Comprehensive experiments highlight the contribution of modules involved in this retrieval-augmented generation setting, revealing interesting directions for future work.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) is one of the key components of the smart grid. It provides interactive services for managing billing and electricity consumption, but it also introduces new vectors for cyberattacks. Although, the devastating and severe impact of power overloading cyberattacks on smart grid AMI, few researches in the literature have addressed them. In the present paper, we propose a two-level anomaly detection framework based on regression decision trees. The introduced detection approach leverages the regularity and predictability of energy consumption to build reference consumption patterns for the whole neighborhood and each household within it. Using a reference consumption pattern enables detecting power overloading cyberattacks regardless of the attacker's strategy as they cause a drastic change in the consumption pattern. The continuous two-level monitoring of energy consumption load allows efficient and early detection of cyberattacks. We carried out an extensive experiment on a real-world publicly available energy consumption dataset of 500 customers in Ireland. We extracted, from the raw data, the relevant attributes for training the energy consumption patterns. The evaluation shows that our approach achieves a high detection rate, a low false alarm rate, and superior performances compared to existing solutions.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models have emerged as the de facto choice for generating visual signals. However, training a single model to predict noise across various levels poses significant challenges, necessitating numerous iterations and incurring significant computational costs. Various approaches, such as loss weighting strategy design and architectural refinements, have been introduced to expedite convergence. In this study, we propose a novel approach to design the noise schedule for enhancing the training of diffusion models. Our key insight is that the importance sampling of the logarithm of the Signal-to-Noise ratio (logSNR), theoretically equivalent to a modified noise schedule, is particularly beneficial for training efficiency when increasing the sample frequency around $\log \text{SNR}=0$. We empirically demonstrate the superiority of our noise schedule over the standard cosine schedule. Furthermore, we highlight the advantages of our noise schedule design on the ImageNet benchmark, showing that the designed schedule consistently benefits different prediction targets.</li>

          DisCo-Diff: Enhancing Continuous Diffusion Models with Discrete Latents(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models (DMs) have revolutionized generative learning. They utilize a diffusion process to encode data into a simple Gaussian distribution. However, encoding a complex, potentially multimodal data distribution into a single continuous Gaussian distribution arguably represents an unnecessarily challenging learning problem. We propose Discrete-Continuous Latent Variable Diffusion Models (DisCo-Diff) to simplify this task by introducing complementary discrete latent variables. We augment DMs with learnable discrete latents, inferred with an encoder, and train DM and encoder end-to-end. DisCo-Diff does not rely on pre-trained networks, making the framework universally applicable. The discrete latents significantly simplify learning the DM's complex noise-to-data mapping by reducing the curvature of the DM's generative ODE. An additional autoregressive transformer models the distribution of the discrete latents, a simple step because DisCo-Diff requires only few discrete variables with small codebooks. We validate DisCo-Diff on toy data, several image synthesis tasks as well as molecular docking, and find that introducing discrete latents consistently improves model performance. For example, DisCo-Diff achieves state-of-the-art FID scores on class-conditioned ImageNet-64/128 datasets with ODE sampler.</li>

          Universal Length Generalization with Turing Programs(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Length generalization refers to the ability to extrapolate from short training sequences to long test sequences and is a challenge for current large language models. While prior work has proposed some architecture or data format changes to achieve length generalization, these proposals typically apply to a limited set of tasks. Building on prior scratchpad and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques, we propose Turing Programs, a novel CoT strategy that decomposes an algorithmic task into steps mimicking the computation of a Turing Machine. This framework is both universal, as it can accommodate any algorithmic task, and simple, requiring only copying text from the context with small modifications. We show that by using Turing Programs, we obtain robust length generalization on a range of algorithmic tasks: addition, multiplication and in-context SGD. We then demonstrate that transformers achieve length generalization on random Turing Programs, suggesting that length generalization is possible for any algorithmic task. Finally, we theoretically prove that transformers can implement Turing Programs, constructing a simple RASP (Weiss et al.) program that simulates an arbitrary Turing machine.</li>
