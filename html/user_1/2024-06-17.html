<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The generalizability of machine learning (ML) models for wearable monitoring in stroke rehabilitation is often constrained by the limited scale and heterogeneity of available data. Data augmentation addresses this challenge by adding computationally derived data to real data to enrich the variability represented in the training set. Traditional augmentation methods, such as rotation, permutation, and time-warping, have shown some benefits in improving classifier performance, but often fail to produce realistic training examples. This study employs Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) to create synthetic kinematic data from a publicly available dataset, closely mimicking the experimentally measured reaching movements of stroke survivors. This approach not only captures the complex temporal dynamics and common movement patterns after stroke, but also significantly enhances the training dataset. By training deep learning models on both synthetic and experimental data, we achieved a substantial enhancement in task classification accuracy: models incorporating synthetic data attained an overall accuracy of 80.2%, significantly higher than the 63.1% seen in models trained solely with real data. These improvements allow for more precise task classification, offering clinicians the potential to monitor patient progress more accurately and tailor rehabilitation interventions more effectively.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multi-modal learning has significantly advanced generative AI, especially in vision-language modeling. Innovations like GPT-4V and open-source projects such as LLaVA have enabled robust conversational agents capable of zero-shot task completions. However, applying these technologies in the biomedical field presents unique challenges. Recent initiatives like LLaVA-Med have started to adapt instruction-tuning for biomedical contexts using large datasets such as PMC-15M. Our research offers three key contributions: (i) we present a new instruct dataset enriched with medical image-text pairs from Claude3-Opus and LLaMA3 70B, (ii) we propose a novel image encoding strategy using hierarchical representations to improve fine-grained biomedical visual comprehension, and (iii) we develop the Llama3-Med model, which achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on biomedical visual question answering benchmarks, with an average performance improvement of over 10% compared to previous methods. These advancements provide more accurate and reliable tools for medical professionals, bridging gaps in current multi-modal conversational assistants and promoting further innovations in medical AI.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>World models simulate future states of the world in response to different actions. They facilitate interactive content creation and provides a foundation for grounded, long-horizon reasoning. Current foundation models do not fully meet the capabilities of general world models: large language models (LLMs) are constrained by their reliance on language modality and their limited understanding of the physical world, while video models lack interactive action control over the world simulations. This paper makes a step towards building a general world model by introducing Pandora, a hybrid autoregressive-diffusion model that simulates world states by generating videos and allows real-time control with free-text actions. Pandora achieves domain generality, video consistency, and controllability through large-scale pretraining and instruction tuning. Crucially, Pandora bypasses the cost of training-from-scratch by integrating a pretrained LLM (7B) and a pretrained video model, requiring only additional lightweight finetuning. We illustrate extensive outputs by Pandora across diverse domains (indoor/outdoor, natural/urban, human/robot, 2D/3D, etc.). The results indicate great potential of building stronger general world models with larger-scale training.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Pretraining egocentric vision-language models has become essential to improving downstream egocentric video-text tasks. These egocentric foundation models commonly use the transformer architecture. The memory footprint of these models during pretraining can be substantial. Therefore, we pretrain SViTT-Ego, the first sparse egocentric video-text transformer model integrating edge and node sparsification. We pretrain on the EgoClip dataset and incorporate the egocentric-friendly objective EgoNCE, instead of the frequently used InfoNCE. Most notably, SViTT-Ego obtains a +2.8% gain on EgoMCQ (intra-video) accuracy compared to LAVILA large, with no additional data augmentation techniques other than standard image augmentations, yet pretrainable on memory-limited devices.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Gradient leakage has been identified as a potential source of privacy breaches in modern image processing systems, where the adversary can completely reconstruct the training images from leaked gradients. However, existing methods are restricted to reconstructing low-resolution images where data leakage risks of image processing systems are not sufficiently explored. In this paper, by exploiting diffusion models, we propose an innovative gradient-guided fine-tuning method and introduce a new reconstruction attack that is capable of stealing private, high-resolution images from image processing systems through leaked gradients where severe data leakage encounters. Our attack method is easy to implement and requires little prior knowledge. The experimental results indicate that current reconstruction attacks can steal images only up to a resolution of $128 \times 128$ pixels, while our attack method can successfully recover and steal images with resolutions up to $512 \times 512$ pixels. Our attack method significantly outperforms the SOTA attack baselines in terms of both pixel-wise accuracy and time efficiency of image reconstruction. Furthermore, our attack can render differential privacy ineffective to some extent.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, foundation model, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Grasp detection is a persistent and intricate challenge with various industrial applications. Recently, many methods and datasets have been proposed to tackle the grasp detection problem. However, most of them do not consider using natural language as a condition to detect the grasp poses. In this paper, we introduce Grasp-Anything++, a new language-driven grasp detection dataset featuring 1M samples, over 3M objects, and upwards of 10M grasping instructions. We utilize foundation models to create a large-scale scene corpus with corresponding images and grasp prompts. We approach the language-driven grasp detection task as a conditional generation problem. Drawing on the success of diffusion models in generative tasks and given that language plays a vital role in this task, we propose a new language-driven grasp detection method based on diffusion models. Our key contribution is the contrastive training objective, which explicitly contributes to the denoising process to detect the grasp pose given the language instructions. We illustrate that our approach is theoretically supportive. The intensive experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and allows real-world robotic grasping. Finally, we demonstrate our large-scale dataset enables zero-short grasp detection and is a challenging benchmark for future work. Project website: this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The fairness of AI decision-making has garnered increasing attention, leading to the proposal of numerous fairness algorithms. In this paper, we aim not to address this issue by directly introducing fair learning algorithms, but rather by generating entirely new, fair synthetic data from biased datasets for use in any downstream tasks. Additionally, the distribution of test data may differ from that of the training set, potentially impacting the performance of the generated synthetic data in downstream tasks. To address these two challenges, we propose a diffusion model-based framework, FADM: Fairness-Aware Diffusion with Meta-training. FADM introduces two types of gradient induction during the sampling phase of the diffusion model: one to ensure that the generated samples belong to the desired target categories, and another to make the sensitive attributes of the generated samples difficult to classify into any specific sensitive attribute category. To overcome data distribution shifts in the test environment, we train the diffusion model and the two classifiers used for induction within a meta-learning framework. Compared to other baselines, FADM allows for flexible control over the categories of the generated samples and exhibits superior generalization capability. Experiments on real datasets demonstrate that FADM achieves better accuracy and optimal fairness in downstream tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this work, we take the first exploration of the recently popular foundation model, i.e., State Space Model/Mamba, in image quality assessment, aiming at observing and excavating the perception potential in vision Mamba. A series of works on Mamba has shown its significant potential in various fields, e.g., segmentation and classification. However, the perception capability of Mamba has been under-explored. Consequently, we propose Q-Mamba by revisiting and adapting the Mamba model for three crucial IQA tasks, i.e., task-specific, universal, and transferable IQA, which reveals that the Mamba model has obvious advantages compared with existing foundational models, e.g., Swin Transformer, ViT, and CNNs, in terms of perception and computational cost for IQA. To increase the transferability of Q-Mamba, we propose the StylePrompt tuning paradigm, where the basic lightweight mean and variance prompts are injected to assist the task-adaptive transfer learning of pre-trained Q-Mamba for different downstream IQA tasks. Compared with existing prompt tuning strategies, our proposed StylePrompt enables better perception transfer capability with less computational cost. Extensive experiments on multiple synthetic, authentic IQA datasets, and cross IQA datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed Q-Mamba.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>To develop rigorous knowledge about ML models -- and the systems in which they are embedded -- we need reliable measurements. But reliable measurement is fundamentally challenging, and touches on issues of reproducibility, scalability, uncertainty quantification, epistemology, and more. This dissertation addresses criteria needed to take reliability seriously: both criteria for designing meaningful metrics, and for methodologies that ensure that we can dependably and efficiently measure these metrics at scale and in practice. In doing so, this dissertation articulates a research vision for a new field of scholarship at the intersection of machine learning, law, and policy. Within this frame, we cover topics that fit under three different themes: (1) quantifying and mitigating sources of arbitrariness in ML, (2) taming randomness in uncertainty estimation and optimization algorithms, in order to achieve scalability without sacrificing reliability, and (3) providing methods for evaluating generative-AI systems, with specific focuses on quantifying memorization in language models and training latent diffusion models on open-licensed data. By making contributions in these three themes, this dissertation serves as an empirical proof by example that research on reliable measurement for machine learning is intimately and inescapably bound up with research in law and policy. These different disciplines pose similar research questions about reliable measurement in machine learning. They are, in fact, two complementary sides of the same research vision, which, broadly construed, aims to construct machine-learning systems that cohere with broader societal values.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In an era of increasing privacy concerns for our online presence, we propose that the decision to appear in a piece of content should only belong to the owner of the body. Although some automatic approaches for full-body anonymization have been proposed, human-guided anonymization can adapt to various contexts, such as cultural norms, personal relations, esthetic concerns, and security issues. ''My Body My Choice'' (MBMC) enables physical and adversarial anonymization by removal and swapping approaches aimed for four tasks, designed by single or multi, ControlNet or GAN modules, combining several diffusion models. We evaluate anonymization on seven datasets; compare with SOTA inpainting and anonymization methods; evaluate by image, adversarial, and generative metrics; and conduct reidentification experiments.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This review paper provides a comprehensive overview of large language model (LLM) research directions within Indic languages. Indic languages are those spoken in the Indian subcontinent, including India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, and Bhutan, among others. These languages have a rich cultural and linguistic heritage and are spoken by over 1.5 billion people worldwide. With the tremendous market potential and growing demand for natural language processing (NLP) based applications in diverse languages, generative applications for Indic languages pose unique challenges and opportunities for research. Our paper deep dives into the recent advancements in Indic generative modeling, contributing with a taxonomy of research directions, tabulating 84 recent publications. Research directions surveyed in this paper include LLM development, fine-tuning existing LLMs, development of corpora, benchmarking and evaluation, as well as publications around specific techniques, tools, and applications. We found that researchers across the publications emphasize the challenges associated with limited data availability, lack of standardization, and the peculiar linguistic complexities of Indic languages. This work aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners working in the field of NLP, particularly those focused on Indic languages, and contributes to the development of more accurate and efficient LLM applications for these languages.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we present the $\texttt{e-COP}$ algorithm, the first policy optimization algorithm for constrained Reinforcement Learning (RL) in episodic (finite horizon) settings. Such formulations are applicable when there are separate sets of optimization criteria and constraints on a system's behavior. We approach this problem by first establishing a policy difference lemma for the episodic setting, which provides the theoretical foundation for the algorithm. Then, we propose to combine a set of established and novel solution ideas to yield the $\texttt{e-COP}$ algorithm that is easy to implement and numerically stable, and provide a theoretical guarantee on optimality under certain scaling assumptions. Through extensive empirical analysis using benchmarks in the Safety Gym suite, we show that our algorithm has similar or better performance than SoTA (non-episodic) algorithms adapted for the episodic setting. The scalability of the algorithm opens the door to its application in safety-constrained Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback for Large Language or Diffusion Models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Consistency models are promising generative models as they distill the multi-step sampling of score-based diffusion in a single forward pass of a neural network. Without access to sampling trajectories of a pre-trained diffusion model, consistency training relies on proxy trajectories built on an independent coupling between the noise and data distributions. Refining this coupling is a key area of improvement to make it more adapted to the task and reduce the resulting randomness in the training process. In this work, we introduce a novel coupling associating the input noisy data with their generated output from the consistency model itself, as a proxy to the inaccessible diffusion flow output. Our affordable approach exploits the inherent capacity of consistency models to compute the transport map in a single step. We provide intuition and empirical evidence of the relevance of our generator-induced coupling (GC), which brings consistency training closer to score distillation. Consequently, our method not only accelerates consistency training convergence by significant amounts but also enhances the resulting performance. The code is available at: this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) is at the core of fine-tuning methods for generative AI models for language and images. Such feedback is often sought as rank or preference feedback from human raters, as opposed to eliciting scores since the latter tends to be very noisy. On the other hand, RL theory and algorithms predominantly assume that a reward feedback is available. In particular, approaches for online learning that can be helpful in adaptive data collection via active learning cannot incorporate offline preference data. In this paper, we adopt a finite-armed linear bandit model as a prototypical model of online learning. We consider an offline preference dataset to be available generated by an expert of unknown 'competence'. We propose $\texttt{warmPref-PS}$, a posterior sampling algorithm for online learning that can be warm-started with an offline dataset with noisy preference feedback. We show that by modeling the competence of the expert that generated it, we are able to use such a dataset most effectively. We support our claims with novel theoretical analysis of its Bayesian regret, as well as extensive empirical evaluation of an approximate algorithm which performs substantially better (almost 25 to 50% regret reduction in our studies) as compared to baselines.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The impressive achievements of generative models in creating high-quality videos have raised concerns about digital integrity and privacy vulnerabilities. Recent works to combat Deepfakes videos have developed detectors that are highly accurate at identifying GAN-generated samples. However, the robustness of these detectors on diffusion-generated videos generated from video creation tools (e.g., SORA by OpenAI, Runway Gen-2, and Pika, etc.) is still unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for detecting videos synthesized from multiple state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models, such as Stable Video Diffusion. We find that the SOTA methods for detecting diffusion-generated images lack robustness in identifying diffusion-generated videos. Our analysis reveals that the effectiveness of these detectors diminishes when applied to out-of-domain videos, primarily because they struggle to track the temporal features and dynamic variations between frames. To address the above-mentioned challenge, we collect a new benchmark video dataset for diffusion-generated videos using SOTA video creation tools. We extract representation within explicit knowledge from the diffusion model for video frames and train our detector with a CNN + LSTM architecture. The evaluation shows that our framework can well capture the temporal features between frames, achieves 93.7% detection accuracy for in-domain videos, and improves the accuracy of out-domain videos by up to 16 points.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>A vision model with general-purpose object-level 3D understanding should be capable of inferring both 2D (e.g., class name and bounding box) and 3D information (e.g., 3D location and 3D viewpoint) for arbitrary rigid objects in natural images. This is a challenging task, as it involves inferring 3D information from 2D signals and most importantly, generalizing to rigid objects from unseen categories. However, existing datasets with object-level 3D annotations are often limited by the number of categories or the quality of annotations. Models developed on these datasets become specialists for certain categories or domains, and fail to generalize. In this work, we present ImageNet3D, a large dataset for general-purpose object-level 3D understanding. ImageNet3D augments 200 categories from the ImageNet dataset with 2D bounding box, 3D pose, 3D location annotations, and image captions interleaved with 3D information. With the new annotations available in ImageNet3D, we could (i) analyze the object-level 3D awareness of visual foundation models, and (ii) study and develop general-purpose models that infer both 2D and 3D information for arbitrary rigid objects in natural images, and (iii) integrate unified 3D models with large language models for 3D-related reasoning.. We consider two new tasks, probing of object-level 3D awareness and open vocabulary pose estimation, besides standard classification and pose estimation. Experimental results on ImageNet3D demonstrate the potential of our dataset in building vision models with stronger general-purpose object-level 3D understanding.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generic Face Image Quality Assessment (GFIQA) evaluates the perceptual quality of facial images, which is crucial in improving image restoration algorithms and selecting high-quality face images for downstream tasks. We present a novel transformer-based method for GFIQA, which is aided by two unique mechanisms. First, a Dual-Set Degradation Representation Learning (DSL) mechanism uses facial images with both synthetic and real degradations to decouple degradation from content, ensuring generalizability to real-world scenarios. This self-supervised method learns degradation features on a global scale, providing a robust alternative to conventional methods that use local patch information in degradation learning. Second, our transformer leverages facial landmarks to emphasize visually salient parts of a face image in evaluating its perceptual quality. We also introduce a balanced and diverse Comprehensive Generic Face IQA (CGFIQA-40k) dataset of 40K images carefully designed to overcome the biases, in particular the imbalances in skin tone and gender representation, in existing datasets. Extensive analysis and evaluation demonstrate the robustness of our method, marking a significant improvement over prior methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised, foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In recent years, the upstream of Large Language Models (LLM) has also encouraged the computer vision community to work on substantial multimodal datasets and train models on a scale in a self-/semi-supervised manner, resulting in Vision Foundation Models (VFM), as, e.g., Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP). The models generalize well and perform outstandingly on everyday objects or scenes, even on downstream tasks, tasks the model has not been trained on, while the application in specialized domains, as in an industrial context, is still an open research question. Here, fine-tuning the models or transfer learning on domain-specific data is unavoidable when objecting to adequate performance. In this work, we, on the one hand, introduce a pipeline to generate the Industrial Language-Image Dataset (ILID) based on web-crawled data; on the other hand, we demonstrate effective self-supervised transfer learning and discussing downstream tasks after training on the cheaply acquired ILID, which does not necessitate human labeling or intervention. With the proposed approach, we contribute by transferring approaches from state-of-the-art research around foundation models, transfer learning strategies, and applications to the industrial domain.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vector fields are widely used to represent and model flows for many science and engineering applications. This paper introduces a novel neural network architecture for learning tangent vector fields that are intrinsically defined on manifold surfaces embedded in 3D. Previous approaches to learning vector fields on surfaces treat vectors as multi-dimensional scalar fields, using traditional scalar-valued architectures to process channels individually, thus fail to preserve fundamental intrinsic properties of the vector field. The core idea of this work is to introduce a trainable vector heat diffusion module to spatially propagate vector-valued feature data across the surface, which we incorporate into our proposed architecture that consists of vector-valued neurons. Our architecture is invariant to rigid motion of the input, isometric deformation, and choice of local tangent bases, and is robust to discretizations of the surface. We evaluate our Vector Heat Network on triangle meshes, and empirically validate its invariant properties. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on the useful industrial application of quadrilateral mesh generation.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We develop Scalable Latent Exploration Score (ScaLES) to mitigate over-exploration in Latent Space Optimization (LSO), a popular method for solving black-box discrete optimization problems. LSO utilizes continuous optimization within the latent space of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and is known to be susceptible to over-exploration, which manifests in unrealistic solutions that reduce its practicality. ScaLES is an exact and theoretically motivated method leveraging the trained decoder's approximation of the data distribution. ScaLES can be calculated with any existing decoder, e.g. from a VAE, without additional training, architectural changes, or access to the training data. Our evaluation across five LSO benchmark tasks and three VAE architectures demonstrates that ScaLES enhances the quality of the solutions while maintaining high objective values, leading to improvements over existing solutions. We believe that new avenues to LSO will be opened by ScaLES ability to identify out of distribution areas, differentiability, and computational tractability. Open source code for ScaLES is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Thanks to their remarkable denoising capabilities, diffusion models are increasingly being employed as defensive tools to reinforce the security of other models, notably in purifying adversarial examples and certifying adversarial robustness. However, the security risks of these practices themselves remain largely unexplored, which is highly concerning. To bridge this gap, this work investigates the vulnerabilities of security-enhancing diffusion models. Specifically, we demonstrate that these models are highly susceptible to DIFF2, a simple yet effective backdoor attack, which substantially diminishes the security assurance provided by such models. Essentially, DIFF2 achieves this by integrating a malicious diffusion-sampling process into the diffusion model, guiding inputs embedded with specific triggers toward an adversary-defined distribution while preserving the normal functionality for clean inputs. Our case studies on adversarial purification and robustness certification show that DIFF2 can significantly reduce both post-purification and certified accuracy across benchmark datasets and models, highlighting the potential risks of relying on pre-trained diffusion models as defensive tools. We further explore possible countermeasures, suggesting promising avenues for future research.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Fine-grained urban flow inference (FUFI) is a crucial transportation service aimed at improving traffic efficiency and safety. FUFI can infer fine-grained urban traffic flows based solely on observed coarse-grained data. However, most of existing methods focus on the influence of single-scale static geographic information on FUFI, neglecting the interactions and dynamic information between different-scale regions within the city. Different-scale geographical features can capture redundant information from the same spatial areas. In order to effectively learn multi-scale information across time and space, we propose an effective fine-grained urban flow inference model called UrbanMSR, which uses self-supervised contrastive learning to obtain dynamic multi-scale representations of neighborhood-level and city-level geographic information, and fuses multi-scale representations to improve fine-grained accuracy. The fusion of multi-scale representations enhances fine-grained. We validate the performance through extensive experiments on three real-world datasets. The resutls compared with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, self-supervised, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose a novel method for learning representations of poses for 3D deformable objects, which specializes in 1) disentangling pose information from the object's identity, 2) facilitating the learning of pose variations, and 3) transferring pose information to other object identities. Based on these properties, our method enables the generation of 3D deformable objects with diversity in both identities and poses, using variations of a single object. It does not require explicit shape parameterization such as skeletons or joints, point-level or shape-level correspondence supervision, or variations of the target object for pose transfer. To achieve pose disentanglement, compactness for generative models, and transferability, we first design the pose extractor to represent the pose as a keypoint-based hybrid representation and the pose applier to learn an implicit deformation field. To better distill pose information from the object's geometry, we propose the implicit pose applier to output an intrinsic mesh property, the face Jacobian. Once the extracted pose information is transferred to the target object, the pose applier is fine-tuned in a self-supervised manner to better describe the target object's shapes with pose variations. The extracted poses are also used to train a cascaded diffusion model to enable the generation of novel poses. Our experiments with the DeformThings4D and Human datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in pose transfer and the ability to generate diverse deformed shapes with various objects and poses.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Conditional visual generation has witnessed remarkable progress with the advent of diffusion models (DMs), especially in tasks like control-to-image generation. However, challenges such as expensive computational cost, high inference latency, and difficulties of integration with large language models (LLMs) have necessitated exploring alternatives to DMs. This paper introduces ControlVAR, a novel framework that explores pixel-level controls in visual autoregressive (VAR) modeling for flexible and efficient conditional generation. In contrast to traditional conditional models that learn the conditional distribution, ControlVAR jointly models the distribution of image and pixel-level conditions during training and imposes conditional controls during testing. To enhance the joint modeling, we adopt the next-scale AR prediction paradigm and unify control and image representations. A teacher-forcing guidance strategy is proposed to further facilitate controllable generation with joint modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior efficacy and flexibility of ControlVAR across various conditional generation tasks against popular conditional DMs, \eg, ControlNet and T2I-Adaptor.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models have recently been shown to excel in many image reconstruction tasks that involve inverse problems based on a forward measurement operator. A common framework uses task-agnostic unconditional models that are later post-conditioned for reconstruction, an approach that typically suffers from suboptimal task performance. While task-specific conditional models have also been proposed, current methods heuristically inject measured data as a naive input channel that elicits sampling inaccuracies. Here, we address the optimal conditioning of diffusion models for solving challenging inverse problems that arise during image reconstruction. Specifically, we propose a novel Bayesian conditioning technique for diffusion models, BCDM, based on score-functions associated with the conditional distribution of desired images given measured data. We rigorously derive the theory to express and train the conditional score-function. Finally, we show state-of-the-art performance in image dealiasing, deblurring, super-resolution, and inpainting with the proposed technique.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Unsupervised monocular depth estimation has received widespread attention because of its capability to train without ground truth. In real-world scenarios, the images may be blurry or noisy due to the influence of weather conditions and inherent limitations of the camera. Therefore, it is particularly important to develop a robust depth estimation model. Benefiting from the training strategies of generative networks, generative-based methods often exhibit enhanced robustness. In light of this, we employ a well-converging diffusion model among generative networks for unsupervised monocular depth estimation. Additionally, we propose a hierarchical feature-guided denoising module. This model significantly enriches the model's capacity for learning and interpreting depth distribution by fully leveraging image features to guide the denoising process. Furthermore, we explore the implicit depth within reprojection and design an implicit depth consistency loss. This loss function serves to enhance the performance of the model and ensure the scale consistency of depth within a video sequence. We conduct experiments on the KITTI, Make3D, and our self-collected SIMIT datasets. The results indicate that our approach stands out among generative-based models, while also showcasing remarkable robustness.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid propagation of misinformation poses substantial risks to public interest. To combat misinformation, large language models (LLMs) are adapted to automatically verify claim credibility. Nevertheless, existing methods heavily rely on the embedded knowledge within LLMs and / or black-box APIs for evidence collection, leading to subpar performance with smaller LLMs or upon unreliable context. In this paper, we propose retrieval augmented fact verification through the synthesis of contrasting arguments (RAFTS). Upon input claims, RAFTS starts with evidence retrieval, where we design a retrieval pipeline to collect and re-rank relevant documents from verifiable sources. Then, RAFTS forms contrastive arguments (i.e., supporting or refuting) conditioned on the retrieved evidence. In addition, RAFTS leverages an embedding model to identify informative demonstrations, followed by in-context prompting to generate the prediction and explanation. Our method effectively retrieves relevant documents as evidence and evaluates arguments from varying perspectives, incorporating nuanced information for fine-grained decision-making. Combined with informative in-context examples as prior, RAFTS achieves significant improvements to supervised and LLM baselines without complex prompts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments, where RAFTS can outperform GPT-based methods with a significantly smaller 7B LLM.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The detection of abnormal or critical system states is essential in condition monitoring. While much attention is given to promptly identifying anomalies, a retrospective analysis of these anomalies can significantly enhance our comprehension of the underlying causes of observed undesired behavior. This aspect becomes particularly critical when the monitored system is deployed in a vital environment. In this study, we delve into anomalies within the domain of Bio-Regenerative Life Support Systems (BLSS) for space exploration and analyze anomalies found in telemetry data stemming from the EDEN ISS space greenhouse in Antarctica. We employ time series clustering on anomaly detection results to categorize various types of anomalies in both uni- and multivariate settings. We then assess the effectiveness of these methods in identifying systematic anomalous behavior. Additionally, we illustrate that the anomaly detection methods MDI and DAMP produce complementary results, as previously indicated by research.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Foundational models (FMs), pretrained on extensive datasets using self-supervised techniques, are capable of learning generalized patterns from large amounts of data. This reduces the need for extensive labeled datasets for each new task, saving both time and resources by leveraging the broad knowledge base established during pretraining. Most research on FMs has primarily focused on unstructured data, such as text and images, or semi-structured data, like time-series. However, there has been limited attention to structured data, such as tabular data, which, despite its prevalence, remains under-studied due to a lack of clean datasets and insufficient research on the transferability of FMs for various tabular data tasks. In response to this gap, we introduce a framework called TabularFM (\url{this https URL}), which incorporates state-of-the-art methods for developing FMs specifically for tabular data. This includes variations of neural architectures such as GANs, VAEs, and Transformers. We have curated a million of tabular datasets and released cleaned versions to facilitate the development of tabular FMs. We pretrained FMs on this curated data, benchmarked various learning methods on these datasets, and released the pretrained models along with leaderboards for future comparative studies. Our fully open-sourced system provides a comprehensive analysis of the transferability of tabular FMs. By releasing these datasets, pretrained models, and leaderboards, we aim to enhance the validity and usability of tabular FMs in the near future.</li>

This pipeline is capable of producing high-quality assets with a total generation time of under 30 minutes using only a single RTX 3090 GPU. Our proposed method employs a Multi-view Diffusion Model, MVDream, to generate Gaussian Splats as a prior, followed by refining geometry and texture using StableDiffusion. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly mitigates the Multi-face Janus problem and achieves the highest average user preference ranking compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Achieving robust generalization across diverse data domains remains a significant challenge in computer vision. This challenge is important in safety-critical applications, where deep-neural-network-based systems must perform reliably under various environmental conditions not seen during training. Our study investigates whether the generalization capabilities of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) methods for the semantic segmentation task are complementary. Results show that combining VFMs with UDA has two main benefits: (a) it allows for better UDA performance while maintaining the out-of-distribution performance of VFMs, and (b) it makes certain time-consuming UDA components redundant, thus enabling significant inference speedups. Specifically, with equivalent model sizes, the resulting VFM-UDA method achieves an 8.4$\times$ speed increase over the prior non-VFM state of the art, while also improving performance by +1.2 mIoU in the UDA setting and by +6.1 mIoU in terms of out-of-distribution generalization. Moreover, when we use a VFM with 3.6$\times$ more parameters, the VFM-UDA approach maintains a 3.3$\times$ speed up, while improving the UDA performance by +3.1 mIoU and the out-of-distribution performance by +10.3 mIoU. These results underscore the significant benefits of combining VFMs with UDA, setting new standards and baselines for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation in semantic segmentation.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce Nymeria - a large-scale, diverse, richly annotated human motion dataset collected in the wild with multiple multimodal egocentric devices. The dataset comes with a) full-body 3D motion ground truth; b) egocentric multimodal recordings from Project Aria devices with RGB, grayscale, eye-tracking cameras, IMUs, magnetometer, barometer, and microphones; and c) an additional "observer" device providing a third-person viewpoint. We compute world-aligned 6DoF transformations for all sensors, across devices and capture sessions. The dataset also provides 3D scene point clouds and calibrated gaze estimation. We derive a protocol to annotate hierarchical language descriptions of in-context human motion, from fine-grain pose narrations, to atomic actions and activity summarization. To the best of our knowledge, the Nymeria dataset is the world largest in-the-wild collection of human motion with natural and diverse activities; first of its kind to provide synchronized and localized multi-device multimodal egocentric data; and the world largest dataset with motion-language descriptions. It contains 1200 recordings of 300 hours of daily activities from 264 participants across 50 locations, travelling a total of 399Km. The motion-language descriptions provide 310.5K sentences in 8.64M words from a vocabulary size of 6545. To demonstrate the potential of the dataset we define key research tasks for egocentric body tracking, motion synthesis, and action recognition and evaluate several state-of-the-art baseline algorithms. Data and code will be open-sourced.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Computer-aided design (CAD) tools are utilized in the manufacturing industry for modeling everything from cups to spacecraft. These programs are complex to use and typically require years of training and experience to master. Structured and well-constrained 2D sketches and 3D constructions are crucial components of CAD modeling. A well-executed CAD model can be seamlessly integrated into the manufacturing process, thereby enhancing production efficiency. Deep generative models of 3D shapes and 3D object reconstruction models has garnered significant research interest. However, most of these models are represented in discrete forms. Moreover, the few models based on CAD operations often have substantial input restrictions. In this work, we fine-tuned pre-trained models to create OpenECAD (0.55B, 0.89B, and 4.2B), leveraging the visual, logical, coding, and general capabilities of visual language models. OpenECAD can process images of 3D designs as input and generate highly structured 2D sketches and 3D construction commands. These outputs can be directly used with existing CAD tools' APIs to generate project files. To train our network, we created a new CAD dataset. This dataset is based on existing public CAD datasets, with adjustments and augmentations to meet the requirements of ~VLM training.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We consider the problem of \textit{true} open-world semi-supervised node classification, in which nodes in a graph either belong to known or new classes, with the latter not present during training. Existing methods detect and reject new classes but fail to distinguish between different new classes. We adapt existing methods and show they do not solve the problem sufficiently. We introduce a novel end-to-end approach for classification into known classes and new classes based on class prototypes, which we call Prototypical Open-World Learning for Node Classification (POWN). Our method combines graph semi-supervised learning, self-supervised learning, and pseudo-labeling to learn prototype representations of new classes in a zero-shot way. In contrast to existing solutions from the vision domain, POWN does not require data augmentation techniques for node classification. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of POWN, where it outperforms baselines by up to $20\%$ accuracy on the small and up to $30\%$ on the large datasets.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Instruction-based image editing has made a great process in using natural human language to manipulate the visual content of images. However, existing models are limited by the quality of the dataset and cannot accurately localize editing regions in images with complex object relationships. In this paper, we propose Reinforcement Learning Guided Image Editing Method(InstructRL4Pix) to train a diffusion model to generate images that are guided by the attention maps of the target object. Our method maximizes the output of the reward model by calculating the distance between attention maps as a reward function and fine-tuning the diffusion model using proximal policy optimization (PPO). We evaluate our model in object insertion, removal, replacement, and transformation. Experimental results show that InstructRL4Pix breaks through the limitations of traditional datasets and uses unsupervised learning to optimize editing goals and achieve accurate image editing based on natural human commands.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Real-time bioaerosol monitoring is improving the quality of life for people affected by allergies, but it often relies on deep-learning models which pose challenges for widespread adoption. These models are typically trained in a supervised fashion and require considerable effort to produce large amounts of annotated data, an effort that must be repeated for new particles, geographical regions, or measurement systems. In this work, we show that self-supervised learning and few-shot learning can be combined to classify holographic images of bioaerosol particles using a large collection of unlabelled data and only a few examples for each particle type. We first demonstrate that self-supervision on pictures of unidentified particles from ambient air measurements enhances identification even when labelled data is abundant. Most importantly, it greatly improves few-shot classification when only a handful of labelled images are available. Our findings suggest that real-time bioaerosol monitoring workflows can be substantially optimized, and the effort required to adapt models for different situations considerably reduced.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Learning representations of well-trained neural network models holds the promise to provide an understanding of the inner workings of those models. However, previous work has either faced limitations when processing larger networks or was task-specific to either discriminative or generative tasks. This paper introduces the SANE approach to weight-space learning. SANE overcomes previous limitations by learning task-agnostic representations of neural networks that are scalable to larger models of varying architectures and that show capabilities beyond a single task. Our method extends the idea of hyper-representations towards sequential processing of subsets of neural network weights, thus allowing one to embed larger neural networks as a set of tokens into the learned representation space. SANE reveals global model information from layer-wise embeddings, and it can sequentially generate unseen neural network models, which was unattainable with previous hyper-representation learning methods. Extensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that SANE matches or exceeds state-of-the-art performance on several weight representation learning benchmarks, particularly in initialization for new tasks and larger ResNet architectures.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the evolving landscape of text-to-3D technology, Dreamfusion has showcased its proficiency by utilizing Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) to optimize implicit representations such as NeRF. This process is achieved through the distillation of pretrained large-scale text-to-image diffusion models. However, Dreamfusion encounters fidelity and efficiency constraints: it faces the multi-head Janus issue and exhibits a relatively slow optimization process. To circumvent these challenges, we introduce OrientDream, a camera orientation conditioned framework designed for efficient and multi-view consistent 3D generation from textual prompts. Our strategy emphasizes the implementation of an explicit camera orientation conditioned feature in the pre-training of a 2D text-to-image diffusion module. This feature effectively utilizes data from MVImgNet, an extensive external multi-view dataset, to refine and bolster its functionality. Subsequently, we utilize the pre-conditioned 2D images as a basis for optimizing a randomly initialized implicit representation (NeRF). This process is significantly expedited by a decoupled back-propagation technique, allowing for multiple updates of implicit parameters per optimization cycle. Our experiments reveal that our method not only produces high-quality NeRF models with consistent multi-view properties but also achieves an optimization speed significantly greater than existing methods, as quantified by comparative metrics.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The increasing size of neural networks has led to a growing demand for methods of efficient fine-tuning. Recently, an orthogonal fine-tuning paradigm was introduced that uses orthogonal matrices for adapting the weights of a pretrained model. In this paper, we introduce a new class of structured matrices, which unifies and generalizes structured classes from previous works. We examine properties of this class and build a structured orthogonal parametrization upon it. We then use this parametrization to modify the orthogonal fine-tuning framework, improving parameter and computational efficiency. We empirically validate our method on different domains, including adapting of text-to-image diffusion models and downstream task fine-tuning in language modeling. Additionally, we adapt our construction for orthogonal convolutions and conduct experiments with 1-Lipschitz neural networks.</li>

However, important challenges remain in the transparency, compactness, and meaningfulness of the explanations provided by these models. This work demonstrates how frozen pre-trained ViT backbones can be effectively turned into prototypical models for both general and domain-specific tasks, in our case biomedical image classifiers. By leveraging strong spatial features combined with a novel prototypical head, ProtoS-ViT surpasses existing prototypical models showing strong performance in terms of accuracy, compactness, and explainability. Model explainability is evaluated through an extensive set of quantitative and qualitative metrics which serve as a general benchmark for the development of prototypical models.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The growing availability of well-organized Electronic Health Records (EHR) data has enabled the development of various machine learning models towards disease risk prediction. However, existing risk prediction methods overlook the heterogeneity of complex diseases, failing to model the potential disease subtypes regarding their corresponding patient visits and clinical concept subgroups. In this work, we introduce TACCO, a novel framework that jointly discovers clusters of clinical concepts and patient visits based on a hypergraph modeling of EHR data. Specifically, we develop a novel self-supervised co-clustering framework that can be guided by the risk prediction task of specific diseases. Furthermore, we enhance the hypergraph model of EHR data with textual embeddings and enforce the alignment between the clusters of clinical concepts and patient visits through a contrastive objective. Comprehensive experiments conducted on the public MIMIC-III dataset and Emory internal CRADLE dataset over the downstream clinical tasks of phenotype classification and cardiovascular risk prediction demonstrate an average 31.25% performance improvement compared to traditional ML baselines and a 5.26% improvement on top of the vanilla hypergraph model without our co-clustering mechanism. In-depth model analysis, clustering results analysis, and clinical case studies further validate the improved utilities and insightful interpretations delivered by TACCO.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present DurLAR, a high-fidelity 128-channel 3D LiDAR dataset with panoramic ambient (near infrared) and reflectivity imagery, as well as a sample benchmark task using depth estimation for autonomous driving applications. Our driving platform is equipped with a high resolution 128 channel LiDAR, a 2MPix stereo camera, a lux meter and a GNSS/INS system. Ambient and reflectivity images are made available along with the LiDAR point clouds to facilitate multi-modal use of concurrent ambient and reflectivity scene information. Leveraging DurLAR, with a resolution exceeding that of prior benchmarks, we consider the task of monocular depth estimation and use this increased availability of higher resolution, yet sparse ground truth scene depth information to propose a novel joint supervised/self-supervised loss formulation. We compare performance over both our new DurLAR dataset, the established KITTI benchmark and the Cityscapes dataset. Our evaluation shows our joint use supervised and self-supervised loss terms, enabled via the superior ground truth resolution and availability within DurLAR improves the quantitative and qualitative performance of leading contemporary monocular depth estimation approaches (RMSE=3.639, Sq Rel=0.936).</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Video understanding is a pivotal task in the digital era, yet the dynamic and multievent nature of videos makes them labor-intensive and computationally demanding to process. Thus, localizing a specific event given a semantic query has gained importance in both user-oriented applications like video search and academic research into video foundation models. A significant limitation in current research is that semantic queries are typically in natural language that depicts the semantics of the target event. This setting overlooks the potential for multimodal semantic queries composed of images and texts. To address this gap, we introduce a new benchmark, ICQ, for localizing events in videos with multimodal queries, along with a new evaluation dataset ICQ-Highlight. Our new benchmark aims to evaluate how well models can localize an event given a multimodal semantic query that consists of a reference image, which depicts the event, and a refinement text to adjust the images' semantics. To systematically benchmark model performance, we include 4 styles of reference images and 5 types of refinement texts, allowing us to explore model performance across different domains. We propose 3 adaptation methods that tailor existing models to our new setting and evaluate 10 SOTA models, ranging from specialized to large-scale foundation models. We believe this benchmark is an initial step toward investigating multimodal queries in video event localization.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The Spoken Language Understanding Evaluation (SLUE) suite of benchmark tasks was recently introduced to address the need for open resources and benchmarking of complex spoken language understanding (SLU) tasks, including both classification and sequence generation tasks, on natural speech. The benchmark has demonstrated preliminary success in using pre-trained speech foundation models (SFM) for these SLU tasks. However, the community still lacks a fine-grained understanding of the comparative utility of different SFMs. Inspired by this, we ask: which SFMs offer the most benefits for these complex SLU tasks, and what is the most effective approach for incorporating these SFMs? To answer this, we perform an extensive evaluation of multiple supervised and self-supervised SFMs using several evaluation protocols: (i) frozen SFMs with a lightweight prediction head, (ii) frozen SFMs with a complex prediction head, and (iii) fine-tuned SFMs with a lightweight prediction head. Although the supervised SFMs are pre-trained on much more speech recognition data (with labels), they do not always outperform self-supervised SFMs; the latter tend to perform at least as well as, and sometimes better than, supervised SFMs, especially on the sequence generation tasks in SLUE. While there is no universally optimal way of incorporating SFMs, the complex prediction head gives the best performance for most tasks, although it increases the inference time. We also introduce an open-source toolkit and performance leaderboard, SLUE-PERB, for these tasks and modeling strategies.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Nowcasting leverages real-time atmospheric conditions to forecast weather over short periods. State-of-the-art models, including PySTEPS, encounter difficulties in accurately forecasting extreme weather events because of their unpredictable distribution patterns. In this study, we design a physics-informed neural network to perform precipitation nowcasting using the precipitation and meteorological data from the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI). This model draws inspiration from the novel Physics-Informed Discriminator GAN (PID-GAN) formulation, directly integrating physics-based supervision within the adversarial learning framework. The proposed model adopts a GAN structure, featuring a Vector Quantization Generative Adversarial Network (VQ-GAN) and a Transformer as the generator, with a temporal discriminator serving as the discriminator. Our findings demonstrate that the PID-GAN model outperforms numerical and SOTA deep generative models in terms of precipitation nowcasting downstream metrics.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Achieving high-resolution novel view synthesis (HRNVS) from low-resolution input views is a challenging task due to the lack of high-resolution data. Previous methods optimize high-resolution Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) from low-resolution input views but suffer from slow rendering speed. In this work, we base our method on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) due to its capability of producing high-quality images at a faster rendering speed. To alleviate the shortage of data for higher-resolution synthesis, we propose to leverage off-the-shelf 2D diffusion priors by distilling the 2D knowledge into 3D with Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). Nevertheless, applying SDS directly to Gaussian-based 3D super-resolution leads to undesirable and redundant 3D Gaussian primitives, due to the randomness brought by generative priors. To mitigate this issue, we introduce two simple yet effective techniques to reduce stochastic disturbances introduced by SDS. Specifically, we 1) shrink the range of diffusion timestep in SDS with an annealing strategy; 2) randomly discard redundant Gaussian primitives during densification. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our proposed GaussainSR can attain high-quality results for HRNVS with only low-resolution inputs on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>State-of-the-art 3D object detectors are often trained on massive labeled datasets. However, annotating 3D bounding boxes remains prohibitively expensive and time-consuming, particularly for LiDAR. Instead, recent works demonstrate that self-supervised pre-training with unlabeled data can improve detection accuracy with limited labels. Contemporary methods adapt best-practices for self-supervised learning from the image domain to point clouds (such as contrastive learning). However, publicly available 3D datasets are considerably smaller and less diverse than those used for image-based self-supervised learning, limiting their effectiveness. We do note, however, that such data is naturally collected in a multimodal fashion, often paired with images. Rather than pre-training with only self-supervised objectives, we argue that it is better to bootstrap point cloud representations using image-based foundation models trained on internet-scale image data. Specifically, we propose a shelf-supervised approach (e.g. supervised with off-the-shelf image foundation models) for generating zero-shot 3D bounding boxes from paired RGB and LiDAR data. Pre-training 3D detectors with such pseudo-labels yields significantly better semi-supervised detection accuracy than prior self-supervised pretext tasks. Importantly, we show that image-based shelf-supervision is helpful for training LiDAR-only and multi-modal (RGB + LiDAR) detectors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on nuScenes and WOD, significantly improving over prior work in limited data settings.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose a training-free and robust solution to offer camera movement control for off-the-shelf video diffusion models. Unlike previous work, our method does not require any supervised finetuning on camera-annotated datasets or self-supervised training via data augmentation. Instead, it can be plugged and played with most pretrained video diffusion models and generate camera controllable videos with a single image or text prompt as input. The inspiration of our work comes from the layout prior that intermediate latents hold towards generated results, thus rearranging noisy pixels in them will make output content reallocated as well. As camera move could also be seen as a kind of pixel rearrangement caused by perspective change, videos could be reorganized following specific camera motion if their noisy latents change accordingly. Established on this, we propose our method CamTrol, which enables robust camera control for video diffusion models. It is achieved by a two-stage process. First, we model image layout rearrangement through explicit camera movement in 3D point cloud space. Second, we generate videos with camera motion using layout prior of noisy latents formed by a series of rearranged images. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the robustness our method holds in controlling camera motion of generated videos. Furthermore, we show that our method can produce impressive results in generating 3D rotation videos with dynamic content. Project page at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In recent years, the input context sizes of large language models (LLMs) have increased dramatically. However, existing evaluation methods have not kept pace, failing to comprehensively assess the efficiency of models in handling long contexts. To bridge this gap, we introduce the BABILong benchmark, designed to test language models' ability to reason across facts distributed in extremely long documents. BABILong includes a diverse set of 20 reasoning tasks, including fact chaining, simple induction, deduction, counting, and handling lists/sets. These tasks are challenging on their own, and even more demanding when the required facts are scattered across long natural text. Our evaluations show that popular LLMs effectively utilize only 10-20\% of the context and their performance declines sharply with increased reasoning complexity. Among alternatives to in-context reasoning, Retrieval-Augmented Generation methods achieve a modest 60\% accuracy on single-fact question answering, independent of context length. Among context extension methods, the highest performance is demonstrated by recurrent memory transformers, enabling the processing of lengths up to 11 million tokens.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep learning-based brain tumor segmentation (BTS) models for multi-modal MRI images have seen significant advancements in recent years. However, a common problem in practice is the unavailability of some modalities due to varying scanning protocols and patient conditions, making segmentation from incomplete MRI modalities a challenging issue. Previous methods have attempted to address this by fusing accessible multi-modal features, leveraging attention mechanisms, and synthesizing missing modalities using generative models. However, these methods ignore the intrinsic problems of medical image segmentation, such as the limited availability of training samples, particularly for cases with tumors. Furthermore, these methods require training and deploying a specific model for each subset of missing modalities. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach that enhances the BTS model from two perspectives. Firstly, we introduce a pre-training stage that generates a diverse pre-training dataset covering a wide range of different combinations of tumor shapes and brain anatomy. Secondly, we propose a post-training stage that enables the model to reconstruct missing modalities in the prediction results when only partial modalities are available. To achieve the pre-training stage, we conceptually decouple the MRI image into two parts: `anatomy' and `tumor'. We pre-train the BTS model using synthesized data generated from the anatomy and tumor parts across different training samples. ... Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves the performance over the baseline and achieves new state-of-the-art results on three brain tumor segmentation datasets: BRATS2020, BRATS2018, and BRATS2015.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text-to-image generation from large generative models like Stable Diffusion, DALLE-2, etc., have become a common base for various tasks due to their superior quality and extensive knowledge bases. As image composition and generation are creative processes the artists need control over various parts of the images being generated. We find that just adding details about parts in the base text prompt either leads to an entirely different image (e.g., missing/incorrect identity) or the extra part details simply being ignored. To mitigate these issues, we introduce PartCraft, which enables image generation based on fine-grained part-level details specified for objects in the base text prompt. This allows more control for artists and enables novel object compositions by combining distinctive object parts. PartCraft first localizes object parts by denoising the object region from a specific diffusion process. This enables each part token to be localized to the right object region. After obtaining part masks, we run a localized diffusion process in each of the part regions based on fine-grained part descriptions and combine them to produce the final image. All the stages of PartCraft are based on repurposing a pre-trained diffusion model, which enables it to generalize across various domains without training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of part-level control provided by PartCraft qualitatively through visual examples and quantitatively in comparison to the contemporary baselines.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Polyps are early cancer indicators, so assessing occurrences of polyps and their removal is critical. They are observed through a colonoscopy screening procedure that generates a stream of video frames. Segmenting polyps in their natural video screening procedure has several challenges, such as the co-existence of imaging artefacts, motion blur, and floating debris. Most existing polyp segmentation algorithms are developed on curated still image datasets that do not represent real-world colonoscopy. Their performance often degrades on video data. We propose a video polyp segmentation method that performs self-supervised learning as an auxiliary task and a spatial-temporal self-attention mechanism for improved representation learning. Our end-to-end configuration and joint optimisation of losses enable the network to learn more discriminative contextual features in videos. Our experimental results demonstrate an improvement with respect to several state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Our ablation study also confirms that the choice of the proposed joint end-to-end training improves network accuracy by over 3% and nearly 10% on both the Dice similarity coefficient and intersection-over-union compared to the recently proposed method PNS+ and Polyp-PVT, respectively. Results on previously unseen video data indicate that the proposed method generalises.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models can memorize and repeat their training data, causing privacy and copyright risks. To mitigate memorization, we introduce a subtle modification to the next-token training objective that we call the goldfish loss. During training, a randomly sampled subset of tokens are excluded from the loss computation. These dropped tokens are not memorized by the model, which prevents verbatim reproduction of a complete chain of tokens from the training set. We run extensive experiments training billion-scale Llama-2 models, both pre-trained and trained from scratch, and demonstrate significant reductions in extractable memorization with little to no impact on downstream benchmarks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Despite the unprecedented success of text-to-image diffusion models, controlling the number of depicted objects using text is surprisingly hard. This is important for various applications from technical documents, to children's books to illustrating cooking recipes. Generating object-correct counts is fundamentally challenging because the generative model needs to keep a sense of separate identity for every instance of the object, even if several objects look identical or overlap, and then carry out a global computation implicitly during generation. It is still unknown if such representations exist. To address count-correct generation, we first identify features within the diffusion model that can carry the object identity information. We then use them to separate and count instances of objects during the denoising process and detect over-generation and under-generation. We fix the latter by training a model that predicts both the shape and location of a missing object, based on the layout of existing ones, and show how it can be used to guide denoising with correct object count. Our approach, CountGen, does not depend on external source to determine object layout, but rather uses the prior from the diffusion model itself, creating prompt-dependent and seed-dependent layouts. Evaluated on two benchmark datasets, we find that CountGen strongly outperforms the count-accuracy of existing baselines.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models face significant challenges when employed for large-scale medical image reconstruction in real practice such as 3D Computed Tomography (CT). Due to the demanding memory, time, and data requirements, it is difficult to train a diffusion model directly on the entire volume of high-dimensional data to obtain an efficient 3D diffusion prior. Existing works utilizing diffusion priors on single 2D image slice with hand-crafted cross-slice regularization would sacrifice the z-axis consistency, which results in severe artifacts along the z-axis. In this work, we propose a novel framework that enables learning the 3D image prior through position-aware 3D-patch diffusion score blending for reconstructing large-scale 3D medical images. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to utilize a 3D-patch diffusion prior for 3D medical image reconstruction. Extensive experiments on sparse view and limited angle CT reconstruction show that our DiffusionBlend method significantly outperforms previous methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world CT reconstruction problems with high-dimensional 3D image (i.e., $256 \times 256 \times 500$). Our algorithm also comes with better or comparable computational efficiency than previous state-of-the-art methods.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Randomised signature has been proposed as a flexible and easily implementable alternative to the well-established path signature. In this article, we employ randomised signature to introduce a generative model for financial time series data in the spirit of reservoir computing. Specifically, we propose a novel Wasserstein-type distance based on discrete-time randomised signatures. This metric on the space of probability measures captures the distance between (conditional) distributions. Its use is justified by our novel universal approximation results for randomised signatures on the space of continuous functions taking the underlying path as an input. We then use our metric as the loss function in a non-adversarial generator model for synthetic time series data based on a reservoir neural stochastic differential equation. We compare the results of our model to benchmarks from the existing literature.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce DiffuseST, a low-latency, direct speech-to-speech translation system capable of preserving the input speaker's voice zero-shot while translating from multiple source languages into English. We experiment with the synthesizer component of the architecture, comparing a Tacotron-based synthesizer to a novel diffusion-based synthesizer. We find the diffusion-based synthesizer to improve MOS and PESQ audio quality metrics by 23\% each and speaker similarity by 5\% while maintaining comparable BLEU scores. Despite having more than double the parameter count, the diffusion synthesizer has lower latency, allowing the entire model to run more than 5$\times$ faster than real-time.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The advent of wearable computers enables a new source of context for AI that is embedded in egocentric sensor data. This new egocentric data comes equipped with fine-grained 3D location information and thus presents the opportunity for a novel class of spatial foundation models that are rooted in 3D space. To measure progress on what we term Egocentric Foundation Models (EFMs) we establish EFM3D, a benchmark with two core 3D egocentric perception tasks. EFM3D is the first benchmark for 3D object detection and surface regression on high quality annotated egocentric data of Project Aria. We propose Egocentric Voxel Lifting (EVL), a baseline for 3D EFMs. EVL leverages all available egocentric modalities and inherits foundational capabilities from 2D foundation models. This model, trained on a large simulated dataset, outperforms existing methods on the EFM3D benchmark.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>During the acquisition of satellite images, there is generally a trade-off between spatial resolution and temporal resolution (acquisition frequency) due to the onboard sensors of satellite imaging systems. High-resolution satellite images are very important for land crop monitoring, urban planning, wildfire management and a variety of applications. It is a significant yet challenging task to achieve high spatial-temporal resolution in satellite imaging. With the advent of diffusion models, we can now learn strong generative priors to generate realistic satellite images with high resolution, which can be utilized to promote the super-resolution task as well. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion-based fusion algorithm called \textbf{SatDiffMoE} that can take an arbitrary number of sequential low-resolution satellite images at the same location as inputs, and fuse them into one high-resolution reconstructed image with more fine details, by leveraging and fusing the complementary information from different time points. Our algorithm is highly flexible and allows training and inference on arbitrary number of low-resolution images. Experimental results show that our proposed SatDiffMoE method not only achieves superior performance for the satellite image super-resolution tasks on a variety of datasets, but also gets an improved computational efficiency with reduced model parameters, compared with previous methods.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Graphical User Interface (GUI) automation holds significant promise for enhancing human productivity by assisting with computer tasks. Existing task formulations primarily focus on simple tasks that can be specified by a single, language-only instruction, such as "Insert a new slide." In this work, we introduce VideoGUI, a novel multi-modal benchmark designed to evaluate GUI assistants on visual-centric GUI tasks. Sourced from high-quality web instructional videos, our benchmark focuses on tasks involving professional and novel software (e.g., Adobe Photoshop or Stable Diffusion WebUI) and complex activities (e.g., video editing). VideoGUI evaluates GUI assistants through a hierarchical process, allowing for identification of the specific levels at which they may fail: (i) high-level planning: reconstruct procedural subtasks from visual conditions without language descriptions; (ii) middle-level planning: generate sequences of precise action narrations based on visual state (i.e., screenshot) and goals; (iii) atomic action execution: perform specific actions such as accurately clicking designated elements. For each level, we design evaluation metrics across individual dimensions to provide clear signals, such as individual performance in clicking, dragging, typing, and scrolling for atomic action execution. Our evaluation on VideoGUI reveals that even the SoTA large multimodal model GPT4o performs poorly on visual-centric GUI tasks, especially for high-level planning.</li>
