<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The developments in Generative AI technologies have paved the way for numerous innovations in different fields. Recently, Generative AI has been proposed as a competitor to AES systems in evaluating student essays automatically. Considering the potential limitations of AI in processing idioms, this study assessed the scoring performances of Generative AI models for essays with and without idioms by incorporating insights from Corpus Linguistics and Computational Linguistics. Two equal essay lists were created from 348 student essays taken from a corpus: one with multiple idioms present in each essay and another with no idioms in essays. Three Generative AI models (ChatGPT, Gemini, and Deepseek) were asked to score all essays in both lists three times, using the same rubric used by human raters in assigning essay scores. The results revealed excellent consistency for all models, but Gemini outperformed its competitors in interrater reliability with human raters. There was also no detectable bias for any demographic group in AI assessment. For essays with multiple idioms, Gemini followed a the most similar pattern to human raters. While the models in the study demonstrated potential for a hybrid approach, Gemini was the best candidate for the task due to its ability to handle figurative language and showed promise for handling essay-scoring tasks alone in the future.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Wind turbine reliability is critical to the growing renewable energy sector, where early fault detection significantly reduces downtime and maintenance costs. This paper introduces a novel ensemble-based deep learning framework for unsupervised anomaly detection in wind turbines. The method integrates Variational Autoencoders (VAE), LSTM Autoencoders, and Transformer architectures, each capturing different temporal and contextual patterns from high-dimensional SCADA data. A unique feature engineering pipeline extracts temporal, statistical, and frequency-domain indicators, which are then processed by the deep models. Ensemble scoring combines model predictions, followed by adaptive thresholding to detect operational anomalies without requiring labeled fault data. Evaluated on the CARE dataset containing 89 years of real-world turbine data across three wind farms, the proposed method achieves an AUC-ROC of 0.947 and early fault detection up to 48 hours prior to failure. This approach offers significant societal value by enabling predictive maintenance, reducing turbine failures, and enhancing operational efficiency in large-scale wind energy deployments.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text-to-Image (T2I) models have advanced rapidly, yet they remain vulnerable to semantic leakage, the unintended transfer of semantically related features between distinct entities. Existing mitigation strategies are often optimization-based or dependent on external inputs. We introduce DeLeaker, a lightweight, optimization-free inference-time approach that mitigates leakage by directly intervening on the model's attention maps. Throughout the diffusion process, DeLeaker dynamically reweights attention maps to suppress excessive cross-entity interactions while strengthening the identity of each entity. To support systematic evaluation, we introduce SLIM (Semantic Leakage in IMages), the first dataset dedicated to semantic leakage, comprising 1,130 human-verified samples spanning diverse scenarios, together with a novel automatic evaluation framework. Experiments demonstrate that DeLeaker consistently outperforms all baselines, even when they are provided with external information, achieving effective leakage mitigation without compromising fidelity or quality. These results underscore the value of attention control and pave the way for more semantically precise T2I models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) models have revolutionized the personalization of pre-trained diffusion models by enabling fine-tuning through low-rank, factorized weight matrices specifically optimized for attention layers. These models facilitate the generation of highly customized content across a variety of objects, individuals, and artistic styles without the need for extensive retraining. Despite the availability of over 100K LoRA adapters on platforms like this http URL, users often face challenges in navigating, selecting, and effectively utilizing the most suitable adapters due to their sheer volume, diversity, and lack of structured organization. This paper addresses the problem of selecting the most relevant and diverse LoRA models from this vast database by framing the task as a combinatorial optimization problem and proposing a novel submodular framework. Our quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our method generates diverse outputs across a wide range of domains.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Scaling up model size and training data has advanced foundation models for instance-level perception, achieving state-of-the-art in-domain and zero-shot performance across object detection and segmentation. However, their high computational cost limits adoption on resource-constrained platforms. We first examine the limitations of existing architectures in enabling efficient edge deployment without compromising performance. We then introduce MOBIUS, a family of foundation models for universal instance segmentation, designed for Pareto-optimal downscaling to support deployment across devices ranging from high-end accelerators to mobile hardware. To reduce training and inference demands, we propose: (i) a bottleneck pixel decoder for efficient multi-scale and multi-modal fusion, (ii) a language-guided uncertainty calibration loss for adaptive decoder pruning, and (iii) a streamlined, unified training strategy. Unlike efficient baselines that trade accuracy for reduced complexity, MOBIUS reduces pixel and transformer decoder FLOPs by up to 55% and 75%, respectively, while maintaining state-of-the-art performance in just a third of the training iterations. MOBIUS establishes a new benchmark for efficient segmentation on both high-performance computing platforms and mobile devices.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Flow-based Generative Models (FGMs) effectively transform noise into complex data distributions. Incorporating Optimal Transport (OT) to couple noise and data during FGM training has been shown to improve the straightness of flow trajectories, enabling more effective inference. However, existing OT-based methods estimate the OT plan using (mini-)batches of sampled noise and data points, which limits their scalability to large and high-dimensional datasets in FGMs. This paper introduces AlignFlow, a novel approach that leverages Semi-Discrete Optimal Transport (SDOT) to enhance the training of FGMs by establishing an explicit, optimal alignment between noise distribution and data points with guaranteed convergence. SDOT computes a transport map by partitioning the noise space into Laguerre cells, each mapped to a corresponding data point. During FGM training, i.i.d. noise samples are paired with data points via the SDOT map. AlignFlow scales well to large datasets and model architectures with negligible computational overhead. Experimental results show that AlignFlow improves the performance of a wide range of state-of-the-art FGM algorithms and can be integrated as a plug-and-play component.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities but remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks exploiting cross-modal vulnerabilities. In this work, we introduce a novel method that leverages sequential comic-style visual narratives to circumvent safety alignments in state-of-the-art MLLMs. Our method decomposes malicious queries into visually innocuous storytelling elements using an auxiliary LLM, generates corresponding image sequences through diffusion models, and exploits the models' reliance on narrative coherence to elicit harmful outputs. Extensive experiments on harmful textual queries from established safety benchmarks show that our approach achieves an average attack success rate of 83.5\%, surpassing prior state-of-the-art by 46\%. Compared with existing visual jailbreak methods, our sequential narrative strategy demonstrates superior effectiveness across diverse categories of harmful content. We further analyze attack patterns, uncover key vulnerability factors in multimodal safety mechanisms, and evaluate the limitations of current defense strategies against narrative-driven attacks, revealing significant gaps in existing protections.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Forecasting high-dimensional, PDE-governed dynamics remains a core challenge for generative modeling. Existing autoregressive and diffusion-based approaches often suffer cumulative errors and discretisation artifacts that limit long, physically consistent forecasts. Flow matching offers a natural alternative, enabling efficient, deterministic sampling. We prove an upper bound on FNO approximation error and propose TempO, a latent flow matching model leveraging sparse conditioning with channel folding to efficiently process 3D spatiotemporal fields using time-conditioned Fourier layers to capture multi-scale modes with high fidelity. TempO outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across three benchmark PDE datasets, and spectral analysis further demonstrates superior recovery of multi-scale dynamics, while efficiency studies highlight its parameter- and memory-light design compared to attention-based or convolutional regressors.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful generative models in medical imaging. However, it remains a major challenge to combine these data-driven models with domain knowledge to guide brain imaging problems. In neuroimaging, Bayesian inverse problems have long provided a successful framework for inference tasks, where incorporating domain knowledge of the imaging process enables robust performance without requiring extensive training data. However, the anatomical modeling component of these approaches typically relies on classical mathematical priors that often fail to capture the complex structure of brain anatomy. In this work, we present the first general-purpose application of diffusion models as priors for solving a wide range of medical imaging inverse problems. Our approach leverages a score-based diffusion prior trained extensively on diverse brain MRI data, paired with flexible forward models that capture common image processing tasks such as super-resolution, bias field correction, inpainting, and combinations thereof. We further demonstrate how our framework can refine outputs from existing deep learning methods to improve anatomical fidelity. Experiments on heterogeneous clinical and research MRI data show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance producing consistent, high-quality solutions without requiring paired training datasets. These results highlight the potential of diffusion priors as versatile tools for brain MRI analysis.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are continually pre-trained on a mixture of image-text caption data and interleaved document data, while the high-quality data filtering towards image-text interleaved document data is under-explored. We propose to train an efficient MLLM as a Unified Mulitmodal Data Quality Classifier to Filter both high-quality image-text caption and interleaved data (UniFilter). To address the challenge of collecting diverse labeled multimodal data, we introduce a semi-synthetic approach that leverages readily available raw images and generates corresponding text across four quality levels. This method enables efficient creation of sample-score pairs for both caption and interleaved document data to train UniFilter. We apply UniFilter to curate high-quality caption data from DataComp caption dataset and interleaved data from the OBELICS image-text interleaved dataset. MLLMs pre-trained on the filtered data demonstrate significantly enhanced capabilities compared to those trained on baseline-filtered data, achieving stronger zero-shot reasoning and in-context learning capabilities. After visual supervised fine-tuning, these UniFilter-induced MLLMs achieve stronger performance on various benchmarks, highlighting the downstream benefits of high-quality multimodal pre-training. We release the synthetic training data used for training UniFilter, the UniFilter model checkpoints, and the high-quality interleaved document subset OBELICS-HQ, curated by UniFilter, to the community for reproduction and further development.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Reproducibility remains a critical challenge in foundation model training for histopathology, often hindered by software randomness, hardware non-determinism, and inconsistent hyperparameter reporting. To investigate these issues, we trained a CLIP model on the QUILT-1M dataset and systematically evaluated the impact of different hyperparameter settings and augmentation strategies across three downstream histopathology datasets (PatchCamelyon, LC25000-Lung, and LC25000-Colon). Despite variability across runs, we identified clear trends: RandomResizedCrop values of 0.7-0.8 outperformed more aggressive (0.6) or conservative (0.9) settings, distributed training without local loss improved stability, and learning rates below 5.0e-5 consistently degraded performance across all datasets. The LC25000 (Colon) dataset consistently provided the most reproducible benchmark. These findings highlight that reproducibility in computational pathology depends not only on transparent documentation but also on carefully chosen experimental configurations, and we provide practical rules to guide future efforts in developing reproducible foundation models for digital pathology.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables agents to learn optimal decision-making strategies through interaction with an environment, yet training from scratch on complex tasks can be highly inefficient. Transfer learning (TL), widely successful in large language models (LLMs), offers a promising direction for enhancing RL efficiency by leveraging pre-trained models. This paper investigates policy transfer, a TL approach that initializes learning in a target RL task using a policy from a related source task, in the context of continuous-time linear quadratic regulators (LQRs) with entropy regularization. We provide the first theoretical proof of policy transfer for continuous-time RL, proving that a policy optimal for one LQR serves as a near-optimal initialization for closely related LQRs, while preserving the original algorithm's convergence rate. Furthermore, we introduce a novel policy learning algorithm for continuous-time LQRs that achieves global linear and local super-linear convergence. Our results demonstrate both theoretical guarantees and algorithmic benefits of transfer learning in continuous-time RL, addressing a gap in existing literature and extending prior work from discrete to continuous time settings. As a byproduct of our analysis, we derive the stability of a class of continuous-time score-based diffusion models via their connection with LQRs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Voice interfaces are increasingly used in high stakes domains such as mobile banking, smart home security, and hands free healthcare. Meanwhile, modern generative models have made high quality voice forgeries inexpensive and easy to create, eroding confidence in voice authentication alone. To strengthen protection against such attacks, we present a second authentication factor that combines acoustic evidence with the unique motion patterns of a speaker's lower face. By placing lightweight inertial sensors around the mouth to capture mouth opening and evolving lower facial geometry, our system records a distinct motion signature with strong discriminative power across individuals. We built a prototype and recruited 43 participants to evaluate the system under four conditions seated, walking on level ground, walking on stairs, and speaking with different language backgrounds (native vs. non native English). Across all scenarios, our approach consistently achieved a median equal error rate (EER) of 0.01 or lower, indicating that mouth movement data remain robust under variations in gait, posture, and spoken language. We discuss specific use cases where this second line of defense could provide tangible security benefits to voice authentication systems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are stealthy cyberattacks that often evade detection in system-level audit logs. Provenance graphs model these logs as connected entities and events, revealing relationships that are missed by linear log representations. Existing systems apply anomaly detection to these graphs but often suffer from high false positive rates and coarse-grained alerts. Their reliance on node attributes like file paths or IPs leads to spurious correlations, reducing detection robustness and reliability. To fully understand an attack's progression and impact, security analysts need systems that can generate accurate, human-like narratives of the entire attack. To address these challenges, we introduce OCR-APT, a system for APT detection and reconstruction of human-like attack stories. OCR-APT uses Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for subgraph anomaly detection, learning behavior patterns around nodes rather than fragile attributes such as file paths or IPs. This approach leads to a more robust anomaly detection. It then iterates over detected subgraphs using Large Language Models (LLMs) to reconstruct multi-stage attack stories. Each stage is validated before proceeding, reducing hallucinations and ensuring an interpretable final report. Our evaluations on the DARPA TC3, OpTC, and NODLINK datasets show that OCR-APT outperforms state-of-the-art systems in both detection accuracy and alert interpretability. Moreover, OCR-APT reconstructs human-like reports that comprehensively capture the attack story.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable advances in reasoning capabilities. However, their performance remains constrained by limited access to explicit and structured domain knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this by incorporating external information as context to augment reasoning. Nevertheless, traditional RAG systems typically operate over unstructured and fragmented text, resulting in low information density and suboptimal reasoning. To overcome these limitations, we propose \textsc{Structure-R1}, a novel framework that transforms retrieved content into structured representations optimized for reasoning. Leveraging reinforcement learning, \textsc{Structure-R1} learns a content representation policy that dynamically generates and adapts structural formats based on the demands of multi-step reasoning. Unlike prior methods that rely on fixed schemas, our approach adopts a generative paradigm capable of producing task-specific structures tailored to individual queries. To ensure the quality and reliability of these representations, we introduce a self-reward structural verification mechanism that checks whether the generated structures are both correct and self-contained. Extensive experiments on seven knowledge-intensive benchmarks show that \textsc{Structure-R1} consistently achieves competitive performance with a 7B-scale backbone model and matches the performance of much larger models. Additionally, our theoretical analysis demonstrates how structured representations enhance reasoning by improving information density and contextual clarity.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent generative data augmentation methods conditioned on both image and text prompts struggle to balance between fidelity and diversity, as it is challenging to preserve essential image details while aligning with varied text prompts. This challenge arises because representations in the synthesis process often become entangled with non-essential input image attributes such as environmental contexts, creating conflicts with text prompts intended to modify these elements. To address this, we propose a personalized image generation framework that uses a salient concept-aware image embedding model to reduce the influence of irrelevant visual details during the synthesis process, thereby maintaining intuitive alignment between image and text inputs. By generating images that better preserve class-discriminative features with additional controlled variations, our framework effectively enhances the diversity of training datasets and thereby improves the robustness of downstream models. Our approach demonstrates superior performance across eight fine-grained vision datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art augmentation methods with averaged classification accuracy improvements by 0.73% and 6.5% under conventional and long-tail settings, respectively.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for the reliable deployment of deep learning models. hile Mahalanobis distance methods are widely used, the impact of representation geometry and normalization on their performance is not fully understood, which may limit their downstream application. To address this gap, we conducted a comprehensive empirical study across diverse image foundation models, datasets, and distance normalization schemes. First, our analysis shows that Mahalanobis-based methods aren't universally reliable. Second, we define the ideal geometry for data representations and demonstrate that spectral and intrinsic-dimensionality metrics can accurately predict a model's OOD performance. Finally, we analyze how normalization impacts OOD performance. Building upon these studies, we propose radially scaled $\ell_2$ normalization, a method that generalizes the standard $\ell_2$ normalization recently applied to Mahalanobis-based OOD detection. Our approach introduces a tunable parameter to directly control the radial geometry of the feature space, systematically contracting or expanding representations to significantly improve OOD detection performance. By bridging the gap between representation geometry, normalization, and OOD performance, our findings offer new insights into the design of more effective and reliable deep learning models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Prenatal diagnosis of Congenital Heart Diseases (CHDs) holds great potential for Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven solutions. However, collecting high-quality diagnostic data remains difficult due to the rarity of these conditions, resulting in imbalanced and low-quality datasets that hinder model performance. Moreover, no public efforts have been made to integrate multiple sources of information, such as imaging and clinical data, further limiting the ability of AI models to support and enhance clinical decision-making. To overcome these challenges, we introduce the Congenital Anomaly Recognition with Diagnostic Images and Unified Medical records (CARDIUM) dataset, the first publicly available multimodal dataset consolidating fetal ultrasound and echocardiographic images along with maternal clinical records for prenatal CHD detection. Furthermore, we propose a robust multimodal transformer architecture that incorporates a cross-attention mechanism to fuse feature representations from image and tabular data, improving CHD detection by 11% and 50% over image and tabular single-modality approaches, respectively, and achieving an F1 score of 79.8 $\pm$ 4.8% in the CARDIUM dataset. We will publicly release our dataset and code to encourage further research on this unexplored field.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently proven effective at scaling chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in large language models on tasks with verifiable answers. However, extending RL to more general non-verifiable tasks, typically in the format of human preference pairs, remains both challenging and underexplored. In this work, we propose Dual-Weighted Reinforcement Learning (DWRL), a new framework for preference modeling that integrates CoT reasoning with the Bradley-Terry (BT) model via a dual-weighted RL objective that preserves preference-modeling inductive bias. DWRL approximates the maximum-likelihood objective of the BT model with two complementary weights: an instance-wise misalignment weight, which emphasizes under-trained pairs misaligned with human preference, and a group-wise (self-normalized) conditional preference score, which promotes promising thoughts. In this paper, we apply DWRL to preference modeling by training generative preference models (GPMs) to first generate a thought and then predict the human preference score. Across multiple benchmarks and model scales (Llama3 and Qwen2.5), DWRL consistently outperforms both GPM baselines and scalar models, while producing coherent, interpretable thoughts. In summary, our results position DWRL as a general framework for reasoning-enhanced preference learning beyond verifiable tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Current autoregressive language models (ARMs) achieve high accuracy but require long token sequences, making them costly. Discrete diffusion language models (DDLMs) enable parallel and flexible generation within a fixed number of steps and have recently emerged for their strong performance in complex reasoning and long-term planning tasks. We present a study exploring hybrid architectures that couple DDLMs with ARMs to assess whether their collaboration can yield complementary benefits. We first examine collaboration in text space, where one model plans the reasoning process and another executes the final answer based on that plan. We then extend this setup to latent-space communication, introducing a learned projector that maps DDLM latents into the ARM's embedding space, potentially bypassing some of the text-generation limitations of diffusion models. We find that shifting DDLM --> ARM communication from text space to latent space yields significant accuracy gains, for example increasing from 27.0% to 54.0% on DART-5 and from 0.0% to 14.0% on AIME24. We also find that combining a DDLM planner with an ARM executor can provide substantial computational savings with little to no impact on accuracy. For example, the latent-space pipeline, using 64 tokens for planning and roughly 5 for execution, surpasses Qwen3.1-7B on DART-5 and AIME, despite Qwen using 44 times more tokens. Overall, our study offers new insights into reasoning with DDLMs and highlights their potential in hybrid architectures.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present DriveGen3D, a novel framework for generating high-quality and highly controllable dynamic 3D driving scenes that addresses critical limitations in existing methodologies. Current approaches to driving scene synthesis either suffer from prohibitive computational demands for extended temporal generation, focus exclusively on prolonged video synthesis without 3D representation, or restrict themselves to static single-scene reconstruction. Our work bridges this methodological gap by integrating accelerated long-term video generation with large-scale dynamic scene reconstruction through multimodal conditional control. DriveGen3D introduces a unified pipeline consisting of two specialized components: FastDrive-DiT, an efficient video diffusion transformer for high-resolution, temporally coherent video synthesis under text and Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) layout guidance; and FastRecon3D, a feed-forward reconstruction module that rapidly builds 3D Gaussian representations across time, ensuring spatial-temporal consistency. Together, these components enable real-time generation of extended driving videos (up to $424\times800$ at 12 FPS) and corresponding dynamic 3D scenes, achieving SSIM of 0.811 and PSNR of 22.84 on novel view synthesis, all while maintaining parameter efficiency.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Foundation models (FMs), such as GPT-4 and AlphaFold, are reshaping the landscape of scientific research. Beyond accelerating tasks such as hypothesis generation, experimental design, and result interpretation, they prompt a more fundamental question: Are FMs merely enhancing existing scientific methodologies, or are they redefining the way science is conducted? In this paper, we argue that FMs are catalyzing a transition toward a new scientific paradigm. We introduce a three-stage framework to describe this evolution: (1) Meta-Scientific Integration, where FMs enhance workflows within traditional paradigms; (2) Hybrid Human-AI Co-Creation, where FMs become active collaborators in problem formulation, reasoning, and discovery; and (3) Autonomous Scientific Discovery, where FMs operate as independent agents capable of generating new scientific knowledge with minimal human intervention. Through this lens, we review current applications and emerging capabilities of FMs across existing scientific paradigms. We further identify risks and future directions for FM-enabled scientific discovery. This position paper aims to support the scientific community in understanding the transformative role of FMs and to foster reflection on the future of scientific discovery.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, self-supervised, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent progress in diffusion-based visual generation has largely relied on latent diffusion models with variational autoencoders (VAEs). While effective for high-fidelity synthesis, this VAE+diffusion paradigm suffers from limited training efficiency, slow inference, and poor transferability to broader vision tasks. These issues stem from a key limitation of VAE latent spaces: the lack of clear semantic separation and strong discriminative structure. Our analysis confirms that these properties are crucial not only for perception and understanding tasks, but also for the stable and efficient training of latent diffusion models. Motivated by this insight, we introduce SVG, a novel latent diffusion model without variational autoencoders, which leverages self-supervised representations for visual generation. SVG constructs a feature space with clear semantic discriminability by leveraging frozen DINO features, while a lightweight residual branch captures fine-grained details for high-fidelity reconstruction. Diffusion models are trained directly on this semantically structured latent space to facilitate more efficient learning. As a result, SVG enables accelerated diffusion training, supports few-step sampling, and improves generative quality. Experimental results further show that SVG preserves the semantic and discriminative capabilities of the underlying self-supervised representations, providing a principled pathway toward task-general, high-quality visual representations.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>A key question in sequence modeling with neural networks is how to represent and learn highly nonlinear and probabilistic state dynamics. Operator theory views such dynamics as linear maps on Hilbert spaces containing mean embedding vectors of distributions, offering an appealing but currently overlooked perspective. We propose a new approach to sequence modeling based on an operator-theoretic view of a hidden Markov model (HMM). Instead of materializing stochastic recurrence, we embed the full sequence distribution as a tensor in the product Hilbert space. A generative process is then defined as maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) gradient flow in the space of sequences. To overcome challenges with large tensors and slow sampling convergence, we introduce spectral mean flows, a novel tractable algorithm integrating two core concepts. First, we propose a new neural architecture by leveraging spectral decomposition of linear operators to derive a scalable tensor network decomposition of sequence mean embeddings. Second, we extend MMD gradient flows to time-dependent Hilbert spaces and connect them to flow matching via the continuity equation, enabling simulation-free learning and faster sampling. We demonstrate competitive results on a range of time-series modeling datasets. Code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The recent development of zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) has opened a new avenue for learning pre-trained generalist policies that can adapt to arbitrary new tasks in a zero-shot manner. While the popular Forward-Backward representations (FB) and related methods have shown promise in zero-shot RL, we empirically found that their modeling lacks expressivity and that extrapolation errors caused by out-of-distribution (OOD) actions during offline learning sometimes lead to biased representations, ultimately resulting in suboptimal performance. To address these issues, we propose Behavior-REgularizEd Zero-shot RL with Expressivity enhancement (BREEZE), an upgraded FB-based framework that simultaneously enhances learning stability, policy extraction capability, and representation learning quality. BREEZE introduces behavioral regularization in zero-shot RL policy learning, transforming policy optimization into a stable in-sample learning paradigm. Additionally, BREEZE extracts the policy using a task-conditioned diffusion model, enabling the generation of high-quality and multimodal action distributions in zero-shot RL settings. Moreover, BREEZE employs expressive attention-based architectures for representation modeling to capture the complex relationships between environmental dynamics. Extensive experiments on ExORL and D4RL Kitchen demonstrate that BREEZE achieves the best or near-the-best performance while exhibiting superior robustness compared to prior offline zero-shot RL methods.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled high-quality, real-time novel-view synthesis from multi-view images. However, most existing methods assume the object is captured in a single, static pose, resulting in incomplete reconstructions that miss occluded or self-occluded regions. We introduce PFGS, a pose-aware 3DGS framework that addresses the practical challenge of reconstructing complete objects from multi-pose image captures. Given images of an object in one main pose and several auxiliary poses, PFGS iteratively fuses each auxiliary set into a unified 3DGS representation of the main pose. Our pose-aware fusion strategy combines global and local registration to merge views effectively and refine the 3DGS model. While recent advances in 3D foundation models have improved registration robustness and efficiency, they remain limited by high memory demands and suboptimal accuracy. PFGS overcomes these challenges by incorporating them more intelligently into the registration process: it leverages background features for per-pose camera pose estimation and employs foundation models for cross-pose registration. This design captures the best of both approaches while resolving background inconsistency issues. Experimental results demonstrate that PFGS consistently outperforms strong baselines in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, producing more complete reconstructions and higher-fidelity 3DGS models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While behavior cloning with flow/diffusion policies excels at learning complex skills from demonstrations, it remains vulnerable to distributional shift, and standard RL methods struggle to fine-tune these models due to their iterative inference process and the limitations of existing workarounds. In this work, we introduce the Stepwise Flow Policy (SWFP) framework, founded on the key insight that discretizing the flow matching inference process via a fixed-step Euler scheme inherently aligns it with the variational Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (JKO) principle from optimal transport. SWFP decomposes the global flow into a sequence of small, incremental transformations between proximate distributions. Each step corresponds to a JKO update, regularizing policy changes to stay near the previous iterate and ensuring stable online adaptation with entropic regularization. This decomposition yields an efficient algorithm that fine-tunes pre-trained flows via a cascade of small flow blocks, offering significant advantages: simpler/faster training of sub-models, reduced computational/memory costs, and provable stability grounded in Wasserstein trust regions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate SWFP's enhanced stability, efficiency, and superior adaptation performance across diverse robotic control benchmarks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generating long and stylized human motions in real time is critical for applications that demand continuous and responsive character control. Despite its importance, existing streaming approaches often operate directly in the raw motion space, leading to substantial computational overhead and making it difficult to maintain temporal stability. In contrast, latent-space VAE-Diffusion-based frameworks alleviate these issues and achieve high-quality stylization, but they are generally confined to offline processing. To bridge this gap, LILAC (Long-sequence Incremental Low-latency Arbitrary Motion Stylization via Streaming VAE-Diffusion with Causal Decoding) builds upon a recent high-performing offline framework for arbitrary motion stylization and extends it to an online setting through a latent-space streaming architecture with a sliding-window causal design and the injection of decoded motion features to ensure smooth motion transitions. This architecture enables long-sequence real-time arbitrary stylization without relying on future frames or modifying the diffusion model architecture, achieving a favorable balance between stylization quality and responsiveness as demonstrated by experiments on benchmark datasets.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Clinical adoption of multi-shot diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (multi-shot DWI) for body-wide tumor diagnostics is limited by severe motion-induced phase artifacts from respiration, peristalsis, and so on, compounded by multi-organ, multi-slice, multi-direction and multi-b-value complexities. Here, we introduce a reconstruction framework, LoSP-Prompt, that overcomes these challenges through physics-informed modeling and synthetic-data-driven prompt learning. We model inter-shot phase variations as a high-order Locally Smooth Phase (LoSP), integrated into a low-rank Hankel matrix reconstruction. Crucially, the algorithm's rank parameter is automatically set via prompt learning trained exclusively on synthetic abdominal DWI data emulating physiological motion. Validated across 10,000+ clinical images (43 subjects, 4 scanner models, 5 centers), LoSP-Prompt: (1) Achieved twice the spatial resolution of clinical single-shot DWI, enhancing liver lesion conspicuity; (2) Generalized to seven diverse anatomical regions (liver, kidney, sacroiliac, pelvis, knee, spinal cord, brain) with a single model; (3) Outperformed state-of-the-art methods in image quality, artifact suppression, and noise reduction (11 radiologists' evaluations on a 5-point scale, $p<0.05$), achieving 4-5 points (excellent) on kidney DWI, 4 points (good to excellent) on liver, sacroiliac and spinal cord DWI, and 3-4 points (good) on knee and tumor brain. The approach eliminates navigator signals and realistic data supervision, providing an interpretable, robust solution for high-resolution multi-organ multi-shot DWI. Its scanner-agnostic performance signifies transformative potential for precision oncology.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This dissertation investigates how reinforcement learning (RL) methods can be designed to be safe, sample-efficient, and robust. Framed through the unifying perspective of contextual-bandit RL, the work addresses two major application domains - ranking and recommendation, and text-to-image diffusion models. The first part of the thesis develops theory and algorithms for safe deployment in ranking systems. An exposure-based generalisation bound is derived, leading to a counterfactual risk-minimisation objective whose solution is guaranteed not to underperform the logging policy, even with sparse feedback. This guarantee is extended to doubly robust estimators, enabling safety even under adversarial or misspecified user models and offering practitioners explicit control over permissible utility loss. The second part turns to single-action bandits, where various off-policy estimators are unified within a baseline-correction framework. A closed-form optimal baseline is proposed and shown to minimise both evaluation and policy-gradient variance, thereby improving off-policy learning reliability. The final part examines the trade-offs between efficiency and effectiveness in generative RL. A systematic study of PPO and REINFORCE motivates the Leave-One-Out PPO (LOOP) algorithm, which combines multiple diffusion trajectories with a REINFORCE-style baseline inside PPO's clipped objective. LOOP achieves PPO-level sample efficiency while producing generations that align more faithfully with textual attributes.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Latent-variable energy-based models (LVEBMs) assign a single normalized energy to joint pairs of observed data and latent variables, offering expressive generative modeling while capturing hidden structure. We recast maximum-likelihood training as a saddle problem over distributions on the latent and joint manifolds and view the inner updates as coupled Wasserstein gradient flows. The resulting algorithm alternates overdamped Langevin updates for a joint negative pool and for conditional latent particles with stochastic parameter ascent, requiring no discriminator or auxiliary networks. We prove existence and convergence under standard smoothness and dissipativity assumptions, with decay rates in KL divergence and Wasserstein-2 distance. The saddle-point view further yields an ELBO strictly tighter than bounds obtained with restricted amortized posteriors. Our method is evaluated on numerical approximations of physical systems and performs competitively against comparable approaches.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While pre-trained visual representations have significantly advanced imitation learning, they are often task-agnostic as they remain frozen during policy learning. In this work, we explore leveraging pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models to obtain task-adaptive visual representations for robotic control, without fine-tuning the model itself. However, we find that naively applying textual conditions - a successful strategy in other vision domains - yields minimal or even negative gains in control tasks. We attribute this to the domain gap between the diffusion model's training data and robotic control environments, leading us to argue for conditions that consider the specific, dynamic visual information required for control. To this end, we propose ORCA, which introduces learnable task prompts that adapt to the control environment and visual prompts that capture fine-grained, frame-specific details. Through facilitating task-adaptive representations with our newly devised conditions, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on various robotic control benchmarks, significantly surpassing prior methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Accelerating the inference of large language models (LLMs) has been a critical challenge in generative AI. Speculative decoding (SD) substantially improves LLM inference efficiency. However, its utility is limited by a fundamental constraint: the draft and target models must share the same vocabulary, thus limiting the herd of available draft models and often necessitating the training of a new model from scratch. Inspired by Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), a classic algorithm for aligning time series, we propose the algorithm TokenTiming for universal speculative decoding. It operates by re-encoding the draft token sequence to get a new target token sequence, and then uses DTW to build a mapping to transfer the probability distributions for speculative sampling. Benefiting from this, our method accommodates mismatched vocabularies and works with any off-the-shelf models without retraining and modification. We conduct comprehensive experiments on various tasks, demonstrating 1.57x speedup. This work enables a universal approach for draft model selection, making SD a more versatile and practical tool for LLM acceleration.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is an established tool in the diagnostic workup of patients with suspected dementing disorders. However, compared to the routinely available magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), FDG-PET remains significantly less accessible and substantially more expensive. Here, we present SiM2P, a 3D diffusion bridge-based framework that learns a probabilistic mapping from MRI and auxiliary patient information to simulate FDG-PET images of diagnostic quality. In a blinded clinical reader study, two neuroradiologists and two nuclear medicine physicians rated the original MRI and SiM2P-simulated PET images of patients with Alzheimer's disease, behavioral-variant frontotemporal dementia, and cognitively healthy controls. SiM2P significantly improved the overall diagnostic accuracy of differentiating between three groups from 75.0% to 84.7% (p<0.05). Notably, the simulated PET images received higher diagnostic certainty ratings and achieved superior interrater agreement compared to the MRI images. Finally, we developed a practical workflow for local deployment of the SiM2P framework. It requires as few as 20 site-specific cases and only basic demographic information. This approach makes the established diagnostic benefits of FDG-PET imaging more accessible to patients with suspected dementing disorders, potentially improving early detection and differential diagnosis in resource-limited settings.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generating artistic and coherent 3D scene layouts is crucial in digital content creation. Traditional optimization-based methods are often constrained by cumbersome manual rules, while deep generative models face challenges in producing content with richness and diversity. Furthermore, approaches that utilize large language models frequently lack robustness and fail to accurately capture complex spatial relationships. To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel vision-guided 3D layout generation system. We first construct a high-quality asset library containing 2,037 scene assets and 147 3D scene layouts. Subsequently, we employ an image generation model to expand prompt representations into images, fine-tuning it to align with our asset library. We then develop a robust image parsing module to recover the 3D layout of scenes based on visual semantics and geometric information. Finally, we optimize the scene layout using scene graphs and overall visual semantics to ensure logical coherence and alignment with the images. Extensive user testing demonstrates that our algorithm significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of layout richness and quality.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Spatio-Temporal Image Fusion (STIF) methods usually require sets of images with matching spatial and spectral resolutions captured by different sensors. To facilitate the application of STIF methods, we propose and compare two different standardization approaches. The first method is based on traditional upscaling of the fine-resolution images. The second method is a sharpening approach called Anomaly Based Satellite Image Standardization (ABSIS) that blends the overall features found in the fine-resolution image series with the distinctive attributes of a specific coarse-resolution image to produce images that more closely resemble the outcome of aggregating the fine-resolution images. Both methods produce a significant increase in accuracy of the Unpaired Spatio Temporal Fusion of Image Patches (USTFIP) STIF method, with the sharpening approach increasing the spectral and spatial accuracies of the fused images by up to 49.46\% and 78.40\%, respectively.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Zero-shot anomaly localization is a rising field in computer vision research, with important progress in recent years. This work focuses on the problem of detecting and localizing anomalies in textures, where anomalies can be defined as the regions that deviate from the overall statistics, violating the stationarity assumption. The main limitation of existing methods is their high running time, making them impractical for deployment in real-world scenarios, such as assembly line monitoring. We propose a real-time method, named QFCA, which implements a quantized version of the feature correspondence analysis (FCA) algorithm. By carefully adapting the patch statistics comparison to work on histograms of quantized values, we obtain a 10x speedup with little to no loss in accuracy. Moreover, we introduce a feature preprocessing step based on principal component analysis, which enhances the contrast between normal and anomalous features, improving the detection precision on complex textures. Our method is thoroughly evaluated against prior art, comparing favorably with existing methods. Project page: this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Current self-supervised denoising techniques achieve impressive results, yet their real-world application is frequently constrained by substantial computational and memory demands, necessitating a compromise between inference speed and reconstruction quality. In this paper, we present an ultra-lightweight model that addresses this challenge, achieving both fast denoising and high quality image restoration. Built upon the Noise2Noise training framework-which removes the reliance on clean reference images or explicit noise modeling-we introduce an innovative multistage denoising pipeline named Noise2Detail (N2D). During inference, this approach disrupts the spatial correlations of noise patterns to produce intermediate smooth structures, which are subsequently refined to recapture fine details directly from the noisy input. Extensive testing reveals that Noise2Detail surpasses existing dataset-free techniques in performance, while requiring only a fraction of the computational resources. This combination of efficiency, low computational cost, and data-free approach make it a valuable tool for biomedical imaging, overcoming the challenges of scarce clean training data-due to rare and complex imaging modalities-while enabling fast inference for practical use.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Operator learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for developing efficient surrogate models to solve partial differential equations (PDEs). However, existing approaches often overlook the domain knowledge inherent in the underlying PDEs and hence suffer from challenges in capturing temporal dynamics and generalization issues beyond training time frames. This paper introduces a deep neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) operator network framework, termed NODE-ONet, to alleviate these limitations. The framework adopts an encoder-decoder architecture comprising three core components: an encoder that spatially discretizes input functions, a neural ODE capturing latent temporal dynamics, and a decoder reconstructing solutions in physical spaces. Theoretically, error analysis for the encoder-decoder architecture is investigated. Computationally, we propose novel physics-encoded neural ODEs to incorporate PDE-specific physical properties. Such well-designed neural ODEs significantly reduce the framework's complexity while enhancing numerical efficiency, robustness, applicability, and generalization capacity. Numerical experiments on nonlinear diffusion-reaction and Navier-Stokes equations demonstrate high accuracy, computational efficiency, and prediction capabilities beyond training time frames. Additionally, the framework's flexibility to accommodate diverse encoders/decoders and its ability to generalize across related PDE families further underscore its potential as a scalable, physics-encoded tool for scientific machine learning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) presents a complementary alternative to supervised learning for brain tumor segmentation in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), particularly when annotated datasets are limited, costly, or inconsistent. In this work, we propose a novel Multimodal Vision Transformer Autoencoder (MViT-AE) trained exclusively on healthy brain MRIs to detect and localize tumors via reconstruction-based error maps. This unsupervised paradigm enables segmentation without reliance on manual labels, addressing a key scalability bottleneck in neuroimaging workflows. Our method is evaluated in the BraTS-GoAT 2025 Lighthouse dataset, which includes various types of tumors such as gliomas, meningiomas, and pediatric brain tumors. To enhance performance, we introduce a multimodal early-late fusion strategy that leverages complementary information across multiple MRI sequences, and a post-processing pipeline that integrates the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to refine predicted tumor contours. Despite the known challenges of UAD, particularly in detecting small or non-enhancing lesions, our method achieves clinically meaningful tumor localization, with lesion-wise Dice Similarity Coefficient of 0.437 (Whole Tumor), 0.316 (Tumor Core), and 0.350 (Enhancing Tumor) on the test set, and an anomaly Detection Rate of 89.4% on the validation set. These findings highlight the potential of transformer-based unsupervised models to serve as scalable, label-efficient tools for neuro-oncological imaging.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Masked Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative to traditional Autoregressive Models (ARMs). DLMs employ transformer encoders with bidirectional attention, enabling parallel token generation while maintaining competitive performance. Although their efficiency and effectiveness have been extensively studied, the internal mechanisms that govern DLMs remain largely unexplored. In this work, we conduct an empirical analysis of DLM attention patterns, focusing on the attention sinking phenomenon, an effect previously observed in various transformer-based architectures. Our findings reveal that DLMs also exhibit attention sinks, but with distinct characteristics. First, unlike in ARMs, the sink positions in DLMs tend to shift throughout the generation process, displaying a dynamic behaviour. Second, while ARMs are highly sensitive to the removal of attention sinks, DLMs remain robust: masking sinks leads to only a minor degradation in performance. These results provide new insights into the inner workings of diffusion-based language models and highlight fundamental differences in how they allocate and utilize attention compared to autoregressive models.</li>

To make this process viable, our framework resolves the prohibitive cost-quality trade-off by employing an efficient, distilled model architecture augmented by a temporal enhancer, which simultaneously reduces computational overhead and improves temporal coherence. Finally, to achieve full scalability, this entire pipeline is driven by an intelligent agent that crafts diverse instructions and rigorously filters the output, ensuring quality control at scale. Using this framework, we invested over 12,000 GPU-days to build Ditto-1M, a new dataset of one million high-fidelity video editing examples. We trained our model, Editto, on Ditto-1M with a curriculum learning strategy. The results demonstrate superior instruction-following ability and establish a new state-of-the-art in instruction-based video editing.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Despite the impressive generative capabilities of text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, they remain vulnerable to generating inappropriate content, especially when confronted with implicit sexual prompts. Unlike explicit harmful prompts, these subtle cues, often disguised as seemingly benign terms, can unexpectedly trigger sexual content due to underlying model biases, raising significant ethical concerns. However, existing detection methods are primarily designed to identify explicit sexual content and therefore struggle to detect these implicit cues. Fine-tuning approaches, while effective to some extent, risk degrading the model's generative quality, creating an undesirable trade-off. To address this, we propose NDM, the first noise-driven detection and mitigation framework, which could detect and mitigate implicit malicious intention in T2I generation while preserving the model's original generative capabilities. Specifically, we introduce two key innovations: first, we leverage the separability of early-stage predicted noise to develop a noise-based detection method that could identify malicious content with high accuracy and efficiency; second, we propose a noise-enhanced adaptive negative guidance mechanism that could optimize the initial noise by suppressing the prominent region's attention, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of adaptive negative guidance for sexual mitigation. Experimentally, we validate NDM on both natural and adversarial datasets, demonstrating its superior performance over existing SOTA methods, including SLD, UCE, and RECE, etc. Code and resources are available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Poultry farming faces increasing pressure to meet productivity targets while ensuring animal welfare and environmental compliance. Yet many small and medium-sized farms lack affordable, integrated tools for continuous monitoring and decision-making, relying instead on manual, reactive inspections. This paper presents Poultry Farm Intelligence (PoultryFI) - a modular, cost-effective platform that integrates six AI-powered modules: Camera Placement Optimizer, Audio-Visual Monitoring, Analytics & Alerting, Real-Time Egg Counting, Production & Profitability Forecasting, and a Recommendation Module. Camera layouts are first optimized offline using evolutionary algorithms for full poultry house coverage with minimal hardware. The Audio-Visual Monitoring module extracts welfare indicators from synchronized video, audio, and feeding data. Analytics & Alerting produces daily summaries and real-time notifications, while Real-Time Egg Counting uses an edge vision model to automate production tracking. Forecasting models predict egg yield and feed consumption up to 10 days in advance, and the Recommendation Module integrates forecasts with weather data to guide environmental and operational adjustments. This is among the first systems to combine low-cost sensing, edge analytics, and prescriptive AI to continuously monitor flocks, predict production, and optimize performance. Field trials demonstrate 100% egg-count accuracy on Raspberry Pi 5, robust anomaly detection, and reliable short-term forecasting. PoultryFI bridges the gap between isolated pilot tools and scalable, farm-wide intelligence, empowering producers to proactively safeguard welfare and profitability.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present QSilk, a lightweight, always-on stabilization layer for latent diffusion that improves high-frequency fidelity while suppressing rare activation spikes. QSilk combines (i) a per-sample micro clamp that gently limits extreme values without washing out texture, and (ii) Adaptive Quantile Clip (AQClip), which adapts the allowed value corridor per region. AQClip can operate in a proxy mode using local structure statistics or in an attention entropy guided mode (model confidence). Integrated into the CADE 2.5 rendering pipeline, QSilk yields cleaner, sharper results at low step counts and ultra-high resolutions with negligible overhead. It requires no training or fine-tuning and exposes minimal user controls. We report consistent qualitative improvements across SD/SDXL backbones and show synergy with CFG/Rescale, enabling slightly higher guidance without artifacts.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The scale and quality of datasets are crucial for training robust perception models. However, obtaining large-scale annotated data is both costly and time-consuming. Generative models have emerged as a powerful tool for data augmentation by synthesizing samples that adhere to desired distributions. However, current generative approaches often rely on complex post-processing or extensive fine-tuning on massive datasets to achieve satisfactory results, and they remain prone to content-position mismatches and semantic leakage. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ReCon, a novel augmentation framework that enhances the capacity of structure-controllable generative models for object detection. ReCon integrates region-guided rectification into the diffusion sampling process, using feedback from a pre-trained perception model to rectify misgenerated regions within diffusion sampling process. We further propose region-aligned cross-attention to enforce spatial-semantic alignment between image regions and their textual cues, thereby improving both semantic consistency and overall image fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReCon substantially improve the quality and trainability of generated data, achieving consistent performance gains across various datasets, backbone architectures, and data scales.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Pretrained time series models have enabled inference-only forecasting systems that produce accurate predictions without task-specific training. However, existing approaches largely focus on univariate forecasting, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios where multivariate data and covariates play a crucial role. We present Chronos-2, a pretrained model capable of handling univariate, multivariate, and covariate-informed forecasting tasks in a zero-shot manner. Chronos-2 employs a group attention mechanism that facilitates in-context learning (ICL) through efficient information sharing across multiple time series within a group, which may represent sets of related series, variates of a multivariate series, or targets and covariates in a forecasting task. These general capabilities are achieved through training on synthetic datasets that impose diverse multivariate structures on univariate series. Chronos-2 delivers state-of-the-art performance across three comprehensive benchmarks: fev-bench, GIFT-Eval, and Chronos Benchmark II. On fev-bench, which emphasizes multivariate and covariate-informed forecasting, Chronos-2's universal ICL capabilities lead to substantial improvements over existing models. On tasks involving covariates, it consistently outperforms baselines by a wide margin. Case studies in the energy and retail domains further highlight its practical advantages. The in-context learning capabilities of Chronos-2 establish it as a general-purpose forecasting model that can be used "as is" in real-world forecasting pipelines.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Rendering novel, relit views of a human head, given a monocular portrait image as input, is an inherently underconstrained problem. The traditional graphics solution is to explicitly decompose the input image into geometry, material and lighting via differentiable rendering; but this is constrained by the multiple assumptions and approximations of the underlying models and parameterizations of these scene components. We propose 3DPR, an image-based relighting model that leverages generative priors learnt from multi-view One-Light-at-A-Time (OLAT) images captured in a light stage. We introduce a new diverse and large-scale multi-view 4K OLAT dataset of 139 subjects to learn a high-quality prior over the distribution of high-frequency face reflectance. We leverage the latent space of a pre-trained generative head model that provides a rich prior over face geometry learnt from in-the-wild image datasets. The input portrait is first embedded in the latent manifold of such a model through an encoder-based inversion process. Then a novel triplane-based reflectance network trained on our lightstage data is used to synthesize high-fidelity OLAT images to enable image-based relighting. Our reflectance network operates in the latent space of the generative head model, crucially enabling a relatively small number of lightstage images to train the reflectance model. Combining the generated OLATs according to a given HDRI environment maps yields physically accurate environmental relighting results. Through quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we demonstrate that 3DPR outperforms previous methods, particularly in preserving identity and in capturing lighting effects such as specularities, self-shadows, and subsurface scattering.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Slot filling is a crucial subtask in spoken language understanding (SLU), traditionally implemented as a cascade of speech recognition followed by one or more natural language understanding (NLU) components. The recent advent of speech-based large language models (speechLLMs), which integrate speech and textual foundation models, has opened new avenues for achieving speech understanding tasks in a more unified, generative, and instruction-following manner while promising data and compute efficiency with zero-shot abilities, generalizing to unseen slot labels. We address the slot-filling task by creating an empirical upper bound for the task, identifying performance, robustness, and generalization gaps, and proposing improvements to the training data, architecture, and training strategies to narrow the gap with the upper bound result. We show that each of these measures improve performance substantially, while highlighting practical challenges and providing empirical guidance and insights for harnessing these emerging models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present BLIP3o-NEXT, a fully open-source foundation model in the BLIP3 series that advances the next frontier of native image generation. BLIP3o-NEXT unifies text-to-image generation and image editing within a single architecture, demonstrating strong image generation and image editing capabilities. In developing the state-of-the-art native image generation model, we identify four key insights: (1) Most architectural choices yield comparable performance; an architecture can be deemed effective provided it scales efficiently and supports fast inference; (2) The successful application of reinforcement learning can further push the frontier of native image generation; (3) Image editing still remains a challenging task, yet instruction following and the consistency between generated and reference images can be significantly enhanced through post-training and data engine; (4) Data quality and scale continue to be decisive factors that determine the upper bound of model performance. Building upon these insights, BLIP3o-NEXT leverages an Autoregressive + Diffusion architecture in which an autoregressive model first generates discrete image tokens conditioned on multimodal inputs, whose hidden states are then used as conditioning signals for a diffusion model to generate high-fidelity images. This architecture integrates the reasoning strength and instruction following of autoregressive models with the fine-detail rendering ability of diffusion models, achieving a new level of coherence and realism. Extensive evaluations of various text-to-image and image-editing benchmarks show that BLIP3o-NEXT achieves superior performance over existing models.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Lens flare significantly degrades image quality, impacting critical computer vision tasks like object detection and autonomous driving. Recent Single Image Flare Removal (SIFR) methods perform poorly when off-frame light sources are incomplete or absent. We propose LightsOut, a diffusion-based outpainting framework tailored to enhance SIFR by reconstructing off-frame light sources. Our method leverages a multitask regression module and LoRA fine-tuned diffusion model to ensure realistic and physically consistent outpainting results. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate LightsOut consistently boosts the performance of existing SIFR methods across challenging scenarios without additional retraining, serving as a universally applicable plug-and-play preprocessing solution.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Synthesizing large-scale, explorable, and geometrically accurate 3D urban scenes is a challenging yet valuable task in providing immersive and embodied applications. The challenges lie in the lack of large-scale and high-quality real-world 3D scans for training generalizable generative models. In this paper, we take an alternative route to create large-scale 3D scenes by synergizing the readily available satellite imagery that supplies realistic coarse geometry and the open-domain diffusion model for creating high-quality close-up appearances. We propose \textbf{Skyfall-GS}, the first city-block scale 3D scene creation framework without costly 3D annotations, also featuring real-time, immersive 3D exploration. We tailor a curriculum-driven iterative refinement strategy to progressively enhance geometric completeness and photorealistic textures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Skyfall-GS provides improved cross-view consistent geometry and more realistic textures compared to state-of-the-art approaches.
