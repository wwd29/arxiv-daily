<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Next-frame prediction is a useful and powerful method for modelling and understanding the dynamics of video data. Inspired by the empirical success of causal language modelling and next-token prediction in language modelling, we explore the extent to which next-frame prediction serves as a strong foundational learning strategy (analogous to language modelling) for inducing an understanding of the visual world. In order to quantify the specific visual understanding induced by next-frame prediction, we introduce six diagnostic simulation video datasets derived from fundamental physical laws created by varying physical constants such as gravity and mass. We demonstrate that our models trained only on next-frame prediction are capable of predicting the value of these physical constants (e.g. gravity) without having been trained directly to learn these constants via a regression task. We find that the generative training phase alone induces a model state that can predict physical constants significantly better than that of a random model, improving the loss by a factor of between 1.28 to 6.24. We conclude that next-frame prediction shows great promise as a general learning strategy to induce understanding of the many `laws' that govern the visual domain without the need for explicit labelling.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We re-examine the problem of reconstructing a high-dimensional signal from a small set of linear measurements, in combination with image prior from a diffusion probabilistic model. Well-established methods for optimizing such measurements include principal component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA) and compressed sensing (CS), all of which rely on axis- or subspace-aligned statistical characterization. But many naturally occurring signals, including photographic images, contain richer statistical structure. To exploit such structure, we introduce a general method for obtaining an optimized set of linear measurements, assuming a Bayesian inverse solution that leverages the prior implicit in a neural network trained to perform denoising. We demonstrate that these measurements are distinct from those of PCA and CS, with significant improvements in minimizing squared reconstruction error. In addition, we show that optimizing the measurements for the SSIM perceptual loss leads to perceptually improved reconstruction. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating the specific statistical regularities of natural signals when designing effective linear measurements.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated Class Incremental Learning (FCIL) is a critical yet largely underexplored issue that deals with the dynamic incorporation of new classes within federated learning (FL). Existing methods often employ generative adversarial networks (GANs) to produce synthetic images to address privacy concerns in FL. However, GANs exhibit inherent instability and high sensitivity, compromising the effectiveness of these methods. In this paper, we introduce a novel data-free federated class incremental learning framework with diffusion-based generative memory (DFedDGM) to mitigate catastrophic forgetting by generating stable, high-quality images through diffusion models. We design a new balanced sampler to help train the diffusion models to alleviate the common non-IID problem in FL, and introduce an entropy-based sample filtering technique from an information theory perspective to enhance the quality of generative samples. Finally, we integrate knowledge distillation with a feature-based regularization term for better knowledge transfer. Our framework does not incur additional communication costs compared to the baseline FedAvg method. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines, e.g., over a 4% improvement in average accuracy on the Tiny-ImageNet dataset.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Human mobility significantly impacts various aspects of society, including transportation, urban planning, and public health. The increasing availability of diverse mobility data and advancements in deep learning have revolutionized mobility modeling. Existing deep learning models, however, mainly study spatio-temporal patterns using trajectories and often fall short in capturing the underlying semantic interdependency among activities. Moreover, they are also constrained by the data source. These two factors thereby limit their realism and adaptability, respectively. Meanwhile, traditional activity-based models (ABMs) in transportation modeling rely on rigid assumptions and are costly and time-consuming to calibrate, making them difficult to adapt and scale to new regions, especially those regions with limited amount of required conventional travel data. To address these limitations, we develop a novel generative deep learning approach for human mobility modeling and synthesis, using ubiquitous and open-source data. Additionally, the model can be fine-tuned with local data, enabling adaptable and accurate representations of mobility patterns across different regions. The model is evaluated on a nationwide dataset of the United States, where it demonstrates superior performance in generating activity chains that closely follow ground truth distributions. Further tests using state- or city-specific datasets from California, Washington, and Mexico City confirm its transferability. This innovative approach offers substantial potential to advance mobility modeling research, especially in generating human activity chains as input for downstream activity-based mobility simulation models and providing enhanced tools for urban planners and policymakers.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text-to-image diffusion models can be fine-tuned in custom domains to adapt to specific user preferences, but such unconstrained adaptability has also been utilized for illegal purposes, such as forging public figures' portraits and duplicating copyrighted artworks. Most existing work focuses on detecting the illegally generated contents, but cannot prevent or mitigate illegal adaptations of diffusion models. Other schemes of model unlearning and reinitialization, similarly, cannot prevent users from relearning the knowledge of illegal model adaptation with custom data. In this paper, we present FreezeAsGuard, a new technique that addresses these limitations and enables irreversible mitigation of illegal adaptations of diffusion models. The basic approach is that the model publisher selectively freezes tensors in pre-trained diffusion models that are critical to illegal model adaptations, to mitigate the fine-tuned model's representation power in illegal domains but minimize the impact on legal model adaptations in other domains. Such tensor freezing can be enforced via APIs provided by the model publisher for fine-tuning, can motivate users' adoption due to its computational savings. Experiment results with datasets in multiple domains show that FreezeAsGuard provides stronger power in mitigating illegal model adaptations of generating fake public figures' portraits, while having the minimum impact on model adaptation in other legal domains.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Fault detection is a key challenge in the management of complex systems. In the context of SparkCognition's efforts towards predictive maintenance in large scale industrial systems, this problem is often framed in terms of anomaly detection - identifying patterns of behavior in the data which deviate from normal. Patterns of normal behavior aren't captured simply in the coarse statistics of measured signals. Rather, the multivariate sequential pattern itself can be indicative of normal vs. abnormal behavior. For this reason, normal behavior modeling that relies on snapshots of the data without taking into account temporal relationships as they evolve would be lacking. However, common strategies for dealing with temporal dependence, such as Recurrent Neural Networks or attention mechanisms are oftentimes computationally expensive and difficult to train. In this paper, we propose a fast and efficient approach to anomaly detection and alert filtering based on sequential pattern similarities. In our empirical analysis section, we show how this approach can be leveraged for a variety of purposes involving anomaly detection on a large scale real-world industrial system. Subsequently, we test our approach on a publicly-available dataset in order to establish its general applicability and robustness compared to a state-of-the-art baseline. We also demonstrate an efficient way of optimizing the framework based on an alert recall objective function.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) faces the significant challenge of adversarial or unreliable vehicles in vehicular networks, which can compromise the model's integrity through misleading updates. Addressing this, our study introduces a novel framework that integrates dynamic vehicle selection and robust anomaly detection mechanisms, aiming to optimize participant selection and mitigate risks associated with malicious contributions. Our approach involves a comprehensive vehicle reliability assessment, considering historical accuracy, contribution frequency, and anomaly records. An anomaly detection algorithm is utilized to identify anomalous behavior by analyzing the cosine similarity of local or model parameters during the federated learning (FL) process. These anomaly records are then registered and combined with past performance for accuracy and contribution frequency to identify the most suitable vehicles for each learning round. Dynamic client selection and anomaly detection algorithms are deployed at different levels, including cluster heads (CHs), cluster members (CMs), and the Evolving Packet Core (EPC), to detect and filter out spurious updates. Through simulation-based performance evaluation, our proposed algorithm demonstrates remarkable resilience even under intense attack conditions. Even in the worst-case scenarios, it achieves convergence times at $63$\% as effective as those in scenarios without any attacks. Conversely, in scenarios without utilizing our proposed algorithm, there is a high likelihood of non-convergence in the FL process.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The smoothing issue leads to indistinguishable node representations, which poses a significant challenge in the field of graph learning. However, this issue also presents an opportunity to reveal underlying properties behind different types of nodes, which have been overlooked in previous studies. Through empirical and theoretical analysis of real-world node anomaly detection (NAD) datasets, we observe that anomalous and normal nodes show different patterns in the smoothing process, which can be leveraged to enhance NAD tasks. Motivated by these findings, in this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised NAD framework. Specifically, according to our theoretical analysis, we design a Smoothing Learning Component. Subsequently, we introduce a Smoothing-aware Spectral Graph Neural Network, which establishes the connection between the spectral space of graphs and the smoothing process. Additionally, we demonstrate that the Dirichlet Energy, which reflects the smoothness of a graph, can serve as coefficients for node representations across different dimensions of the spectral space. Building upon these observations and analyses, we devise a novel anomaly measure for the NAD task. Extensive experiments on 9 real-world datasets show that SmoothGNN outperforms the best rival by an average of 14.66% in AUC and 7.28% in Precision, with 75x running time speed-up, which validates the effectiveness and efficiency of our framework.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The landscape of computer graphics has undergone significant transformations with the recent advances of differentiable rendering models. These rendering models often rely on heuristic designs that may not fully align with the final rendering objectives. We address this gap by pioneering \textit{evolutive rendering models}, a methodology where rendering models possess the ability to evolve and adapt dynamically throughout the rendering process. In particular, we present a comprehensive learning framework that enables the optimization of three principal rendering elements, including the gauge transformations, the ray sampling mechanisms, and the primitive organization. Central to this framework is the development of differentiable versions of these rendering elements, allowing for effective gradient backpropagation from the final rendering objectives. A detailed analysis of gradient characteristics is performed to facilitate a stable and goal-oriented elements evolution. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the large potential of evolutive rendering models for enhancing the rendering performance across various domains, including static and dynamic scene representations, generative modeling, and texture mapping.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent text-to-image customization works have been proven successful in generating images of given concepts by fine-tuning the diffusion models on a few examples. However, these methods tend to overfit the concepts, resulting in failure to create the concept under multiple conditions (e.g. headphone is missing when generating a <sks> dog wearing a headphone'). Interestingly, we notice that the base model before fine-tuning exhibits the capability to compose the base concept with other elements (e.g. a dog wearing a headphone) implying that the compositional ability only disappears after personalization tuning. Inspired by this observation, we present ClassDiffusion, a simple technique that leverages a semantic preservation loss to explicitly regulate the concept space when learning the new concept. Despite its simplicity, this helps avoid semantic drift when fine-tuning on the target concepts. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that the use of semantic preservation loss effectively improves the compositional abilities of the fine-tune models. In response to the ineffective evaluation of CLIP-T metrics, we introduce BLIP2-T metric, a more equitable and effective evaluation metric for this particular domain. We also provide in-depth empirical study and theoretical analysis to better understand the role of the proposed loss. Lastly, we also extend our ClassDiffusion to personalized video generation, demonstrating its flexibility.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>3D open-vocabulary scene understanding, crucial for advancing augmented reality and robotic applications, involves interpreting and locating specific regions within a 3D space as directed by natural language instructions. To this end, we introduce GOI, a framework that integrates semantic features from 2D vision-language foundation models into 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and identifies 3D Gaussians of Interest using an Optimizable Semantic-space Hyperplane. Our approach includes an efficient compression method that utilizes scene priors to condense noisy high-dimensional semantic features into compact low-dimensional vectors, which are subsequently embedded in 3DGS. During the open-vocabulary querying process, we adopt a distinct approach compared to existing methods, which depend on a manually set fixed empirical threshold to select regions based on their semantic feature distance to the query text embedding. This traditional approach often lacks universal accuracy, leading to challenges in precisely identifying specific target areas. Instead, our method treats the feature selection process as a hyperplane division within the feature space, retaining only those features that are highly relevant to the query. We leverage off-the-shelf 2D Referring Expression Segmentation (RES) models to fine-tune the semantic-space hyperplane, enabling a more precise distinction between target regions and others. This fine-tuning substantially improves the accuracy of open-vocabulary queries, ensuring the precise localization of pertinent 3D Gaussians. Extensive experiments demonstrate GOI's superiority over previous state-of-the-art methods. Our project page is available at this https URL .</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Supervised multi-modal learning involves mapping multiple modalities to a target label. Previous studies in this field have concentrated on capturing in isolation either the inter-modality dependencies (the relationships between different modalities and the label) or the intra-modality dependencies (the relationships within a single modality and the label). We argue that these conventional approaches that rely solely on either inter- or intra-modality dependencies may not be optimal in general. We view the multi-modal learning problem from the lens of generative models where we consider the target as a source of multiple modalities and the interaction between them. Towards that end, we propose inter- & intra-modality modeling (I2M2) framework, which captures and integrates both the inter- and intra-modality dependencies, leading to more accurate predictions. We evaluate our approach using real-world healthcare and vision-and-language datasets with state-of-the-art models, demonstrating superior performance over traditional methods focusing only on one type of modality dependency.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Retrosynthesis, the task of identifying precursors for a given molecule, can be naturally framed as a conditional graph generation task. Diffusion models are a particularly promising modelling approach, enabling post-hoc conditioning and trading off quality for speed during generation. We show mathematically that permutation equivariant denoisers severely limit the expressiveness of graph diffusion models and thus their adaptation to retrosynthesis. To address this limitation, we relax the equivariance requirement such that it only applies to aligned permutations of the conditioning and the generated graphs obtained through atom mapping. Our new denoiser achieves the highest top-$1$ accuracy ($54.7$\%) across template-free and template-based methods on USPTO-50k. We also demonstrate the ability for flexible post-training conditioning and good sample quality with small diffusion step counts, highlighting the potential for interactive applications and additional controls for multi-step planning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>There is a rapidly growing interest in controlling consistency across multiple generated images using diffusion models. Among various methods, recent works have found that simply manipulating attention modules by concatenating features from multiple reference images provides an efficient approach to enhancing consistency without fine-tuning. Despite its popularity and success, few studies have elucidated the underlying mechanisms that contribute to its effectiveness. In this work, we reveal that the popular approach is a linear interpolation of image self-attention and cross-attention between synthesized content and reference features, with a constant rank-1 coefficient. Motivated by this observation, we find that a rank-1 coefficient is not necessary and simplifies the controllable generation mechanism. The resulting algorithm, which we coin as RefDrop, allows users to control the influence of reference context in a direct and precise manner. Besides further enhancing consistency in single-subject image generation, our method also enables more interesting applications, such as the consistent generation of multiple subjects, suppressing specific features to encourage more diverse content, and high-quality personalized video generation by boosting temporal consistency. Even compared with state-of-the-art image-prompt-based generators, such as IP-Adapter, RefDrop is competitive in terms of controllability and quality while avoiding the need to train a separate image encoder for feature injection from reference images, making it a versatile plug-and-play solution for any image or video diffusion model.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Constructing fast samplers for unconditional diffusion and flow-matching models has received much attention recently; however, existing methods for solving inverse problems, such as super-resolution, inpainting, or deblurring, still require hundreds to thousands of iterative steps to obtain high-quality results. We propose a plug-and-play framework for constructing efficient samplers for inverse problems, requiring only pre-trained diffusion or flow-matching models. We present Conditional Conjugate Integrators, which leverage the specific form of the inverse problem to project the respective conditional diffusion/flow dynamics into a more amenable space for sampling. Our method complements popular posterior approximation methods for solving inverse problems using diffusion/flow models. We evaluate the proposed method's performance on various linear image restoration tasks across multiple datasets, employing diffusion and flow-matching models. Notably, on challenging inverse problems like 4$\times$ super-resolution on the ImageNet dataset, our method can generate high-quality samples in as few as 5 conditional sampling steps and outperforms competing baselines requiring 20-1000 steps.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This work addresses the challenge of achieving zero-shot adversarial robustness while preserving zero-shot generalization in large-scale foundation models, with a focus on the popular Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP). Although foundation models were reported to have exceptional zero-shot generalization, they are highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. Existing methods achieve a comparable good tradeoff between zero-shot adversarial robustness and generalization under small adversarial perturbations. However, they fail to achieve a good tradeoff under large adversarial perturbations. To this end, we propose a novel Text-Image Mutual Awareness (TIMA) method that strikes a balance between zero-shot adversarial robustness and generalization. More precisely, we propose an Image-Aware Text (IAT) tuning mechanism that increases the inter-class distance of text embeddings by incorporating the Minimum Hyperspherical Energy (MHE). Simultaneously, fixed pre-trained image embeddings are used as cross-modal auxiliary supervision to maintain the similarity between the MHE-tuned and original text embeddings by the knowledge distillation, preserving semantic information between different classes. Besides, we introduce a Text-Aware Image (TAI) tuning mechanism, which increases inter-class distance between image embeddings during the training stage by Text-distance based Adaptive Margin (TAM). Similarly, a knowledge distillation is utilized to retain the similarity between fine-tuned and pre-trained image embeddings. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing impressive zero-shot performance against a wide range of adversarial perturbations while preserving the zero-shot generalization capabilities of the original CLIP model.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Understanding multi-agent behavior is critical across various fields. The conventional approach involves analyzing agent movements through three primary tasks: trajectory prediction, imputation, and spatial-temporal recovery. Considering the unique input formulation and constraint of these tasks, most existing methods are tailored to address only one specific task. However, in real-world applications, these scenarios frequently occur simultaneously. Consequently, methods designed for one task often fail to adapt to others, resulting in performance drops. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Unified Trajectory Generation model, UniTraj, that processes arbitrary trajectories as masked inputs, adaptable to diverse scenarios. Specifically, we introduce a Ghost Spatial Masking (GSM) module embedded within a Transformer encoder for spatial feature extraction. We further extend recent successful State Space Models (SSMs), particularly the Mamba model, into a Bidirectional Temporal Mamba to effectively capture temporal dependencies. Additionally, we incorporate a Bidirectional Temporal Scaled (BTS) module to comprehensively scan trajectories while maintaining the temporal missing relationships within the sequence. We curate and benchmark three practical sports game datasets, Basketball-U, Football-U, and Soccer-U, for evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that addresses this unified problem through a versatile generative framework, thereby enhancing our understanding of multi-agent movement.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Egocentric video-language pretraining is a crucial paradigm to advance the learning of egocentric hand-object interactions (EgoHOI). Despite the great success on existing testbeds, these benchmarks focus more on closed-set visual concepts or limited scenarios. Due to the occurrence of diverse EgoHOIs in the real world, we propose an open-vocabulary benchmark named EgoHOIBench to reveal the diminished performance of current egocentric video-language models (EgoVLM) on fined-grained concepts, indicating that these models still lack a full spectrum of egocentric understanding. We attribute this performance gap to insufficient fine-grained supervision and strong bias towards understanding objects rather than temporal dynamics in current methods. To tackle these issues, we introduce a novel asymmetric contrastive objective for EgoHOI named EgoNCE++. For video-to-text loss, we enhance text supervision through the generation of negative captions by leveraging the in-context learning of large language models to perform HOI-related word substitution. For text-to-video loss, we propose an object-centric positive video sampling strategy that aggregates video representations by the same nouns. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that EgoNCE++ significantly boosts open-vocabulary HOI recognition, multi-instance retrieval, and action recognition tasks across various egocentric models, with improvements of up to +26.55%.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Research efforts to understand neural signals have been ongoing for many years, with visual decoding from fMRI signals attracting considerable attention. Particularly, the advent of image diffusion models has advanced the reconstruction of images from fMRI data significantly. However, existing approaches often introduce inter- and intra- subject variations in the reconstructed images, which can compromise accuracy. To address current limitations in multi-subject brain decoding, we introduce a new Transformer architecture called MindFormer. This model is specifically designed to generate fMRI-conditioned feature vectors that can be used for conditioning Stable Diffusion model. More specifically, MindFormer incorporates two key innovations: 1) a novel training strategy based on the IP-Adapter to extract semantically meaningful features from fMRI signals, and 2) a subject specific token and linear layer that effectively capture individual differences in fMRI signals while synergistically combines multi subject fMRI data for training. Our experimental results demonstrate that Stable Diffusion, when integrated with MindFormer, produces semantically consistent images across different subjects. This capability significantly surpasses existing models in multi-subject brain decoding. Such advancements not only improve the accuracy of our reconstructions but also deepen our understanding of neural processing variations among individuals.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Sleep is a complex physiological process evaluated through various modalities recording electrical brain, cardiac, and respiratory activities. We curate a large polysomnography dataset from over 14,000 participants comprising over 100,000 hours of multi-modal sleep recordings. Leveraging this extensive dataset, we developed SleepFM, the first multi-modal foundation model for sleep analysis. We show that a novel leave-one-out approach for contrastive learning significantly improves downstream task performance compared to representations from standard pairwise contrastive learning. A logistic regression model trained on SleepFM's learned embeddings outperforms an end-to-end trained convolutional neural network (CNN) on sleep stage classification (macro AUROC 0.88 vs 0.72 and macro AUPRC 0.72 vs 0.48) and sleep disordered breathing detection (AUROC 0.85 vs 0.69 and AUPRC 0.77 vs 0.61). Notably, the learned embeddings achieve 48% top-1 average accuracy in retrieving the corresponding recording clips of other modalities from 90,000 candidates. This work demonstrates the value of holistic multi-modal sleep modeling to fully capture the richness of sleep recordings. SleepFM is open source and available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Protein-protein interactions are central mediators in many biological processes. Accurately predicting the effects of mutations on interactions is crucial for guiding the modulation of these interactions, thereby playing a significant role in therapeutic development and drug discovery. Mutations generally affect interactions hierarchically across three levels: mutated residues exhibit different sidechain conformations, which lead to changes in the backbone conformation, eventually affecting the binding affinity between proteins. However, existing methods typically focus only on sidechain-level interaction modeling, resulting in suboptimal predictions. In this work, we propose a self-supervised multi-level pre-training framework, ProMIM, to fully capture all three levels of interactions with well-designed pretraining objectives. Experiments show ProMIM outperforms all the baselines on the standard benchmark, especially on mutations where significant changes in backbone conformations may occur. In addition, leading results from zero-shot evaluations for SARS-CoV-2 mutational effect prediction and antibody optimization underscore the potential of ProMIM as a powerful next-generation tool for developing novel therapeutic approaches and new drugs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The fusion of a low-resolution hyperspectral image (LR-HSI) with a high-resolution multispectral image (HR-MSI) has emerged as an effective technique for achieving HSI super-resolution (SR). Previous studies have mainly concentrated on estimating the posterior distribution of the latent high-resolution hyperspectral image (HR-HSI), leveraging an appropriate image prior and likelihood computed from the discrepancy between the latent HSI and observed images. Low rankness stands out for preserving latent HSI characteristics through matrix factorization among the various priors. However, this method only enhances resolution within the dimensions of the two modalities. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel continuous low-rank factorization (CLoRF) by integrating two neural representations into the matrix factorization, capturing spatial and spectral information, respectively. This approach enables us to harness both the low rankness from the matrix factorization and the continuity from neural representation in a self-supervised manner. Theoretically, we prove the low-rank property and Lipschitz continuity in the proposed continuous low-rank factorization. Experimentally, our method significantly surpasses existing techniques and achieves user-desired resolutions without the need for neural network retraining.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present Diffusion Model Patching (DMP), a simple method to boost the performance of pre-trained diffusion models that have already reached convergence, with a negligible increase in parameters. DMP inserts a small, learnable set of prompts into the model's input space while keeping the original model frozen. The effectiveness of DMP is not merely due to the addition of parameters but stems from its dynamic gating mechanism, which selects and combines a subset of learnable prompts at every step of the generative process (e.g., reverse denoising steps). This strategy, which we term "mixture-of-prompts", enables the model to draw on the distinct expertise of each prompt, essentially "patching" the model's functionality at every step with minimal yet specialized parameters. Uniquely, DMP enhances the model by further training on the same dataset on which it was originally trained, even in a scenario where significant improvements are typically not expected due to model convergence. Experiments show that DMP significantly enhances the converged FID of DiT-L/2 on FFHQ 256x256 by 10.38%, achieved with only a 1.43% parameter increase and 50K additional training iterations.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the emergence of diffusion models as the frontline of generative models, many researchers have proposed molecule generation techniques using conditional diffusion models. However, due to the fundamental nature of a molecule, which carries highly entangled correlations within a small number of atoms and bonds, it becomes difficult for a model to connect raw data with the conditions when the conditions become more complex as natural language. To address this, here we present a novel latent diffusion model dubbed LDMol, which enables a natural text-conditioned molecule generation. Specifically, LDMol is composed of three building blocks: a molecule encoder that produces a chemically informative feature space, a natural language-conditioned latent diffusion model using a Diffusion Transformer (DiT), and an autoregressive decoder for molecule re. In particular, recognizing that multiple SMILES notations can represent the same molecule, we employ a contrastive learning strategy to extract the chemical informative feature space. LDMol not only beats the existing baselines on the text-to-molecule generation benchmark but is also capable of zero-shot inference with unseen scenarios. Furthermore, we show that LDMol can be applied to downstream tasks such as molecule-to-text retrieval and text-driven molecule editing, demonstrating its versatility as a diffusion model.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Creating multilingual task-oriented dialogue (TOD) agents is challenging due to the high cost of training data acquisition. Following the research trend of improving training data efficiency, we show for the first time, that in-context learning is sufficient to tackle multilingual TOD. To handle the challenging dialogue state tracking (DST) subtask, we break it down to simpler steps that are more compatible with in-context learning where only a handful of few-shot examples are used. We test our approach on the multilingual TOD dataset X-RiSAWOZ, which has 12 domains in Chinese, English, French, Korean, Hindi, and code-mixed Hindi-English. Our turn-by-turn DST accuracy on the 6 languages range from 55.6% to 80.3%, seemingly worse than the SOTA results from fine-tuned models that achieve from 60.7% to 82.8%; our BLEU scores in the response generation (RG) subtask are also significantly lower than SOTA. However, after manual evaluation of the validation set, we find that by correcting gold label errors and improving dataset annotation schema, GPT-4 with our prompts can achieve (1) 89.6%-96.8% accuracy in DST, and (2) more than 99% correct response generation across different languages. This leads us to conclude that current automatic metrics heavily underestimate the effectiveness of in-context learning.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this study, we aim to construct an audio-video generative model with minimal computational cost by leveraging pre-trained single-modal generative models for audio and video. To achieve this, we propose a novel method that guides each single-modal model to cooperatively generate well-aligned samples across modalities. Specifically, given two pre-trained base diffusion models, we train a lightweight joint guidance module to adjust scores separately estimated by the base models to match the score of joint distribution over audio and video. We theoretically show that this guidance can be computed through the gradient of the optimal discriminator distinguishing real audio-video pairs from fake ones independently generated by the base models. On the basis of this analysis, we construct the joint guidance module by training this discriminator. Additionally, we adopt a loss function to make the gradient of the discriminator work as a noise estimator, as in standard diffusion models, stabilizing the gradient of the discriminator. Empirical evaluations on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method improves both single-modal fidelity and multi-modal alignment with a relatively small number of parameters.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models have achieved significant visual generation quality. However, their significant computational and memory costs pose challenge for their application on resource-constrained mobile devices or even desktop GPUs. Recent few-step diffusion models reduces the inference time by reducing the denoising steps. However, their memory consumptions are still excessive. The Post Training Quantization (PTQ) replaces high bit-width FP representation with low-bit integer values (INT4/8) , which is an effective and efficient technique to reduce the memory cost. However, when applying to few-step diffusion models, existing quantization methods face challenges in preserving both the image quality and text alignment. To address this issue, we propose an mixed-precision quantization framework - MixDQ. Firstly, We design specialized BOS-aware quantization method for highly sensitive text embedding quantization. Then, we conduct metric-decoupled sensitivity analysis to measure the sensitivity of each layer. Finally, we develop an integer-programming-based method to conduct bit-width allocation. While existing quantization methods fall short at W8A8, MixDQ could achieve W8A8 without performance loss, and W4A8 with negligible visual degradation. Compared with FP16, we achieve 3-4x reduction in model size and memory cost, and 1.45x latency speedup.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion planners have shown promise in handling long-horizon and sparse-reward tasks due to the non-autoregressive plan generation. However, their inherent stochastic risk of generating infeasible trajectories presents significant challenges to their reliability and stability. We introduce a novel approach, the Trajectory Aggregation Tree (TAT), to address this issue in diffusion planners. Compared to prior methods that rely solely on raw trajectory predictions, TAT aggregates information from both historical and current trajectories, forming a dynamic tree-like structure. Each trajectory is conceptualized as a branch and individual states as nodes. As the structure evolves with the integration of new trajectories, unreliable states are marginalized, and the most impactful nodes are prioritized for decision-making. TAT can be deployed without modifying the original training and sampling pipelines of diffusion planners, making it a training-free, ready-to-deploy solution. We provide both theoretical analysis and empirical evidence to support TAT's effectiveness. Our results highlight its remarkable ability to resist the risk from unreliable trajectories, guarantee the performance boosting of diffusion planners in $100\%$ of tasks, and exhibit an appreciable tolerance margin for sample quality, thereby enabling planning with a more than $3\times$ acceleration.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in powerful pre-trained diffusion models encourage the development of methods to improve the sampling performance under well-trained diffusion models. This paper introduces Diffusion Rejection Sampling (DiffRS), which uses a rejection sampling scheme that aligns the sampling transition kernels with the true ones at each timestep. The proposed method can be viewed as a mechanism that evaluates the quality of samples at each intermediate timestep and refines them with varying effort depending on the sample. Theoretical analysis shows that DiffRS can achieve a tighter bound on sampling error compared to pre-trained models. Empirical results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of DiffRS on the benchmark datasets and the effectiveness of DiffRS for fast diffusion samplers and large-scale text-to-image diffusion models.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative modeling of crystal structures is significantly challenged by the complexity of input data, which constrains the ability of these models to explore and discover novel crystals. This complexity often confines de novo design methodologies to merely small perturbations of known crystals and hampers the effective application of advanced optimization techniques. One such optimization technique, Latent Space Bayesian Optimization (LSBO) has demonstrated promising results in uncovering novel objects across various domains, especially when combined with Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). Recognizing LSBO's potential and the critical need for innovative crystal discovery, we introduce Crystal-LSBO, a de novo design framework for crystals specifically tailored to enhance explorability within LSBO frameworks. Crystal-LSBO employs multiple VAEs, each dedicated to a distinct aspect of crystal structure: lattice, coordinates, and chemical elements, orchestrated by an integrative model that synthesizes these components into a cohesive output. This setup not only streamlines the learning process but also produces explorable latent spaces thanks to the decreased complexity of the learning task for each model, enabling LSBO approaches to operate. Our study pioneers the use of LSBO for de novo crystal design, demonstrating its efficacy through optimization tasks focused mainly on formation energy values. Our results highlight the effectiveness of our methodology, offering a new perspective for de novo crystal discovery.</li>

However, their application to discrete data types, such as language, has often been suboptimal compared to autoregressive generative models. This paper tackles the challenge of improving discrete diffusion models by introducing a structured forward process that leverages the inherent information hierarchy in discrete categories, such as words in text. Our approach biases the generative process to produce certain categories before others, resulting in a notable improvement in log-likelihood scores on the text8 dataset.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The objective of traffic prediction is to accurately forecast and analyze the dynamics of transportation patterns, considering both space and time. However, the presence of distribution shift poses a significant challenge in this field, as existing models struggle to generalize well when faced with test data that significantly differs from the training distribution. To tackle this issue, this paper introduces a simple and universal spatio-temporal prompt-tuning framework-FlashST, which adapts pre-trained models to the specific characteristics of diverse downstream datasets, improving generalization in diverse traffic prediction scenarios. Specifically, the FlashST framework employs a lightweight spatio-temporal prompt network for in-context learning, capturing spatio-temporal invariant knowledge and facilitating effective adaptation to diverse scenarios. Additionally, we incorporate a distribution mapping mechanism to align the data distributions of pre-training and downstream data, facilitating effective knowledge transfer in spatio-temporal forecasting. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our FlashST across different spatio-temporal prediction tasks using diverse urban datasets. Code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Quantifying sarcomere structure organization in human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) is crucial for understanding cardiac disease pathology, improving drug screening, and advancing regenerative medicine. Traditional methods, such as manual annotation and Fourier transform analysis, are labor-intensive, error-prone, and lack high-throughput capabilities. In this study, we present a novel deep learning-based framework that leverages cell images and integrates cell features to automatically evaluate the sarcomere structure of hiPSC-CMs from the onset of differentiation. This framework overcomes the limitations of traditional methods through automated, high-throughput analysis, providing consistent, reliable results while accurately detecting complex sarcomere patterns across diverse samples. The proposed framework contains the SarcNet, a linear layers-added ResNet-18 module, to output a continuous score ranging from one to five that captures the level of sarcomere structure organization. It is trained and validated on an open-source dataset of hiPSC-CMs images with the endogenously GFP-tagged alpha-actinin-2 structure developed by the Allen Institute for Cell Science (AICS). SarcNet achieves a Spearman correlation of 0.831 with expert evaluations, demonstrating superior performance and an improvement of 0.075 over the current state-of-the-art approach, which uses Linear Regression. Our results also show a consistent pattern of increasing organization from day 18 to day 32 of differentiation, aligning with expert evaluations. By integrating the quantitative features calculated directly from the images with the visual features learned during the deep learning model, our framework offers a more comprehensive and accurate assessment, thereby enhancing the further utility of hiPSC-CMs in medical research and therapy development.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper addresses image copy detection, a task in online sharing platforms for copyright protection. While previous approaches have performed exceptionally well, the large size of their networks and descriptors remains a significant disadvantage, complicating their practical application. In this paper, we propose a novel method that achieves a competitive performance by using a lightweight network and compact descriptors. By utilizing relational self-supervised distillation to transfer knowledge from a large network to a small network, we enable the training of lightweight networks with a small descriptor size. Our approach, which we call Relational selfsupervised Distillation with Compact Descriptors (RDCD), introduces relational self-supervised distillation (RSD) for flexible representation in a smaller feature space and applies contrastive learning with a hard negative (HN) loss to prevent dimensional collapse. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using the DISC2021, Copydays, and NDEC benchmark datasets, with which our lightweight network with compact descriptors achieves a competitive performance. For the DISC2021 benchmark, ResNet-50/EfficientNet- B0 are used as a teacher and student respectively, the micro average precision improved by 5.0%/4.9%/5.9% for 64/128/256 descriptor sizes compared to the baseline method.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce ToonCrafter, a novel approach that transcends traditional correspondence-based cartoon video interpolation, paving the way for generative interpolation. Traditional methods, that implicitly assume linear motion and the absence of complicated phenomena like dis-occlusion, often struggle with the exaggerated non-linear and large motions with occlusion commonly found in cartoons, resulting in implausible or even failed interpolation results. To overcome these limitations, we explore the potential of adapting live-action video priors to better suit cartoon interpolation within a generative framework. ToonCrafter effectively addresses the challenges faced when applying live-action video motion priors to generative cartoon interpolation. First, we design a toon rectification learning strategy that seamlessly adapts live-action video priors to the cartoon domain, resolving the domain gap and content leakage issues. Next, we introduce a dual-reference-based 3D decoder to compensate for lost details due to the highly compressed latent prior spaces, ensuring the preservation of fine details in interpolation results. Finally, we design a flexible sketch encoder that empowers users with interactive control over the interpolation results. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method not only produces visually convincing and more natural dynamics, but also effectively handles dis-occlusion. The comparative evaluation demonstrates the notable superiority of our approach over existing competitors.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In autonomous driving, multi-modal perception models leveraging inputs from multiple sensors exhibit strong robustness in degraded environments. However, these models face challenges in efficiently and effectively transferring learned representations across different modalities and tasks. This paper presents NeRF-Supervised Masked Auto Encoder (NS-MAE), a self-supervised pre-training paradigm for transferable multi-modal representation learning. NS-MAE is designed to provide pre-trained model initializations for efficient and high-performance fine-tuning. Our approach uses masked multi-modal reconstruction in neural radiance fields (NeRF), training the model to reconstruct missing or corrupted input data across multiple modalities. Specifically, multi-modal embeddings are extracted from corrupted LiDAR point clouds and images, conditioned on specific view directions and locations. These embeddings are then rendered into projected multi-modal feature maps using neural rendering techniques. The original multi-modal signals serve as reconstruction targets for the rendered feature maps, facilitating self-supervised representation learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the promising transferability of NS-MAE representations across diverse multi-modal and single-modal perception models. This transferability is evaluated on various 3D perception downstream tasks, such as 3D object detection and BEV map segmentation, using different amounts of fine-tuning labeled data. Our code will be released to support the community.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Transformer architectures have shown promising results in time series processing. However, despite recent advances in subquadratic attention mechanisms or state-space models, processing very long sequences still imposes significant computational requirements. Token merging, which involves replacing multiple tokens with a single one calculated as their linear combination, has shown to considerably improve the throughput of vision transformer architectures while maintaining accuracy. In this work, we go beyond computer vision and perform the first investigations of token merging in time series analysis on both time series transformers and state-space models. To effectively scale token merging to long sequences, we introduce local merging, a domain-specific token merging algorithm that selectively combines tokens within a local neighborhood, adjusting the computational complexity from linear to quadratic based on the neighborhood size. Our comprehensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that token merging offers substantial computational benefits with minimal impact on accuracy across various models and datasets. On the recently proposed Chronos foundation model, we achieve accelerations up to 5400% with only minor accuracy degradations.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the unprecedented performance being achieved by text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, T2I customization further empowers users to tailor the diffusion model to new concepts absent in the pre-training dataset, termed subject-driven generation. Moreover, extracting several new concepts from a single image enables the model to learn multiple concepts, and simultaneously decreases the difficulties of training data preparation, urging the disentanglement of multiple concepts to be a new challenge. However, existing models for disentanglement commonly require pre-determined masks or retain background elements. To this end, we propose an attention-guided method, AttenCraft, for multiple concept disentanglement. In particular, our method leverages self-attention and cross-attention maps to create accurate masks for each concept within a single initialization step, omitting any required mask preparation by humans or other models. The created masks are then applied to guide the cross-attention activation of each target concept during training and achieve concept disentanglement. Additionally, we introduce Uniform sampling and Reweighted sampling schemes to alleviate the non-synchronicity of feature acquisition from different concepts, and improve generation quality. Our method outperforms baseline models in terms of image-alignment, and behaves comparably on text-alignment. Finally, we showcase the applicability of AttenCraft to more complicated settings, such as an input image containing three concepts. The project is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The remarkable capabilities of modern large language models are rooted in their vast repositories of knowledge encoded within their parameters, enabling them to perceive the world and engage in reasoning. The inner workings of how these models store knowledge have long been a subject of intense interest and investigation among researchers. To date, most studies have concentrated on isolated components within these models, such as the Multilayer Perceptrons and attention head. In this paper, we delve into the computation graph of the language model to uncover the knowledge circuits that are instrumental in articulating specific knowledge. The experiments, conducted with GPT2 and TinyLLAMA, has allowed us to observe how certain information heads, relation heads, and Multilayer Perceptrons collaboratively encode knowledge within the model. Moreover, we evaluate the impact of current knowledge editing techniques on these knowledge circuits, providing deeper insights into the functioning and constraints of these editing methodologies. Finally, we utilize knowledge circuits to analyze and interpret language model behaviors such as hallucinations and in-context learning. We believe the knowledge circuit holds potential for advancing our understanding of Transformers and guiding the improved design of knowledge editing.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the enhancement in the field of generative artificial intelligence (AI), contextual question answering has become extremely relevant. Attributing model generations to the input source document is essential to ensure trustworthiness and reliability. We observe that when large language models (LLMs) are used for contextual question answering, the output answer often consists of text copied verbatim from the input prompt which is linked together with "glue text" generated by the LLM. Motivated by this, we propose that LLMs have an inherent awareness from where the text was copied, likely captured in the hidden states of the LLM. We introduce a novel method for attribution in contextual question answering, leveraging the hidden state representations of LLMs. Our approach bypasses the need for extensive model retraining and retrieval model overhead, offering granular attributions and preserving the quality of generated answers. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method performs on par or better than GPT-4 at identifying verbatim copied segments in LLM generations and in attributing these segments to their source. Importantly, our method shows robust performance across various LLM architectures, highlighting its broad applicability. Additionally, we present Verifiability-granular, an attribution dataset which has token level annotations for LLM generations in the contextual question answering setup.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion-based video generation has achieved significant progress, yet generating multiple actions that occur sequentially remains a formidable task. Directly generating a video with sequential actions can be extremely challenging due to the scarcity of fine-grained action annotations and the difficulty in establishing temporal semantic correspondences and maintaining long-term consistency. To tackle this, we propose an intuitive and straightforward solution: splicing multiple single-action video segments sequentially. The core challenge lies in generating smooth and natural transitions between these segments given the inherent complexity and variability of action transitions. We introduce MAVIN (Multi-Action Video INfilling model), designed to generate transition videos that seamlessly connect two given videos, forming a cohesive integrated sequence. MAVIN incorporates several innovative techniques to address challenges in the transition video infilling task. Firstly, a consecutive noising strategy coupled with variable-length sampling is employed to handle large infilling gaps and varied generation lengths. Secondly, boundary frame guidance (BFG) is proposed to address the lack of semantic guidance during transition generation. Lastly, a Gaussian filter mixer (GFM) dynamically manages noise initialization during inference, mitigating train-test discrepancy while preserving generation flexibility. Additionally, we introduce a new metric, CLIP-RS (CLIP Relative Smoothness), to evaluate temporal coherence and smoothness, complementing traditional quality-based metrics. Experimental results on horse and tiger scenarios demonstrate MAVIN's superior performance in generating smooth and coherent video transitions compared to existing methods.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Personalized retrieval and segmentation aim to locate specific instances within a dataset based on an input image and a short description of the reference instance. While supervised methods are effective, they require extensive labeled data for training. Recently, self-supervised foundation models have been introduced to these tasks showing comparable results to supervised methods. However, a significant flaw in these models is evident: they struggle to locate a desired instance when other instances within the same class are presented. In this paper, we explore text-to-image diffusion models for these tasks. Specifically, we propose a novel approach called PDM for Personalized Features Diffusion Matching, that leverages intermediate features of pre-trained text-to-image models for personalization tasks without any additional training. PDM demonstrates superior performance on popular retrieval and segmentation benchmarks, outperforming even supervised methods. We also highlight notable shortcomings in current instance and segmentation datasets and propose new benchmarks for these tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The ultimate goal of generative models is to characterize the data distribution perfectly. For image generation, common metrics of visual quality (e.g., FID), and the truthlikeness of generated images to the human eyes seem to suggest that we are close to achieving it. However, through distribution classification tasks, we find that, in the eyes of classifiers parameterized by neural networks, the strongest diffusion models are still far from this goal. Specifically, classifiers consistently and effortlessly distinguish between real and generated images in various settings. Further, we observe an intriguing discrepancy: classifiers can identify differences between diffusion models with similar performance (e.g., U-ViT-H vs. DiT-XL), but struggle to differentiate between the smallest and largest models in the same family (e.g., EDM2-XS vs. EDM2-XXL), whereas humans exhibit the opposite tendency. As an explanation, our comprehensive empirical study suggests that, unlike humans, classifiers tend to classify images through edge and high-frequency components. We believe that our methodology can serve as a probe to understand how generative models work and inspire further thought on how existing models can be improved and how the abuse of such models can be prevented.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Gaussian Splatting has revolutionized the world of novel view synthesis by achieving high rendering performance in real-time. Recently, studies have focused on enriching these 3D representations with semantic information for downstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce RT-GS2, the first generalizable semantic segmentation method employing Gaussian Splatting. While existing Gaussian Splatting-based approaches rely on scene-specific training, RT-GS2 demonstrates the ability to generalize to unseen scenes. Our method adopts a new approach by first extracting view-independent 3D Gaussian features in a self-supervised manner, followed by a novel View-Dependent / View-Independent (VDVI) feature fusion to enhance semantic consistency over different views. Extensive experimentation on three different datasets showcases RT-GS2's superiority over the state-of-the-art methods in semantic segmentation quality, exemplified by a 8.01% increase in mIoU on the Replica dataset. Moreover, our method achieves real-time performance of 27.03 FPS, marking an astonishing 901 times speedup compared to existing approaches. This work represents a significant advancement in the field by introducing, to the best of our knowledge, the first real-time generalizable semantic segmentation method for 3D Gaussian representations of radiance fields.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) identifies sentiment information related to specific aspects and provides deeper market insights to businesses and organizations. With the emergence of large language models (LMs), recent studies have proposed using fixed examples for instruction tuning to reformulate ABSA as a generation task. However, the performance is sensitive to the selection of in-context examples; several retrieval methods are based on surface similarity and are independent of the LM generative objective. This study proposes an instruction learning method with retrieval-based example ranking for ABSA tasks. For each target sample, an LM was applied as a scorer to estimate the likelihood of the output given the input and a candidate example as the prompt, and training examples were labeled as positive or negative by ranking the scores. An alternating training schema is proposed to train both the retriever and LM. Instructional prompts can be constructed using high-quality examples. The LM is used for both scoring and inference, improving the generation efficiency without incurring additional computational costs or training difficulties. Extensive experiments on three ABSA subtasks verified the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating its superiority over various strong baseline models.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper proposes a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to automate curriculum design, thereby enhancing the application of reinforcement learning (RL) in mobile networks. As mobile networks evolve towards the 6G era, managing their increasing complexity and dynamic nature poses significant challenges. Conventional RL approaches often suffer from slow convergence and poor generalization due to conflicting objectives and the large state and action spaces associated with mobile networks. To address these shortcomings, we introduce curriculum learning, a method that systematically exposes the RL agent to progressively challenging tasks, improving convergence and generalization. However, curriculum design typically requires extensive domain knowledge and manual human effort. Our framework mitigates this by utilizing the generative capabilities of LLMs to automate the curriculum design process, significantly reducing human effort while improving the RL agent's convergence and performance. We deploy our approach within a simulated mobile network environment and demonstrate improved RL convergence rates, generalization to unseen scenarios, and overall performance enhancements. As a case study, we consider autonomous coordination and user association in mobile networks. Our obtained results highlight the potential of combining LLM-based curriculum generation with RL for managing next-generation wireless networks, marking a significant step towards fully autonomous network operations.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The Masked autoencoder (MAE) has drawn attention as a representative self-supervised approach for masked image modeling with vision transformers. However, even though MAE shows better generalization capability than fully supervised training from scratch, the reason why has not been explored. In another line of work, the Reconstruction Consistent Masked Auto Encoder (RC-MAE), has been proposed which adopts a self-distillation scheme in the form of an exponential moving average (EMA) teacher into MAE, and it has been shown that the EMA-teacher performs a conditional gradient correction during optimization. To further investigate the reason for better generalization of the self-supervised ViT when trained by MAE (MAE-ViT) and the effect of the gradient correction of RC-MAE from the perspective of optimization, we visualize the loss landscapes of the self-supervised vision transformer by both MAE and RC-MAE and compare them with the supervised ViT (Sup-ViT). Unlike previous loss landscape visualizations of neural networks based on classification task loss, we visualize the loss landscape of ViT by computing pre-training task loss. Through the lens of loss landscapes, we find two interesting observations: (1) MAE-ViT has a smoother and wider overall loss curvature than Sup-ViT. (2) The EMA-teacher allows MAE to widen the region of convexity in both pretraining and linear probing, leading to quicker convergence. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to investigate the self-supervised ViT through the lens of the loss landscape.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Anomaly detection in continuous-time dynamic graphs is an emerging field yet under-explored in the context of learning-based approaches. In this paper, we pioneer structured analyses of link-level anomalies and graph representation learning for identifying anomalous links in these graphs. First, we introduce a fine-grain taxonomy for edge-level anomalies leveraging structural, temporal, and contextual graph properties. We present a method for generating and injecting such typed anomalies into graphs. Next, we introduce a novel method to generate continuous-time dynamic graphs with consistent patterns across time, structure, and context. To allow temporal graph methods to learn the link anomaly detection task, we extend the generic link prediction setting by: (1) conditioning link existence on contextual edge attributes; and (2) refining the training regime to accommodate diverse perturbations in the negative edge sampler. Building on this, we benchmark methods for anomaly detection. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets -- featuring synthetic and labeled organic anomalies and employing six state-of-the-art learning methods -- validate our taxonomy and generation processes for anomalies and benign graphs, as well as our approach to adapting link prediction methods for anomaly detection. Our results further reveal that different learning methods excel in capturing different aspects of graph normality and detecting different types of anomalies. We conclude with a comprehensive list of findings highlighting opportunities for future research.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The task of Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is to predict the location of a query image from a database of geo-tagged images. Recent studies in VPR have highlighted the significant advantage of employing pre-trained foundation models like DINOv2 for the VPR task. However, these models are often deemed inadequate for VPR without further fine-tuning on task-specific data. In this paper, we propose a simple yet powerful approach to better exploit the potential of a foundation model for VPR. We first demonstrate that features extracted from self-attention layers can serve as a powerful re-ranker for VPR. Utilizing these features in a zero-shot manner, our method surpasses previous zero-shot methods and achieves competitive results compared to supervised methods across multiple datasets. Subsequently, we demonstrate that a single-stage method leveraging internal ViT layers for pooling can generate global features that achieve state-of-the-art results, even when reduced to a dimensionality as low as 128D. Nevertheless, incorporating our local foundation features for re-ranking, expands this gap. Our approach further demonstrates remarkable robustness and generalization, achieving state-of-the-art results, with a significant gap, in challenging scenarios, involving occlusion, day-night variations, and seasonal changes.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Broad, open source availability of large pretrained foundation models on the internet through platforms such as HuggingFace has taken the world of practical deep learning by storm. A classical pipeline for neural network training now typically consists of finetuning these pretrained network on a small target dataset instead of training from scratch. In the case of large models this can be done even on modest hardware using a low rank training technique known as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). While Low Rank training has already been studied in the continual learning setting, existing works often consider storing the learned adapter along with the existing model but rarely attempt to modify the weights of the pretrained model by merging the LoRA with the existing weights after finishing the training of each task. In this article we investigate this setting and study the impact of LoRA rank on the forgetting of the pretraining foundation task and on the plasticity and forgetting of subsequent ones. We observe that this rank has an important impact on forgetting of both the pretraining and downstream tasks. We also observe that vision transformers finetuned in that way exhibit a sort of ``contextual'' forgetting, a behaviour that we do not observe for residual networks and that we believe has not been observed yet in previous continual learning works.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The widespread use of diffusion methods enables the creation of highly realistic images on demand, thereby posing significant risks to the integrity and safety of online information and highlighting the necessity of DeepFake detection. Our analysis of features extracted by traditional image encoders reveals that both low-level and high-level features offer distinct advantages in identifying DeepFake images produced by various diffusion methods. Inspired by this finding, we aim to develop an effective representation that captures both low-level and high-level features to detect diffusion-based DeepFakes. To address the problem, we propose a text modality-oriented feature extraction method, termed TOFE. Specifically, for a given target image, the representation we discovered is a corresponding text embedding that can guide the generation of the target image with a specific text-to-image model. Experiments conducted across ten diffusion types demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Across scientific domains, generating new models or optimizing existing ones while meeting specific criteria is crucial. Traditional machine learning frameworks for guided design use a generative model and a surrogate model (discriminator), requiring large datasets. However, real-world scientific applications often have limited data and complex landscapes, making data-hungry models inefficient or impractical. We propose a new framework, PropEn, inspired by ``matching'', which enables implicit guidance without training a discriminator. By matching each sample with a similar one that has a better property value, we create a larger training dataset that inherently indicates the direction of improvement. Matching, combined with an encoder-decoder architecture, forms a domain-agnostic generative framework for property enhancement. We show that training with a matched dataset approximates the gradient of the property of interest while remaining within the data distribution, allowing efficient design optimization. Extensive evaluations in toy problems and scientific applications, such as therapeutic protein design and airfoil optimization, demonstrate PropEn's advantages over common baselines. Notably, the protein design results are validated with wet lab experiments, confirming the competitiveness and effectiveness of our approach.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Medical image segmentation is a crucial task that relies on the ability to accurately identify and isolate regions of interest in medical images. Thereby, generative approaches allow to capture the statistical properties of segmentation masks that are dependent on the respective structures. In this work we propose FlowSDF, an image-guided conditional flow matching framework to represent the signed distance function (SDF) leading to an implicit distribution of segmentation masks. The advantage of leveraging the SDF is a more natural distortion when compared to that of binary masks. By learning a vector field that is directly related to the probability path of a conditional distribution of SDFs, we can accurately sample from the distribution of segmentation masks, allowing for the evaluation of statistical quantities. Thus, this probabilistic representation allows for the generation of uncertainty maps represented by the variance, which can aid in further analysis and enhance the predictive robustness. We qualitatively and quantitatively illustrate competitive performance of the proposed method on a public nuclei and gland segmentation data set, highlighting its utility in medical image segmentation applications.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Learning-based isosurface extraction methods have recently emerged as a robust and efficient alternative to axiomatic techniques. However, the vast majority of such approaches rely on supervised training with axiomatically computed ground truths, thus potentially inheriting biases and data artifacts of the corresponding axiomatic methods. Steering away from such dependencies, we propose a self-supervised training scheme for the Neural Dual Contouring meshing framework, resulting in our method: Self-Supervised Dual Contouring (SDC). Instead of optimizing predicted mesh vertices with supervised training, we use two novel self-supervised loss functions that encourage the consistency between distances to the generated mesh up to the first order. Meshes reconstructed by SDC surpass existing data-driven methods in capturing intricate details while being more robust to possible irregularities in the input. Furthermore, we use the same self-supervised training objective linking inferred mesh and input SDF, to regularize the training process of Deep Implicit Networks (DINs). We demonstrate that the resulting DINs produce higher-quality implicit functions, ultimately leading to more accurate and detail-preserving surfaces compared to prior baselines for different input modalities. Finally, we demonstrate that our self-supervised losses improve meshing performance in the single-view reconstruction task by enabling joint training of predicted SDF and resulting output mesh.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In recent years, the increasing demand for dynamic 3D assets in design and gaming applications has given rise to powerful generative pipelines capable of synthesizing high-quality 4D objects. Previous methods generally rely on score distillation sampling (SDS) algorithm to infer the unseen views and motion of 4D objects, thus leading to unsatisfactory results with defects like over-saturation and Janus problem. Therefore, inspired by recent progress of video diffusion models, we propose to optimize a 4D representation by explicitly generating multi-view videos from one input image. However, it is far from trivial to handle practical challenges faced by such a pipeline, including dramatic temporal inconsistency, inter-frame geometry and texture diversity, and semantic defects brought by video generation results. To address these issues, we propose DG4D, a novel multi-stage framework that generates high-quality and consistent 4D assets without score distillation. Specifically, collaborative techniques and solutions are developed, including an attention injection strategy to synthesize temporal-consistent multi-view videos, a robust and efficient dynamic reconstruction method based on Gaussian Splatting, and a refinement stage with diffusion prior for semantic restoration. The qualitative results and user preference study demonstrate that our framework outperforms the baselines in generation quality by a considerable margin.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Human image animation involves generating a video from a static image by following a specified pose sequence. Current approaches typically adopt a multi-stage pipeline that separately learns appearance and motion, which often leads to appearance degradation and temporal inconsistencies. To address these issues, we propose VividPose, an innovative end-to-end pipeline based on Stable Video Diffusion (SVD) that ensures superior temporal stability. To enhance the retention of human identity, we propose an identity-aware appearance controller that integrates additional facial information without compromising other appearance details such as clothing texture and background. This approach ensures that the generated videos maintain high fidelity to the identity of human subject, preserving key facial features across various poses. To accommodate diverse human body shapes and hand movements, we introduce a geometry-aware pose controller that utilizes both dense rendering maps from SMPL-X and sparse skeleton maps. This enables accurate alignment of pose and shape in the generated videos, providing a robust framework capable of handling a wide range of body shapes and dynamic hand movements. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on the UBCFashion and TikTok benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, VividPose exhibits superior generalization capabilities on our proposed in-the-wild dataset. Codes and models will be available.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Time series analysis remains a major challenge due to its sparse characteristics, high dimensionality, and inconsistent data quality. Recent advancements in transformer-based techniques have enhanced capabilities in forecasting and imputation; however, these methods are still resource-heavy, lack adaptability, and face difficulties in integrating both local and global attributes of time series. To tackle these challenges, we propose a new architectural concept for time series analysis based on introspection. Central to this concept is the self-supervised pretraining of Time Series Representation Models (TSRMs), which once learned can be easily tailored and fine-tuned for specific tasks, such as forecasting and imputation, in an automated and resource-efficient manner. Our architecture is equipped with a flexible and hierarchical representation learning process, which is robust against missing data and outliers. It can capture and learn both local and global features of the structure, semantics, and crucial patterns of a given time series category, such as heart rate data. Our learned time series representation models can be efficiently adapted to a specific task, such as forecasting or imputation, without manual intervention. Furthermore, our architecture's design supports explainability by highlighting the significance of each input value for the task at hand. Our empirical study using four benchmark datasets shows that, compared to investigated state-of-the-art baseline methods, our architecture improves imputation and forecasting errors by up to 90.34% and 71.54%, respectively, while reducing the required trainable parameters by up to 92.43%.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised, in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>At the core of self-supervised learning for vision is the idea of learning invariant or equivariant representations with respect to a set of data transformations. This approach, however, introduces strong inductive biases, which can render the representations fragile in downstream tasks that do not conform to these symmetries. In this work, drawing insights from world models, we propose to instead learn a general representation that can adapt to be invariant or equivariant to different transformations by paying attention to context -- a memory module that tracks task-specific states, actions, and future states. Here, the action is the transformation, while the current and future states respectively represent the input's representation before and after the transformation. Our proposed algorithm, Contextual Self-Supervised Learning (ContextSSL), learns equivariance to all transformations (as opposed to invariance). In this way, the model can learn to encode all relevant features as general representations while having the versatility to tail down to task-wise symmetries when given a few examples as the context. Empirically, we demonstrate significant performance gains over existing methods on equivariance-related tasks, supported by both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Regression models often fail to generalize effectively in regions characterized by highly imbalanced label distributions. Previous methods for deep imbalanced regression rely on gradient-based weight updates, which tend to overfit in underrepresented regions. This paper proposes a paradigm shift towards in-context learning as an effective alternative to conventional in-weight learning methods, particularly for addressing imbalanced regression. In-context learning refers to the ability of a model to condition itself, given a prompt sequence composed of in-context samples (input-label pairs) alongside a new query input to generate predictions, without requiring any parameter updates. In this paper, we study the impact of the prompt sequence on the model performance from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. We emphasize the importance of localized context in reducing bias within regions of high imbalance. Empirical evaluations across a variety of real-world datasets demonstrate that in-context learning substantially outperforms existing in-weight learning methods in scenarios with high levels of imbalance.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In conventional remote sensing change detection (RS CD) procedures, extensive manual labeling for bi-temporal images is first required to maintain the performance of subsequent fully supervised training. However, pixel-level labeling for CD tasks is very complex and time-consuming. In this paper, we explore a novel self-supervised contrastive framework applicable to the RS CD task, which promotes the model to accurately capture spatial, structural, and semantic information through domain adapter and hierarchical contrastive head. The proposed SSLChange framework accomplishes self-learning only by taking a single-temporal sample and can be flexibly transferred to main-stream CD baselines. With self-supervised contrastive learning, feature representation pre-training can be performed directly based on the original data even without labeling. After a certain amount of labels are subsequently obtained, the pre-trained features will be aligned with the labels for fully supervised fine-tuning. Without introducing any additional data or labels, the performance of downstream baselines will experience a significant enhancement. Experimental results on 2 entire datasets and 6 diluted datasets show that our proposed SSLChange improves the performance and stability of CD baseline in data-limited situations.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this work, we study the problem of generating novel images from complex multimodal prompt sequences. While existing methods achieve promising results for text-to-image generation, they often struggle to capture fine-grained details from lengthy prompts and maintain contextual coherence within prompt sequences. Moreover, they often result in misaligned image generation for prompt sequences featuring multiple objects. To address this, we propose a Multi-modal Generation via Cross-Modal In-Context Learning (MGCC) method that generates novel images from complex multimodal prompt sequences by leveraging the combined capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models. Our MGCC comprises a novel Cross-Modal Refinement module to explicitly learn cross-modal dependencies between the text and image in the LLM embedding space, and a contextual object grounding module to generate object bounding boxes specifically targeting scenes with multiple objects. Our MGCC demonstrates a diverse range of multimodal capabilities, like novel image generation, the facilitation of multimodal dialogue, and generation of texts. Experimental evaluations on two benchmark datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. On Visual Story Generation (VIST) dataset with multimodal inputs, our MGCC achieves a CLIP Similarity score of $0.652$ compared to SOTA GILL $0.641$. Similarly, on Visual Dialogue Context (VisDial) having lengthy dialogue sequences, our MGCC achieves an impressive CLIP score of $0.660$, largely outperforming existing SOTA method scoring $0.645$.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Self-supervised landmark estimation is a challenging task that demands the formation of locally distinct feature representations to identify sparse facial landmarks in the absence of annotated data. To tackle this task, existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods (1) extract coarse features from backbones that are trained with instance-level self-supervised learning (SSL) paradigms, which neglect the dense prediction nature of the task, (2) aggregate them into memory-intensive hypercolumn formations, and (3) supervise lightweight projector networks to naively establish full local correspondences among all pairs of spatial features. In this paper, we introduce SCE-MAE, a framework that (1) leverages the MAE, a region-level SSL method that naturally better suits the landmark prediction task, (2) operates on the vanilla feature map instead of on expensive hypercolumns, and (3) employs a Correspondence Approximation and Refinement Block (CARB) that utilizes a simple density peak clustering algorithm and our proposed Locality-Constrained Repellence Loss to directly hone only select local correspondences. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that SCE-MAE is highly effective and robust, outperforming existing SOTA methods by large margins of approximately 20%-44% on the landmark matching and approximately 9%-15% on the landmark detection tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Video try-on stands as a promising area for its tremendous real-world potential. Prior works are limited to transferring product clothing images onto person videos with simple poses and backgrounds, while underperforming on casually captured videos. Recently, Sora revealed the scalability of Diffusion Transformer (DiT) in generating lifelike videos featuring real-world scenarios. Inspired by this, we explore and propose the first DiT-based video try-on framework for practical in-the-wild applications, named VITON-DiT. Specifically, VITON-DiT consists of a garment extractor, a Spatial-Temporal denoising DiT, and an identity preservation ControlNet. To faithfully recover the clothing details, the extracted garment features are fused with the self-attention outputs of the denoising DiT and the ControlNet. We also introduce novel random selection strategies during training and an Interpolated Auto-Regressive (IAR) technique at inference to facilitate long video generation. Unlike existing attempts that require the laborious and restrictive construction of a paired training dataset, severely limiting their scalability, VITON-DiT alleviates this by relying solely on unpaired human dance videos and a carefully designed multi-stage training strategy. Furthermore, we curate a challenging benchmark dataset to evaluate the performance of casual video try-on. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of VITON-DiT in generating spatio-temporal consistent try-on results for in-the-wild videos with complicated human poses.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The diffusion bridge is a type of diffusion process that conditions on hitting a specific state within a finite time period. It has broad applications in fields such as Bayesian inference, financial mathematics, control theory, and shape analysis. However, simulating the diffusion bridge for natural data can be challenging due to both the intractability of the drift term and continuous representations of the data. Although several methods are available to simulate finite-dimensional diffusion bridges, infinite-dimensional cases remain unresolved. In the paper, we present a solution to this problem by merging score-matching techniques with operator learning, enabling a direct approach to score-matching for the infinite-dimensional bridge. We construct the score to be discretization invariant, which is natural given the underlying spatially continuous process. We conduct a series of experiments, ranging from synthetic examples with closed-form solutions to the stochastic nonlinear evolution of real-world biological shape data, and our method demonstrates high efficacy, particularly due to its ability to adapt to any resolution without extra training.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI across diverse domains, showcasing remarkable capabilities. Central to their success is the concept of prompting, which guides model output generation. However, manual prompt engineering is labor-intensive and domain-specific, necessitating automated solutions. This paper introduces PromptWizard, a novel framework leveraging LLMs to iteratively synthesize and refine prompts tailored to specific tasks. Unlike existing approaches, PromptWizard optimizes both prompt instructions and in-context examples, maximizing model performance. The framework iteratively refines prompts by mutating instructions and incorporating negative examples to deepen understanding and ensure diversity. It further enhances both instructions and examples with the aid of a critic, synthesizing new instructions and examples enriched with detailed reasoning steps for optimal performance. PromptWizard offers several key features and capabilities, including computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art approaches, adaptability to scenarios with varying amounts of training data, and effectiveness with smaller LLMs. Rigorous evaluation across 35 tasks on 8 datasets demonstrates PromptWizard's superiority over existing prompt strategies, showcasing its efficacy and scalability in prompt optimization.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent video generative models primarily rely on carefully written text prompts for specific tasks, like inpainting or style editing. They require labor-intensive textual descriptions for input videos, hindering their flexibility to adapt personal/raw videos to user specifications. This paper proposes RACCooN, a versatile and user-friendly video-to-paragraph-to-video generative framework that supports multiple video editing capabilities such as removal, addition, and modification, through a unified pipeline. RACCooN consists of two principal stages: Video-to-Paragraph (V2P) and Paragraph-to-Video (P2V). In the V2P stage, we automatically describe video scenes in well-structured natural language, capturing both the holistic context and focused object details. Subsequently, in the P2V stage, users can optionally refine these descriptions to guide the video diffusion model, enabling various modifications to the input video, such as removing, changing subjects, and/or adding new objects. The proposed approach stands out from other methods through several significant contributions: (1) RACCooN suggests a multi-granular spatiotemporal pooling strategy to generate well-structured video descriptions, capturing both the broad context and object details without requiring complex human annotations, simplifying precise video content editing based on text for users. (2) Our video generative model incorporates auto-generated narratives or instructions to enhance the quality and accuracy of the generated content. It supports the addition of video objects, inpainting, and attribute modification within a unified framework, surpassing existing video editing and inpainting benchmarks. The proposed framework demonstrates impressive versatile capabilities in video-to-paragraph generation, video content editing, and can be incorporated into other SoTA video generative models for further enhancement.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The consistency model (CM) has recently made significant progress in accelerating the generation of diffusion models. However, its application to high-resolution, text-conditioned image generation in the latent space (a.k.a., LCM) remains unsatisfactory. In this paper, we identify three key flaws in the current design of LCM. We investigate the reasons behind these limitations and propose the Phased Consistency Model (PCM), which generalizes the design space and addresses all identified limitations. Our evaluations demonstrate that PCM significantly outperforms LCM across 1--16 step generation settings. While PCM is specifically designed for multi-step refinement, it achieves even superior or comparable 1-step generation results to previously state-of-the-art specifically designed 1-step methods. Furthermore, we show that PCM's methodology is versatile and applicable to video generation, enabling us to train the state-of-the-art few-step text-to-video generator.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Scene image editing is crucial for entertainment, photography, and advertising design. Existing methods solely focus on either 2D individual object or 3D global scene editing. This results in a lack of a unified approach to effectively control and manipulate scenes at the 3D level with different levels of granularity. In this work, we propose 3DitScene, a novel and unified scene editing framework leveraging language-guided disentangled Gaussian Splatting that enables seamless editing from 2D to 3D, allowing precise control over scene composition and individual objects. We first incorporate 3D Gaussians that are refined through generative priors and optimization techniques. Language features from CLIP then introduce semantics into 3D geometry for object disentanglement. With the disentangled Gaussians, 3DitScene allows for manipulation at both the global and individual levels, revolutionizing creative expression and empowering control over scenes and objects. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of 3DitScene in scene image editing. Code and online demo can be found at our project homepage: this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models with large-scale pre-training have achieved significant success in the field of visual content generation, particularly exemplified by Diffusion Transformers (DiT). However, DiT models have faced challenges with scalability and quadratic complexity efficiency. In this paper, we aim to leverage the long sequence modeling capability of Gated Linear Attention (GLA) Transformers, expanding its applicability to diffusion models. We introduce Diffusion Gated Linear Attention Transformers (DiG), a simple, adoptable solution with minimal parameter overhead, following the DiT design, but offering superior efficiency and effectiveness. In addition to better performance than DiT, DiG-S/2 exhibits $2.5\times$ higher training speed than DiT-S/2 and saves $75.7\%$ GPU memory at a resolution of $1792 \times 1792$. Moreover, we analyze the scalability of DiG across a variety of computational complexity. DiG models, with increased depth/width or augmentation of input tokens, consistently exhibit decreasing FID. We further compare DiG with other subquadratic-time diffusion models. With the same model size, DiG-XL/2 is $4.2\times$ faster than the recent Mamba-based diffusion model at a $1024$ resolution, and is $1.8\times$ faster than DiT with CUDA-optimized FlashAttention-2 under the $2048$ resolution. All these results demonstrate its superior efficiency among the latest diffusion models. Code is released at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid growth of neural network models shared on the internet has made model weights an important data modality. However, this information is underutilized as the weights are uninterpretable, and publicly available models are disorganized. Inspired by Darwin's tree of life, we define the Model Tree which describes the origin of models i.e., the parent model that was used to fine-tune the target model. Similarly to the natural world, the tree structure is unknown. In this paper, we introduce the task of Model Tree Heritage Recovery (MoTHer Recovery) for discovering Model Trees in the ever-growing universe of neural networks. Our hypothesis is that model weights encode this information, the challenge is to decode the underlying tree structure given the weights. Beyond the immediate application of model authorship attribution, MoTHer recovery holds exciting long-term applications akin to indexing the internet by search engines. Practically, for each pair of models, this task requires: i) determining if they are related, and ii) establishing the direction of the relationship. We find that certain distributional properties of the weights evolve monotonically during training, which enables us to classify the relationship between two given models. MoTHer recovery reconstructs entire model hierarchies, represented by a directed tree, where a parent model gives rise to multiple child models through additional training. Our approach successfully reconstructs complex Model Trees, as well as the structure of "in-the-wild" model families such as Llama 2 and Stable Diffusion.</li>
