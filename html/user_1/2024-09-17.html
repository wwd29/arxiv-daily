<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Learning representations for structured data with certain geometries (observed or unobserved) is a fundamental challenge, wherein message passing neural networks (MPNNs) have become a de facto class of model solutions. In this paper, we propose an energy-constrained diffusion model as a principled interpretable framework for understanding the mechanism of MPNNs and navigating novel architectural designs. The model, inspired by physical systems, combines the inductive bias of diffusion on manifolds with layer-wise constraints of energy minimization. As shown by our analysis, the diffusion operators have a one-to-one correspondence with the energy functions implicitly descended by the diffusion process, and the finite-difference iteration for solving the energy-constrained diffusion system induces the propagation layers of various types of MPNNs operated on observed or latent structures. On top of these findings, we devise a new class of neural message passing models, dubbed as diffusion-inspired Transformers, whose global attention layers are induced by the principled energy-constrained diffusion. Across diverse datasets ranging from real-world networks to images and physical particles, we show that the new model can yield promising performance for cases where the data structures are observed (as a graph), partially observed or completely unobserved.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This work addresses the task of zero-shot monocular depth estimation. A recent advance in this field has been the idea of utilising Text-to-Image foundation models, such as Stable Diffusion. Foundation models provide a rich and generic image representation, and therefore, little training data is required to reformulate them as a depth estimation model that predicts highly-detailed depth maps and has good generalisation capabilities. However, the realisation of this idea has so far led to approaches which are, unfortunately, highly inefficient at test-time due to the underlying iterative denoising process. In this work, we propose a different realisation of this idea and present PrimeDepth, a method that is highly efficient at test time while keeping, or even enhancing, the positive aspects of diffusion-based approaches. Our key idea is to extract from Stable Diffusion a rich, but frozen, image representation by running a single denoising step. This representation, we term preimage, is then fed into a refiner network with an architectural inductive bias, before entering the downstream task. We validate experimentally that PrimeDepth is two orders of magnitude faster than the leading diffusion-based method, Marigold, while being more robust for challenging scenarios and quantitatively marginally superior. Thereby, we reduce the gap to the currently leading data-driven approach, Depth Anything, which is still quantitatively superior, but predicts less detailed depth maps and requires 20 times more labelled data. Due to the complementary nature of our approach, even a simple averaging between PrimeDepth and Depth Anything predictions can improve upon both methods and sets a new state-of-the-art in zero-shot monocular depth estimation. In future, data-driven approaches may also benefit from integrating our preimage.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models have shown their remarkable ability to synthesize images, including the generation of humans in specific poses. However, current models face challenges in adequately expressing conditional control for detailed hand pose generation, leading to significant distortion in the hand regions. To tackle this problem, we first curate the How2Sign dataset to provide richer and more accurate hand pose annotations. In addition, we introduce adaptive, multi-modal fusion to integrate characters' physical features expressed in different modalities such as skeleton, depth, and surface normal. Furthermore, we propose a novel Region-Aware Cycle Loss (RACL) that enables the diffusion model training to focus on improving the hand region, resulting in improved quality of generated hand gestures. More specifically, the proposed RACL computes a weighted keypoint distance between the full-body pose keypoints from the generated image and the ground truth, to generate higher-quality hand poses while balancing overall pose accuracy. Moreover, we use two hand region metrics, named hand-PSNR and hand-Distance for hand pose generation evaluations. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in improving the quality of digital human pose generation using diffusion models, especially the quality of the hand region.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative self-supervised learning (SSL), especially masked autoencoders (MAE), has greatly succeeded and garnered substantial research interest in graph machine learning. However, the research of MAE in dynamic graphs is still scant. This gap is primarily due to the dynamic graph not only possessing topological structure information but also encapsulating temporal evolution dependency. Applying a random masking strategy which most MAE methods adopt to dynamic graphs will remove the crucial subgraph that guides the evolution of dynamic graphs, resulting in the loss of crucial spatio-temporal information in node representations. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose a novel Informative Subgraphs Aware Masked Auto-Encoder in Dynamic Graph, namely DyGIS. Specifically, we introduce a constrained probabilistic generative model to generate informative subgraphs that guide the evolution of dynamic graphs, successfully alleviating the issue of missing dynamic evolution subgraphs. The informative subgraph identified by DyGIS will serve as the input of dynamic graph masked autoencoder (DGMAE), effectively ensuring the integrity of the evolutionary spatio-temporal information within dynamic graphs. Extensive experiments on eleven datasets demonstrate that DyGIS achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We examine the pre-training dynamics of language models, focusing on their ability to copy text from preceding context--a fundamental skill for various LLM applications, including in-context learning (ICL) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We propose a novel perspective that Transformer-based language models develop copying abilities similarly to grokking, which refers to sudden generalization on test set long after the model fit to the training set. Our experiments yield three arguments: (1) The pre-training loss decreases rapidly, while the context copying ability of models initially lags and then abruptly saturates. (2) The speed of developing copying ability is independent of the number of tokens trained, similarly to how grokking speed is unaffected by dataset size as long as the data distribution is preserved. (3) Induction heads, the attention heads responsible for copying, form from shallow to deep layers during training, mirroring the development of circuits in deeper layers during grokking. We contend that the connection between grokking and context copying can provide valuable insights for more effective language model training, ultimately improving in-context performance. For example, we demonstrated that techniques that enhance grokking, such as regularization, either accelerate or enhance the development of context copying.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Contrastive learning has become one of the most impressive approaches for multi-modal representation learning. However, previous multi-modal works mainly focused on cross-modal understanding, ignoring in-modal contrastive learning, which limits the representation of each modality. In this paper, we propose a novel contrastive learning strategy, called $Turbo$, to promote multi-modal understanding by joint in-modal and cross-modal contrastive learning. Specifically, multi-modal data pairs are sent through the forward pass twice with different hidden dropout masks to get two different representations for each modality. With these representations, we obtain multiple in-modal and cross-modal contrastive objectives for training. Finally, we combine the self-supervised Turbo with the supervised multi-modal classification and demonstrate its effectiveness on two audio-text classification tasks, where the state-of-the-art performance is achieved on a speech emotion recognition benchmark dataset.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The Matrix Profile (MP), a versatile tool for time series data mining, has been shown effective in time series anomaly detection (TSAD). This paper delves into the problem of anomaly detection in multidimensional time series, a common occurrence in real-world applications. For instance, in a manufacturing factory, multiple sensors installed across the site collect time-varying data for analysis. The Matrix Profile, named for its role in profiling the matrix storing pairwise distance between subsequences of univariate time series, becomes complex in multidimensional scenarios. If the input univariate time series has n subsequences, the pairwise distance matrix is a n x n matrix. In a multidimensional time series with d dimensions, the pairwise distance information must be stored in a n x n x d tensor. In this paper, we first analyze different strategies for condensing this tensor into a profile vector. We then investigate the potential of extending the MP to efficiently find k-nearest neighbors for anomaly detection. Finally, we benchmark the multidimensional MP against 19 baseline methods on 119 multidimensional TSAD datasets. The experiments covers three learning setups: unsupervised, supervised, and semi-supervised. MP is the only method that consistently delivers high performance across all setups.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Dynamic and dexterous manipulation of objects presents a complex challenge, requiring the synchronization of hand motions with the trajectories of objects to achieve seamless and physically plausible interactions. In this work, we introduce ManiDext, a unified hierarchical diffusion-based framework for generating hand manipulation and grasp poses based on 3D object trajectories. Our key insight is that accurately modeling the contact correspondences between objects and hands during interactions is crucial. Therefore, we propose a continuous correspondence embedding representation that specifies detailed hand correspondences at the vertex level between the object and the hand. This embedding is optimized directly on the hand mesh in a self-supervised manner, with the distance between embeddings reflecting the geodesic distance. Our framework first generates contact maps and correspondence embeddings on the object's surface. Based on these fine-grained correspondences, we introduce a novel approach that integrates the iterative refinement process into the diffusion process during the second stage of hand pose generation. At each step of the denoising process, we incorporate the current hand pose residual as a refinement target into the network, guiding the network to correct inaccurate hand poses. Introducing residuals into each denoising step inherently aligns with traditional optimization process, effectively merging generation and refinement into a single unified framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can generate physically plausible and highly realistic motions for various tasks, including single and bimanual hand grasping as well as manipulating both rigid and articulated objects. Code will be available for research purposes.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Mass transport problems arise in many areas of machine learning whereby one wants to compute a map transporting one distribution to another. Generative modeling techniques like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Denoising Diffusion Models (DDMs) have been successfully adapted to solve such transport problems, resulting in CycleGAN and Bridge Matching respectively. However, these methods do not approximate Optimal Transport (OT) maps, which are known to have desirable properties. Existing techniques approximating OT maps for high-dimensional data-rich problems, such as DDM-based Rectified Flow and Schrödinger Bridge procedures, require fully training a DDM-type model at each iteration, or use mini-batch techniques which can introduce significant errors. We propose a novel algorithm to compute the Schrödinger Bridge, a dynamic entropy-regularised version of OT, that eliminates the need to train multiple DDM-like models. This algorithm corresponds to a discretisation of a flow of path measures, which we call the Schrödinger Bridge Flow, whose only stationary point is the Schrödinger Bridge. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on a variety of unpaired data translation tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Variational autoencoder (VAE) is an established generative model but is notorious for its blurriness. In this work, we investigate the blurry output problem of VAE and resolve it, exploiting the variance of Gaussian decoder and $\beta$ of beta-VAE. Specifically, we reveal that the indistinguishability of decoder variance and $\beta$ hinders appropriate analysis of the model by random likelihood value, and limits performance improvement by omitting the gain from $\beta$. To address the problem, we propose Beta-Sigma VAE (BS-VAE) that explicitly separates $\beta$ and decoder variance $\sigma^2_x$ in the model. Our method demonstrates not only superior performance in natural image synthesis but also controllable parameters and predictable analysis compared to conventional VAE. In our experimental evaluation, we employ the analysis of rate-distortion curve and proxy metrics on computer vision datasets. The code is available on this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Histopathology Whole-Slide Images (WSIs) provide an important tool to assess cancer prognosis in computational pathology (CPATH). While existing survival analysis (SA) approaches have made exciting progress, they are generally limited to adopting highly-expressive architectures and only coarse-grained patient-level labels to learn prognostic visual representations from gigapixel WSIs. Such learning paradigm suffers from important performance bottlenecks, when facing present scarce training data and standard multi-instance learning (MIL) framework in CPATH. To break through it, this paper, for the first time, proposes a new Vision-Language-based SA (VLSA) paradigm. Concretely, (1) VLSA is driven by pathology VL foundation models. It no longer relies on high-capability networks and shows the advantage of data efficiency. (2) In vision-end, VLSA encodes prognostic language prior and then employs it as auxiliary signals to guide the aggregating of prognostic visual features at instance level, thereby compensating for the weak supervision in MIL. Moreover, given the characteristics of SA, we propose i) ordinal survival prompt learning to transform continuous survival labels into textual prompts; and ii) ordinal incidence function as prediction target to make SA compatible with VL-based prediction. VLSA's predictions can be interpreted intuitively by our Shapley values-based method. The extensive experiments on five datasets confirm the effectiveness of our scheme. Our VLSA could pave a new way for SA in CPATH by offering weakly-supervised MIL an effective means to learn valuable prognostic clues from gigapixel WSIs.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce Diffusion-based Audio Captioning (DAC), a non-autoregressive diffusion model tailored for diverse and efficient audio captioning. Although existing captioning models relying on language backbones have achieved remarkable success in various captioning tasks, their insufficient performance in terms of generation speed and diversity impede progress in audio understanding and multimedia applications. Our diffusion-based framework offers unique advantages stemming from its inherent stochasticity and holistic context modeling in captioning. Through rigorous evaluation, we demonstrate that DAC not only achieves SOTA performance levels compared to existing benchmarks in the caption quality, but also significantly outperforms them in terms of generation speed and diversity. The success of DAC illustrates that text generation can also be seamlessly integrated with audio and visual generation tasks using a diffusion backbone, paving the way for a unified, audio-related generative model across different modalities.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Adversarial patches present significant challenges to the robustness of deep learning models, making the development of effective defenses become critical for real-world applications. This paper introduces DIFFender, a novel DIFfusion-based DeFender framework that leverages the power of a text-guided diffusion model to counter adversarial patch attacks. At the core of our approach is the discovery of the Adversarial Anomaly Perception (AAP) phenomenon, which enables the diffusion model to accurately detect and locate adversarial patches by analyzing distributional anomalies. DIFFender seamlessly integrates the tasks of patch localization and restoration within a unified diffusion model framework, enhancing defense efficacy through their close interaction. Additionally, DIFFender employs an efficient few-shot prompt-tuning algorithm, facilitating the adaptation of the pre-trained diffusion model to defense tasks without the need for extensive retraining. Our comprehensive evaluation, covering image classification and face recognition tasks, as well as real-world scenarios, demonstrates DIFFender's robust performance against adversarial attacks. The framework's versatility and generalizability across various settings, classifiers, and attack methodologies mark a significant advancement in adversarial patch defense strategies. Except for the popular visible domain, we have identified another advantage of DIFFender: its capability to easily expand into the infrared domain. Consequently, we demonstrate the good flexibility of DIFFender, which can defend against both infrared and visible adversarial patch attacks alternatively using a universal defense framework.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Medical image retrieval refers to the task of finding similar images for given query images in a database, with applications such as diagnosis support, treatment planning, and educational tools for inexperienced medical practitioners. While traditional medical image retrieval was performed using clinical metadata, content-based medical image retrieval (CBMIR) relies on the characteristic features of the images, such as color, texture, shape, and spatial features. Many approaches have been proposed for CBMIR, and among them, using pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is a widely utilized approach. However, considering the recent advances in the development of foundation models for various computer vision tasks, their application for CBMIR can be also investigated for its potentially superior performance. In this study, we used several pre-trained feature extractors from well-known pre-trained CNNs (VGG19, ResNet-50, DenseNet121, and EfficientNetV2M) and pre-trained foundation models (MedCLIP, BioMedCLIP, OpenCLIP, CONCH and UNI) and investigated the CBMIR performance on a subset of the MedMNIST V2 dataset, including eight types of 2D and 3D medical images. Furthermore, we also investigated the effect of image size on the CBMIR performance. Our results show that, overall, for the 2D datasets, foundation models deliver superior performance by a large margin compared to CNNs, with UNI providing the best overall performance across all datasets and image sizes. For 3D datasets, CNNs and foundation models deliver more competitive performance, with CONCH achieving the best overall performance. Moreover, our findings confirm that while using larger image sizes (especially for 2D datasets) yields slightly better performance, competitive CBMIR performance can still be achieved even with smaller image sizes. Our codes to generate and reproduce the results are available on GitHub.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Archaeological sites are the physical remains of past human activity and one of the main sources of information about past societies and cultures. However, they are also the target of malevolent human actions, especially in countries having experienced inner turmoil and conflicts. Because monitoring these sites from space is a key step towards their preservation, we introduce the DAFA Looted Sites dataset, \datasetname, a labeled multi-temporal remote sensing dataset containing 55,480 images acquired monthly over 8 years across 675 Afghan archaeological sites, including 135 sites looted during the acquisition period. \datasetname~is particularly challenging because of the limited number of training samples, the class imbalance, the weak binary annotations only available at the level of the time series, and the subtlety of relevant changes coupled with important irrelevant ones over a long time period. It is also an interesting playground to assess the performance of satellite image time series (SITS) classification methods on a real and important use case. We evaluate a large set of baselines, outline the substantial benefits of using foundation models and show the additional boost that can be provided by using complete time series instead of using a single image.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised, foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Foundation models pre-trained using self-supervised and weakly-supervised learning have shown powerful transfer learning capabilities on various downstream tasks, including language understanding, text generation, and image recognition. Recently, the Earth observation (EO) field has produced several foundation models pre-trained directly on multispectral satellite imagery (e.g., Sentinel-2) for applications like precision agriculture, wildfire and drought monitoring, and natural disaster response. However, few studies have investigated the ability of these models to generalize to new geographic locations, and potential concerns of geospatial bias -- models trained on data-rich developed countries not transferring well to data-scarce developing countries -- remain. We investigate the ability of popular EO foundation models to transfer to new geographic regions in the agricultural domain, where differences in farming practices and class imbalance make transfer learning particularly challenging. We first select six crop classification datasets across five continents, normalizing for dataset size and harmonizing classes to focus on four major cereal grains: maize, soybean, rice, and wheat. We then compare three popular foundation models, pre-trained on SSL4EO-S12, SatlasPretrain, and ImageNet, using in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) evaluation. Experiments show that pre-trained weights designed explicitly for Sentinel-2, such as SSL4EO-S12, outperform general pre-trained weights like ImageNet. Furthermore, the benefits of pre-training on OOD data are the most significant when only 10--100 ID training samples are used. Transfer learning and pre-training with OOD and limited ID data show promising applications, as many developing regions have scarce crop type labels. All harmonized datasets and experimental code are open-source and available for download.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The study of social interactions and collective behaviors through multi-agent video analysis is crucial in biology. While self-supervised keypoint discovery has emerged as a promising solution to reduce the need for manual keypoint annotations, existing methods often struggle with videos containing multiple interacting agents, especially those of the same species and color. To address this, we introduce B-KinD-multi, a novel approach that leverages pre-trained video segmentation models to guide keypoint discovery in multi-agent scenarios. This eliminates the need for time-consuming manual annotations on new experimental settings and organisms. Extensive evaluations demonstrate improved keypoint regression and downstream behavioral classification in videos of flies, mice, and rats. Furthermore, our method generalizes well to other species, including ants, bees, and humans, highlighting its potential for broad applications in automated keypoint annotation for multi-agent behavior analysis.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Automated text annotation is a compelling use case for generative large language models (LLMs) in social media research. Recent work suggests that LLMs can achieve strong performance on annotation tasks; however, these studies evaluate LLMs on a small number of tasks and likely suffer from contamination due to a reliance on public benchmark datasets. Here, we test a human-centered framework for responsibly evaluating artificial intelligence tools used in automated annotation. We use GPT-4 to replicate 27 annotation tasks across 11 password-protected datasets from recently published computational social science articles in high-impact journals. For each task, we compare GPT-4 annotations against human-annotated ground-truth labels and against annotations from separate supervised classification models fine-tuned on human-generated labels. Although the quality of LLM labels is generally high, we find significant variation in LLM performance across tasks, even within datasets. Our findings underscore the importance of a human-centered workflow and careful evaluation standards: Automated annotations significantly diverge from human judgment in numerous scenarios, despite various optimization strategies such as prompt tuning. Grounding automated annotation in validation labels generated by humans is essential for responsible evaluation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Current AI-assisted skin image diagnosis has achieved dermatologist-level performance in classifying skin cancer, driven by rapid advancements in deep learning architectures. However, unlike traditional vision tasks, skin images in general present unique challenges due to the limited availability of well-annotated datasets, complex variations in conditions, and the necessity for detailed interpretations to ensure patient safety. Previous segmentation methods have sought to reduce image noise and enhance diagnostic performance, but these techniques require fine-grained, pixel-level ground truth masks for training. In contrast, with the rise of foundation models, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has been introduced to facilitate promptable segmentation, enabling the automation of the segmentation process with simple yet effective prompts. Efforts applying SAM predominantly focus on dermatoscopy images, which present more easily identifiable lesion boundaries than clinical photos taken with smartphones. This limitation constrains the practicality of these approaches to real-world applications. To overcome the challenges posed by noisy clinical photos acquired via non-standardized protocols and to improve diagnostic accessibility, we propose a novel Cross-Attentive Fusion framework for interpretable skin lesion diagnosis. Our method leverages SAM to generate visual concepts for skin diseases using prompts, integrating local visual concepts with global image features to enhance model performance. Extensive evaluation on two skin disease datasets demonstrates our proposed method's effectiveness on lesion diagnosis and interpretability.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Wearable medical sensors (WMSs) are revolutionizing smart healthcare by enabling continuous, real-time monitoring of user physiological signals, especially in the field of consumer healthcare. The integration of WMSs and modern machine learning (ML) enables unprecedented solutions to efficient early-stage disease detection. Despite the success of Transformers in various fields, their application to sensitive domains, such as smart healthcare, remains underexplored due to limited data accessibility and privacy concerns. To bridge the gap between Transformer-based foundation models and WMS-based disease detection, we propose COMFORT, a continual fine-tuning framework for foundation models targeted at consumer healthcare. COMFORT introduces a novel approach for pre-training a Transformer-based foundation model on a large dataset of physiological signals exclusively collected from healthy individuals with commercially available WMSs. We adopt a masked data modeling (MDM) objective to pre-train this health foundation model. We then fine-tune the model using various parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and its variants, to adapt it to various downstream disease detection tasks that rely on WMS data. In addition, COMFORT continually stores the low-rank decomposition matrices obtained from the PEFT algorithms to construct a library for multi-disease detection. The COMFORT library enables scalable and memory-efficient disease detection on edge devices. Our experimental results demonstrate that COMFORT achieves highly competitive performance while reducing memory overhead by up to 52% relative to conventional methods. Thus, COMFORT paves the way for personalized and proactive solutions to efficient and effective early-stage disease detection for consumer healthcare.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the growing adoption of Text-to-Image (TTI) systems, the social biases of these models have come under increased scrutiny. Herein we conduct a systematic investigation of one such source of bias for diffusion models: embedding spaces. First, because traditional classifier-based fairness definitions require true labels not present in generative modeling, we propose statistical group fairness criteria based on a model's internal representation of the world. Using these definitions, we demonstrate theoretically and empirically that an unbiased text embedding space for input prompts is a necessary condition for representationally balanced diffusion models, meaning the distribution of generated images satisfy diversity requirements with respect to protected attributes. Next, we investigate the impact of biased embeddings on evaluating the alignment between generated images and prompts, a process which is commonly used to assess diffusion models. We find that biased multimodal embeddings like CLIP can result in lower alignment scores for representationally balanced TTI models, thus rewarding unfair behavior. Finally, we develop a theoretical framework through which biases in alignment evaluation can be studied and propose bias mitigation methods. By specifically adapting the perspective of embedding spaces, we establish new fairness conditions for diffusion model development and evaluation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We study the problem of generating intermediate images from image pairs with large motion while maintaining semantic consistency. Due to the large motion, the intermediate semantic information may be absent in input images. Existing methods either limit to small motion or focus on topologically similar objects, leading to artifacts and inconsistency in the interpolation results. To overcome this challenge, we delve into pre-trained image diffusion models for their capabilities in semantic cognition and representations, ensuring consistent expression of the absent intermediate semantic representations with the input. To this end, we propose DreamMover, a novel image interpolation framework with three main components: 1) A natural flow estimator based on the diffusion model that can implicitly reason about the semantic correspondence between two images. 2) To avoid the loss of detailed information during fusion, our key insight is to fuse information in two parts, high-level space and low-level space. 3) To enhance the consistency between the generated images and input, we propose the self-attention concatenation and replacement approach. Lastly, we present a challenging benchmark dataset InterpBench to evaluate the semantic consistency of generated results. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recently, text-guided image editing has achieved significant success. However, existing methods can only apply simple textures like wood or gold when changing the texture of an object. Complex textures such as cloud or fire pose a challenge. This limitation stems from that the target prompt needs to contain both the input image content and <texture>, restricting the texture representation. In this paper, we propose TextureDiffusion, a tuning-free image editing method applied to various texture transfer. Initially, the target prompt is directly set to "<texture>", making the texture disentangled from the input image content to enhance texture representation. Subsequently, query features in self-attention and features in residual blocks are utilized to preserve the structure of the input image. Finally, to maintain the background, we introduce an edit localization technique which blends the self-attention results and the intermediate latents. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that TextureDiffusion can harmoniously transfer various textures with excellent structure and background preservation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The interplay between stochastic processes and optimal control has been extensively explored in the literature. With the recent surge in the use of diffusion models, stochastic processes have increasingly been applied to sample generation. This paper builds on the log transform, known as the Cole-Hopf transform in Brownian motion contexts, and extends it within a more abstract framework that includes a linear operator. Within this framework, we found that the well-known relationship between the Cole-Hopf transform and optimal transport is a particular instance where the linear operator acts as the infinitesimal generator of a stochastic process. We also introduce a novel scenario where the linear operator is the adjoint of the generator, linking to Bayesian inference under specific initial and terminal conditions. Leveraging this theoretical foundation, we develop a new algorithm, named the HJ-sampler, for Bayesian inference for the inverse problem of a stochastic differential equation with given terminal observations. The HJ-sampler involves two stages: (1) solving the viscous Hamilton-Jacobi partial differential equations, and (2) sampling from the associated stochastic optimal control problem. Our proposed algorithm naturally allows for flexibility in selecting the numerical solver for viscous HJ PDEs. We introduce two variants of the solver: the Riccati-HJ-sampler, based on the Riccati method, and the SGM-HJ-sampler, which utilizes diffusion models. We demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed methods by applying them to solve Bayesian inverse problems involving various stochastic processes and prior distributions, including applications that address model misspecifications and quantifying model uncertainty.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Despite the recent advance in self-supervised representations, unsupervised phonetic segmentation remains challenging. Most approaches focus on improving phonetic representations with self-supervised learning, with the hope that the improvement can transfer to phonetic segmentation. In this paper, contrary to recent approaches, we show that peak detection on Mel spectrograms is a strong baseline, better than many self-supervised approaches. Based on this finding, we propose a simple hidden Markov model that uses self-supervised representations and features at the boundaries for phone segmentation. Our results demonstrate consistent improvements over previous approaches, with a generalized formulation allowing versatile design adaptations.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Native Language Identification (NLI) - the task of identifying the native language (L1) of a person based on their writing in the second language (L2) - has applications in forensics, marketing, and second language acquisition. Historically, conventional machine learning approaches that heavily rely on extensive feature engineering have outperformed transformer-based language models on this task. Recently, closed-source generative large language models (LLMs), e.g., GPT-4, have demonstrated remarkable performance on NLI in a zero-shot setting, including promising results in open-set classification. However, closed-source LLMs have many disadvantages, such as high costs and undisclosed nature of training data. This study explores the potential of using open-source LLMs for NLI. Our results indicate that open-source LLMs do not reach the accuracy levels of closed-source LLMs when used out-of-the-box. However, when fine-tuned on labeled training data, open-source LLMs can achieve performance comparable to that of commercial LLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid development of diffusion models has significantly advanced AI-generated content (AIGC), particularly in Text-to-Image (T2I) and Text-to-Video (T2V) generation. Text-based video editing, leveraging these generative capabilities, has emerged as a promising field, enabling precise modifications to videos based on text prompts. Despite the proliferation of innovative video editing models, there is a conspicuous lack of comprehensive evaluation benchmarks that holistically assess these models' performance across various dimensions. Existing evaluations are limited and inconsistent, typically summarizing overall performance with a single score, which obscures models' effectiveness on individual editing tasks. To address this gap, we propose EditBoard, the first comprehensive evaluation benchmark for text-based video editing models. EditBoard encompasses nine automatic metrics across four dimensions, evaluating models on four task categories and introducing three new metrics to assess fidelity. This task-oriented benchmark facilitates objective evaluation by detailing model performance and providing insights into each model's strengths and weaknesses. By open-sourcing EditBoard, we aim to standardize evaluation and advance the development of robust video editing models.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>E-commerce image generation has always been one of the core demands in the e-commerce field. The goal is to restore the missing background that matches the main product given. In the post-AIGC era, diffusion models are primarily used to generate product images, achieving impressive results. This paper systematically analyzes and addresses a core pain point in diffusion model generation: overcompletion, which refers to the difficulty in maintaining product features. We propose two solutions: 1. Using an instance mask fine-tuned inpainting model to mitigate this phenomenon; 2. Adopting a train-free mask guidance approach, which incorporates refined product masks as constraints when combining ControlNet and UNet to generate the main product, thereby avoiding overcompletion of the product. Our method has achieved promising results in practical applications and we hope it can serve as an inspiring technical report in this field.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets), a class of generative models have recently emerged as a suitable framework for generating diverse and high-quality molecular structures by learning from unnormalized reward distributions. Previous works in this direction often restrict exploration by using predefined molecular fragments as building blocks, limiting the chemical space that can be accessed. In this work, we introduce Atomic GFlowNets (A-GFNs), a foundational generative model leveraging individual atoms as building blocks to explore drug-like chemical space more comprehensively. We propose an unsupervised pre-training approach using offline drug-like molecule datasets, which conditions A-GFNs on inexpensive yet informative molecular descriptors such as drug-likeliness, topological polar surface area, and synthetic accessibility scores. These properties serve as proxy rewards, guiding A-GFNs towards regions of chemical space that exhibit desirable pharmacological properties. We further our method by implementing a goal-conditioned fine-tuning process, which adapts A-GFNs to optimize for specific target properties. In this work, we pretrain A-GFN on the ZINC15 offline dataset and employ robust evaluation metrics to show the effectiveness of our approach when compared to other relevant baseline methods in drug design.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In recent years, there has been a surge in the publication of clinical trial reports, making it challenging to conduct systematic reviews. Automatically extracting Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome (PICO) from clinical trial studies can alleviate the traditionally time-consuming process of manually scrutinizing systematic reviews. Existing approaches of PICO frame extraction involves supervised approach that relies on the existence of manually annotated data points in the form of BIO label tagging. Recent approaches, such as In-Context Learning (ICL), which has been shown to be effective for a number of downstream NLP tasks, require the use of labeled examples. In this work, we adopt ICL strategy by employing the pretrained knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs), gathered during the pretraining phase of an LLM, to automatically extract the PICO-related terminologies from clinical trial documents in unsupervised set up to bypass the availability of large number of annotated data instances. Additionally, to showcase the highest effectiveness of LLM in oracle scenario where large number of annotated samples are available, we adopt the instruction tuning strategy by employing Low Rank Adaptation (LORA) to conduct the training of gigantic model in low resource environment for the PICO frame extraction task. Our empirical results show that our proposed ICL-based framework produces comparable results on all the version of EBM-NLP datasets and the proposed instruction tuned version of our framework produces state-of-the-art results on all the different EBM-NLP datasets.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid development of photo-realistic face generation methods has raised significant concerns in society and academia, highlighting the urgent need for robust and generalizable face forgery detection (FFD) techniques. Although existing approaches mainly capture face forgery patterns using image modality, other modalities like fine-grained noises and texts are not fully explored, which limits the generalization capability of the model. In addition, most FFD methods tend to identify facial images generated by GAN, but struggle to detect unseen diffusion-synthesized ones. To address the limitations, we aim to leverage the cutting-edge foundation model, contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP), to achieve generalizable diffusion face forgery detection (DFFD). In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal fine-grained CLIP (MFCLIP) model, which mines comprehensive and fine-grained forgery traces across image-noise modalities via language-guided face forgery representation learning, to facilitate the advancement of DFFD. Specifically, we devise a fine-grained language encoder (FLE) that extracts fine global language features from hierarchical text prompts. We design a multi-modal vision encoder (MVE) to capture global image forgery embeddings as well as fine-grained noise forgery patterns extracted from the richest patch, and integrate them to mine general visual forgery traces. Moreover, we build an innovative plug-and-play sample pair attention (SPA) method to emphasize relevant negative pairs and suppress irrelevant ones, allowing cross-modality sample pairs to conduct more flexible alignment. Extensive experiments and visualizations show that our model outperforms the state of the arts on different settings like cross-generator, cross-forgery, and cross-dataset evaluations.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Time series are ubiquitous and occur naturally in a variety of applications -- from data recorded by sensors in manufacturing processes, over financial data streams to climate data. Different tasks arise, such as regression, classification or segmentation of the time series. However, to reliably solve these challenges, it is important to filter out abnormal observations that deviate from the usual behavior of the time series. While many anomaly detection methods exist for independent data and stationary time series, these methods are not applicable to non-stationary time series. To allow for non-stationarity in the data, while simultaneously detecting anomalies, we propose OML-AD, a novel approach for anomaly detection (AD) based on online machine learning (OML). We provide an implementation of OML-AD within the Python library River and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Anomaly detection on graphs plays an important role in many real-world applications. Usually, these data are composed of multiple types (e.g., user information and transaction records for financial data), thus exhibiting view heterogeneity. Therefore, it can be challenging to leverage such multi-view information and learn the graph's contextual information to identify rare anomalies. To tackle this problem, many deep learning-based methods utilize contrastive learning loss as a regularization term to learn good representations. However, many existing contrastive-based methods show that traditional contrastive learning losses fail to consider the semantic information (e.g., class membership information). In addition, we theoretically show that clustering-based contrastive learning also easily leads to a sub-optimal solution. To address these issues, in this paper, we proposed an autoencoder-based clustering framework regularized by a similarity-guided contrastive loss to detect anomalous nodes. Specifically, we build a similarity map to help the model learn robust representations without imposing a hard margin constraint between the positive and negative pairs. Theoretically, we show that the proposed similarity-guided loss is a variant of contrastive learning loss, and how it alleviates the issue of unreliable pseudo-labels with the connection to graph spectral clustering. Experimental results on several datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed framework.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Current end-to-end autonomous driving methods resort to unifying modular designs for various tasks (e.g. perception, prediction and planning). Although optimized in a planning-oriented spirit with a fully differentiable framework, existing end-to-end driving systems without ego-centric designs still suffer from unsatisfactory performance and inferior efficiency, owing to the rasterized scene representation learning and redundant information transmission. In this paper, we revisit the human driving behavior and propose an ego-centric fully sparse paradigm, named DiFSD, for end-to-end self-driving. Specifically, DiFSD mainly consists of sparse perception, hierarchical interaction and iterative motion planner. The sparse perception module performs detection, tracking and online mapping based on sparse representation of the driving scene. The hierarchical interaction module aims to select the Closest In-Path Vehicle / Stationary (CIPV / CIPS) from coarse to fine, benefiting from an additional geometric prior. As for the iterative motion planner, both selected interactive agents and ego-vehicle are considered for joint motion prediction, where the output multi-modal ego-trajectories are optimized in an iterative fashion. Besides, both position-level motion diffusion and trajectory-level planning denoising are introduced for uncertainty modeling, thus facilitating the training stability and convergence of the whole framework. Extensive experiments conducted on nuScenes dataset demonstrate the superior planning performance and great efficiency of DiFSD, which significantly reduces the average L2 error by \textbf{66\%} and collision rate by \textbf{77\%} than UniAD while achieves \textbf{8.2$\times$} faster running efficiency.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Given recent advances in generative AI technology, a key question is how large language models (LLMs) can enhance acoustic modeling tasks using text decoding results from a frozen, pretrained automatic speech recognition (ASR) model. To explore new capabilities in language modeling for speech processing, we introduce the generative speech transcription error correction (GenSEC) challenge. This challenge comprises three post-ASR language modeling tasks: (i) post-ASR transcription correction, (ii) speaker tagging, and (iii) emotion recognition. These tasks aim to emulate future LLM-based agents handling voice-based interfaces while remaining accessible to a broad audience by utilizing open pretrained language models or agent-based APIs. We also discuss insights from baseline evaluations, as well as lessons learned for designing future evaluations.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Developing an efficient sampler capable of generating independent and identically distributed (IID) samples from a Boltzmann distribution is a crucial challenge in scientific research, e.g. molecular dynamics. In this work, we intend to learn neural samplers given energy functions instead of data sampled from the Boltzmann distribution. By learning the energies of the noised data, we propose a diffusion-based sampler, ENERGY-BASED DENOISING ENERGY MATCHING, which theoretically has lower variance and more complexity compared to related works. Furthermore, a novel bootstrapping technique is applied to EnDEM to balance between bias and variance. We evaluate EnDEM and BEnDEM on a 2-dimensional 40 Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and a 4-particle double-welling potential (DW-4). The experimental results demonstrate that BEnDEM can achieve state-of-the-art performance while being more robust.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Abnormal event detection or anomaly detection in surveillance videos is currently a challenge because of the diversity of possible events. Due to the lack of anomalous events at training time, anomaly detection requires the design of learning methods without supervision. In this work we propose an unsupervised approach for video anomaly detection with the aim to jointly optimize the objectives of the deep neural network and the anomaly detection task using a hybrid architecture. Initially, a convolutional autoencoder is pre-trained in an unsupervised manner with a fusion of depth, motion and appearance features. In the second step, we utilize the encoder part of the pre-trained autoencoder and extract the embeddings of the fused input. Now, we jointly train/ fine tune the encoder to map the embeddings to a hypercenter. Thus, embeddings of normal data fall near the hypercenter, whereas embeddings of anomalous data fall far away from the hypercenter.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose PROSE-FD, a zero-shot multimodal PDE foundational model for simultaneous prediction of heterogeneous two-dimensional physical systems related to distinct fluid dynamics settings. These systems include shallow water equations and the Navier-Stokes equations with incompressible and compressible flow, regular and complex geometries, and different buoyancy settings. This work presents a new transformer-based multi-operator learning approach that fuses symbolic information to perform operator-based data prediction, i.e. non-autoregressive. By incorporating multiple modalities in the inputs, the PDE foundation model builds in a pathway for including mathematical descriptions of the physical behavior. We pre-train our foundation model on 6 parametric families of equations collected from 13 datasets, including over 60K trajectories. Our model outperforms popular operator learning, computer vision, and multi-physics models, in benchmark forward prediction tasks. We test our architecture choices with ablation studies.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper presents RNAdiffusion, a latent diffusion model for generating and optimizing discrete RNA sequences. RNA is a particularly dynamic and versatile molecule in biological processes. RNA sequences exhibit high variability and diversity, characterized by their variable lengths, flexible three-dimensional structures, and diverse functions. We utilize pretrained BERT-type models to encode raw RNAs into token-level biologically meaningful representations. A Q-Former is employed to compress these representations into a fixed-length set of latent vectors, with an autoregressive decoder trained to reconstruct RNA sequences from these latent variables. We then develop a continuous diffusion model within this latent space. To enable optimization, we train reward networks to estimate functional properties of RNA from the latent variables. We employ gradient-based guidance during the backward diffusion process, aiming to generate RNA sequences that are optimized for higher rewards. Empirical experiments confirm that RNAdiffusion generates non-coding RNAs that align with natural distributions across various biological indicators. We fine-tuned the diffusion model on untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNA and optimize sample sequences for protein translation efficiencies. Our guided diffusion model effectively generates diverse UTR sequences with high Mean Ribosome Loading (MRL) and Translation Efficiency (TE), surpassing baselines. These results hold promise for studies on RNA sequence-function relationships, protein synthesis, and enhancing therapeutic RNA design.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The ability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to capture long-range and global topology information is limited by the scope of conventional graph Laplacian, leading to unsatisfactory performance on some datasets, particularly on heterophilic graphs. To address this limitation, we propose a new class of parameterized Laplacian matrices, which provably offers more flexibility in controlling the diffusion distance between nodes than the conventional graph Laplacian, allowing long-range information to be adaptively captured through diffusion on graph. Specifically, we first prove that the diffusion distance and spectral distance on graph have an order-preserving relationship. With this result, we demonstrate that the parameterized Laplacian can accelerate the diffusion of long-range information, and the parameters in the Laplacian enable flexibility of the diffusion scopes. Based on the theoretical results, we propose topology-guided rewiring mechanism to capture helpful long-range neighborhood information for heterophilic graphs. With this mechanism and the new Laplacian, we propose two GNNs with flexible diffusion scopes: namely the Parameterized Diffusion based Graph Convolutional Networks (PD-GCN) and Graph Attention Networks (PD-GAT). Synthetic experiments reveal the high correlations between the parameters of the new Laplacian and the performance of parameterized GNNs under various graph homophily levels, which verifies that our new proposed GNNs indeed have the ability to adjust the parameters to adaptively capture the global information for different levels of heterophilic graphs. They also outperform the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on 6 out of 7 real-world benchmark datasets, which further confirms their superiority.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>One thread of empirical work in social science focuses on decomposing group differences in outcomes into unexplained components and components explained by observable factors. In this paper, we study gender wage decompositions, which require estimating the portion of the gender wage gap explained by career histories of workers. Classical methods for decomposing the wage gap employ simple predictive models of wages which condition on a small set of simple summaries of labor history. The problem is that these predictive models cannot take advantage of the full complexity of a worker's history, and the resulting decompositions thus suffer from omitted variable bias (OVB), where covariates that are correlated with both gender and wages are not included in the model. Here we explore an alternative methodology for wage gap decomposition that employs powerful foundation models, such as large language models, as the predictive engine. Foundation models excel at making accurate predictions from complex, high-dimensional inputs. We use a custom-built foundation model, designed to predict wages from full labor histories, to decompose the gender wage gap. We prove that the way such models are usually trained might still lead to OVB, but develop fine-tuning algorithms that empirically mitigate this issue. Our model captures a richer representation of career history than simple models and predicts wages more accurately. In detail, we first provide a novel set of conditions under which an estimator of the wage gap based on a fine-tuned foundation model is $\sqrt{n}$-consistent. Building on the theory, we then propose methods for fine-tuning foundation models that minimize OVB. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we find that history explains more of the gender wage gap than standard econometric models can measure, and we identify elements of history that are important for reducing OVB.</li>

Learning-based methods address its inherent scale ambiguity by leveraging increasingly large labeled and unlabeled datasets, to produce geometric priors capable of generating accurate predictions across domains. As a result, state of the art approaches show impressive performance in zero-shot relative and metric depth estimation. Recently, diffusion models have exhibited remarkable scalability and generalizable properties in their learned representations. However, because these models repurpose tools originally designed for image generation, they can only operate on dense ground-truth, which is not available for most depth labels, especially in real-world settings. In this paper we present GRIN, an efficient diffusion model designed to ingest sparse unstructured training data. We use image features with 3D geometric positional encodings to condition the diffusion process both globally and locally, generating depth predictions at a pixel-level. With comprehensive experiments across eight indoor and outdoor datasets, we show that GRIN establishes a new state of the art in zero-shot metric monocular depth estimation even when trained from scratch.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This study investigates the efficacy of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in fine-tuning Earth Observation (EO) foundation models for flood segmentation. We hypothesize that LoRA, a parameter-efficient technique, can significantly accelerate the adaptation of large-scale EO models to this critical task while maintaining high performance. We apply LoRA to fine-tune a state-of-the-art EO foundation model pre-trained on diverse satellite imagery, using a curated dataset of flood events. Our results demonstrate that LoRA-based fine-tuning (r-256) improves F1 score by 6.66 points and IoU by 0.11 compared to a frozen encoder baseline, while significantly reducing computational costs. Notably, LoRA outperforms full fine-tuning, which proves computationally infeasible on our hardware. We further assess generalization through out-of-distribution (OOD) testing on a geographically distinct flood event. While LoRA configurations show improved OOD performance over the baseline. This work contributes to research on efficient adaptation of foundation models for specialized EO tasks, with implications for rapid response systems in disaster management. Our findings demonstrate LoRA's potential for enabling faster deployment of accurate flood segmentation models in resource-constrained, time-critical scenarios.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), a paradigm that integrates external contextual information with large language models (LLMs) to enhance factual accuracy and relevance, has emerged as a pivotal area in generative AI. The LLMs used in RAG applications are required to faithfully and completely comprehend the provided context and users' questions, avoid hallucination, handle unanswerable, counterfactual or otherwise low-quality and irrelevant contexts, perform complex multi-hop reasoning and produce reliable citations. In this paper, we introduce SFR-RAG, a small LLM that is instruction-tuned with an emphasis on context-grounded generation and hallucination minimization. We also present ContextualBench, a new evaluation framework compiling multiple popular and diverse RAG benchmarks, such as HotpotQA and TriviaQA, with consistent RAG settings to ensure reproducibility and consistency in model assessments. Experimental results demonstrate that our SFR-RAG-9B model outperforms leading baselines such as Command-R+ (104B) and GPT-4o, achieving state-of-the-art results in 3 out of 7 benchmarks in ContextualBench with significantly fewer parameters. The model is also shown to be resilient to alteration in the contextual information and behave appropriately when relevant context is removed. Additionally, the SFR-RAG model maintains competitive performance in general instruction-following tasks and function-calling capabilities.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Graph anomaly detection (GAD), which aims to identify unusual graph instances (nodes, edges, subgraphs, or graphs), has attracted increasing attention in recent years due to its significance in a wide range of applications. Deep learning approaches, graph neural networks (GNNs) in particular, have been emerging as a promising paradigm for GAD, owing to its strong capability in capturing complex structure and/or node attributes in graph data. Considering the large number of methods proposed for GNN-based GAD, it is of paramount importance to summarize the methodologies and findings in the existing GAD studies, so that we can pinpoint effective model designs for tackling open GAD problems. To this end, in this work we aim to present a comprehensive review of deep learning approaches for GAD. Existing GAD surveys are focused on task-specific discussions, making it difficult to understand the technical insights of existing methods and their limitations in addressing some unique challenges in GAD. To fill this gap, we first discuss the problem complexities and their resulting challenges in GAD, and then provide a systematic review of current deep GAD methods from three novel perspectives of methodology, including GNN backbone design, proxy task design for GAD, and graph anomaly measures. To deepen the discussions, we further propose a taxonomy of 13 fine-grained method categories under these three perspectives to provide more in-depth insights into the model designs and their capabilities. To facilitate the experiments and validation, we also summarize a collection of widely-used GAD datasets and empirical comparison. We further discuss multiple open problems to inspire more future high-quality research.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Omni-directional images have been increasingly used in various applications, including virtual reality and SNS (Social Networking Services). However, their availability is comparatively limited in contrast to normal field of view (NFoV) images, since specialized cameras are required to take omni-directional images. Consequently, several methods have been proposed based on generative adversarial networks (GAN) to synthesize omni-directional images, but these approaches have shown difficulties in training of the models, due to instability and/or significant time consumption in the training. To address these problems, this paper proposes a novel omni-directional image synthesis method, 2S-ODIS (Two-Stage Omni-Directional Image Synthesis), which generated high-quality omni-directional images but drastically reduced the training time. This was realized by utilizing the VQGAN (Vector Quantized GAN) model pre-trained on a large-scale NFoV image database such as ImageNet without fine-tuning. Since this pre-trained model does not represent distortions of omni-directional images in the equi-rectangular projection (ERP), it cannot be applied directly to the omni-directional image synthesis in ERP. Therefore, two-stage structure was adopted to first create a global coarse image in ERP and then refine the image by integrating multiple local NFoV images in the higher resolution to compensate the distortions in ERP, both of which are based on the pre-trained VQGAN model. As a result, the proposed method, 2S-ODIS, achieved the reduction of the training time from 14 days in OmniDreamer to four days in higher image quality.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In recent years,Text-to-SQL, the problem of automatically converting questions posed in natural language to formal SQL queries, has emerged as an important problem at the intersection of natural language processing and data management research. Large language models (LLMs) have delivered impressive performance when used in an off-the-shelf performance, but still fall significantly short of expected expert-level performance. Errors are especially probable when a nuanced understanding is needed of database schemas, questions, and SQL clauses to do proper Text-to-SQL conversion. We introduce SelECT-SQL, a novel in-context learning solution that uses an algorithmic combination of chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, self-correction, and ensemble methods to yield a new state-of-the-art result on challenging Text-to-SQL benchmarks. Specifically, when configured using GPT-3.5-Turbo as the base LLM, SelECT-SQL achieves 84.2% execution accuracy on the Spider leaderboard's development set, exceeding both the best results of other baseline GPT-3.5-Turbo-based solutions (81.1%), and the peak performance (83.5%) of the GPT-4 result reported on the leaderboard.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Imagine a human artist looking at the generated photo of a diffusion model, and hoping to create a painting out of it. There could be some feature of the object in the photo that the artist wants to emphasize, some color to disperse, some silhouette to twist, or some part of the scene to be materialized. These intentions can be viewed as the modification of the cross attention from the text prompt onto UNet, during the desoising diffusion. This work presents AttnMod, to modify attention for creating new unpromptable art styles out of existing diffusion models. The style-creating behavior is studied across different setups.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Unsupervised anomaly detection is a daunting task, as it relies solely on normality patterns from the training data to identify unseen anomalies during testing. Recent approaches have focused on leveraging domain-specific transformations or perturbations to generate synthetic anomalies from normal samples. The objective here is to acquire insights into normality patterns by learning to differentiate between normal samples and these crafted anomalies. However, these approaches often encounter limitations when domain-specific transformations are not well-specified such as in tabular data, or when it becomes trivial to distinguish between them. To address these issues, we introduce a novel domain-agnostic method that employs a set of conditional perturbators and a discriminator. The perturbators are trained to generate input-dependent perturbations, which are subsequently utilized to construct synthetic anomalies, and the discriminator is trained to distinguish normal samples from them. We ensure that the generated anomalies are both diverse and hard to distinguish through two key strategies: i) directing perturbations to be orthogonal to each other and ii) constraining perturbations to remain in proximity to normal samples. Throughout experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art benchmarks, which is evident not only in image data but also in tabular data, where domain-specific transformation is not readily accessible. Additionally, we empirically confirm the adaptability of our method to semi-supervised settings, demonstrating its capacity to incorporate supervised signals to enhance anomaly detection performance even further.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This work presents MotionCom, a training-free motion-aware diffusion based image composition, enabling automatic and seamless integration of target objects into new scenes with dynamically coherent results without finetuning or optimization. Traditional approaches in this area suffer from two significant limitations: they require manual planning for object placement and often generate static compositions lacking motion realism. MotionCom addresses these issues by utilizing a Large Vision Language Model (LVLM) for intelligent planning, and a Video Diffusion prior for motion-infused image synthesis, streamlining the composition process. Our multi-modal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting with LVLM automates the strategic placement planning of foreground objects, considering their potential motion and interaction within the scenes. Complementing this, we propose a novel method MotionPaint to distill motion-aware information from pretrained video diffusion models in the generation phase, ensuring that these objects are not only seamlessly integrated but also endowed with realistic motion. Extensive quantitative and qualitative results highlight MotionCom's superiority, showcasing its efficiency in streamlining the planning process and its capability to produce compositions that authentically depict motion and interaction.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Out-of-Distribution (OoD) detection determines whether the given samples are from the training distribution of the classifier-under-protection, i.e., the In-Distribution (InD), or from a different OoD. Latest researches introduce diffusion models pre-trained on InD data to advocate OoD detection by transferring an OoD image into a generated one that is close to InD, so that one could capture the distribution disparities between original and generated images to detect OoD data. Existing diffusion-based detectors adopt perceptual metrics on the two images to measure such disparities, but ignore a fundamental fact: Perceptual metrics are devised essentially for human-perceived similarities of low-level image patterns, e.g., textures and colors, and are not advisable in evaluating distribution disparities, since images with different low-level patterns could possibly come from the same distribution. To address this issue, we formulate a diffusion-based detection framework that considers the distribution similarity between a tested image and its generated counterpart via a novel proper similarity metric in the informative feature space and probability space learned by the classifier-under-protection. An anomaly-removal strategy is further presented to enlarge such distribution disparities by removing abnormal OoD information in the feature space to facilitate the detection. Extensive empirical results unveil the insufficiency of perceptual metrics and the effectiveness of our distribution similarity framework with new state-of-the-art detection performance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Self-supervised speech representation learning has become essential for extracting meaningful features from untranscribed audio. Recent advances highlight the potential of deriving discrete symbols from the features correlated with linguistic units, which enables text-less training across diverse tasks. In particular, sentence-level Self-Distillation of the pretrained HuBERT (SD-HuBERT) induces syllabic structures within latent speech frame representations extracted from an intermediate Transformer layer. In SD-HuBERT, sentence-level representation is accumulated from speech frame features through self-attention layers using a special CLS token. However, we observe that the information aggregated in the CLS token correlates more with speaker identity than with linguistic content. To address this, we propose a speech-only self-supervised fine-tuning approach that separates syllabic units from speaker information. Our method introduces speaker perturbation as data augmentation and adopts a frame-level training objective to prevent the CLS token from aggregating paralinguistic information. Experimental results show that our approach surpasses the current state-of-the-art method in most syllable segmentation and syllabic unit quality metrics on Librispeech, underscoring its effectiveness in promoting syllabic organization within speech-only models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Detailed and photorealistic 3D human modeling is essential for various applications and has seen tremendous progress. However, full-body reconstruction from a monocular RGB image remains challenging due to the ill-posed nature of the problem and sophisticated clothing topology with self-occlusions. In this paper, we propose PSHuman, a novel framework that explicitly reconstructs human meshes utilizing priors from the multiview diffusion model. It is found that directly applying multiview diffusion on single-view human images leads to severe geometric distortions, especially on generated faces. To address it, we propose a cross-scale diffusion that models the joint probability distribution of global full-body shape and local facial characteristics, enabling detailed and identity-preserved novel-view generation without any geometric distortion. Moreover, to enhance cross-view body shape consistency of varied human poses, we condition the generative model on parametric models like SMPL-X, which provide body priors and prevent unnatural views inconsistent with human anatomy. Leveraging the generated multi-view normal and color images, we present SMPLX-initialized explicit human carving to recover realistic textured human meshes efficiently. Extensive experimental results and quantitative evaluations on CAPE and THuman2.1 datasets demonstrate PSHumans superiority in geometry details, texture fidelity, and generalization capability.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Point cloud completion aims to recover the complete 3D shape of an object from partial observations. While approaches relying on synthetic shape priors achieved promising results in this domain, their applicability and generalizability to real-world data are still limited. To tackle this problem, we propose a self-supervised framework, namely RealDiff, that formulates point cloud completion as a conditional generation problem directly on real-world measurements. To better deal with noisy observations without resorting to training on synthetic data, we leverage additional geometric cues. Specifically, RealDiff simulates a diffusion process at the missing object parts while conditioning the generation on the partial input to address the multimodal nature of the task. We further regularize the training by matching object silhouettes and depth maps, predicted by our method, with the externally estimated ones. Experimental results show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in real-world point cloud completion.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As the demand for human-like interactions with LLMs continues to grow, so does the interest in manipulating their personality traits, which has emerged as a key area of research. Methods like prompt-based In-Context Knowledge Editing (IKE) and gradient-based Model Editor Networks (MEND) have been explored but show irregularity and variability. IKE depends on the prompt, leading to variability and sensitivity, while MEND yields inconsistent and gibberish outputs. To address this, we employed Opinion QA Based Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), specifically Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLORA), to manipulate the Big Five personality traits: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. After PEFT, models such as Mistral-7B-Instruct and Llama-2-7B-chat began generating emojis, despite their absence in the PEFT data. For instance, Llama-2-7B-chat generated emojis in 99.5% of extraversion-related test instances, while Mistral-8B-Instruct did so in 92.5% of openness-related test instances. Explainability analysis indicated that the LLMs used emojis intentionally to express these traits. This paper provides a number of novel contributions. First, introducing an Opinion QA dataset for PEFT-driven personality manipulation; second, developing metric models to benchmark LLM personality traits; third, demonstrating PEFT's superiority over IKE in personality manipulation; and finally, analyzing and validating emoji usage through explainability methods such as mechanistic interpretability and in-context learning explainability methods.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose a self-supervised model producing 3D anatomical positional embeddings (APE) of individual medical image voxels. APE encodes voxels' anatomical closeness, i.e., voxels of the same organ or nearby organs always have closer positional embeddings than the voxels of more distant body parts. In contrast to the existing models of anatomical positional embeddings, our method is able to efficiently produce a map of voxel-wise embeddings for a whole volumetric input image, which makes it an optimal choice for different downstream applications. We train our APE model on 8400 publicly available CT images of abdomen and chest regions. We demonstrate its superior performance compared with the existing models on anatomical landmark retrieval and weakly-supervised few-shot localization of 13 abdominal organs. As a practical application, we show how to cheaply train APE to crop raw CT images to different anatomical regions of interest with 0.99 recall, while reducing the image volume by 10-100 times.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The influence of textures on machine learning models has been an ongoing investigation, specifically in texture bias/learning, interpretability, and robustness. However, due to the lack of large and diverse texture data available, the findings in these works have been limited, as more comprehensive evaluations have not been feasible. Image generative models are able to provide data creation at scale, but utilizing these models for texture synthesis has been unexplored and poses additional challenges both in creating accurate texture images and validating those images. In this work, we introduce an extensible methodology and corresponding new dataset for generating high-quality, diverse texture images capable of supporting a broad set of texture-based tasks. Our pipeline consists of: (1) developing prompts from a range of descriptors to serve as input to text-to-image models, (2) adopting and adapting Stable Diffusion pipelines to generate and filter the corresponding images, and (3) further filtering down to the highest quality images. Through this, we create the Prompted Textures Dataset (PTD), a dataset of 362,880 texture images that span 56 textures. During the process of generating images, we find that NSFW safety filters in image generation pipelines are highly sensitive to texture (and flag up to 60\% of our texture images), uncovering a potential bias in these models and presenting unique challenges when working with texture data. Through both standard metrics and a human evaluation, we find that our dataset is high quality and diverse.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in generative modelling, particularly in enhancing image quality to conform to human preferences. Recently, these models have also been applied to low-level computer vision for photo-realistic image restoration (IR) in tasks such as image denoising, deblurring, dehazing, etc. In this review paper, we introduce key constructions in diffusion models and survey contemporary techniques that make use of diffusion models in solving general IR tasks. Furthermore, we point out the main challenges and limitations of existing diffusion-based IR frameworks and provide potential directions for future work.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Co-speech gestures are fundamental for communication. The advent of recent deep learning techniques has facilitated the creation of lifelike, synchronous co-speech gestures for Embodied Conversational Agents. "In-the-wild" datasets, aggregating video content from platforms like YouTube via human pose detection technologies, provide a feasible solution by offering 2D skeletal sequences aligned with speech. Concurrent developments in lifting models enable the conversion of these 2D sequences into 3D gesture databases. However, it is important to note that the 3D poses estimated from the 2D extracted poses are, in essence, approximations of the ground-truth, which remains in the 2D domain. This distinction raises questions about the impact of gesture representation dimensionality on the quality of generated motions - a topic that, to our knowledge, remains largely unexplored. Our study examines the effect of using either 2D or 3D joint coordinates as training data on the performance of speech-to-gesture deep generative models. We employ a lifting model for converting generated 2D pose sequences into 3D and assess how gestures created directly in 3D stack up against those initially generated in 2D and then converted to 3D. We perform an objective evaluation using widely used metrics in the gesture generation field as well as a user study to qualitatively evaluate the different approaches.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present a novel frequency-based Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) approach that significantly enhances its efficacy for pre-training. Prior work in this direction masks out pre-defined frequencies in the input image and employs a reconstruction loss to pre-train the model. While achieving promising results, such an implementation has two fundamental limitations as identified in our paper. First, using pre-defined frequencies overlooks the variability of image frequency responses. Second, pre-trained with frequency-filtered images, the resulting model needs relatively more data to adapt to naturally looking images during fine-tuning. To address these drawbacks, we propose FOurier transform compression with seLf-Knowledge distillation (FOLK), integrating two dedicated ideas. First, inspired by image compression, we adaptively select the masked-out frequencies based on image frequency responses, creating more suitable SSL tasks for pre-training. Second, we employ a two-branch framework empowered by knowledge distillation, enabling the model to take both the filtered and original images as input, largely reducing the burden of downstream tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of FOLK in achieving competitive performance to many state-of-the-art SSL methods across various downstream tasks, including image classification, few-shot learning, and semantic segmentation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The goal of style transfer is, given a content image and a style source, generating a new image preserving the content but with the artistic representation of the style source. Most of the state-of-the-art architectures use transformers or diffusion-based models to perform this task, despite the heavy computational burden that they require. In particular, transformers use self- and cross-attention layers which have large memory footprint, while diffusion models require high inference time. To overcome the above, this paper explores a novel design of Mamba, an emergent State-Space Model (SSM), called Mamba-ST, to perform style transfer. To do so, we adapt Mamba linear equation to simulate the behavior of cross-attention layers, which are able to combine two separate embeddings into a single output, but drastically reducing memory usage and time complexity. We modified the Mamba's inner equations so to accept inputs from, and combine, two separate data streams. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to adapt the equations of SSMs to a vision task like style transfer without requiring any other module like cross-attention or custom normalization layers. An extensive set of experiments demonstrates the superiority and efficiency of our method in performing style transfer compared to transformers and diffusion models. Results show improved quality in terms of both ArtFID and FID metrics. Code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Autoencoders based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have garnered significant attention in recent years for their ability to extract informative latent representations, characterizing the structure of complex topologies, such as graphs. Despite the prevalence of Graph Autoencoders, there has been limited focus on developing and evaluating explainable neural-based graph generative models specifically designed for signed networks. To address this gap, we propose the Signed Graph Archetypal Autoencoder (SGAAE) framework. SGAAE extracts node-level representations that express node memberships over distinct extreme profiles, referred to as archetypes, within the network. This is achieved by projecting the graph onto a learned polytope, which governs its polarization. The framework employs a recently proposed likelihood for analyzing signed networks based on the Skellam distribution, combined with relational archetypal analysis and GNNs. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the SGAAEs' capability to successfully infer node memberships over the different underlying latent structures while extracting competing communities formed through the participation of the opposing views in the network. Additionally, we introduce the 2-level network polarization problem and show how SGAAE is able to characterize such a setting. The proposed model achieves high performance in different tasks of signed link prediction across four real-world datasets, outperforming several baseline models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, self-supervised, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Self-supervised learning has proved effective for skeleton-based human action understanding. However, previous works either rely on contrastive learning that suffers false negative problems or are based on reconstruction that learns too much unessential low-level clues, leading to limited representations for downstream tasks. Recently, great advances have been made in generative learning, which is naturally a challenging yet meaningful pretext task to model the general underlying data distributions. However, the representation learning capacity of generative models is under-explored, especially for the skeletons with spacial sparsity and temporal redundancy. To this end, we propose Masked Conditional Diffusion (MacDiff) as a unified framework for human skeleton modeling. For the first time, we leverage diffusion models as effective skeleton representation learners. Specifically, we train a diffusion decoder conditioned on the representations extracted by a semantic encoder. Random masking is applied to encoder inputs to introduce a information bottleneck and remove redundancy of skeletons. Furthermore, we theoretically demonstrate that our generative objective involves the contrastive learning objective which aligns the masked and noisy views. Meanwhile, it also enforces the representation to complement for the noisy view, leading to better generalization performance. MacDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance on representation learning benchmarks while maintaining the competence for generative tasks. Moreover, we leverage the diffusion model for data augmentation, significantly enhancing the fine-tuning performance in scenarios with scarce labeled data.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models demonstrate impressive image generation performance with text guidance. Inspired by the learning process of diffusion, existing images can be edited according to text by DDIM inversion. However, the vanilla DDIM inversion is not optimized for classifier-free guidance and the accumulated error will result in the undesired performance. While many algorithms are developed to improve the framework of DDIM inversion for editing, in this work, we investigate the approximation error in DDIM inversion and propose to disentangle the guidance scale for the source and target branches to reduce the error while keeping the original framework. Moreover, a better guidance scale (i.e., 0.5) than default settings can be derived theoretically. Experiments on PIE-Bench show that our proposal can improve the performance of DDIM inversion dramatically without sacrificing efficiency.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>For a vision-language model (VLM) to understand the physical world, such as cause and effect, a first step is to capture the temporal dynamics of the visual world, for example how the physical states of objects evolve over time (e.g. a whole apple into a sliced apple). Our paper aims to investigate if VLMs pre-trained on web-scale data learn to encode object states, which can be extracted with zero-shot text prompts. We curate an object state recognition dataset ChangeIt-Frames, and evaluate nine open-source VLMs, including models trained with contrastive and generative objectives. We observe that while these state-of-the-art vision-language models can reliably perform object recognition, they consistently fail to accurately distinguish the objects' physical states. Through extensive experiments, we identify three areas for improvements for VLMs to better encode object states, namely the quality of object localization, the architecture to bind concepts to objects, and the objective to learn discriminative visual and language encoders on object states. Data and code are released.</li>
