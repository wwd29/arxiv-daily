<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Fruit harvesting poses a significant labor and financial burden for the industry, highlighting the critical need for advancements in robotic harvesting solutions. Machine vision-based fruit detection has been recognized as a crucial component for robust identification of fruits to guide robotic manipulation. Despite considerable progress in leveraging deep learning and machine learning techniques for fruit detection, a common shortfall is the inability to swiftly extend the developed models across different orchards and/or various fruit species. Additionally, the limited availability of pertinent data further compounds these challenges. In this work, we introduce MetaFruit, the largest publicly available multi-class fruit dataset, comprising 4,248 images and 248,015 manually labeled instances across diverse U.S. orchards. Furthermore, this study proposes an innovative open-set fruit detection system leveraging advanced Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) for fruit detection that can adeptly identify a wide array of fruit types under varying orchard conditions. This system not only demonstrates remarkable adaptability in learning from minimal data through few-shot learning but also shows the ability to interpret human instructions for subtle detection tasks. The performance of the developed foundation model is comprehensively evaluated using several metrics, which outperforms the existing state-of-the-art algorithms in both our MetaFruit dataset and other open-sourced fruit datasets, thereby setting a new benchmark in the field of agricultural technology and robotic harvesting. The MetaFruit dataset and detection framework are open-sourced to foster future research in vision-based fruit harvesting, marking a significant stride toward addressing the urgent needs of the agricultural sector.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper presents a novel anomaly and outlier detection algorithm from the SPINEX (Similarity-based Predictions with Explainable Neighbors Exploration) family. This algorithm leverages the concept of similarity and higher-order interactions across multiple subspaces to identify outliers. A comprehensive set of experiments was conducted to evaluate the performance of SPINEX. This algorithm was examined against 21 commonly used anomaly detection algorithms, namely, namely, Angle-Based Outlier Detection (ABOD), Connectivity-Based Outlier Factor (COF), Copula-Based Outlier Detection (COPOD), ECOD, Elliptic Envelope (EE), Feature Bagging with KNN, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), Histogram-based Outlier Score (HBOS), Isolation Forest (IF), Isolation Neural Network Ensemble (INNE), Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Lightweight Online Detector of Anomalies (LODA), Linear Model Deviation-based Detector (LMDD), Local Outlier Factor (LOF), Minimum Covariance Determinant (MCD), One-Class SVM (OCSVM), Quadratic MCD (QMCD), Robust Covariance (RC), Stochastic Outlier Selection (SOS), and Subspace Outlier Detection (SOD), and across 39 synthetic and real datasets from various domains and of a variety of dimensions and complexities. Furthermore, a complexity analysis was carried out to examine the complexity of the proposed algorithm. Our results demonstrate that SPINEX achieves superior performance, outperforms commonly used anomaly detection algorithms, and has moderate complexity (e.g., O(n log n d)). More specifically, SPINEX was found to rank at the top of algorithms on the synthetic datasets and the 7th on the real datasets. Finally, a demonstration of the explainability capabilities of SPINEX, along with future research needs, is presented.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this work, we study how well the learned weights of a neural network utilize the space available to them. This notion is related to capacity, but additionally incorporates the interaction of the network architecture with the dataset. Most learned weights appear to be full rank, and are therefore not amenable to low rank decomposition. This deceptively implies that the weights are utilizing the entire space available to them. We propose a simple data-driven transformation that projects the weights onto the subspace where the data and the weight interact. This preserves the functional mapping of the layer and reveals its low rank structure. In our findings, we conclude that most models utilize a fraction of the available space. For instance, for ViTB-16 and ViTL-16 trained on ImageNet, the mean layer utilization is 35% and 20% respectively. Our transformation results in reducing the parameters to 50% and 25% respectively, while resulting in less than 0.2% accuracy drop after fine-tuning. We also show that self-supervised pre-training drives this utilization up to 70%, justifying its suitability for downstream tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce segmentation-free guidance, a novel method designed for text-to-image diffusion models like Stable Diffusion. Our method does not require retraining of the diffusion model. At no additional compute cost, it uses the diffusion model itself as an implied segmentation network, hence named segmentation-free guidance, to dynamically adjust the negative prompt for each patch of the generated image, based on the patch's relevance to concepts in the prompt. We evaluate segmentation-free guidance both objectively, using FID, CLIP, IS, and PickScore, and subjectively, through human evaluators. For the subjective evaluation, we also propose a methodology for subsampling the prompts in a dataset like MS COCO-30K to keep the number of human evaluations manageable while ensuring that the selected subset is both representative in terms of content and fair in terms of model performance. The results demonstrate the superiority of our segmentation-free guidance to the widely used classifier-free method. Human evaluators preferred segmentation-free guidance over classifier-free 60% to 19%, with 18% of occasions showing a strong preference. Additionally, PickScore win-rate, a recently proposed metric mimicking human preference, also indicates a preference for our method over classifier-free.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we propose to reformulate the blind image deblurring task to directly learn an inverse of the degradation model using a deep linear network. We introduce Deep Identity Learning (DIL), a novel learning strategy that includes a dedicated regularization term based on the properties of linear systems, to exploit the identity relation between the degradation and inverse degradation models. The salient aspect of our proposed framework is it neither relies on a deblurring dataset nor a single input blurred image (like Polyblur, a self-supervised method). Since it is purely image-data-independent, we term our model as Null-Shot deblurring Using Deep Identity Learning (NSD-DIL). We also provide an explicit representation of the learned deep linear network in a matrix form, called Deep Restoration Kernel (DRK) for deblurring task. The proposed framework detours the typical degradation kernel estimation step involved in most of the existing blind deblurring solutions by the proposition of our Random Kernel Gallery (RKG) dataset. In this work, we focus on the restoration of mild blur images, generated by small out-of-focus, lens blur, or slight camera motion, which often occurs in real images. Our experiments show that the proposed method outperforms both traditional and deep learning based deblurring methods, with at least an order of 100 lesser computational resources. The proposed NSD-DIL method can be effortlessly extended to the Image Super-Resolution (ISR) task as well to restore the low-resolution images with fine details. The NSD-DIL model and its kernel form representation (DRK) are lightweight yet robust and restore the mild blur input in a fraction of a second. Hence, more suitable for wide real-time applications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While text-to-image models like DALLE-3 and Stable Diffusion are rapidly proliferating, they often encounter challenges such as hallucination, bias, and the production of unsafe, low-quality output. To effectively address these issues, it is crucial to align these models with desired behaviors based on feedback from a multimodal judge. Despite their significance, current multimodal judges frequently undergo inadequate evaluation of their capabilities and limitations, potentially leading to misalignment and unsafe fine-tuning outcomes. To address this issue, we introduce MJ-Bench, a novel benchmark which incorporates a comprehensive preference dataset to evaluate multimodal judges in providing feedback for image generation models across four key perspectives: alignment, safety, image quality, and bias. Specifically, we evaluate a large variety of multimodal judges including smaller-sized CLIP-based scoring models, open-source VLMs (e.g. LLaVA family), and close-source VLMs (e.g. GPT-4o, Claude 3) on each decomposed subcategory of our preference dataset. Experiments reveal that close-source VLMs generally provide better feedback, with GPT-4o outperforming other judges in average. Compared with open-source VLMs, smaller-sized scoring models can provide better feedback regarding text-image alignment and image quality, while VLMs provide more accurate feedback regarding safety and generation bias due to their stronger reasoning capabilities. Further studies in feedback scale reveal that VLM judges can generally provide more accurate and stable feedback in natural language (Likert-scale) than numerical scales. Notably, human evaluations on end-to-end fine-tuned models using separate feedback from these multimodal judges provide similar conclusions, further confirming the effectiveness of MJ-Bench.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Volumetric medical image segmentation is pivotal in enhancing disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and advancing medical research. While existing volumetric foundation models for medical image segmentation, such as SAM-Med3D and SegVol, have shown remarkable performance on general organs and tumors, their ability to segment certain categories in clinical downstream tasks remains limited. Supervised Finetuning (SFT) serves as an effective way to adapt such foundation models for task-specific downstream tasks but at the cost of degrading the general knowledge previously stored in the original foundation this http URL address this, we propose SAM-Med3D-MoE, a novel framework that seamlessly integrates task-specific finetuned models with the foundational model, creating a unified model at minimal additional training expense for an extra gating network. This gating network, in conjunction with a selection strategy, allows the unified model to achieve comparable performance of the original models in their respective tasks both general and specialized without updating any parameters of them.Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of SAM-Med3D-MoE, with an average Dice performance increase from 53 to 56.4 on 15 specific classes. It especially gets remarkable gains of 29.6, 8.5, 11.2 on the spinal cord, esophagus, and right hip, respectively. Additionally, it achieves 48.9 Dice on the challenging SPPIN2023 Challenge, significantly surpassing the general expert's performance of 32.3. We anticipate that SAM-Med3D-MoE can serve as a new framework for adapting the foundation model to specific areas in medical image analysis. Codes and datasets will be publicly available.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We offer a novel approach to image composition, which integrates multiple input images into a single, coherent image. Rather than concentrating on specific use cases such as appearance editing (image harmonization) or semantic editing (semantic image composition), we showcase the potential of utilizing the powerful generative prior inherent in large-scale pre-trained diffusion models to accomplish generic image composition applicable to both scenarios. We observe that the pre-trained diffusion models automatically identify simple copy-paste boundary areas as low-density regions during denoising. Building on this insight, we propose to optimize the composed image towards high-density regions guided by the diffusion prior. In addition, we introduce a novel maskguided loss to further enable flexible semantic image composition. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our approach in achieving generic zero-shot image composition. Additionally, our approach shows promising potential in various tasks, such as object removal and multiconcept customization.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Normalizing Flows (NFs) have gained popularity among deep generative models due to their ability to provide exact likelihood estimation and efficient sampling. However, a crucial limitation of NFs is their substantial memory requirements, arising from maintaining the dimension of the latent space equal to that of the input space. Multi-scale architectures bypass this limitation by progressively reducing the dimension of latent variables while ensuring reversibility. Existing multi-scale architectures split the latent variables in a simple, static manner at the channel level, compromising NFs' expressive power. To address this issue, we propose a regularized and feature-dependent $\mathtt{Shuffle}$ operation and integrate it into vanilla multi-scale architecture. This operation heuristically generates channel-wise weights and adaptively shuffles latent variables before splitting them with these weights. We observe that such operation guides the variables to evolve in the direction of entropy increase, hence we refer to NFs with the $\mathtt{Shuffle}$ operation as \emph{Entropy-Informed Weighting Channel Normalizing Flow} (EIW-Flow). Experimental results indicate that the EIW-Flow achieves state-of-the-art density estimation results and comparable sample quality on CIFAR-10, CelebA and ImageNet datasets, with negligible additional computational overhead.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) have recently become the leading source of answers for users' questions online. Despite their ability to offer eloquent answers, their accuracy and reliability can pose a significant challenge. This is especially true for sensitive domains such as biomedicine, where there is a higher need for factually correct answers. This paper introduces a biomedical retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system designed to enhance the reliability of generated responses. The system is based on a fine-tuned LLM for the referenced question-answering, where retrieved relevant abstracts from PubMed are passed to LLM's context as input through a prompt. Its output is an answer based on PubMed abstracts, where each statement is referenced accordingly, allowing the users to verify the answer. Our retrieval system achieves an absolute improvement of 23% compared to the PubMed search engine. Based on the manual evaluation on a small sample, our fine-tuned LLM component achieves comparable results to GPT-4 Turbo in referencing relevant abstracts. We make the dataset used to fine-tune the models and the fine-tuned models based on Mistral-7B-instruct-v0.1 and v0.2 publicly available.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this work, we leverage the pure skin color patch from the face image as the additional information to train an auxiliary skin color feature extractor and face recognition model in parallel to improve performance of state-of-the-art (SOTA) privacy-preserving face recognition (PPFR) systems. Our solution is robust against black-box attacking and well-established generative adversarial network (GAN) based image restoration. We analyze the potential risk in previous work, where the proposed cosine similarity computation might directly leak the protected precomputed embedding stored on the server side. We propose a Function Secret Sharing (FSS) based face embedding comparison protocol without any intermediate result leakage. In addition, we show in experiments that the proposed protocol is more efficient compared to the Secret Sharing (SS) based protocol.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Despite extensive research into data heterogeneity in federated learning (FL), system heterogeneity remains a significant yet often overlooked challenge. Traditional FL approaches typically assume homogeneous hardware resources across FL clients, implying that clients can train a global model within a comparable time. However, in practical FL systems, clients often have heterogeneous resources, which impacts their capacity for training tasks. This discrepancy highlights the significance of exploring model-heterogeneous FL, a paradigm that allows clients to train different models based on their resource capabilities. To address this, we introduce FedTSA, a cluster-based two-stage aggregation method tailored for system heterogeneity in FL. FedTSA starts by clustering clients based on their capabilities, then conducts a two-stage aggregation, i.e., conventional weight averaging for homogeneous models as Stage 1, and deep mutual learning with a diffusion model for aggregating heterogeneous models as Stage 2. Extensive experiments not only show that FedTSA outperforms the baselines, but also explore various factors influencing model performance, thereby validating FedTSA as a promising approach for model-heterogeneous FL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In heterogeneous scenarios where the data distribution amongst the Federated Learning (FL) participants is Non-Independent and Identically distributed (Non-IID), FL suffers from the well known problem of data heterogeneity. This leads the performance of FL to be significantly degraded, as the global model tends to struggle to converge. To solve this problem, we propose Differentially Private Synthetic Data Aided Federated Learning Using Foundation Models (DPSDA-FL), a novel data augmentation strategy that aids in homogenizing the local data present on the clients' side. DPSDA-FL improves the training of the local models by leveraging differentially private synthetic data generated from foundation models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by evaluating it on the benchmark image dataset: CIFAR-10. Our experimental results have shown that DPSDA-FL can improve class recall and classification accuracy of the global model by up to 26% and 9%, respectively, in FL with Non-IID issues.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generating images from hand-drawings is a crucial and fundamental task in content creation. The translation is challenging due to the infinite possibilities and the diverse expectations of users. However, traditional methods are often limited by the availability of training data. Therefore, VisioBlend, a unified framework supporting three-dimensional control over image synthesis from sketches and strokes based on diffusion models, is proposed. It enables users to decide the level of faithfulness to the input strokes and sketches. VisioBlend achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of realism and flexibility, enabling various applications in image synthesis from sketches and strokes. It solves the problem of data availability by synthesizing new data points from hand-drawn sketches and strokes, enriching the dataset and enabling more robust and diverse image synthesis. This work showcases the power of diffusion models in image creation, offering a user-friendly and versatile approach for turning artistic visions into reality.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Self-supervised learning for pre-training (SSP) can help the network learn better low-level features, especially when the size of the training set is small. In contrastive pre-training, the network is pre-trained to distinguish between different versions of the input. For example, the network learns to distinguish pairs (original, rotated) of images where the rotated image was rotated by angle $\theta$ vs. other pairs of images. In this work, we show that, when training using contrastive pre-training in this way, the angle $\theta$ and the dataset interact in interesting ways. We hypothesize, and give some evidence, that, for some datasets, the network can take "shortcuts" for particular rotation angles $\theta$ based on the distribution of the gradient directions in the input, possibly avoiding learning features other than edges, but our experiments do not seem to support that hypothesis. We demonstrate experiments on three radiology datasets. We compute the saliency map indicating which pixels were important in the SSP process, and compare the saliency map to the ground truth foreground/background segmentation. Our visualizations indicate that the effects of rotation angles in SSP are dataset-dependent. We believe the distribution of gradient orientations may play a role in this, but our experiments so far are inconclusive.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Open-vocabulary 3D object detection (OV-3DDet) aims to localize and recognize both seen and previously unseen object categories within any new 3D scene. While language and vision foundation models have achieved success in handling various open-vocabulary tasks with abundant training data, OV-3DDet faces a significant challenge due to the limited availability of training data. Although some pioneering efforts have integrated vision-language models (VLM) knowledge into OV-3DDet learning, the full potential of these foundational models has yet to be fully exploited. In this paper, we unlock the textual and visual wisdom to tackle the open-vocabulary 3D detection task by leveraging the language and vision foundation models. We leverage a vision foundation model to provide image-wise guidance for discovering novel classes in 3D scenes. Specifically, we utilize a object detection vision foundation model to enable the zero-shot discovery of objects in images, which serves as the initial seeds and filtering guidance to identify novel 3D objects. Additionally, to align the 3D space with the powerful vision-language space, we introduce a hierarchical alignment approach, where the 3D feature space is aligned with the vision-language feature space using a pre-trained VLM at the instance, category, and scene levels. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy and generalization, highlighting the potential of foundation models in advancing open-vocabulary 3D object detection in real-world scenarios.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recently, the transform-based tensor representation has attracted increasing attention in multimedia data (e.g., images and videos) recovery problems, which consists of two indispensable components, i.e., transform and characterization. Previously, the development of transform-based tensor representation mainly focuses on the transform aspect. Although several attempts consider using shallow matrix factorization (e.g., singular value decomposition and negative matrix factorization) to characterize the frontal slices of transformed tensor (termed as latent tensor), the faithful characterization aspect is underexplored. To address this issue, we propose a unified Deep Tensor Representation (termed as DTR) framework by synergistically combining the deep latent generative module and the deep transform module. Especially, the deep latent generative module can faithfully generate the latent tensor as compared with shallow matrix factorization. The new DTR framework not only allows us to better understand the classic shallow representations, but also leads us to explore new representation. To examine the representation ability of the proposed DTR, we consider the representative multi-dimensional data recovery task and suggest an unsupervised DTR-based multi-dimensional data recovery model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DTR achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative aspects, especially for fine details recovery.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper presents UltraEdit, a large-scale (approximately 4 million editing samples), automatically generated dataset for instruction-based image editing. Our key idea is to address the drawbacks in existing image editing datasets like InstructPix2Pix and MagicBrush, and provide a systematic approach to producing massive and high-quality image editing samples. UltraEdit offers several distinct advantages: 1) It features a broader range of editing instructions by leveraging the creativity of large language models (LLMs) alongside in-context editing examples from human raters; 2) Its data sources are based on real images, including photographs and artworks, which provide greater diversity and reduced bias compared to datasets solely generated by text-to-image models; 3) It also supports region-based editing, enhanced by high-quality, automatically produced region annotations. Our experiments show that canonical diffusion-based editing baselines trained on UltraEdit set new records on MagicBrush and Emu-Edit benchmarks. Our analysis further confirms the crucial role of real image anchors and region-based editing data. The dataset, code, and models can be found in this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent years have witnessed the vulnerability of Federated Learning (FL) against gradient leakage attacks, where the private training data can be recovered from the exchanged gradients, making gradient protection a critical issue for the FL training process. Existing solutions often resort to perturbation-based mechanisms, such as differential privacy, where each participating client injects a specific amount of noise into local gradients before aggregating to the server, and the global distribution variation finally conceals the gradient privacy. However, perturbation is not always the panacea for gradient protection since the robustness heavily relies on the injected noise. This intuition raises an interesting question: \textit{is it possible to deactivate existing protection mechanisms by removing the perturbation inside the gradients?} In this paper, we present the answer: \textit{yes} and propose the Perturbation-resilient Gradient Leakage Attack (PGLA), the first attempt to recover the perturbed gradients, without additional access to the original model structure or third-party data. Specifically, we leverage the inherent diffusion property of gradient perturbation protection and construct a novel diffusion-based denoising model to implement PGLA. Our insight is that capturing the disturbance level of perturbation during the diffusion reverse process can release the gradient denoising capability, which promotes the diffusion model to generate approximate gradients as the original clean version through adaptive sampling steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PGLA effectively recovers the protected gradients and exposes the FL training process to the threat of gradient leakage, achieving the best quality in gradient denoising and data recovery compared to existing models. We hope to arouse public attention on PGLA and its defense.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Estimating the difficulty of multiple-choice questions would be great help for educators who must spend substantial time creating and piloting stimuli for their tests, and for learners who want to practice. Supervised approaches to difficulty estimation have yielded to date mixed results. In this contribution we leverage an aspect of generative large models which might be seen as a weakness when answering questions, namely their uncertainty, and exploit it towards exploring correlations between two different metrics of uncertainty, and the actual student response distribution. While we observe some present but weak correlations, we also discover that the models' behaviour is different in the case of correct vs wrong answers, and that correlations differ substantially according to the different question types which are included in our fine-grained, previously unused dataset of 451 questions from a Biopsychology course. In discussing our findings, we also suggest potential avenues to further leverage model uncertainty as an additional proxy for item difficulty.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recently, diffusion models have increasingly demonstrated their capabilities in vision understanding. By leveraging prompt-based learning to construct sentences, these models have shown proficiency in classification and visual grounding tasks. However, existing approaches primarily showcase their ability to perform sentence-level localization, leaving the potential for leveraging contextual information for phrase-level understanding largely unexplored. In this paper, we utilize Panoptic Narrative Grounding (PNG) as a proxy task to investigate this capability further. PNG aims to segment object instances mentioned by multiple noun phrases within a given narrative text. Specifically, we introduce the DiffPNG framework, a straightforward yet effective approach that fully capitalizes on the diffusion's architecture for segmentation by decomposing the process into a sequence of localization, segmentation, and refinement steps. The framework initially identifies anchor points using cross-attention mechanisms and subsequently performs segmentation with self-attention to achieve zero-shot PNG. Moreover, we introduce a refinement module based on SAM to enhance the quality of the segmentation masks. Our extensive experiments on the PNG dataset demonstrate that DiffPNG achieves strong performance in the zero-shot PNG task setting, conclusively proving the diffusion model's capability for context-aware, phrase-level understanding.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The development of multimodal models has significantly advanced multimodal sentiment analysis and emotion recognition. However, in real-world applications, the presence of various missing modality cases often leads to a degradation in the model's performance. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal Transformer framework using prompt learning to address the issue of missing modalities. Our method introduces three types of prompts: generative prompts, missing-signal prompts, and missing-type prompts. These prompts enable the generation of missing modality features and facilitate the learning of intra- and inter-modality information. Through prompt learning, we achieve a substantial reduction in the number of trainable parameters. Our proposed method outperforms other methods significantly across all evaluation metrics. Extensive experiments and ablation studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method, showcasing its ability to effectively handle missing modalities.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Underwater image enhancement (UIE) has attracted much attention owing to its importance for underwater operation and marine engineering. Motivated by the recent advance in generative models, we propose a novel UIE method based on image-conditional diffusion transformer (ICDT). Our method takes the degraded underwater image as the conditional input and converts it into latent space where ICDT is applied. ICDT replaces the conventional U-Net backbone in a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) with a transformer, and thus inherits favorable properties such as scalability from transformers. Furthermore, we train ICDT with a hybrid loss function involving variances to achieve better log-likelihoods, which meanwhile significantly accelerates the sampling process. We experimentally assess the scalability of ICDTs and compare with prior works in UIE on the Underwater ImageNet dataset. Besides good scaling properties, our largest model, ICDT-XL/2, outperforms all comparison methods, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) quality of image enhancement.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>One-shot detection of anatomical landmarks is gaining significant attention for its efficiency in using minimal labeled data to produce promising results. However, the success of current methods heavily relies on the employment of extensive unlabeled data to pre-train an effective feature extractor, which limits their applicability in scenarios where a substantial amount of unlabeled data is unavailable. In this paper, we propose the first foundation model-enabled one-shot landmark detection (FM-OSD) framework for accurate landmark detection in medical images by utilizing solely a single template image without any additional unlabeled data. Specifically, we use the frozen image encoder of visual foundation models as the feature extractor, and introduce dual-branch global and local feature decoders to increase the resolution of extracted features in a coarse to fine manner. The introduced feature decoders are efficiently trained with a distance-aware similarity learning loss to incorporate domain knowledge from the single template image. Moreover, a novel bidirectional matching strategy is developed to improve both robustness and accuracy of landmark detection in the case of scattered similarity map obtained by foundation models. We validate our method on two public anatomical landmark detection datasets. By using solely a single template image, our method demonstrates significant superiority over strong state-of-the-art one-shot landmark detection methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved notable progress in medical image segmentation. To achieve effective SSL, a model needs to be able to efficiently learn from limited labeled data and effectively exploiting knowledge from abundant unlabeled data. Recent developments in visual foundation models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), have demonstrated remarkable adaptability with improved sample efficiency. To harness the power of foundation models for application in SSL, we propose a cross prompting consistency method with segment anything model (CPC-SAM) for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Our method employs SAM's unique prompt design and innovates a cross-prompting strategy within a dual-branch framework to automatically generate prompts and supervisions across two decoder branches, enabling effectively learning from both scarce labeled and valuable unlabeled data. We further design a novel prompt consistency regularization, to reduce the prompt position sensitivity and to enhance the output invariance under different prompts. We validate our method on two medical image segmentation tasks. The extensive experiments with different labeled-data ratios and modalities demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over the state-of-the-art SSL methods, with more than 9% Dice improvement on the breast cancer segmentation task.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid expansion of large foundation models within the pre-training and fine-tuning framework has underscored that larger models often yield better results. However, the scaling up of large foundation models has led to soaring costs in fine-tuning and parameter storage, rendering extensive adaptations impractical. This challenge has sparked the development of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), which focuses on optimizing a select subset of parameters while keeping the rest fixed, significantly lowering computational and storage overheads. While recent years have witnessed a significant success in PEFT, a deep understanding of the fundamental principles behind these methods remains unexplored. To this end, here we take the first step to unify all approaches by dissecting them from a decomposition perspective. We initiate a comprehensive mathematical analysis of these methods, allowing us to delve deeply into their underlying mechanisms, and we explore the reasons behind the variations in performance among different techniques. Furthermore, inspired by our theoretical analysis, we introduce two novel PEFT methods alongside a simple yet effective framework designed to enhance the performance of PEFT techniques across various applications. Our empirical validations, conducted across multiple datasets, demonstrate the efficacy of these methods, showcasing both theoretical validity and practical performance improvements under the guidance of our analytical findings. We believe our work will deepen researchers' understanding of PEFT and other techniques, prompting further contemplation and advancing the research across the whole community.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Semantic segmentation and activity classification are key components to creating intelligent surgical systems able to understand and assist clinical workflow. In the Operating Room, semantic segmentation is at the core of creating robots aware of clinical surroundings, whereas activity classification aims at understanding OR workflow at a higher level. State-of-the-art semantic segmentation and activity recognition approaches are fully supervised, which is not scalable. Self-supervision can decrease the amount of annotated data needed. We propose a new 3D self-supervised task for OR scene understanding utilizing OR scene images captured with ToF cameras. Contrary to other self-supervised approaches, where handcrafted pretext tasks are focused on 2D image features, our proposed task consists of predicting the relative 3D distance of image patches by exploiting the depth maps. Learning 3D spatial context generates discriminative features for our downstream tasks. Our approach is evaluated on two tasks and datasets containing multi-view data captured from clinical scenarios. We demonstrate a noteworthy improvement of performance on both tasks, specifically on low-regime data where utility of self-supervised learning is the highest.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recurrent large language models that compete with Transformers in language modeling perplexity are emerging at a rapid rate (e.g., Mamba, RWKV). Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Event cameras harness advantages such as low latency, high temporal resolution, and high dynamic range (HDR), compared to standard cameras. Due to the distinct imaging paradigm shift, a dominant line of research focuses on event-to-video (E2V) reconstruction to bridge event-based and standard computer vision. However, this task remains challenging due to its inherently ill-posed nature: event cameras only detect the edge and motion information locally. Consequently, the reconstructed videos are often plagued by artifacts and regional blur, primarily caused by the ambiguous semantics of event data. In this paper, we find language naturally conveys abundant semantic information, rendering it stunningly superior in ensuring semantic consistency for E2V reconstruction. Accordingly, we propose a novel framework, called LaSe-E2V, that can achieve semantic-aware high-quality E2V reconstruction from a language-guided perspective, buttressed by the text-conditional diffusion models. However, due to diffusion models' inherent diversity and randomness, it is hardly possible to directly apply them to achieve spatial and temporal consistency for E2V reconstruction. Thus, we first propose an Event-guided Spatiotemporal Attention (ESA) module to condition the event data to the denoising pipeline effectively. We then introduce an event-aware mask loss to ensure temporal coherence and a noise initialization strategy to enhance spatial consistency. Given the absence of event-text-video paired data, we aggregate existing E2V datasets and generate textual descriptions using the tagging models for training and evaluation. Extensive experiments on three datasets covering diverse challenging scenarios (e.g., fast motion, low light) demonstrate the superiority of our method. Dataset and code will be available upon acceptance.</li>

Despite the progress, generating sound solely from text poses challenges in ensuring comprehensive scene depiction and temporal alignment. Meanwhile, video-to-sound generation limits the flexibility to prioritize sound synthesis for specific objects within the scene. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel video-and-text-to-sound generation method, called ReWaS, where video serves as a conditional control for a text-to-audio generation model. Our method estimates the structural information of audio (namely, energy) from the video while receiving key content cues from a user prompt. We employ a well-performing text-to-sound model to consolidate the video control, which is much more efficient for training multimodal diffusion models with massive triplet-paired (audio-video-text) data. In addition, by separating the generative components of audio, it becomes a more flexible system that allows users to freely adjust the energy, surrounding environment, and primary sound source according to their preferences. Experimental results demonstrate that our method shows superiority in terms of quality, controllability, and training efficiency. Our demo is available at this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Fine-tuning advanced diffusion models for high-quality image stylization usually requires large training datasets and substantial computational resources, hindering their practical applicability. We propose Ada-Adapter, a novel framework for few-shot style personalization of diffusion models. Ada-Adapter leverages off-the-shelf diffusion models and pre-trained image feature encoders to learn a compact style representation from a limited set of source images. Our method enables efficient zero-shot style transfer utilizing a single reference image. Furthermore, with a small number of source images (three to five are sufficient) and a few minutes of fine-tuning, our method can capture intricate style details and conceptual characteristics, generating high-fidelity stylized images that align well with the provided text prompts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on various artistic styles, including flat art, 3D rendering, and logo design. Our experimental results show that Ada-Adapter outperforms existing zero-shot and few-shot stylization methods in terms of output quality, diversity, and training efficiency.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Inferring future activity information based on observed activity data is a crucial step to improve the accuracy of early activity prediction. Traditional methods based on generative adversarial networks(GAN) or joint learning frameworks can achieve good prediction accuracy under low observation ratios, but they usually have high computational costs. In view of this, this paper proposes a spatio-temporal encoding and decoding-based method for future human activity skeleton synthesis. Firstly, algorithms such as time control, discrete cosine transform, and low-pass filtering are used to cut or pad the skeleton sequences. Secondly, the encoder and decoder are responsible for extracting intermediate semantic encoding from observed skeleton sequences and inferring future sequences from the intermediate semantic encoding, respectively. Finally, joint displacement error, velocity error, and acceleration error, three higher-order kinematic features, are used as key components of the loss function to optimize model parameters. Experimental results show that the proposed future skeleton synthesis algorithm performs better than some existing algorithms. It generates skeleton sequences with smaller errors and fewer model parameters, effectively providing future information for early activity prediction.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recently, transfer learning and self-supervised learning have gained significant attention within the medical field due to their ability to mitigate the challenges posed by limited data availability, improve model generalisation, and reduce computational expenses. Transfer learning and self-supervised learning hold immense potential for advancing medical research. However, it is crucial to recognise that transfer learning and self-supervised learning architectures exhibit distinct advantages and limitations, manifesting variations in accuracy, training speed, and robustness. This paper compares the performance and robustness of transfer learning and self-supervised learning in the medical field. Specifically, we pre-trained two models using the same source domain datasets with different pre-training methods and evaluated them on small-sized medical datasets to identify the factors influencing their final performance. We tested data with several common issues in medical domains, such as data imbalance, data scarcity, and domain mismatch, through comparison experiments to understand their impact on specific pre-trained models. Finally, we provide recommendations to help users apply transfer learning and self-supervised learning methods in medical areas, and build more convenient and efficient deployment strategies.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Misinformation about climate change causes numerous negative impacts, necessitating corrective responses. Psychological research has offered various strategies for reducing the influence of climate misinformation, such as the fact-myth-fallacy-fact-structure. However, practically implementing corrective interventions at scale represents a challenge. Automatic detection and correction of misinformation offers a solution to the misinformation problem. This study documents the development of large language models that accept as input a climate myth and produce a debunking that adheres to the fact-myth-fallacy-fact (``truth sandwich'') structure, by incorporating contrarian claim classification and fallacy detection into an LLM prompting framework. We combine open (Mixtral, Palm2) and proprietary (GPT-4) LLMs with prompting strategies of varying complexity. Experiments reveal promising performance of GPT-4 and Mixtral if combined with structured prompts. We identify specific challenges of debunking generation and human evaluation, and map out avenues for future work. We release a dataset of high-quality truth-sandwich debunkings, source code and a demo of the debunking system.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Whole slide imaging is routinely adopted for carcinoma diagnosis and prognosis. Abundant experience is required for pathologists to achieve accurate and reliable diagnostic results of whole slide images (WSI). The huge size and heterogeneous features of WSIs make the workflow of pathological reading extremely time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a novel framework (WSI-VQA) to interpret WSIs by generative visual question answering. WSI-VQA shows universality by reframing various kinds of slide-level tasks in a question-answering pattern, in which pathologists can achieve immunohistochemical grading, survival prediction, and tumor subtyping following human-machine interaction. Furthermore, we establish a WSI-VQA dataset which contains 8672 slide-level question-answering pairs with 977 WSIs. Besides the ability to deal with different slide-level tasks, our generative model which is named Wsi2Text Transformer (W2T) outperforms existing discriminative models in medical correctness, which reveals the potential of our model to be applied in the clinical scenario. Additionally, we also visualize the co-attention mapping between word embeddings and WSIs as an intuitive explanation for diagnostic results.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative, anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Computer network anomaly detection and log analysis, as an important topic in the field of network security, has been a key task to ensure network security and system reliability. First, existing network anomaly detection and log analysis methods are often challenged by high-dimensional data and complex network topologies, resulting in unstable performance and high false-positive rates. In addition, traditional methods are usually difficult to handle time-series data, which is crucial for anomaly detection and log analysis. Therefore, we need a more efficient and accurate method to cope with these problems. To compensate for the shortcomings of current methods, we propose an innovative fusion model that integrates Isolation Forest, GAN (Generative Adversarial Network), and Transformer with each other, and each of them plays a unique role. Isolation Forest is used to quickly identify anomalous data points, and GAN is used to generate synthetic data with the real data distribution characteristics to augment the training dataset, while the Transformer is used for modeling and context extraction on time series data. The synergy of these three components makes our model more accurate and robust in anomaly detection and log analysis tasks. We validate the effectiveness of this fusion model in an extensive experimental evaluation. Experimental results show that our model significantly improves the accuracy of anomaly detection while reducing the false alarm rate, which helps to detect potential network problems in advance. The model also performs well in the log analysis task and is able to quickly identify anomalous behaviors, which helps to improve the stability of the system. The significance of this study is that it introduces advanced deep learning techniques, which work anomaly detection and log analysis.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>World models are receiving increasing attention in autonomous driving for their ability to predict potential future scenarios. In this paper, we present BEVWorld, a novel approach that tokenizes multimodal sensor inputs into a unified and compact Bird's Eye View (BEV) latent space for environment modeling. The world model consists of two parts: the multi-modal tokenizer and the latent BEV sequence diffusion model. The multi-modal tokenizer first encodes multi-modality information and the decoder is able to reconstruct the latent BEV tokens into LiDAR and image observations by ray-casting rendering in a self-supervised manner. Then the latent BEV sequence diffusion model predicts future scenarios given action tokens as conditions. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of BEVWorld in autonomous driving tasks, showcasing its capability in generating future scenes and benefiting downstream tasks such as perception and motion prediction.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In-context learning (ICL) has been instrumental in adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to downstream tasks using correct input-output examples. Recent advances have attempted to improve model performance through principles derived from mistakes, yet these approaches suffer from lack of customization and inadequate error coverage. To address these limitations, we propose Retrieved In-Context Principles (RICP), a novel teacher-student framework. In RICP, the teacher model analyzes mistakes from the student model to generate reasons and insights for preventing similar mistakes. These mistakes are clustered based on their underlying reasons for developing task-level principles, enhancing the error coverage of principles. During inference, the most relevant mistakes for each question are retrieved to create question-level principles, improving the customization of the provided guidance. RICP is orthogonal to existing prompting methods and does not require intervention from the teacher model during inference. Experimental results across seven reasoning benchmarks reveal that RICP effectively enhances performance when applied to various prompting strategies.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In-context learning (ICL) leverages in-context examples as prompts for the predictions of Large Language Models (LLMs). These prompts play a crucial role in achieving strong performance. However, the selection of suitable prompts from a large pool of labeled examples often entails significant annotation costs. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{Sub-SA} (\textbf{Sub}modular \textbf{S}elective \textbf{A}nnotation), a submodule-based selective annotation method. The aim of Sub-SA is to reduce annotation costs while improving the quality of in-context examples and minimizing the time consumption of the selection process. In Sub-SA, we design a submodular function that facilitates effective subset selection for annotation and demonstrates the characteristics of monotonically and submodularity from the theoretical perspective. Specifically, we propose \textbf{RPR} (\textbf{R}eward and \textbf{P}enalty \textbf{R}egularization) to better balance the diversity and representativeness of the unlabeled dataset attributed to a reward term and a penalty term, respectively. Consequently, the selection for annotations can be effectively addressed with a simple yet effective greedy search algorithm based on the submodular function. Finally, we apply the similarity prompt retrieval to get the examples for ICL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This work explores the capability of conversational chatbots powered by large language models (LLMs), to understand and characterize predicate symmetry, a cognitive linguistic function traditionally believed to be an inherent human trait. Leveraging in-context learning (ICL), a paradigm shift enabling chatbots to learn new tasks from prompts without re-training, we assess the symmetrical reasoning of five chatbots: ChatGPT 4, Huggingface chat AI, Microsoft's Copilot AI, LLaMA through Perplexity, and Gemini Advanced. Using the Symmetry Inference Sentence (SIS) dataset by Tanchip et al. (2020), we compare chatbot responses against human evaluations to gauge their understanding of predicate symmetry. Experiment results reveal varied performance among chatbots, with some approaching human-like reasoning capabilities. Gemini, for example, reaches a correlation of 0.85 with human scores, while providing a sounding justification for each symmetry evaluation. This study underscores the potential and limitations of LLMs in mirroring complex cognitive processes as symmetrical reasoning.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent multimodal large language models (MLLM) such as GPT-4o and GPT-4v have shown great potential in autonomous driving. In this paper, we propose a cross-domain few-shot in-context learning method based on the MLLM for enhancing traffic sign recognition (TSR). We first construct a traffic sign detection network based on Vision Transformer Adapter and an extraction module to extract traffic signs from the original road images. To reduce the dependence on training data and improve the performance stability of cross-country TSR, we introduce a cross-domain few-shot in-context learning method based on the MLLM. To enhance MLLM's fine-grained recognition ability of traffic signs, the proposed method generates corresponding description texts using template traffic signs. These description texts contain key information about the shape, color, and composition of traffic signs, which can stimulate the ability of MLLM to perceive fine-grained traffic sign categories. By using the description texts, our method reduces the cross-domain differences between template and real traffic signs. Our approach requires only simple and uniform textual indications, without the need for large-scale traffic sign images and labels. We perform comprehensive evaluations on the German traffic sign recognition benchmark dataset, the Belgium traffic sign dataset, and two real-world datasets taken from Japan. The experimental results show that our method significantly enhances the TSR performance.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Blood vessel networks, represented as 3D graphs, help predict disease biomarkers, simulate blood flow, and aid in synthetic image generation, relevant in both clinical and pre-clinical settings. However, generating realistic vessel graphs that correspond to an anatomy of interest is challenging. Previous methods aimed at generating vessel trees mostly in an autoregressive style and could not be applied to vessel graphs with cycles such as capillaries or specific anatomical structures such as the Circle of Willis. Addressing this gap, we introduce the first application of \textit{denoising diffusion models} in 3D vessel graph generation. Our contributions include a novel, two-stage generation method that sequentially denoises node coordinates and edges. We experiment with two real-world vessel datasets, consisting of microscopic capillaries and major cerebral vessels, and demonstrate the generalizability of our method for producing diverse, novel, and anatomically plausible vessel graphs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Contrastive learning (CL) for Vision Transformers (ViTs) in image domains has achieved performance comparable to CL for traditional convolutional backbones. However, in 3D point cloud pretraining with ViTs, masked autoencoder (MAE) modeling remains dominant. This raises the question: Can we take the best of both worlds? To answer this question, we first empirically validate that integrating MAE-based point cloud pre-training with the standard contrastive learning paradigm, even with meticulous design, can lead to a decrease in performance. To address this limitation, we reintroduce CL into the MAE-based point cloud pre-training paradigm by leveraging the inherent contrastive properties of MAE. Specifically, rather than relying on extensive data augmentation as commonly used in the image domain, we randomly mask the input tokens twice to generate contrastive input pairs. Subsequently, a weight-sharing encoder and two identically structured decoders are utilized to perform masked token reconstruction. Additionally, we propose that for an input token masked by both masks simultaneously, the reconstructed features should be as similar as possible. This naturally establishes an explicit contrastive constraint within the generative MAE-based pre-training paradigm, resulting in our proposed method, Point-CMAE. Consequently, Point-CMAE effectively enhances the representation quality and transfer performance compared to its MAE counterpart. Experimental evaluations across various downstream applications, including classification, part segmentation, and few-shot learning, demonstrate the efficacy of our framework in surpassing state-of-the-art techniques under standard ViTs and single-modal settings.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>For image inpainting, the existing Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) based method i.e. RePaint can produce high-quality images for any inpainting form. It utilizes a pre-trained DDPM as a prior and generates inpainting results by conditioning on the reverse diffusion process, namely denoising process. However, this process is significantly time-consuming. In this paper, we propose an efficient DDPM-based image inpainting method which includes three speed-up strategies. First, we utilize a pre-trained Light-Weight Diffusion Model (LWDM) to reduce the number of parameters. Second, we introduce a skip-step sampling scheme of Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) for the denoising process. Finally, we propose Coarse-to-Fine Sampling (CFS), which speeds up inference by reducing image resolution in the coarse stage and decreasing denoising timesteps in the refinement stage. We conduct extensive experiments on both faces and general-purpose image inpainting tasks, and our method achieves competitive performance with approximately 60 times speedup.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The consequences of a healthcare data breach can be devastating for the patients, providers, and payers. The average financial impact of a data breach in recent months has been estimated to be close to USD 10 million. This is especially significant for healthcare organizations in India that are managing rapid digitization while still establishing data governance procedures that align with the letter and spirit of the law. Computer-based systems for de-identification of personal information are vulnerable to data drift, often rendering them ineffective in cross-institution settings. Therefore, a rigorous assessment of existing de-identification against local health datasets is imperative to support the safe adoption of digital health initiatives in India. Using a small set of de-identified patient discharge summaries provided by an Indian healthcare institution, in this paper, we report the nominal performance of de-identification algorithms (based on language models) trained on publicly available non-Indian datasets, pointing towards a lack of cross-institutional generalization. Similarly, experimentation with off-the-shelf de-identification systems reveals potential risks associated with the approach. To overcome data scarcity, we explore generating synthetic clinical reports (using publicly available and Indian summaries) by performing in-context learning over Large Language Models (LLMs). Our experiments demonstrate the use of generated reports as an effective strategy for creating high-performing de-identification systems with good generalization capabilities.</li>

          Enhancing Vision-Language Models with Scene Graphs for Traffic Accident Understanding(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recognizing a traffic accident is an essential part of any autonomous driving or road monitoring system. An accident can appear in a wide variety of forms, and understanding what type of accident is taking place may be useful to prevent it from reoccurring. The task of being able to classify a traffic scene as a specific type of accident is the focus of this work. We approach the problem by likening a traffic scene to a graph, where objects such as cars can be represented as nodes, and relative distances and directions between them as edges. This representation of an accident can be referred to as a scene graph, and is used as input for an accident classifier. Better results can be obtained with a classifier that fuses the scene graph input with representations from vision and language. This work introduces a multi-stage, multimodal pipeline to pre-process videos of traffic accidents, encode them as scene graphs, and align this representation with vision and language modalities for accident classification. When trained on 4 classes, our method achieves a balanced accuracy score of 57.77% on an (unbalanced) subset of the popular Detection of Traffic Anomaly (DoTA) benchmark, representing an increase of close to 5 percentage points from the case where scene graph information is not taken into account.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Graph anomaly detection (GAD) has been widely applied in many areas, e.g., fraud detection in finance and robot accounts in social networks. Existing methods are dedicated to identifying the outlier nodes that deviate from normal ones. While they heavily rely on high-quality annotation, which is hard to obtain in real-world scenarios, this could lead to severely degraded performance based on noisy labels. Thus, we are motivated to cut the edges of suspicious nodes to alleviate the impact of noise. However, it remains difficult to precisely identify the nodes with noisy labels. Moreover, it is hard to quantitatively evaluate the regret of cutting the edges, which may have either positive or negative influences. To this end, we propose a novel framework REGAD, i.e., REinforced Graph Anomaly Detector. Specifically, we aim to maximize the performance improvement (AUC) of a base detector by cutting noisy edges approximated through the nodes with high-confidence labels. (i) We design a tailored action and search space to train a policy network to carefully prune edges step by step, where only a few suspicious edges are prioritized in each step. (ii) We design a policy-in-the-loop mechanism to iteratively optimize the policy based on the feedback from base detector. The overall performance is evaluated by the cumulative rewards. Extensive experiments are conducted on three datasets under different anomaly ratios. The results indicate the superior performance of our proposed REGAD.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The recent development of Sora leads to a new era in text-to-video (T2V) generation. Along with this comes the rising concern about its security risks. The generated videos may contain illegal or unethical content, and there is a lack of comprehensive quantitative understanding of their safety, posing a challenge to their reliability and practical deployment. Previous evaluations primarily focus on the quality of video generation. While some evaluations of text-to-image models have considered safety, they cover fewer aspects and do not address the unique temporal risk inherent in video generation. To bridge this research gap, we introduce T2VSafetyBench, a new benchmark designed for conducting safety-critical assessments of text-to-video models. We define 12 critical aspects of video generation safety and construct a malicious prompt dataset using LLMs and jailbreaking prompt attacks. Based on our evaluation results, we draw several important findings, including: 1) no single model excels in all aspects, with different models showing various strengths; 2) the correlation between GPT-4 assessments and manual reviews is generally high; 3) there is a trade-off between the usability and safety of text-to-video generative models. This indicates that as the field of video generation rapidly advances, safety risks are set to surge, highlighting the urgency of prioritizing video safety. We hope that T2VSafetyBench can provide insights for better understanding the safety of video generation in the era of generative AI.</li>

We develop a new class of algorithms based on easily implementable numerical schemes that are compatible with discrete-time reinforcement learning (RL) with function approximation. We establish high-order numerical accuracy as well as the approximation error guarantees for the proposed approach. In contrast to discrete-time RL problems where the approximation factor depends on the effective horizon, we obtain a bounded approximation factor using the underlying elliptic structures, even if the effective horizon diverges to infinity.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models~(LLMs) demonstrate remarkable translation capabilities in high-resource language tasks, yet their performance in low-resource languages is hindered by insufficient multilingual data during pre-training. To address this, we dedicate 35,000 A100-SXM4-80GB GPU hours in conducting extensive multilingual continual pre-training on the LLaMA series models, enabling translation support across more than 100 languages. Through a comprehensive analysis of training strategies, such as vocabulary expansion and data augmentation, we develop LLaMAX. Remarkably, without sacrificing its generalization ability, LLaMAX achieves significantly higher translation performance compared to existing open-source LLMs~(by more than 10 spBLEU points) and performs on-par with specialized translation model~(M2M-100-12B) on the Flores-101 benchmark. Extensive experiments indicate that LLaMAX can serve as a robust multilingual foundation model.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Satellite imagery has emerged as an important tool to analyse demographic, health, and development indicators. While various deep learning models have been built for these tasks, each is specific to a particular problem, with few standard benchmarks available. We propose a new dataset pairing satellite imagery and high-quality survey data on child poverty to benchmark satellite feature representations. Our dataset consists of 33,608 images, each 10 km $\times$ 10 km, from 19 countries in Eastern and Southern Africa in the time period 1997-2022. As defined by UNICEF, multidimensional child poverty covers six dimensions and it can be calculated from the face-to-face Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) Program . As part of the benchmark, we test spatial as well as temporal generalization, by testing on unseen locations, and on data after the training years. Using our dataset we benchmark multiple models, from low-level satellite imagery models such as MOSAIKS , to deep learning foundation models, which include both generic vision models such as Self-Distillation with no Labels (DINOv2) models and specific satellite imagery models such as SatMAE. We provide open source code for building the satellite dataset, obtaining ground truth data from DHS and running various models assessed in our work.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this study, we formulate the task of Video Anomaly Detection as a probabilistic analysis of object bounding boxes. We hypothesize that the representation of objects via their bounding boxes only, can be sufficient to successfully identify anomalous events in a scene. The implied value of this approach is increased object anonymization, faster model training and fewer computational resources. This can particularly benefit applications within video surveillance running on edge devices such as cameras. We design our model based on human reasoning which lends itself to explaining model output in human-understandable terms. Meanwhile, the slowest model trains within less than 7 seconds on a 11th Generation Intel Core i9 Processor. While our approach constitutes a drastic reduction of problem feature space in comparison with prior art, we show that this does not result in a reduction in performance: the results we report are highly competitive on the benchmark datasets CUHK Avenue and ShanghaiTech, and significantly exceed on the latest State-of-the-Art results on StreetScene, which has so far proven to be the most challenging VAD dataset.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) can spend extra compute during inference to generate intermediate thoughts, which helps to produce better final responses. Since Chain-of-Thought (Wei et al., 2022), many such System 2 techniques have been proposed such as Rephrase and Respond (Deng et al., 2023a), System 2 Attention (Weston and Sukhbaatar, 2023) and Branch-Solve-Merge (Saha et al., 2023). In this work we investigate self-supervised methods to ``compile'' (distill) higher quality outputs from System 2 techniques back into LLM generations without intermediate reasoning token sequences, as this reasoning has been distilled into System 1. We show that several such techniques can be successfully distilled, resulting in improved results compared to the original System 1 performance, and with less inference cost than System 2. We posit that such System 2 distillation will be an important feature of future continually learning AI systems, enabling them to focus System 2 capabilities on the reasoning tasks that they cannot yet do well.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Domain adaptation (DA) techniques help deep learning models generalize across data shifts for point cloud semantic segmentation (PCSS). Test-time adaptation (TTA) allows direct adaptation of a pre-trained model to unlabeled data during inference stage without access to source data or additional training, avoiding privacy issues and large computational resources. We address TTA for geospatial PCSS by introducing three domain shift paradigms: photogrammetric to airborne LiDAR, airborne to mobile LiDAR, and synthetic to mobile laser scanning. We propose a TTA method that progressively updates batch normalization (BN) statistics with each testing batch. Additionally, a self-supervised learning module optimizes learnable BN affine parameters. Information maximization and reliability-constrained pseudo-labeling improve prediction confidence and supply supervisory signals. Experimental results show our method improves classification accuracy by up to 20\% mIoU, outperforming other methods. For photogrammetric (SensatUrban) to airborne (Hessigheim 3D) adaptation at the inference stage, our method achieves 59.46\% mIoU and 85.97\% OA without retraining or fine-turning.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are known for their ability to learn hierarchical structures, naturally developing detectors for objects, and semantic concepts within their deeper layers. Activation maps (AMs) reveal these saliency regions, which are crucial for many Explainable AI (XAI) methods. However, the direct exploitation of raw AMs in CNNs for feature attribution remains underexplored in literature. This work revises Class Activation Map (CAM) methods by introducing the Label-free Activation Map (LaFAM), a streamlined approach utilizing raw AMs for feature attribution without reliance on labels. LaFAM presents an efficient alternative to conventional CAM methods, demonstrating particular effectiveness in saliency map generation for self-supervised learning while maintaining applicability in supervised learning scenarios.</li>

We show that this method outperforms the baseline of synthesizing images only at the target resolution, while reducing the computational cost per step. We demonstrate that higher resolution synthesis can be achieved by layering convolutions at additional resolution scales, in contrast to other methods which require additional models for super-resolution synthesis.</li>

In this study, we propose a self-supervised, large language model-based (LLMcap) method for PCAP failure detection. LLMcap leverages language-learning abilities and employs masked language modeling to learn grammar, context, and structure. Tested rigorously on various PCAPs, it demonstrates high accuracy despite the absence of labeled data during training, presenting a promising solution for efficient network analysis.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) provides all-weather, high-resolution imaging capabilities, but its unique imaging mechanism often requires expert interpretation, limiting its widespread applicability. Translating SAR images into more easily recognizable optical images using diffusion models helps address this challenge. However, diffusion models suffer from high latency due to numerous iterative inferences, while Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can achieve image translation with just a single iteration but often at the cost of image quality. To overcome these issues, we propose a new training framework for SAR-to-optical image translation that combines the strengths of both approaches. Our method employs consistency distillation to reduce iterative inference steps and integrates adversarial learning to ensure image clarity and minimize color shifts. Additionally, our approach allows for a trade-off between quality and speed, providing flexibility based on application requirements. We conducted experiments on SEN12 and GF3 datasets, performing quantitative evaluations using Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and Frechet Inception Distance (FID), as well as calculating the inference latency. The results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves inference speed by 131 times while maintaining the visual quality of the generated images, thus offering a robust and efficient solution for SAR-to-optical image translation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Controllable generation is considered a potentially vital approach to address the challenge of annotating 3D data, and the precision of such controllable generation becomes particularly imperative in the context of data production for autonomous driving. Existing methods focus on the integration of diverse generative information into controlling inputs, utilizing frameworks such as GLIGEN or ControlNet, to produce commendable outcomes in controllable generation. However, such approaches intrinsically restrict generation performance to the learning capacities of predefined network architectures. In this paper, we explore the integration of controlling information and introduce PerlDiff (Perspective-Layout Diffusion Models), a method for effective street view image generation that fully leverages perspective 3D geometric information. Our PerlDiff employs 3D geometric priors to guide the generation of street view images with precise object-level control within the network learning process, resulting in a more robust and controllable output. Moreover, it demonstrates superior controllability compared to alternative layout control methods. Empirical results justify that our PerlDiff markedly enhances the precision of generation on the NuScenes and KITTI datasets. Our codes and models are publicly available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper introduces Diffuse-TreeVAE, a deep generative model that integrates hierarchical clustering into the framework of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs). The proposed approach generates new images by sampling from a root embedding of a learned latent tree VAE-based structure, it then propagates through hierarchical paths, and utilizes a second-stage DDPM to refine and generate distinct, high-quality images for each data cluster. The result is a model that not only improves image clarity but also ensures that the generated samples are representative of their respective clusters, addressing the limitations of previous VAE-based methods and advancing the state of clustering-based generative modeling.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Previous open-source large multimodal models (LMMs) have faced several limitations: (1) they often lack native integration, requiring adapters to align visual representations with pre-trained large language models (LLMs); (2) many are restricted to single-modal generation; (3) while some support multimodal generation, they rely on separate diffusion models for visual modeling and generation. To mitigate these limitations, we present Anole, an open, autoregressive, native large multimodal model for interleaved image-text generation. We build Anole from Meta AI's Chameleon, adopting an innovative fine-tuning strategy that is both data-efficient and parameter-efficient. Anole demonstrates high-quality, coherent multimodal generation capabilities. We have open-sourced our model, training framework, and instruction tuning data.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce CHAMP, a novel method for learning sequence-to-sequence, multi-hypothesis 3D human poses from 2D keypoints by leveraging a conditional distribution with a diffusion model. To predict a single output 3D pose sequence, we generate and aggregate multiple 3D pose hypotheses. For better aggregation results, we develop a method to score these hypotheses during training, effectively integrating conformal prediction into the learning process. This process results in a differentiable conformal predictor that is trained end2end with the 3D pose estimator. Post-training, the learned scoring model is used as the conformity score, and the 3D pose estimator is combined with a conformal predictor to select the most accurate hypotheses for downstream aggregation. Our results indicate that using a simple mean aggregation on the conformal prediction-filtered hypotheses set yields competitive results. When integrated with more sophisticated aggregation techniques, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across various metrics and datasets while inheriting the probabilistic guarantees of conformal prediction.</li>

          The Tug-of-War Between Deepfake Generation and Detection(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multimodal generative models are rapidly evolving, leading to a surge in the generation of realistic video and audio that offers exciting possibilities but also serious risks. Deepfake videos, which can convincingly impersonate individuals, have particularly garnered attention due to their potential misuse in spreading misinformation and creating fraudulent content. This survey paper examines the dual landscape of deepfake video generation and detection, emphasizing the need for effective countermeasures against potential abuses. We provide a comprehensive overview of current deepfake generation techniques, including face swapping, reenactment, and audio-driven animation, which leverage cutting-edge technologies like generative adversarial networks and diffusion models to produce highly realistic fake videos. Additionally, we analyze various detection approaches designed to differentiate authentic from altered videos, from detecting visual artifacts to deploying advanced algorithms that pinpoint inconsistencies across video and audio signals. The effectiveness of these detection methods heavily relies on the diversity and quality of datasets used for training and evaluation. We discuss the evolution of deepfake datasets, highlighting the importance of robust, diverse, and frequently updated collections to enhance the detection accuracy and generalizability. As deepfakes become increasingly indistinguishable from authentic content, developing advanced detection techniques that can keep pace with generation technologies is crucial. We advocate for a proactive approach in the "tug-of-war" between deepfake creators and detectors, emphasizing the need for continuous research collaboration, standardization of evaluation metrics, and the creation of comprehensive benchmarks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present our approach for the SnakeCLEF 2024 competition to predict snake species from images. We explore and use Meta's DINOv2 vision transformer model for feature extraction to tackle species' high variability and visual similarity in a dataset of 182,261 images. We perform exploratory analysis on embeddings to understand their structure, and train a linear classifier on the embeddings to predict species. Despite achieving a score of 39.69, our results show promise for DINOv2 embeddings in snake identification. All code for this project is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large-scale Text-to-Video (T2V) diffusion models have recently demonstrated unprecedented capability to transform natural language descriptions into stunning and photorealistic videos. Despite the promising results, a significant challenge remains: these models struggle to fully grasp complex compositional interactions between multiple concepts and actions. This issue arises when some words dominantly influence the final video, overshadowing other this http URL tackle this problem, we introduce \textbf{Vico}, a generic framework for compositional video generation that explicitly ensures all concepts are represented properly. At its core, Vico analyzes how input tokens influence the generated video, and adjusts the model to prevent any single concept from dominating. Specifically, Vico extracts attention weights from all layers to build a spatial-temporal attention graph, and then estimates the influence as the \emph{max-flow} from the source text token to the video target token. Although the direct computation of attention flow in diffusion models is typically infeasible, we devise an efficient approximation based on subgraph flows and employ a fast and vectorized implementation, which in turn makes the flow computation manageable and differentiable. By updating the noisy latent to balance these flows, Vico captures complex interactions and consequently produces videos that closely adhere to textual descriptions. We apply our method to multiple diffusion-based video models for compositional T2V and video editing. Empirical results demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances the compositional richness and accuracy of the generated videos.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Personalized text-to-image generation models enable users to create images that depict their individual possessions in diverse scenes, finding applications in various domains. To achieve the personalization capability, existing methods rely on finetuning a text-to-image foundation model on a user's custom dataset, which can be non-trivial for general users, resource-intensive, and time-consuming. Despite attempts to develop finetuning-free methods, their generation quality is much lower compared to their finetuning counterparts. In this paper, we propose Joint-Image Diffusion (\jedi), an effective technique for learning a finetuning-free personalization model. Our key idea is to learn the joint distribution of multiple related text-image pairs that share a common subject. To facilitate learning, we propose a scalable synthetic dataset generation technique. Once trained, our model enables fast and easy personalization at test time by simply using reference images as input during the sampling process. Our approach does not require any expensive optimization process or additional modules and can faithfully preserve the identity represented by any number of reference images. Experimental results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art generation quality, both quantitatively and qualitatively, significantly outperforming both the prior finetuning-based and finetuning-free personalization baselines.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the realm of autonomous driving, accurate 3D perception is the foundation. However, developing such models relies on extensive human annotations -- a process that is both costly and labor-intensive. To address this challenge from a data representation learning perspective, we introduce SuperFlow, a novel framework designed to harness consecutive LiDAR-camera pairs for establishing spatiotemporal pretraining objectives. SuperFlow stands out by integrating two key designs: 1) a dense-to-sparse consistency regularization, which promotes insensitivity to point cloud density variations during feature learning, and 2) a flow-based contrastive learning module, carefully crafted to extract meaningful temporal cues from readily available sensor calibrations. To further boost learning efficiency, we incorporate a plug-and-play view consistency module that enhances the alignment of the knowledge distilled from camera views. Extensive comparative and ablation studies across 11 heterogeneous LiDAR datasets validate our effectiveness and superiority. Additionally, we observe several interesting emerging properties by scaling up the 2D and 3D backbones during pretraining, shedding light on the future research of 3D foundation models for LiDAR-based perception.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in 3D AIGC have shown promise in directly creating 3D objects from text and images, offering significant cost savings in animation and product design. However, detailed edit and customization of 3D assets remains a long-standing challenge. Specifically, 3D Generation methods lack the ability to follow finely detailed instructions as precisely as their 2D image creation counterparts. Imagine you can get a toy through 3D AIGC but with undesired accessories and dressing. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel pipeline called Tailor3D, which swiftly creates customized 3D assets from editable dual-side images. We aim to emulate a tailor's ability to locally change objects or perform overall style transfer. Unlike creating 3D assets from multiple views, using dual-side images eliminates conflicts on overlapping areas that occur when editing individual views. Specifically, it begins by editing the front view, then generates the back view of the object through multi-view diffusion. Afterward, it proceeds to edit the back views. Finally, a Dual-sided LRM is proposed to seamlessly stitch together the front and back 3D features, akin to a tailor sewing together the front and back of a garment. The Dual-sided LRM rectifies imperfect consistencies between the front and back views, enhancing editing capabilities and reducing memory burdens while seamlessly integrating them into a unified 3D representation with the LoRA Triplane Transformer. Experimental results demonstrate Tailor3D's effectiveness across various 3D generation and editing tasks, including 3D generative fill and style transfer. It provides a user-friendly, efficient solution for editing 3D assets, with each editing step taking only seconds to complete.</li>
