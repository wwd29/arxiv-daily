<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) represents a challenging and prominent research task within computer vision. In recent years, Pose-based Video Anomaly Detection (PAD) has drawn considerable attention from the research community due to several inherent advantages over pixel-based approaches despite the occasional suboptimal performance. Specifically, PAD is characterized by reduced computational complexity, intrinsic privacy preservation, and the mitigation of concerns related to discrimination and bias against specific demographic groups. This paper introduces TSGAD, a novel human-centric Two-Stream Graph-Improved Anomaly Detection leveraging Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and trajectory prediction. TSGAD aims to explore the possibility of utilizing VAEs as a new approach for pose-based human-centric VAD alongside the benefits of trajectory prediction. We demonstrate TSGAD's effectiveness through comprehensive experimentation on benchmark datasets. TSGAD demonstrates comparable results with state-of-the-art methods showcasing the potential of adopting variational autoencoders. This suggests a promising direction for future research endeavors.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Reconstruction networks are prevalently used in unsupervised anomaly and Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection due to their independence from labeled anomaly data. However, in multi-class datasets, the effectiveness of anomaly detection is often compromised by the models' generalized reconstruction capabilities, which allow anomalies to blend within the expanded boundaries of normality resulting from the added categories, thereby reducing detection accuracy. We introduce the FUTUREG framework, which incorporates two innovative modules: the Feature Purification Module (FPM) and the CFG Decoder. The FPM constrains the normality boundary within the latent space to effectively filter out anomalous features, while the CFG Decoder uses layer-wise encoder representations to guide the reconstruction of filtered features, preserving fine-grained details. Together, these modules enhance the reconstruction error for anomalies, ensuring high-quality reconstructions for normal samples. Our results demonstrate that FUTUREG achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-class OOD settings and remains competitive in industrial anomaly detection scenarios.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Annually and globally, over three billion radiography examinations and computer tomography scans result in mostly unstructured radiology reports containing free text. Despite the potential benefits of structured reporting, its adoption is limited by factors such as established processes, resource constraints and potential loss of information. However, structured information would be necessary for various use cases, including automatic analysis, clinical trial matching, and prediction of health outcomes. This study introduces RadEx, an end-to-end framework comprising 15 software components and ten artifacts to develop systems that perform automated information extraction from radiology reports. It covers the complete process from annotating training data to extracting information by offering a consistent generic information model and setting boundaries for model development. Specifically, RadEx allows clinicians to define relevant information for clinical domains (e.g., mammography) and to create report templates. The framework supports both generative and encoder-only models and the decoupling of information extraction from template filling enables independent model improvements. Developing information extraction systems according to the RadEx framework facilitates implementation and maintenance as components are easily exchangeable, while standardized artifacts ensure interoperability between components.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the era of large language models, model merging is a promising way to combine multiple task-specific models into a single multitask model without extra training. However, two challenges remain: (a) interference between different models and (b) heterogeneous data during testing. Traditional model merging methods often show significant performance gaps compared to fine-tuned models due to these issues. Additionally, a one-size-fits-all model lacks flexibility for diverse test data, leading to performance degradation. We show that both shared and exclusive task-specific knowledge are crucial for merging performance, but directly merging exclusive knowledge hinders overall performance. In view of this, we propose Twin-Merging, a method that encompasses two principal stages: (1) modularizing knowledge into shared and exclusive components, with compression to reduce redundancy and enhance efficiency; (2) dynamically merging shared and task-specific knowledge based on the input. This approach narrows the performance gap between merged and fine-tuned models and improves adaptability to heterogeneous data. Extensive experiments on $12$ datasets for both discriminative and generative tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showing an average improvement of $28.34\%$ in absolute normalized score for discriminative tasks and even surpassing the fine-tuned upper bound on the generative tasks.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Efficient fine-tuning of large language models for task-specific applications is imperative, yet the vast number of parameters in these models makes their training increasingly challenging. Despite numerous proposals for effective methods, a substantial memory overhead remains for gradient computations during updates. \thm{Can we fine-tune a series of task-specific small models and transfer their knowledge directly to a much larger model without additional training?} In this paper, we explore weak-to-strong specialization using logit arithmetic, facilitating a direct answer to this question. Existing weak-to-strong methods often employ a static knowledge transfer ratio and a single small model for transferring complex knowledge, which leads to suboptimal performance. % To address this, To surmount these limitations, we propose a dynamic logit fusion approach that works with a series of task-specific small models, each specialized in a different task. This method adaptively allocates weights among these models at each decoding step, learning the weights through Kullback-Leibler divergence constrained optimization problems. We conduct extensive experiments across various benchmarks in both single-task and multi-task settings, achieving leading results. By transferring expertise from the 7B model to the 13B model, our method closes the performance gap by 96.4\% in single-task scenarios and by 86.3\% in multi-task scenarios compared to full fine-tuning of the 13B model. Notably, we achieve surpassing performance on unseen tasks. Moreover, we further demonstrate that our method can effortlessly integrate in-context learning for single tasks and task arithmetic for multi-task scenarios.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Customer data is often stored as records in Customer Relations Management systems (CRMs). Data which is manually entered into such systems by one of more users over time leads to data replication, partial duplication or fuzzy duplication. This in turn means that there no longer a single source of truth for customers, contacts, accounts, etc. Downstream business processes become increasing complex and contrived without a unique mapping between a record in a CRM and the target customer. Current methods to detect and de-duplicate records use traditional Natural Language Processing techniques known as Entity Matching. In this paper we show how using the latest advancements in Large Language Models and Generative AI can vastly improve the identification and repair of duplicated records. On common benchmark datasets we find an improvement in the accuracy of data de-duplication rates from 30 percent using NLP techniques to almost 60 percent using our proposed method.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>To build safe and reliable graph machine learning systems, unsupervised graph-level anomaly detection (GLAD) and unsupervised graph-level out-of-distribution (OOD) detection (GLOD) have received significant attention in recent years. Though those two lines of research indeed share the same objective, they have been studied independently in the community due to distinct evaluation setups, creating a gap that hinders the application and evaluation of methods from one to the other. To bridge the gap, in this work, we present a Unified Benchmark for unsupervised Graph-level OOD and anomaly Detection (our method), a comprehensive evaluation framework that unifies GLAD and GLOD under the concept of generalized graph-level OOD detection. Our benchmark encompasses 35 datasets spanning four practical anomaly and OOD detection scenarios, facilitating the comparison of 16 representative GLAD/GLOD methods. We conduct multi-dimensional analyses to explore the effectiveness, generalizability, robustness, and efficiency of existing methods, shedding light on their strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we provide an open-source codebase (this https URL) of our method to foster reproducible research and outline potential directions for future investigations based on our insights.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This work investigates the in-context learning abilities of pretrained large language models (LLMs) when instructed to translate text from a low-resource language into a high-resource language as part of an automated machine translation pipeline. We conduct a set of experiments translating Southern Quechua to Spanish and examine the informativity of various types of information retrieved from a constrained database of digitized pedagogical materials (dictionaries and grammar lessons) and parallel corpora. Using both automatic and human evaluation of model output, we conduct ablation studies that manipulate (1) context type (morpheme translations, grammar descriptions, and corpus examples), (2) retrieval methods (automated vs. manual), and (3) model type. Our results suggest that even relatively small LLMs are capable of utilizing prompt context for zero-shot low-resource translation when provided a minimally sufficient amount of relevant linguistic information. However, the variable effects of prompt type, retrieval method, model type, and language-specific factors highlight the limitations of using even the best LLMs as translation systems for the majority of the world's 7,000+ languages and their speakers.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recently, self-supervised learning (SSL) methods have been used in pre-training the segmentation models for 2D and 3D medical images. Most of these methods are based on reconstruction, contrastive learning and consistency regularization. However, the spatial correspondence of 2D slices from a 3D medical image has not been fully exploited. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised alignment learning framework to pre-train the neural network for medical image segmentation. The proposed framework consists of a new local alignment loss and a global positional loss. We observe that in the same 3D scan, two close 2D slices usually contain similar anatomic structures. Thus, the local alignment loss is proposed to make the pixel-level features of matched structures close to each other. Experimental results show that the proposed alignment learning is competitive with existing self-supervised pre-training approaches on CT and MRI datasets, under the setting of limited annotations.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models have obtained substantial progress in image-to-video (I2V) generation. However, such models are not fully understood. In this paper, we report a significant but previously overlooked issue in I2V diffusion models (I2V-DMs), namely, conditional image leakage. I2V-DMs tend to over-rely on the conditional image at large time steps, neglecting the crucial task of predicting the clean video from noisy inputs, which results in videos lacking dynamic and vivid motion. We further address this challenge from both inference and training aspects by presenting plug-and-play strategies accordingly. First, we introduce a training-free inference strategy that starts the generation process from an earlier time step to avoid the unreliable late-time steps of I2V-DMs, as well as an initial noise distribution with optimal analytic expressions (Analytic-Init) by minimizing the KL divergence between it and the actual marginal distribution to effectively bridge the training-inference gap. Second, to mitigate conditional image leakage during training, we design a time-dependent noise distribution for the conditional image, which favors high noise levels at large time steps to sufficiently interfere with the conditional image. We validate these strategies on various I2V-DMs using our collected open-domain image benchmark and the UCF101 dataset. Extensive results demonstrate that our methods outperform baselines by producing videos with more dynamic and natural motion without compromising image alignment and temporal consistency.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present a numerical method for learning unknown nonautonomous stochastic dynamical system, i.e., stochastic system subject to time dependent excitation or control signals. Our basic assumption is that the governing equations for the stochastic system are unavailable. However, short bursts of input/output (I/O) data consisting of certain known excitation signals and their corresponding system responses are available. When a sufficient amount of such I/O data are available, our method is capable of learning the unknown dynamics and producing an accurate predictive model for the stochastic responses of the system subject to arbitrary excitation signals not in the training data. Our method has two key components: (1) a local approximation of the training I/O data to transfer the learning into a parameterized form; and (2) a generative model to approximate the underlying unknown stochastic flow map in distribution. After presenting the method in detail, we present a comprehensive set of numerical examples to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method, especially for long-term system predictions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models (DMs) have gained attention in Missing Data Imputation (MDI), but there remain two long-neglected issues to be addressed: (1). Inaccurate Imputation, which arises from inherently sample-diversification-pursuing generative process of DMs. (2). Difficult Training, which stems from intricate design required for the mask matrix in model training stage. To address these concerns within the realm of numerical tabular datasets, we introduce a novel principled approach termed Kernelized Negative Entropy-regularized Wasserstein gradient flow Imputation (KnewImp). Specifically, based on Wasserstein gradient flow (WGF) framework, we first prove that issue (1) stems from the cost functionals implicitly maximized in DM-based MDI are equivalent to the MDI's objective plus diversification-promoting non-negative terms. Based on this, we then design a novel cost functional with diversification-discouraging negative entropy and derive our KnewImp approach within WGF framework and reproducing kernel Hilbert space. After that, we prove that the imputation procedure of KnewImp can be derived from another cost functional related to the joint distribution, eliminating the need for the mask matrix and hence naturally addressing issue (2). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed KnewImp approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in large foundation models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), have demonstrated considerable promise across various tasks. Despite their progress, these models still encounter challenges in specialized medical image analysis, especially in recognizing subtle inter-class differences in Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) lesion segmentation. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that customizes SAM for text-prompted DR lesion segmentation, termed TP-DRSeg. Our core idea involves exploiting language cues to inject medical prior knowledge into the vision-only segmentation network, thereby combining the advantages of different foundation models and enhancing the credibility of segmentation. Specifically, to unleash the potential of vision-language models in the recognition of medical concepts, we propose an explicit prior encoder that transfers implicit medical concepts into explicit prior knowledge, providing explainable clues to excavate low-level features associated with lesions. Furthermore, we design a prior-aligned injector to inject explicit priors into the segmentation process, which can facilitate knowledge sharing across multi-modality features and allow our framework to be trained in a parameter-efficient fashion. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our framework over other traditional models and foundation model variants.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) integrates interconnected sensors and devices to support industrial applications, but its dynamic environments pose challenges related to data drift. Considering the limited resources and the need to effectively adapt models to new data distributions, this paper introduces a Continual Learning (CL) approach, i.e., Distillation-based Self-Guidance (DSG), to address challenges presented by industrial streaming data via a novel generative replay mechanism. DSG utilizes knowledge distillation to transfer knowledge from the previous diffusion-based generator to the updated one, improving both the stability of the generator and the quality of reproduced data, thereby enhancing the mitigation of catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results on CWRU, DSA, and WISDM datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DSG. DSG outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline in accuracy, demonstrating improvements ranging from 2.9% to 5.0% on key datasets, showcasing its potential for practical industrial applications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Detecting anomalies in business processes is crucial for ensuring operational success. While many existing methods rely on statistical frequency to detect anomalies, it's important to note that infrequent behavior doesn't necessarily imply undesirability. To address this challenge, detecting anomalies from a semantic viewpoint proves to be a more effective approach. However, current semantic anomaly detection methods treat a trace (i.e., process instance) as multiple event pairs, disrupting long-distance dependencies. In this paper, we introduce DABL, a novel approach for detecting semantic anomalies in business processes using large language models (LLMs). We collect 143,137 real-world process models from various domains. By generating normal traces through the playout of these process models and simulating both ordering and exclusion anomalies, we fine-tune Llama 2 using the resulting log. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that DABL surpasses existing state-of-the-art semantic anomaly detection methods in terms of both generalization ability and learning of given processes. Users can directly apply DABL to detect semantic anomalies in their own datasets without the need for additional training. Furthermore, DABL offers the capability to interpret the causes of anomalies in natural language, providing valuable insights into the detected anomalies.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Employing graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn cohesive and discriminative node representations for clustering has shown promising results in deep graph clustering. However, existing methods disregard the reciprocal relationship between representation learning and structure augmentation. This study suggests that enhancing embedding and structure synergistically becomes imperative for GNNs to unleash their potential in deep graph clustering. A reliable structure promotes obtaining more cohesive node representations, while high-quality node representations can guide the augmentation of the structure, enhancing structural reliability in return. Moreover, the generalization ability of existing GNNs-based models is relatively poor. While they perform well on graphs with high homogeneity, they perform poorly on graphs with low homogeneity. To this end, we propose a graph clustering framework named Synergistic Deep Graph Clustering Network (SynC). In our approach, we design a Transform Input Graph Auto-Encoder (TIGAE) to obtain high-quality embeddings for guiding structure augmentation. Then, we re-capture neighborhood representations on the augmented graph to obtain clustering-friendly embeddings and conduct self-supervised clustering. Notably, representation learning and structure augmentation share weights, significantly reducing the number of model parameters. Additionally, we introduce a structure fine-tuning strategy to improve the model's generalization. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our method. The code is released on GitHub and Code Ocean.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Reconstructing textured meshes from colored point clouds is an important but challenging task in 3D graphics and vision. Most existing methods predict colors as implicit functions in 3D or UV space, suffering from blurry textures or the lack of generalization capability. Addressing this, we propose PointDreamer, a novel framework for textured mesh reconstruction from colored point cloud. It produces meshes with enhanced fidelity and clarity by 2D image inpainting, taking advantage of the mature techniques and massive data of 2D vision. Specifically, we first project the input point cloud into 2D space to generate sparse multi-view images, and then inpaint empty pixels utilizing a pre-trained 2D diffusion model. Next, we design a novel Non-Border-First strategy to unproject the colors of the inpainted dense images back to 3D space, thus obtaining the final textured mesh. In this way, our PointDreamer works in a zero-shot manner, requiring no extra training. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on various synthetic and real-scanned datasets show the SoTA performance of PointDreamer, by significantly outperforming baseline methods with 30\% improvement in LPIPS score (from 0.118 to 0.068).

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We revisit language bottleneck models as an approach to ensuring the explainability of deep learning models for image classification. Because of inevitable information loss incurred in the step of converting images into language, the accuracy of language bottleneck models is considered to be inferior to that of standard black-box models. Recent image captioners based on large-scale foundation models of Vision and Language, however, have the ability to accurately describe images in verbal detail to a degree that was previously believed to not be realistically possible. In a task of disaster image classification, we experimentally show that a language bottleneck model that combines a modern image captioner with a pre-trained language model can achieve image classification accuracy that exceeds that of black-box models. We also demonstrate that a language bottleneck model and a black-box model may be thought to extract different features from images and that fusing the two can create a synergistic effect, resulting in even higher classification accuracy.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Video composition is the core task of video editing. Although image composition based on diffusion models has been highly successful, it is not straightforward to extend the achievement to video object composition tasks, which not only exhibit corresponding interaction effects but also ensure that the objects in the composited video maintain motion and identity consistency, which is necessary to composite a physical harmony video. To address this challenge, we propose a Multiple Video Object Composition (MVOC) method based on diffusion models. Specifically, we first perform DDIM inversion on each video object to obtain the corresponding noise features. Secondly, we combine and edit each object by image editing methods to obtain the first frame of the composited video. Finally, we use the image-to-video generation model to composite the video with feature and attention injections in the Video Object Dependence Module, which is a training-free conditional guidance operation for video generation, and enables the coordination of features and attention maps between various objects that can be non-independent in the composited video. The final generative model not only constrains the objects in the generated video to be consistent with the original object motion and identity, but also introduces interaction effects between objects. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches. Project page: this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Italy exhibits rich linguistic diversity across its territory due to the distinct regional languages spoken in different areas. Recent advances in self-supervised learning provide new opportunities to analyze Italy's linguistic varieties using speech data alone. This includes the potential to leverage representations learned from large amounts of data to better examine nuances between closely related linguistic varieties. In this study, we focus on automatically identifying the geographic region of origin of speech samples drawn from Italy's diverse language varieties. We leverage self-supervised learning models to tackle this task and analyze differences and similarities between Italy's regional languages. In doing so, we also seek to uncover new insights into the relationships among these diverse yet closely related varieties, which may help linguists understand their interconnected evolution and regional development over time and space. To improve the discriminative ability of learned representations, we evaluate several supervised contrastive learning objectives, both as pre-training steps and additional fine-tuning objectives. Experimental evidence shows that pre-trained self-supervised models can effectively identify regions from speech recording. Additionally, incorporating contrastive objectives during fine-tuning improves classification accuracy and yields embeddings that distinctly separate regional varieties, demonstrating the value of combining self-supervised pre-training and contrastive learning for this task.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text-to-image diffusion models can create realistic images based on input texts. Users can describe an object to convey their opinions visually. In this work, we unveil a previously unrecognized and latent risk of using diffusion models to generate images; we utilize emotion in the input texts to introduce negative contents, potentially eliciting unfavorable emotions in users. Emotions play a crucial role in expressing personal opinions in our daily interactions, and the inclusion of maliciously negative content can lead users astray, exacerbating negative emotions. Specifically, we identify the emotion-aware backdoor attack (EmoAttack) that can incorporate malicious negative content triggered by emotional texts during image generation. We formulate such an attack as a diffusion personalization problem to avoid extensive model retraining and propose the EmoBooth. Unlike existing personalization methods, our approach fine-tunes a pre-trained diffusion model by establishing a mapping between a cluster of emotional words and a given reference image containing malicious negative content. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we built a dataset and conducted extensive analysis and discussion about its effectiveness. Given consumers' widespread use of diffusion models, uncovering this threat is critical for society.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Today, the detection of AI-generated content is receiving more and more attention. Our idea is to go beyond detection and try to recover the prompt used to generate a text. This paper, to the best of our knowledge, introduces the first investigation in this particular domain without a closed set of tasks. Our goal is to study if this approach is promising. We experiment with zero-shot and few-shot in-context learning but also with LoRA fine-tuning. After that, we evaluate the benefits of using a semi-synthetic dataset. For this first study, we limit ourselves to text generated by a single model. The results show that it is possible to recover the original prompt with a reasonable degree of accuracy.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Circulant Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) matrices have gained significant importance due to their applications in the diffusion layer of the AES block cipher. In $2013$, Gupta and Ray established that circulant involutory matrices of order greater than $3$ cannot be MDS. This finding prompted a generalization of circulant matrices and the involutory property of matrices by various authors. In $2016$, Liu and Sim introduced cyclic matrices by changing the permutation of circulant matrices. In $1961,$ Friedman introduced $g$-circulant matrices which form a subclass of cyclic matrices. In this article, we first discuss $g$-circulant matrices with involutory and MDS properties. We prove that $g$-circulant involutory matrices of order $k \times k$ cannot be MDS unless $g \equiv -1 \pmod k.$ Next, we delve into $g$-circulant semi-involutory and semi-orthogonal matrices with entries from finite fields. We establish that the $k$-th power of the associated diagonal matrices of a $g$-circulant semi-orthogonal (semi-involutory) matrix of order $k \times k$ results in a scalar matrix. These findings can be viewed as an extension of the results concerning circulant matrices established by Chatterjee {\it{et al.}} in $2022.$</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Computed Tomography (CT) are the predominant modalities utilized in the field of medical imaging. Although MRI capture the complexity of anatomical structures with greater detail than CT, it entails a higher financial costs and requires longer image acquisition times. In this study, we aim to train latent diffusion model for CT to MRI conversion, replacing the commonly-used U-Net or Transformer backbone with a State-Space Model (SSM) called Mamba that operates on latent patches. First, we noted critical oversights in the scan scheme of most Mamba-based vision methods, including inadequate attention to the spatial continuity of patch tokens and the lack of consideration for their varying importance to the target task. Secondly, extending from this insight, we introduce Diffusion Mamba (DiffMa), employing soft masked to integrate Cross-Sequence Attention into Mamba and conducting selective scan in a spiral manner. Lastly, extensive experiments demonstrate impressive performance by DiffMa in medical image generation tasks, with notable advantages in input scaling efficiency over existing benchmark models.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Credit attribution is crucial across various fields. In academic research, proper citation acknowledges prior work and establishes original contributions. Similarly, in generative models, such as those trained on existing artworks or music, it is important to ensure that any generated content influenced by these works appropriately credits the original creators. We study credit attribution by machine learning algorithms. We propose new definitions--relaxations of Differential Privacy--that weaken the stability guarantees for a designated subset of $k$ datapoints. These $k$ datapoints can be used non-stably with permission from their owners, potentially in exchange for compensation. Meanwhile, the remaining datapoints are guaranteed to have no significant influence on the algorithm's output. Our framework extends well-studied notions of stability, including Differential Privacy ($k = 0$), differentially private learning with public data (where the $k$ public datapoints are fixed in advance), and stable sample compression (where the $k$ datapoints are selected adaptively by the algorithm). We examine the expressive power of these stability notions within the PAC learning framework, provide a comprehensive characterization of learnability for algorithms adhering to these principles, and propose directions and questions for future research.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deepfake techniques generate highly realistic data, making it challenging for humans to discern between actual and artificially generated images. Recent advancements in deep learning-based deepfake detection methods, particularly with diffusion models, have shown remarkable progress. However, there is a growing demand for real-world applications to detect unseen individuals, deepfake techniques, and scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a Prototype-based Unified Framework for Deepfake Detection (PUDD). PUDD offers a detection system based on similarity, comparing input data against known prototypes for video classification and identifying potential deepfakes or previously unseen classes by analyzing drops in similarity. Our extensive experiments reveal three key findings: (1) PUDD achieves an accuracy of 95.1% on Celeb-DF, outperforming state-of-the-art deepfake detection methods; (2) PUDD leverages image classification as the upstream task during training, demonstrating promising performance in both image classification and deepfake detection tasks during inference; (3) PUDD requires only 2.7 seconds for retraining on new data and emits 10$^{5}$ times less carbon compared to the state-of-the-art model, making it significantly more environmentally friendly.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The location of knowledge within Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT)-like models has seen extensive recent investigation. However, much of the work is focused towards determining locations of individual facts, with the end goal being the editing of facts that are outdated, erroneous, or otherwise harmful, without the time and expense of retraining the entire model. In this work, we investigate a broader view of knowledge location, that of concepts or clusters of related information, instead of disparate individual facts. To do this, we first curate a novel dataset, called DARC, that includes a total of 34 concepts of ~120K factual statements divided into two types of hierarchical categories, namely taxonomy and meronomy. Next, we utilize existing causal mediation analysis methods developed for determining regions of importance for individual facts and apply them to a series of related categories to provide detailed investigation into whether concepts are associated with distinct regions within these models. We find that related categories exhibit similar areas of importance in contrast to less similar categories. However, fine-grained localization of individual category subsets to specific regions is not apparent.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities, one of the most important being In-Context Learning (ICL). With ICL, LLMs can derive the underlying rule from a few demonstrations and provide answers that comply with the rule. Previous work hypothesized that the network creates a "task vector" in specific positions during ICL. Patching the "task vector" allows LLMs to achieve zero-shot performance similar to few-shot learning. However, we discover that such "task vectors" do not exist in tasks where the rule has to be defined through multiple demonstrations. Instead, the rule information provided by each demonstration is first transmitted to its answer position and forms its own rule vector. Importantly, all the rule vectors contribute to the output in a distributed manner. We further show that the rule vectors encode a high-level abstraction of rules extracted from the demonstrations. These results are further validated in a series of tasks that rely on rules dependent on multiple demonstrations. Our study provides novel insights into the mechanism underlying ICL in LLMs, demonstrating how ICL may be achieved through an information aggregation mechanism.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we leverage the power of latent diffusion models to generate synthetic time series tabular data. Along with the temporal and feature correlations, the heterogeneous nature of the feature in the table has been one of the main obstacles in time series tabular data modeling. We tackle this problem by combining the ideas of the variational auto-encoder (VAE) and the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM). Our model named as \texttt{TimeAutoDiff} has several key advantages including (1) Generality: the ability to handle the broad spectrum of time series tabular data from single to multi-sequence datasets; (2) Good fidelity and utility guarantees: numerical experiments on six publicly available datasets demonstrating significant improvements over state-of-the-art models in generating time series tabular data, across four metrics measuring fidelity and utility; (3) Fast sampling speed: entire time series data generation as opposed to the sequential data sampling schemes implemented in the existing diffusion-based models, eventually leading to significant improvements in sampling speed, (4) Entity conditional generation: the first implementation of conditional generation of multi-sequence time series tabular data with heterogenous features in the literature, enabling scenario exploration across multiple scientific and engineering domains.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Person re-identification (Re-ID) often faces challenges due to variations in human poses and camera viewpoints, which significantly affect the appearance of individuals across images. Existing datasets frequently lack diversity and scalability in these aspects, hindering the generalization of Re-ID models to new camera systems. Previous methods have attempted to address these issues through data augmentation; however, they rely on human poses already present in the training dataset, failing to effectively reduce the human pose bias in the dataset. We propose Diff-ID, a novel data augmentation approach that incorporates sparse and underrepresented human pose and camera viewpoint examples into the training data, addressing the limited diversity in the original training data distribution. Our objective is to augment a training dataset that enables existing Re-ID models to learn features unbiased by human pose and camera viewpoint variations. To achieve this, we leverage the knowledge of pre-trained large-scale diffusion models. Using the SMPL model, we simultaneously capture both the desired human poses and camera viewpoints, enabling realistic human rendering. The depth information provided by the SMPL model indirectly conveys the camera viewpoints. By conditioning the diffusion model on both the human pose and camera viewpoint concurrently through the SMPL model, we generate realistic images with diverse human poses and camera viewpoints. Qualitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in addressing human pose bias and enhancing the generalizability of Re-ID models compared to other data augmentation-based Re-ID approaches. The performance gains achieved by training Re-ID models on our offline augmented dataset highlight the potential of our proposed framework in improving the scalability and generalizability of person Re-ID models.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants store energy by heating a storage medium with an array of mirrors that focus sunlight onto solar receivers atop a central tower. Operating at high temperatures these receivers face risks such as freezing, deformation, and corrosion, leading to operational failures, downtime, or costly equipment damage. We study the problem of anomaly detection (AD) in sequences of thermal images collected over a year from an operational CSP plant. These images are captured at irregular intervals ranging from one to five minutes throughout the day by infrared cameras mounted on solar receivers. Our goal is to develop a method to extract useful representations from high-dimensional thermal images for AD. It should be able to handle temporal features of the data, which include irregularity, temporal dependency between images and non-stationarity due to a strong daily seasonal pattern. The co-occurrence of low-temperature anomalies that resemble normal images from the start and the end of the operational cycle with high-temperature anomalies poses an additional challenge. We first evaluate state-of-the-art deep image-based AD methods, which have been shown to be effective in deriving meaningful image representations for the detection of anomalies. Then, we introduce a forecasting-based AD method that predicts future thermal images from past sequences and timestamps via a deep sequence model. This method effectively captures specific temporal data features and distinguishes between difficult-to-detect temperature-based anomalies. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared to multiple SOTA baselines across multiple evaluation metrics. We have also successfully deployed our solution on five months of unseen data, providing critical insights for the maintenance of the CSP plant. Our code is available at: this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion-based models have achieved notable empirical successes in reinforcement learning (RL) due to their expressiveness in modeling complex distributions. Despite existing methods being promising, the key challenge of extending existing methods for broader real-world applications lies in the computational cost at inference time, i.e., sampling from a diffusion model is considerably slow as it often requires tens to hundreds of iterations to generate even one sample. To circumvent this issue, we propose to leverage the flexibility of diffusion models for RL from a representation learning perspective. In particular, by exploiting the connection between diffusion model and energy-based model, we develop Diffusion Spectral Representation (Diff-SR), a coherent algorithm framework that enables extracting sufficient representations for value functions in Markov decision processes (MDP) and partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP). We further demonstrate how Diff-SR facilitates efficient policy optimization and practical algorithms while explicitly bypassing the difficulty and inference cost of sampling from the diffusion model. Finally, we provide comprehensive empirical studies to verify the benefits of Diff-SR in delivering robust and advantageous performance across various benchmarks with both fully and partially observable settings.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Remotely sensed image high-accuracy interpretation (RSIHI), including tasks such as semantic segmentation and change detection, faces the three major problems: (1) complementarity problem of spatially stationary-and-non-stationary frequency; (2) edge uncertainty problem caused by down-sampling in the encoder step and intrinsic edge noises; and (3) false detection problem caused by imagery registration error in change detection. To solve the aforementioned problems, an uncertainty-diffusion-model-based high-Frequency TransFormer network (UDHF2-Net) is the proposed for RSIHI, the superiority of which is as following: (1) a spatially-stationary-and-non-stationary high-frequency connection paradigm (SHCP) is proposed to enhance the interaction of spatially stationary and non-stationary frequency features to yield high-fidelity edge extraction result. Inspired by HRFormer, SHCP remains the high-frequency stream through the whole encoder-decoder process with parallel high-to-low frequency streams and reduces the edge loss by a downsampling operation; (2) a mask-and-geo-knowledge-based uncertainty diffusion module (MUDM) is proposed to improve the robustness and edge noise resistance. MUDM could further optimize the uncertain region to improve edge extraction result by gradually removing the multiple geo-knowledge-based noises; (3) a semi-pseudo-Siamese UDHF2-Net for change detection task is proposed to reduce the pseudo change by registration error. It adopts semi-pseudo-Siamese architecture to extract above complemental frequency features for adaptively reducing registration differencing, and MUDM to recover the uncertain region by gradually reducing the registration error besides above edge noises. Comprehensive experiments were performed to demonstrate the superiority of UDHF2-Net. Especially ablation experiments indicate the effectiveness of UDHF2-Net.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent work demonstrated Transformers' ability to efficiently copy strings of exponential sizes, distinguishing them from other architectures. We present the Causal Relation Network (CausalRN), an all-MLP sequence modeling architecture that can match Transformers on the copying task. Extending Relation Networks (RNs), we implemented key innovations to support autoregressive sequence modeling while maintaining computational feasibility. We discovered that exponentially-activated RNs are reducible to linear time complexity, and pre-activation normalization induces an infinitely growing memory pool, similar to a KV cache. In ablation study, we found both exponential activation and pre-activation normalization are indispensable for Transformer-level copying. Our findings provide new insights into what actually constitutes strong in-context retrieval.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Experiments in affective computing are based on stimulus datasets that, in the process of standardization, receive metadata describing which emotions each stimulus evokes. In this paper, we explore an approach to creating stimulus datasets for affective computing using generative adversarial networks (GANs). Traditional dataset preparation methods are costly and time consuming, prompting our investigation of alternatives. We conducted experiments with various GAN architectures, including Deep Convolutional GAN, Conditional GAN, Auxiliary Classifier GAN, Progressive Augmentation GAN, and Wasserstein GAN, alongside data augmentation and transfer learning techniques. Our findings highlight promising advances in the generation of emotionally evocative synthetic images, suggesting significant potential for future research and improvements in this domain.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Spatial transcriptomics (ST) enables interrogating the molecular composition of tissue with ever-increasing resolution, depth, and sensitivity. However, costs, rapidly evolving technology, and lack of standards have constrained computational methods in ST to narrow tasks and small cohorts. In addition, the underlying tissue morphology as reflected by H&E-stained whole slide images (WSIs) encodes rich information often overlooked in ST studies. Here, we introduce HEST-1k, a collection of 1,108 spatial transcriptomic profiles, each linked to a WSI and metadata. HEST-1k was assembled using HEST-Library from 131 public and internal cohorts encompassing 25 organs, two species (Homo Sapiens and Mus Musculus), and 320 cancer samples from 25 cancer types. HEST-1k processing enabled the identification of 1.5 million expression--morphology pairs and 60 million nuclei. HEST-1k is tested on three use cases: (1) benchmarking foundation models for histopathology (HEST-Benchmark), (2) biomarker identification, and (3) multimodal representation learning.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Membership inference (MI) attacks try to determine if a data sample was used to train a machine learning model. For foundation models trained on unknown Web data, MI attacks can be used to detect copyrighted training materials, measure test set contamination, or audit machine unlearning. Unfortunately, we find that evaluations of MI attacks for foundation models are flawed, because they sample members and non-members from different distributions. For 8 published MI evaluation datasets, we show that blind attacks -- that distinguish the member and non-member distributions without looking at any trained model -- outperform state-of-the-art MI attacks. Existing evaluations thus tell us nothing about membership leakage of a foundation model's training data.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models have revolutionized various application domains, including computer vision and audio generation. Despite the state-of-the-art performance, diffusion models are known for their slow sample generation due to the extensive number of steps involved. In response, consistency models have been developed to merge multiple steps in the sampling process, thereby significantly boosting the speed of sample generation without compromising quality. This paper contributes towards the first statistical theory for consistency models, formulating their training as a distribution discrepancy minimization problem. Our analysis yields statistical estimation rates based on the Wasserstein distance for consistency models, matching those of vanilla diffusion models. Additionally, our results encompass the training of consistency models through both distillation and isolation methods, demystifying their underlying advantage.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This work is motivated by two key trends. On one hand, large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable versatility in various generative tasks such as writing, drawing, and question answering, significantly reducing the time required for many routine tasks. On the other hand, researchers, whose work is not only time-consuming but also highly expertise-demanding, face increasing challenges as they have to spend more time reading, writing, and reviewing papers. This raises the question: how can LLMs potentially assist researchers in alleviating their heavy workload? This study focuses on the topic of LLMs assist NLP Researchers, particularly examining the effectiveness of LLM in assisting paper (meta-)reviewing and its recognizability. To address this, we constructed the ReviewCritique dataset, which includes two types of information: (i) NLP papers (initial submissions rather than camera-ready) with both human-written and LLM-generated reviews, and (ii) each review comes with "deficiency" labels and corresponding explanations for individual segments, annotated by experts. Using ReviewCritique, this study explores two threads of research questions: (i) "LLMs as Reviewers", how do reviews generated by LLMs compare with those written by humans in terms of quality and distinguishability? (ii) "LLMs as Metareviewers", how effectively can LLMs identify potential issues, such as Deficient or unprofessional review segments, within individual paper reviews? To our knowledge, this is the first work to provide such a comprehensive analysis.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models have recently achieved remarkable results for video generation. Despite the encouraging performances, the generated videos are typically constrained to a small number of frames, resulting in clips lasting merely a few seconds. The primary challenges in producing longer videos include the substantial memory requirements and the extended processing time required on a single GPU. A straightforward solution would be to split the workload across multiple GPUs, which, however, leads to two issues: (1) ensuring all GPUs communicate effectively to share timing and context information, and (2) modifying existing video diffusion models, which are usually trained on short sequences, to create longer videos without additional training. To tackle these, in this paper we introduce Video-Infinity, a distributed inference pipeline that enables parallel processing across multiple GPUs for long-form video generation. Specifically, we propose two coherent mechanisms: Clip parallelism and Dual-scope attention. Clip parallelism optimizes the gathering and sharing of context information across GPUs which minimizes communication overhead, while Dual-scope attention modulates the temporal self-attention to balance local and global contexts efficiently across the devices. Together, the two mechanisms join forces to distribute the workload and enable the fast generation of long videos. Under an 8 x Nvidia 6000 Ada GPU (48G) setup, our method generates videos up to 2,300 frames in approximately 5 minutes, enabling long video generation at a speed 100 times faster than the prior methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Assessment of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is crucial for diagnosing chronic kidney disease (CKD). The lack of domain-independent automatic segmentation tools for the GBM necessitates an AI-based solution to automate the process. In this study, we introduce GBMSeg, a training-free framework designed to automatically segment the GBM in TEM images guided only by a one-shot annotated reference. Specifically, GBMSeg first exploits the robust feature matching capabilities of the pretrained foundation model to generate initial prompt points, then introduces a series of novel automatic prompt engineering techniques across the feature and physical space to optimize the prompt scheme. Finally, GBMSeg employs a class-agnostic foundation segmentation model with the generated prompt scheme to obtain accurate segmentation results. Experimental results on our collected 2538 TEM images confirm that GBMSeg achieves superior segmentation performance with a Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 87.27% using only one labeled reference image in a training-free manner, outperforming recently proposed one-shot or few-shot methods. In summary, GBMSeg introduces a distinctive automatic prompt framework that facilitates robust domain-independent segmentation performance without training, particularly advancing the automatic prompting of foundation segmentation models for medical images. Future work involves automating the thickness measurement of segmented GBM and quantifying pathological indicators, holding significant potential for advancing pathology assessments in clinical applications.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text-to-Image Diffusion Models (T2I DMs) have garnered significant attention for their ability to generate high-quality images from textual descriptions. However, these models often produce images that do not fully align with the input prompts, resulting in semantic inconsistencies. The most prominent issue among these semantic inconsistencies is catastrophic-neglect, where the images generated by T2I DMs miss key objects mentioned in the prompt. We first conduct an empirical study on this issue, exploring the prevalence of catastrophic-neglect, potential mitigation strategies with feature enhancement, and the insights gained. Guided by the empirical findings, we propose an automated repair approach named Patcher to address catastrophic-neglect in T2I DMs. Specifically, Patcher first determines whether there are any neglected objects in the prompt, and then applies attention-guided feature enhancement to these neglected objects, resulting in a repaired prompt. Experimental results on three versions of Stable Diffusion demonstrate that Patcher effectively repairs the issue of catastrophic-neglect, achieving 10.1%-16.3% higher Correct Rate in image generation compared to baselines.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>3D generation guided by text-to-image diffusion models enables the creation of visually compelling assets. However previous methods explore generation based on image or text. The boundaries of creativity are limited by what can be expressed through words or the images that can be sourced. We present YouDream, a method to generate high-quality anatomically controllable animals. YouDream is guided using a text-to-image diffusion model controlled by 2D views of a 3D pose prior. Our method generates 3D animals that are not possible to create using previous text-to-3D generative methods. Additionally, our method is capable of preserving anatomic consistency in the generated animals, an area where prior text-to-3D approaches often struggle. Moreover, we design a fully automated pipeline for generating commonly found animals. To circumvent the need for human intervention to create a 3D pose, we propose a multi-agent LLM that adapts poses from a limited library of animal 3D poses to represent the desired animal. A user study conducted on the outcomes of YouDream demonstrates the preference of the animal models generated by our method over others. Turntable results and code are released at this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>AI Generated Text (AIGT) detectors are developed with texts from humans and LLMs of common tasks. Despite the diversity of plausible prompt choices, these datasets are generally constructed with a limited number of prompts. The lack of prompt variation can introduce prompt-specific shortcut features that exist in data collected with the chosen prompt, but do not generalize to others. In this paper, we analyze the impact of such shortcuts in AIGT detection. We propose Feedback-based Adversarial Instruction List Optimization (FAILOpt), an attack that searches for instructions deceptive to AIGT detectors exploiting prompt-specific shortcuts. FAILOpt effectively drops the detection performance of the target detector, comparable to other attacks based on adversarial in-context examples. We also utilize our method to enhance the robustness of the detector by mitigating the shortcuts. Based on the findings, we further train the classifier with the dataset augmented by FAILOpt prompt. The augmented classifier exhibits improvements across generation models, tasks, and attacks. Our code will be available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) have shown their potential in long-context understanding and mathematical reasoning. In this paper, we study the problem of using LLMs to detect tabular anomalies and show that pre-trained LLMs are zero-shot batch-level anomaly detectors. That is, without extra distribution-specific model fitting, they can discover hidden outliers in a batch of data, demonstrating their ability to identify low-density data regions. For LLMs that are not well aligned with anomaly detection and frequently output factual errors, we apply simple yet effective data-generating processes to simulate synthetic batch-level anomaly detection datasets and propose an end-to-end fine-tuning strategy to bring out the potential of LLMs in detecting real anomalies. Experiments on a large anomaly detection benchmark (ODDS) showcase i) GPT-4 has on-par performance with the state-of-the-art transductive learning-based anomaly detection methods and ii) the efficacy of our synthetic dataset and fine-tuning strategy in aligning LLMs to this task.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid advancement of Text-to-Image(T2I) generative models has enabled the synthesis of high-quality images guided by textual descriptions. Despite this significant progress, these models are often susceptible in generating contents that contradict the input text, which poses a challenge to their reliability and practical deployment. To address this problem, we introduce a novel diffusion-based framework to significantly enhance the alignment of generated images with their corresponding descriptions, addressing the inconsistency between visual output and textual input. Our framework is built upon a comprehensive analysis of inconsistency phenomena, categorizing them based on their manifestation in the image. Leveraging a state-of-the-art large language module, we first extract objects and construct a knowledge graph to predict the locations of these objects in potentially generated images. We then integrate a state-of-the-art controllable image generation model with a visual text generation module to generate an image that is consistent with the original prompt, guided by the predicted object locations. Through extensive experiments on an advanced multimodal hallucination benchmark, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in accurately generating the images without the inconsistency with the original prompt.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Anomaly Detection System (ADS) is an essential part of a modern gateway Electronic Control Unit (ECU) to detect abnormal behaviors and attacks in vehicles. Among the existing attacks, ``one-time`` attack is the most challenging to be detected, together with the strict gateway ECU constraints of both microsecond or even nanosecond level real-time budget and limited footprint of code. To address the challenges, we propose to use the self-information theory to generate values for training and testing models, aiming to achieve real-time detection performance for the ``one-time`` attack that has not been well studied in the past. Second, the generation of self-information is based on logarithm calculation, which leads to the smallest footprint to reduce the cost in Gateway. Finally, our proposed method uses an unsupervised model without the need of training data for anomalies or attacks. We have compared different machine learning methods ranging from typical machine learning models to deep learning models, e.g., Hidden Markov Model (HMM), Support Vector Data Description (SVDD), and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves 8.7 times lower False Positive Rate (FPR), 1.77 times faster testing time, and 4.88 times smaller footprint.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Knowledge-enhanced pre-trained language models (KEPLMs) leverage relation triples from knowledge graphs (KGs) and integrate these external data sources into language models via self-supervised learning. Previous works treat knowledge enhancement as two independent operations, i.e., knowledge injection and knowledge integration. In this paper, we propose to learn Knowledge-Enhanced language representations with Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (KEHRL), which jointly addresses the problems of detecting positions for knowledge injection and integrating external knowledge into the model in order to avoid injecting inaccurate or irrelevant knowledge. Specifically, a high-level reinforcement learning (RL) agent utilizes both internal and prior knowledge to iteratively detect essential positions in texts for knowledge injection, which filters out less meaningful entities to avoid diverting the knowledge learning direction. Once the entity positions are selected, a relevant triple filtration module is triggered to perform low-level RL to dynamically refine the triples associated with polysemic entities through binary-valued actions. Experiments validate KEHRL's effectiveness in probing factual knowledge and enhancing the model's performance on various natural language understanding tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable performance on objective multimodal perception tasks, but their ability to interpret subjective, emotionally nuanced multimodal content remains largely unexplored. Thus, it impedes their ability to effectively understand and react to the intricate emotions expressed by humans through multimodal media. To bridge this gap, we introduce EmoBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed specifically to evaluate the emotional capabilities of MLLMs across five popular emotional tasks, using a diverse dataset of 287k images and videos paired with corresponding textual instructions. Meanwhile, we propose EmoLLM, a novel model for multimodal emotional understanding, incorporating with two core techniques. 1) Multi-perspective Visual Projection, it captures diverse emotional cues from visual data from multiple perspectives. 2) EmoPrompt, it guides MLLMs to reason about emotions in the correct direction. Experimental results demonstrate that EmoLLM significantly elevates multimodal emotional understanding performance, with an average improvement of 12.1% across multiple foundation models on EmoBench. Our work contributes to the advancement of MLLMs by facilitating a deeper and more nuanced comprehension of intricate human emotions, paving the way for the development of artificial emotional intelligence capabilities with wide-ranging applications in areas such as human-computer interaction, mental health support, and empathetic AI systems.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The problem of blind image super-resolution aims to recover high-resolution (HR) images from low-resolution (LR) images with unknown degradation modes. Most existing methods model the image degradation process using blur kernels. However, this explicit modeling approach struggles to cover the complex and varied degradation processes encountered in the real world, such as high-order combinations of JPEG compression, blur, and noise. Implicit modeling for the degradation process can effectively overcome this issue, but a key challenge of implicit modeling is the lack of accurate ground truth labels for the degradation process to conduct supervised training. To overcome this limitations inherent in implicit modeling, we propose an \textbf{U}ncertainty-based degradation representation for blind \textbf{S}uper-\textbf{R}esolution framework (\textbf{USR}). By suppressing the uncertainty of local degradation representations in images, USR facilitated self-supervised learning of degradation representations. The USR consists of two components: Adaptive Uncertainty-Aware Degradation Extraction (AUDE) and a feature extraction network composed of Variable Depth Dynamic Convolution (VDDC) blocks. To extract Uncertainty-based Degradation Representation from LR images, the AUDE utilizes the Self-supervised Uncertainty Contrast module with Uncertainty Suppression Loss to suppress the inherent model uncertainty of the Degradation Extractor. Furthermore, VDDC block integrates degradation information through dynamic convolution. Rhe VDDC also employs an Adaptive Intensity Scaling operation that adaptively adjusts the degradation representation according to the network hierarchy, thereby facilitating the effective integration of degradation information. Quantitative and qualitative experiments affirm the superiority of our approach.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We show that the gradient of the cosine similarity between two points goes to zero in two under-explored settings: (1) if a point has large magnitude or (2) if the points are on opposite ends of the latent space. Counterintuitively, we prove that optimizing the cosine similarity between points forces them to grow in magnitude. Thus, (1) is unavoidable in practice. We then observe that these derivations are extremely general -- they hold across deep learning architectures and for many of the standard self-supervised learning (SSL) loss functions. This leads us to propose cut-initialization: a simple change to network initialization that helps all studied SSL methods converge faster.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models excel at producing high-quality images; however, scaling to higher resolutions, such as 4K, often results in over-smoothed content, structural distortions, and repetitive patterns. To this end, we introduce ResMaster, a novel, training-free method that empowers resolution-limited diffusion models to generate high-quality images beyond resolution restrictions. Specifically, ResMaster leverages a low-resolution reference image created by a pre-trained diffusion model to provide structural and fine-grained guidance for crafting high-resolution images on a patch-by-patch basis. To ensure a coherent global structure, ResMaster meticulously aligns the low-frequency components of high-resolution patches with the low-resolution reference at each denoising step. For fine-grained guidance, tailored image prompts based on the low-resolution reference and enriched textual prompts produced by a vision-language model are incorporated. This approach could significantly mitigate local pattern distortions and improve detail refinement. Extensive experiments validate that ResMaster sets a new benchmark for high-resolution image generation and demonstrates promising efficiency. The project page is this https URL .</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Image super-resolution pursuits reconstructing high-fidelity high-resolution counterpart for low-resolution image. In recent years, diffusion-based models have garnered significant attention due to their capabilities with rich prior knowledge. The success of diffusion models based on general text prompts has validated the effectiveness of textual control in the field of text2image. However, given the severe degradation commonly presented in low-resolution images, coupled with the randomness characteristics of diffusion models, current models struggle to adequately discern semantic and degradation information within severely degraded images. This often leads to obstacles such as semantic loss, visual artifacts, and visual hallucinations, which pose substantial challenges for practical use. To address these challenges, this paper proposes to leverage degradation-aligned language prompt for accurate, fine-grained, and high-fidelity image restoration. Complementary priors including semantic content descriptions and degradation prompts are explored. Specifically, on one hand, image-restoration prompt alignment decoder is proposed to automatically discern the degradation degree of LR images, thereby generating beneficial degradation priors for image restoration. On the other hand, much richly tailored descriptions from pretrained multimodal large language model elicit high-level semantic priors closely aligned with human perception, ensuring fidelity control for image restoration. Comprehensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods have been done on several popular synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets. The quantitative and qualitative analysis have demonstrated that the proposed method achieves a new state-of-the-art perceptual quality level, especially in real-world cases based on reference-free metrics.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The extraordinary ability of generative models emerges as a new trend in image editing and generating realistic images, posing a serious threat to the trustworthiness of multimedia data and driving the research of image manipulation detection and location(IMDL). However, the lack of a large-scale data foundation makes IMDL task unattainable. In this paper, a local manipulation pipeline is designed, incorporating the powerful SAM, ChatGPT and generative models. Upon this basis, We propose the GIM dataset, which has the following advantages: 1) Large scale, including over one million pairs of AI-manipulated images and real images. 2) Rich Image Content, encompassing a broad range of image classes 3) Diverse Generative Manipulation, manipulated images with state-of-the-art generators and various manipulation tasks. The aforementioned advantages allow for a more comprehensive evaluation of IMDL methods, extending their applicability to diverse images. We introduce two benchmark settings to evaluate the generalization capability and comprehensive performance of baseline methods. In addition, we propose a novel IMDL framework, termed GIMFormer, which consists of a ShadowTracer, Frequency-Spatial Block (FSB), and a Multi-window Anomalous Modelling (MWAM) Module. Extensive experiments on the GIM demonstrate that GIMFormer surpasses previous state-of-the-art works significantly on two different benchmarks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In-Context Learning (ICL) typically utilizes classification criteria from probabilities of manually selected label tokens. However, we argue that such token-based classification criteria lead to suboptimal decision boundaries, despite delicate calibrations through translation and constrained rotation. To address this problem, we propose Hidden Calibration, which renounces token probabilities and uses the nearest centroid classifier on the LM's last hidden states. In detail, we use the nearest centroid classification on the hidden states, assigning the category of the nearest centroid previously observed from a few-shot calibration set to the test sample as the predicted label. Our experiments on 3 models and 10 classification datasets indicate that Hidden Calibration consistently outperforms current token-based calibrations by about 20%. Our further analysis demonstrates that Hidden Calibration finds better classification criteria with less inter-categories overlap, and LMs provide linearly separable intra-category clusters with the help of demonstrations, which supports Hidden Calibration and gives new insights into the conventional ICL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The recent advancements in text-to-image generative models have been remarkable. Yet, the field suffers from a lack of evaluation metrics that accurately reflect the performance of these models, particularly lacking fine-grained metrics that can guide the optimization of the models. In this paper, we propose EvalAlign, a metric characterized by its accuracy, stability, and fine granularity. Our approach leverages the capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) pre-trained on extensive datasets. We develop evaluation protocols that focus on two key dimensions: image faithfulness and text-image alignment. Each protocol comprises a set of detailed, fine-grained instructions linked to specific scoring options, enabling precise manual scoring of the generated images. We Supervised Fine-Tune (SFT) the MLLM to align closely with human evaluative judgments, resulting in a robust evaluation model. Our comprehensive tests across 24 text-to-image generation models demonstrate that EvalAlign not only provides superior metric stability but also aligns more closely with human preferences than existing metrics, confirming its effectiveness and utility in model assessment.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Face recognition and verification are two computer vision tasks whose performance has progressed with the introduction of deep representations. However, ethical, legal, and technical challenges due to the sensitive character of face data and biases in real training datasets hinder their development. Generative AI addresses privacy by creating fictitious identities, but fairness problems persist. We promote fairness by introducing a demographic attributes balancing mechanism in generated training datasets. We experiment with an existing real dataset, three generated training datasets, and the balanced versions of a diffusion-based dataset. We propose a comprehensive evaluation that considers accuracy and fairness equally and includes a rigorous regression-based statistical analysis of attributes. The analysis shows that balancing reduces demographic unfairness. Also, a performance gap persists despite generation becoming more accurate with time. The proposed balancing method and comprehensive verification evaluation promote fairer and transparent face recognition and verification.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Score distillation sampling has been pivotal for integrating diffusion models into generation of complex visuals. Despite impressive results it suffers from mode collapse and lack of diversity. To cope with this challenge, we leverage the gradient flow interpretation of score distillation to propose Repulsive Score Distillation (RSD). In particular, we propose a variational framework based on repulsion of an ensemble of particles that promotes diversity. Using a variational approximation that incorporates a coupling among particles, the repulsion appears as a simple regularization that allows interaction of particles based on their relative pairwise similarity, measured e.g., via radial basis kernels. We design RSD for both unconstrained and constrained sampling scenarios. For constrained sampling we focus on inverse problems in the latent space that leads to an augmented variational formulation, that strikes a good balance between compute, quality and diversity. Our extensive experiments for text-to-image generation, and inverse problems demonstrate that RSD achieves a superior trade-off between diversity and quality compared with state-of-the-art alternatives.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Score distillation sampling (SDS), the methodology in which the score from pretrained 2D diffusion models is distilled into 3D representation, has recently brought significant advancements in text-to-3D generation task. However, this approach is still confronted with critical geometric inconsistency problems such as the Janus problem. Starting from a hypothesis that such inconsistency problems may be induced by multiview inconsistencies between 2D scores predicted from various viewpoints, we introduce GSD, a simple and general plug-and-play framework for incorporating 3D consistency and therefore geometry awareness into the SDS process. Our methodology is composed of three components: 3D consistent noising, designed to produce 3D consistent noise maps that perfectly follow the standard Gaussian distribution, geometry-based gradient warping for identifying correspondences between predicted gradients of different viewpoints, and novel gradient consistency loss to optimize the scene geometry toward producing more consistent gradients. We demonstrate that our method significantly improves performance, successfully addressing the geometric inconsistency problems in text-to-3D generation task with minimal computation cost and being compatible with existing score distillation-based models.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While recent works have achieved great success on one-shot 3D common object generation, high quality and fidelity 3D head generation from a single image remains a great challenge. Previous text-based methods for generating 3D heads were limited by text descriptions and image-based methods struggled to produce high-quality head geometry. To handle this challenging problem, we propose a novel framework, Portrait3D, to generate high-quality 3D heads while preserving their identities. Our work incorporates the identity information of the portrait image into three parts: 1) geometry initialization, 2) geometry sculpting, and 3) texture generation stages. Given a reference portrait image, we first align the identity features with text features to realize ID-aware guidance enhancement, which contains the control signals representing the face information. We then use the canny map, ID features of the portrait image, and a pre-trained text-to-normal/depth diffusion model to generate ID-aware geometry supervision, and 3D-GAN inversion is employed to generate ID-aware geometry initialization. Furthermore, with the ability to inject identity information into 3D head generation, we use ID-aware guidance to calculate ID-aware Score Distillation (ISD) for geometry sculpting. For texture generation, we adopt the ID Consistent Texture Inpainting and Refinement which progressively expands the view for texture inpainting to obtain an initialization UV texture map. We then use the id-aware guidance to provide image-level supervision for noisy multi-view images to obtain a refined texture map. Extensive experiments demonstrate that we can generate high-quality 3D heads with accurate geometry and texture from single in-the-wild portrait images. The project page is at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Foundation model development attracts a rapidly expanding body of contributors, scientists, and applications. To help shape responsible development practices, we introduce the Foundation Model Development Cheatsheet: a growing collection of 250+ tools and resources spanning text, vision, and speech modalities. We draw on a large body of prior work to survey resources (e.g. software, documentation, frameworks, guides, and practical tools) that support informed data selection, processing, and understanding, precise and limitation-aware artifact documentation, efficient model training, advance awareness of the environmental impact from training, careful model evaluation of capabilities, risks, and claims, as well as responsible model release, licensing and deployment practices. We hope this curated collection of resources helps guide more responsible development. The process of curating this list, enabled us to review the AI development ecosystem, revealing what tools are critically missing, misused, or over-used in existing practices. We find that (i) tools for data sourcing, model evaluation, and monitoring are critically under-serving ethical and real-world needs, (ii) evaluations for model safety, capabilities, and environmental impact all lack reproducibility and transparency, (iii) text and particularly English-centric analyses continue to dominate over multilingual and multi-modal analyses, and (iv) evaluation of systems, rather than just models, is needed so that capabilities and impact are assessed in context.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>A central aim in computational neuroscience is to relate the activity of large populations of neurons to an underlying dynamical system. Models of these neural dynamics should ideally be both interpretable and fit the observed data well. Low-rank recurrent neural networks (RNNs) exhibit such interpretability by having tractable dynamics. However, it is unclear how to best fit low-rank RNNs to data consisting of noisy observations of an underlying stochastic system. Here, we propose to fit stochastic low-rank RNNs with variational sequential Monte Carlo methods. We validate our method on several datasets consisting of both continuous and spiking neural data, where we obtain lower dimensional latent dynamics than current state of the art methods. Additionally, for low-rank models with piecewise linear nonlinearities, we show how to efficiently identify all fixed points in polynomial rather than exponential cost in the number of units, making analysis of the inferred dynamics tractable for large RNNs. Our method both elucidates the dynamical systems underlying experimental recordings and provides a generative model whose trajectories match observed trial-to-trial variability.</li>

It is therefore important to quantitatively understand the nature of generated stories, and how they differ from human storytelling. We augment the Reddit WritingPrompts dataset with short stories generated by GPT-3.5, given the same prompts. We quantify and compare the emotional and descriptive features of storytelling from both generative processes, human and machine, along a set of six dimensions. We find that generated stories differ significantly from human stories along all six dimensions, and that human and machine generations display similar biases when grouped according to the narrative point-of-view and gender of the main protagonist.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The path to interpreting a language model often proceeds via analysis of circuits -- sparse computational subgraphs of the model that capture specific aspects of its behavior. Recent work has automated the task of discovering circuits. Yet, these methods have practical limitations, as they rely either on inefficient search algorithms or inaccurate approximations. In this paper, we frame automated circuit discovery as an optimization problem and propose *Edge Pruning* as an effective and scalable solution. Edge Pruning leverages gradient-based pruning techniques, but instead of removing neurons or components, it prunes the \emph{edges} between components. Our method finds circuits in GPT-2 that use less than half the number of edges compared to circuits found by previous methods while being equally faithful to the full model predictions on standard circuit-finding tasks. Edge Pruning is efficient even with as many as 100K examples, outperforming previous methods in speed and producing substantially better circuits. It also perfectly recovers the ground-truth circuits in two models compiled with Tracr. Thanks to its efficiency, we scale Edge Pruning to CodeLlama-13B, a model over 100x the scale that prior methods operate on. We use this setting for a case study comparing the mechanisms behind instruction prompting and in-context learning. We find two circuits with more than 99.96% sparsity that match the performance of the full model and reveal that the mechanisms in the two settings overlap substantially. Our case study shows that Edge Pruning is a practical and scalable tool for interpretability and sheds light on behaviors that only emerge in large models.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we introduce a novel image encryption and decryption algorithm using hyperchaotic signals from the novel 3D hyperchaotic map, 2D memristor map, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and key sensitivity analysis to achieve robust security and high efficiency. The encryption starts with the scrambling of gray images by using a 3D hyperchaotic map to yield complex sequences under disruption of pixel values; the robustness of this original encryption is further reinforced by employing a CNN to learn the intricate patterns and add the safety layer. The robustness of the encryption algorithm is shown by key sensitivity analysis, i.e., the average sensitivity of the algorithm to key elements. The other factors and systems of unauthorized decryption, even with slight variations in the keys, can alter the decryption procedure, resulting in the ineffective recreation of the decrypted image. Statistical analysis includes entropy analysis, correlation analysis, histogram analysis, and other security analyses like anomaly detection, all of which confirm the high security and effectiveness of the proposed encryption method. Testing of the algorithm under various noisy conditions is carried out to test robustness against Gaussian noise. Metrics for differential analysis, such as the NPCR (Number of Pixel Change Rate)and UACI (Unified Average Change Intensity), are also used to determine the strength of encryption. At the same time, the empirical validation was performed on several test images, which showed that the proposed encryption techniques have practical applicability and are robust to noise. Simulation results and comparative analyses illustrate that our encryption scheme possesses excellent visual security, decryption quality, and computational efficiency, and thus, it is efficient for secure image transmission and storage in big data applications.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>High-fidelity 3D garment synthesis from text is desirable yet challenging for digital avatar creation. Recent diffusion-based approaches via Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) have enabled new possibilities but either intricately couple with human body or struggle to reuse. We introduce ClotheDreamer, a 3D Gaussian-based method for generating wearable, production-ready 3D garment assets from text prompts. We propose a novel representation Disentangled Clothe Gaussian Splatting (DCGS) to enable separate optimization. DCGS represents clothed avatar as one Gaussian model but freezes body Gaussian splats. To enhance quality and completeness, we incorporate bidirectional SDS to supervise clothed avatar and garment RGBD renderings respectively with pose conditions and propose a new pruning strategy for loose clothing. Our approach can also support custom clothing templates as input. Benefiting from our design, the synthetic 3D garment can be easily applied to virtual try-on and support physically accurate animation. Extensive experiments showcase our method's superior and competitive performance. Our project page is at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Structure-Based Drug Design (SBDD) focuses on generating valid ligands that strongly and specifically bind to a designated protein pocket. Several methods use machine learning for SBDD to generate these ligands in 3D space, conditioned on the structure of a desired protein pocket. Recently, diffusion models have shown success here by modeling the underlying distributions of atomic positions and types. While these methods are effective in considering the structural details of the protein pocket, they often fail to explicitly consider the binding affinity. Binding affinity characterizes how tightly the ligand binds to the protein pocket, and is measured by the change in free energy associated with the binding process. It is one of the most crucial metrics for benchmarking the effectiveness of the interaction between a ligand and protein pocket. To address this, we propose BADGER: Binding Affinity Diffusion Guidance with Enhanced Refinement. BADGER is a general guidance method to steer the diffusion sampling process towards improved protein-ligand binding, allowing us to adjust the distribution of the binding affinity between ligands and proteins. Our method is enabled by using a neural network (NN) to model the energy function, which is commonly approximated by AutoDock Vina (ADV). ADV's energy function is non-differentiable, and estimates the affinity based on the interactions between a ligand and target protein receptor. By using a NN as a differentiable energy function proxy, we utilize the gradient of our learned energy function as a guidance method on top of any trained diffusion model. We show that our method improves the binding affinity of generated ligands to their protein receptors by up to 60\%, significantly surpassing previous machine learning methods. We also show that our guidance method is flexible and can be easily applied to other diffusion-based SBDD frameworks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Personalized image generation holds great promise in assisting humans in everyday work and life due to its impressive function in creatively generating personalized content. However, current evaluations either are automated but misalign with humans or require human evaluations that are time-consuming and expensive. In this work, we present DreamBench++, a human-aligned benchmark automated by advanced multimodal GPT models. Specifically, we systematically design the prompts to let GPT be both human-aligned and self-aligned, empowered with task reinforcement. Further, we construct a comprehensive dataset comprising diverse images and prompts. By benchmarking 7 modern generative models, we demonstrate that DreamBench++ results in significantly more human-aligned evaluation, helping boost the community with innovative findings.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce Cambrian-1, a family of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) designed with a vision-centric approach. While stronger language models can enhance multimodal capabilities, the design choices for vision components are often insufficiently explored and disconnected from visual representation learning research. This gap hinders accurate sensory grounding in real-world scenarios. Our study uses LLMs and visual instruction tuning as an interface to evaluate various visual representations, offering new insights into different models and architectures -- self-supervised, strongly supervised, or combinations thereof -- based on experiments with over 20 vision encoders. We critically examine existing MLLM benchmarks, addressing the difficulties involved in consolidating and interpreting results from various tasks, and introduce a new vision-centric benchmark, CV-Bench. To further improve visual grounding, we propose the Spatial Vision Aggregator (SVA), a dynamic and spatially-aware connector that integrates high-resolution vision features with LLMs while reducing the number of tokens. Additionally, we discuss the curation of high-quality visual instruction-tuning data from publicly available sources, emphasizing the importance of data source balancing and distribution ratio. Collectively, Cambrian-1 not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also serves as a comprehensive, open cookbook for instruction-tuned MLLMs. We provide model weights, code, supporting tools, datasets, and detailed instruction-tuning and evaluation recipes. We hope our release will inspire and accelerate advancements in multimodal systems and visual representation learning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion model has demonstrated remarkable capability in video generation, which further sparks interest in introducing trajectory control into the generation process. While existing works mainly focus on training-based methods (e.g., conditional adapter), we argue that diffusion model itself allows decent control over the generated content without requiring any training. In this study, we introduce a tuning-free framework to achieve trajectory-controllable video generation, by imposing guidance on both noise construction and attention computation. Specifically, 1) we first show several instructive phenomenons and analyze how initial noises influence the motion trajectory of generated content. 2) Subsequently, we propose FreeTraj, a tuning-free approach that enables trajectory control by modifying noise sampling and attention mechanisms. 3) Furthermore, we extend FreeTraj to facilitate longer and larger video generation with controllable trajectories. Equipped with these designs, users have the flexibility to provide trajectories manually or opt for trajectories automatically generated by the LLM trajectory planner. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of our approach in enhancing the trajectory controllability of video diffusion models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This work addresses the challenge of high-quality surface normal estimation from monocular colored inputs (i.e., images and videos), a field which has recently been revolutionized by repurposing diffusion priors. However, previous attempts still struggle with stochastic inference, conflicting with the deterministic nature of the Image2Normal task, and costly ensembling step, which slows down the estimation process. Our method, StableNormal, mitigates the stochasticity of the diffusion process by reducing inference variance, thus producing "Stable-and-Sharp" normal estimates without any additional ensembling process. StableNormal works robustly under challenging imaging conditions, such as extreme lighting, blurring, and low quality. It is also robust against transparent and reflective surfaces, as well as cluttered scenes with numerous objects. Specifically, StableNormal employs a coarse-to-fine strategy, which starts with a one-step normal estimator (YOSO) to derive an initial normal guess, that is relatively coarse but reliable, then followed by a semantic-guided refinement process (SG-DRN) that refines the normals to recover geometric details. The effectiveness of StableNormal is demonstrated through competitive performance in standard datasets such as DIODE-indoor, iBims, ScannetV2 and NYUv2, and also in various downstream tasks, such as surface reconstruction and normal enhancement. These results evidence that StableNormal retains both the "stability" and "sharpness" for accurate normal estimation. StableNormal represents a baby attempt to repurpose diffusion priors for deterministic estimation. To democratize this, code and models have been publicly available in this http URL</li>
