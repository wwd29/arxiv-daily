<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Ubiquitous mobile devices are generating vast amounts of location-based service data that reveal how individuals navigate and utilize urban spaces in detail. In this study, we utilize these extensive, unlabeled sequences of user trajectories to develop a foundation model for understanding urban space and human mobility. We introduce the \textbf{P}retrained \textbf{M}obility \textbf{T}ransformer (PMT), which leverages the transformer architecture to process user trajectories in an autoregressive manner, converting geographical areas into tokens and embedding spatial and temporal information within these representations. Experiments conducted in three U.S. metropolitan areas over a two-month period demonstrate PMT's ability to capture underlying geographic and socio-demographic characteristics of regions. The proposed PMT excels across various downstream tasks, including next-location prediction, trajectory imputation, and trajectory generation. These results support PMT's capability and effectiveness in decoding complex patterns of human mobility, offering new insights into urban spatial functionality and individual mobility preferences.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Adapting to the changing climate requires accurate local climate information, a computationally challenging problem. Recent studies have used Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), a type of deep learning, to learn complex distributions and downscale climate variables efficiently. Capturing variability while downscaling is crucial for estimating uncertainty and characterising extreme events - critical information for climate adaptation. Since downscaling is an undetermined problem, many fine-scale states are physically consistent with the coarse-resolution state. To quantify this ill-posed problem, downscaling techniques should be stochastic, able to sample realisations from a high-resolution distribution conditioned on low-resolution input. Previous stochastic downscaling attempts have found substantial underdispersion, with models failing to represent the full distribution. We propose approaches to improve the stochastic calibration of GANs in three ways: a) injecting noise inside the network, b) adjusting the training process to explicitly account for the stochasticity, and c) using a probabilistic loss metric. We tested our models first on a synthetic dataset with known distributional properties, and then on a realistic downscaling scenario, predicting high-resolution wind components from low-resolution climate covariates. Injecting noise, on its own, substantially improved the quality of conditional and full distributions in tests with synthetic data, but performed less well for wind field downscaling, where models remained underdispersed. For wind downscaling, we found that adjusting the training method and including the probabilistic loss improved calibration. The best model, with all three changes, showed much improved skill at capturing the full variability of the high-resolution distribution and thus at characterising extremes.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The performance of Large Language Models has achieved superhuman breadth with unprecedented depth. At the same time, the language models are mostly black box models and the underlying mechanisms for performance have been evaluated using synthetic or mechanistic schemes. We extend current mechanistic schemes to incorporate Logic, memory, and nuances of Language such as latent structure. The proposed framework is called LOLAMEME and we provide two instantiations of LOLAMEME: LoLa and MeMe languages. We then consider two generative language model architectures: transformer-based GPT-2 and convolution-based Hyena. We propose the hybrid architecture T HEX and use LOLAMEME framework is used to compare three architectures. T HEX outperforms GPT-2 and Hyena on select tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Pathfinding problems are found throughout robotics, computational science, and natural sciences. Traditional methods to solve these require training deep neural networks (DNNs) for each new problem domain, consuming substantial time and resources. This study introduces a novel foundation model, leveraging deep reinforcement learning to train heuristic functions that seamlessly adapt to new domains without further fine-tuning. Building upon DeepCubeA, we enhance the model by providing the heuristic function with the domain's state transition information, improving its adaptability. Utilizing a puzzle generator for the 15-puzzle action space variation domains, we demonstrate our model's ability to generalize and solve unseen domains. We achieve a strong correlation between learned and ground truth heuristic values across various domains, as evidenced by robust R-squared and Concordance Correlation Coefficient metrics. These results underscore the potential of foundation models to establish new standards in efficiency and adaptability for AI-driven solutions in complex pathfinding problems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large-scale multi-modal deep learning models have revolutionized domains such as healthcare, highlighting the importance of computational power. However, in resource-constrained regions like Low and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs), limited access to GPUs and data poses significant challenges, often leaving CPUs as the sole resource. To address this, we advocate for leveraging vector embeddings to enable flexible and efficient computational methodologies, democratizing multimodal deep learning across diverse contexts. Our paper investigates the efficiency and effectiveness of using vector embeddings from single-modal foundation models and multi-modal Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for multimodal deep learning in low-resource environments, particularly in healthcare. Additionally, we propose a simple yet effective inference-time method to enhance performance by aligning image-text embeddings. Comparing these approaches with traditional methods, we assess their impact on computational efficiency and model performance using metrics like accuracy, F1-score, inference time, training time, and memory usage across three medical modalities: BRSET (ophthalmology), HAM10000 (dermatology), and SatelliteBench (public health). Our findings show that embeddings reduce computational demands without compromising model performance. Furthermore, our alignment method improves performance in medical tasks. This research promotes sustainable AI practices by optimizing resources in constrained environments, highlighting the potential of embedding-based approaches for efficient multimodal learning. Vector embeddings democratize multimodal deep learning in LMICs, particularly in healthcare, enhancing AI adaptability in varied use cases.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The field of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) relies on accurate traffic forecasting to enable various downstream applications. However, developing cities often face challenges in collecting sufficient training traffic data due to limited resources and outdated infrastructure. Recognizing this obstacle, the concept of cross-city few-shot forecasting has emerged as a viable approach. While previous cross-city few-shot forecasting methods ignore the frequency similarity between cities, we have made an observation that the traffic data is more similar in the frequency domain between cities. Based on this fact, we propose a \textbf{F}requency \textbf{E}nhanced \textbf{P}re-training Framework for \textbf{Cross}-city Few-shot Forecasting (\textbf{FEPCross}). FEPCross has a pre-training stage and a fine-tuning stage. In the pre-training stage, we propose a novel Cross-Domain Spatial-Temporal Encoder that incorporates the information of the time and frequency domain and trains it with self-supervised tasks encompassing reconstruction and contrastive objectives. In the fine-tuning stage, we design modules to enrich training samples and maintain a momentum-updated graph structure, thereby mitigating the risk of overfitting to the few-shot training data. Empirical evaluations performed on real-world traffic datasets validate the exceptional efficacy of FEPCross, outperforming existing approaches of diverse categories and demonstrating characteristics that foster the progress of cross-city few-shot forecasting.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The Internet of Things (IoT) has been introduced as a breakthrough technology that integrates intelligence into everyday objects, enabling high levels of connectivity between them. As the IoT networks grow and expand, they become more susceptible to cybersecurity attacks. A significant challenge in current intrusion detection systems for IoT includes handling imbalanced datasets where labeled data are scarce, particularly for new and rare types of cyber attacks. Existing literature often fails to detect such underrepresented attack classes. This paper introduces a novel intrusion detection approach designed to address these challenges. By integrating Self Supervised Learning (SSL), Few Shot Learning (FSL), and Random Forest (RF), our approach excels in learning from limited and imbalanced data and enhancing detection capabilities. The approach starts with a Deep Infomax model trained to extract key features from the dataset. These features are then fed into a prototypical network to generate discriminate embedding. Subsequently, an RF classifier is employed to detect and classify potential malware, including a range of attacks that are frequently observed in IoT networks. The proposed approach was evaluated through two different datasets, MaleVis and WSN-DS, which demonstrate its superior performance with accuracies of 98.60% and 99.56%, precisions of 98.79% and 99.56%, recalls of 98.60% and 99.56%, and F1-scores of 98.63% and 99.56%, respectively.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In-context learning (ICL) achieves remarkable performance in various domains such as knowledge acquisition, commonsense reasoning, and semantic understanding. However, its performance significantly deteriorates for emotion detection tasks, especially fine-grained emotion recognition. The underlying reasons for this remain unclear. In this paper, we identify the reasons behind ICL's poor performance from the perspective of prototype theory and propose a method to address this issue. Specifically, we conduct extensive pilot experiments and find that ICL conforms to the prototype theory on fine-grained emotion recognition. Based on this theory, we uncover the following deficiencies in ICL: (1) It relies on prototypes (example-label pairs) that are semantically similar but emotionally inaccurate to predict emotions. (2) It is prone to interference from irrelevant categories, affecting the accuracy and robustness of the predictions. To address these issues, we propose an Emotion Context Learning method (E-ICL) on fine-grained emotion recognition. E-ICL relies on more emotionally accurate prototypes to predict categories by referring to emotionally similar examples with dynamic labels. Simultaneously, E-ICL employs an exclusionary emotion prediction strategy to avoid interference from irrelevant categories, thereby increasing its accuracy and robustness. Note that the entire process is accomplished with the assistance of a plug-and-play emotion auxiliary model, without additional training. Experiments on the fine-grained emotion datasets EDOS, Empathetic-Dialogues, EmpatheticIntent, and GoEmotions show that E-ICL achieves superior emotion prediction performance. Furthermore, even when the emotion auxiliary model used is lower than 10% of the LLMs, E-ICL can still boost the performance of LLMs by over 4% on multiple datasets.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Learning representations for reinforcement learning (RL) has shown much promise for continuous control. We propose an efficient representation learning method using only a self-supervised latent-state consistency loss. Our approach employs an encoder and a dynamics model to map observations to latent states and predict future latent states, respectively. We achieve high performance and prevent representation collapse by quantizing the latent representation such that the rank of the representation is empirically preserved. Our method, named iQRL: implicitly Quantized Reinforcement Learning, is straightforward, compatible with any model-free RL algorithm, and demonstrates excellent performance by outperforming other recently proposed representation learning methods in continuous control benchmarks from DeepMind Control Suite.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We investigate the construction of latent spaces through self-supervised learning to support semantically meaningful operations. Analogous to operational amplifiers, these "operational latent spaces" (OpLaS) not only demonstrate semantic structure such as clustering but also support common transformational operations with inherent semantic meaning. Some operational latent spaces are found to have arisen "unintentionally" in the progress toward some (other) self-supervised learning objective, in which unintended but still useful properties are discovered among the relationships of points in the space. Other spaces may be constructed "intentionally" by developers stipulating certain kinds of clustering or transformations intended to produce the desired structure. We focus on the intentional creation of operational latent spaces via self-supervised learning, including the introduction of rotation operators via a novel "FiLMR" layer, which can be used to enable ring-like symmetries found in some musical constructions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we propose a textless acoustic model with a self-supervised distillation strategy for noise-robust expressive speech-to-speech translation (S2ST). Recently proposed expressive S2ST systems have achieved impressive expressivity preservation performances by cascading unit-to-speech (U2S) generator to the speech-to-unit translation model. However, these systems are vulnerable to the presence of noise in input speech, which is an assumption in real-world translation scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a U2S generator that incorporates a distillation with no label (DINO) self-supervised training strategy into it's pretraining process. Because the proposed method captures noise-agnostic expressivity representation, it can generate qualified speech even in noisy environment. Objective and subjective evaluation results verified that the proposed method significantly improved the performance of the expressive S2ST system in noisy environments while maintaining competitive performance in clean environments.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Training gaze following models requires a large number of images with gaze target coordinates annotated by human annotators, which is a laborious and inherently ambiguous process. We propose the first semi-supervised method for gaze following by introducing two novel priors to the task. We obtain the first prior using a large pretrained Visual Question Answering (VQA) model, where we compute Grad-CAM heatmaps by `prompting' the VQA model with a gaze following question. These heatmaps can be noisy and not suited for use in training. The need to refine these noisy annotations leads us to incorporate a second prior. We utilize a diffusion model trained on limited human annotations and modify the reverse sampling process to refine the Grad-CAM heatmaps. By tuning the diffusion process we achieve a trade-off between the human annotation prior and the VQA heatmap prior, which retains the useful VQA prior information while exhibiting similar properties to the training data distribution. Our method outperforms simple pseudo-annotation generation baselines on the GazeFollow image dataset. More importantly, our pseudo-annotation strategy, applied to a widely used supervised gaze following model (VAT), reduces the annotation need by 50%. Our method also performs the best on the VideoAttentionTarget dataset.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The demand for condition-based and predictive maintenance is rising across industries, especially for remote, high-value, and high-risk assets. In this article, the diagnostic digital twin concept is introduced, discussed, and implemented for a floating offshore turbine. A diagnostic digital twin is a virtual representation of an asset that combines real-time data and models to monitor damage, detect anomalies, and diagnose failures, thereby enabling condition-based and predictive maintenance. By applying diagnostic digital twins to offshore assets, unexpected failures can be alleviated, but the implementation can prove challenging. Here, a diagnostic digital twin is implemented for an operational floating offshore wind turbine. The asset is monitored through measurements. Unsupervised learning methods are employed to build a normal operation model, detect anomalies, and provide a fault diagnosis. Warnings and diagnoses are sent through text messages, and a more detailed diagnosis can be accessed in a virtual reality interface. The diagnostic digital twin successfully detected an anomaly with high confidence hours before a failure occurred. The paper concludes by discussing diagnostic digital twins in the broader context of offshore engineering. The presented approach can be generalized to other offshore assets to improve maintenance and increase the lifetime, efficiency, and sustainability of offshore assets.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text-to-image diffusion models have recently taken center stage as pivotal tools in promoting visual creativity across an array of domains such as comic book artistry, children's literature, game development, and web design. These models harness the power of artificial intelligence to convert textual descriptions into vivid images, thereby enabling artists and creators to bring their imaginative concepts to life with unprecedented ease. However, one of the significant hurdles that persist is the challenge of maintaining consistency in character generation across diverse contexts. Variations in textual prompts, even if minor, can yield vastly different visual outputs, posing a considerable problem in projects that require a uniform representation of characters throughout. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework designed to produce consistent character representations from a single text prompt across diverse settings. Through both quantitative and qualitative analyses, we demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing methods in generating characters with consistent visual identities, underscoring its potential to transform creative industries. By addressing the critical challenge of character consistency, we not only enhance the practical utility of these models but also broaden the horizons for artistic and creative expression.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Summarizing medical conversations poses unique challenges due to the specialized domain and the difficulty of collecting in-domain training data. In this study, we investigate the performance of state-of-the-art doctor-patient conversation generative summarization models on the out-of-domain data. We divide the summarization model of doctor-patient conversation into two configurations: (1) a general model, without specifying subjective (S), objective (O), and assessment (A) and plan (P) notes; (2) a SOAP-oriented model that generates a summary with SOAP sections. We analyzed the limitations and strengths of the fine-tuning language model-based methods and GPTs on both configurations. We also conducted a Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count analysis to compare the SOAP notes from different datasets. The results exhibit a strong correlation for reference notes across different datasets, indicating that format mismatch (i.e., discrepancies in word distribution) is not the main cause of performance decline on out-of-domain data. Lastly, a detailed analysis of SOAP notes is included to provide insights into missing information and hallucinations introduced by the models.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent innovations in diffusion probabilistic models have paved the way for significant progress in image, text and audio generation, leading to their applications in generative time series forecasting. However, leveraging such abilities to model highly stochastic time series data remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel Stochastic Diffusion (StochDiff) model which learns data-driven prior knowledge at each time step by utilizing the representational power of the stochastic latent spaces to model the variability of the multivariate time series data. The learnt prior knowledge helps the model to capture complex temporal dynamics and the inherent uncertainty of the data. This improves its ability to model highly stochastic time series data. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model on stochastic time series forecasting. Additionally, we showcase an application of our model for real-world surgical guidance, highlighting its potential to benefit the medical community.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As artificial neural networks grow in complexity, understanding their inner workings becomes increasingly challenging, which is particularly important in healthcare applications. The intrinsic evaluation metrics of autoregressive neural language models (NLMs), perplexity (PPL), can reflect how "surprised" an NLM model is at novel input. PPL has been widely used to understand the behavior of NLMs. Previous findings show that changes in PPL when masking attention layers in pre-trained transformer-based NLMs reflect linguistic anomalies associated with Alzheimer's disease dementia. Building upon this, we explore a novel bidirectional attention head ablation method that exhibits properties attributed to the concepts of cognitive and brain reserve in human brain studies, which postulate that people with more neurons in the brain and more efficient processing are more resilient to neurodegeneration. Our results show that larger GPT-2 models require a disproportionately larger share of attention heads to be masked/ablated to display degradation of similar magnitude to masking in smaller models. These results suggest that the attention mechanism in transformer models may present an analogue to the notions of cognitive and brain reserve and could potentially be used to model certain aspects of the progression of neurodegenerative disorders and aging.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Video anomaly detection aims to develop automated models capable of identifying abnormal events in surveillance videos. The benchmark setup for this task is extremely challenging due to: i) the limited size of the training sets, ii) weak supervision provided in terms of video-level labels, and iii) intrinsic class imbalance induced by the scarcity of abnormal events. In this work, we show that distilling knowledge from aggregated representations of multiple backbones into a relatively simple model achieves state-of-the-art performance. In particular, we develop a bi-level distillation approach along with a novel disentangled cross-attention-based feature aggregation network. Our proposed approach, DAKD (Distilling Aggregated Knowledge with Disentangled Attention), demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods across multiple benchmark datasets. Notably, we achieve significant improvements of 1.36%, 0.78%, and 7.02% on the UCF-Crime, ShanghaiTech, and XD-Violence datasets, respectively.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose Conditional Idempotent Generative Networks (CIGN), a novel approach that expands upon Idempotent Generative Networks (IGN) to enable conditional generation. While IGNs offer efficient single-pass generation, they lack the ability to control the content of the generated data. CIGNs address this limitation by incorporating conditioning mechanisms, allowing users to steer the generation process towards specific types of data. We establish the theoretical foundations for CIGNs, outlining their scope, loss function design, and evaluation metrics. We then present two potential architectures for implementing CIGNs: channel conditioning and filter conditioning. Finally, we discuss experimental results on the MNIST dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of both approaches. Our findings pave the way for further exploration of CIGNs on larger datasets and with more powerful computing resources to determine the optimal implementation strategy.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Foundation models have emerged as powerful tools across various domains including language, vision, and multimodal tasks. While prior works have addressed unsupervised image segmentation, they significantly lag behind supervised models. In this paper, we use a diffusion UNet encoder as a foundation vision encoder and introduce DiffCut, an unsupervised zero-shot segmentation method that solely harnesses the output features from the final self-attention block. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that the utilization of these diffusion features in a graph based segmentation algorithm, significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on zero-shot segmentation. Specifically, we leverage a recursive Normalized Cut algorithm that softly regulates the granularity of detected objects and produces well-defined segmentation maps that precisely capture intricate image details. Our work highlights the remarkably accurate semantic knowledge embedded within diffusion UNet encoders that could then serve as foundation vision encoders for downstream tasks.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In-Context Learning (ICL) has been a powerful emergent property of large language models that has attracted increasing attention in recent years. In contrast to regular gradient-based learning, ICL is highly interpretable and does not require parameter updates. In this paper, we show that, for linearized transformer networks, ICL can be made explicit and permanent through the inclusion of bias terms. We mathematically demonstrate the equivalence between a model with ICL demonstration prompts and the same model with the additional bias terms. Our algorithm (ICLCA) allows for exact conversion in an inexpensive manner. Existing methods are not exact and require expensive parameter updates. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through experiments that show the exact incorporation of ICL tokens into a linear transformer. We further suggest how our method can be adapted to achieve cheap approximate conversion of ICL tokens, even in regular transformer networks that are not linearized. Our experiments on GPT-2 show that, even though the conversion is only approximate, the model still gains valuable context from the included bias terms.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Reservoir computing, a machine learning framework used for modeling the brain, can predict temporal data with little observations and minimal computational resources. However, it is difficult to accurately reproduce the long-term target time series because the reservoir system becomes unstable. This predictive capability is required for a wide variety of time-series processing, including predictions of motor timing and chaotic dynamical systems. This study proposes oscillation-driven reservoir computing (ODRC) with feedback, where oscillatory signals are fed into a reservoir network to stabilize the network activity and induce complex reservoir dynamics. The ODRC can reproduce long-term target time series more accurately than conventional reservoir computing methods in a motor timing and chaotic time-series prediction tasks. Furthermore, it generates a time series similar to the target in the unexperienced period, that is, it can learn the abstract generative rules from limited observations. Given these significant improvements made by the simple and computationally inexpensive implementation, the ODRC would serve as a practical model of various time series data. Moreover, we will discuss biological implications of the ODRC, considering it as a model of neural oscillations and their cerebellar processors.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The remarkable advancement in text-to-image generation models significantly boosts the research in ID customization generation. However, existing personalization methods cannot simultaneously satisfy high fidelity and high-efficiency requirements. Their main bottleneck lies in the prompt image encoder, which produces weak alignment signals with the text-to-image model and significantly increased model size. Towards this end, we propose a lightweight Inv-Adapter, which first extracts diffusion-domain representations of ID images utilizing a pre-trained text-to-image model via DDIM image inversion, without additional image encoder. Benefiting from the high alignment of the extracted ID prompt features and the intermediate features of the text-to-image model, we then embed them efficiently into the base text-to-image model by carefully designing a lightweight attention adapter. We conduct extensive experiments to assess ID fidelity, generation loyalty, speed, and training parameters, all of which show that the proposed Inv-Adapter is highly competitive in ID customization generation and model scale.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Dataset bias is a significant problem in training fair classifiers. When attributes unrelated to classification exhibit strong biases towards certain classes, classifiers trained on such dataset may overfit to these bias attributes, substantially reducing the accuracy for minority groups. Mitigation techniques can be categorized according to the availability of bias information (\ie, prior knowledge). Although scenarios with unknown biases are better suited for real-world settings, previous work in this field often suffers from a lack of interpretability regarding biases and lower performance. In this study, we propose a framework to identify potential biases as keywords without prior knowledge based on the partial occurrence in the captions. We further propose two debiasing methods: (a) handing over to an existing debiasing approach which requires prior knowledge by assigning pseudo-labels, and (b) employing data augmentation via text-to-image generative models, using acquired bias keywords as prompts. Despite its simplicity, experimental results show that our framework not only outperforms existing methods without prior knowledge, but also is even comparable with a method that assumes prior knowledge.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved promising results in sentiment analysis through the in-context learning (ICL) paradigm. However, their ability to distinguish subtle sentiments still remains a challenge. Inspired by the human ability to adjust understanding via feedback, this paper enhances ICL by incorporating prior predictions and feedback, aiming to rectify sentiment misinterpretation of LLMs. Specifically, the proposed framework consists of three steps: (1) acquiring prior predictions of LLMs, (2) devising predictive feedback based on correctness, and (3) leveraging a feedback-driven prompt to refine sentiment understanding. Experimental results across nine sentiment analysis datasets demonstrate the superiority of our framework over conventional ICL methods, with an average F1 improvement of 5.95%.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In low-visibility marine environments characterized by turbidity and darkness, acoustic cameras serve as visual sensors capable of generating high-resolution 2D sonar images. However, acoustic camera images are interfered with by complex noise and are difficult to be directly ingested by downstream visual algorithms. This paper introduces a novel strategy for denoising acoustic camera images using deep learning techniques, which comprises two principal components: a self-supervised denoising framework and a fine feature-guided block. Additionally, the study explores the relationship between the level of image denoising and the improvement in feature-matching performance. Experimental results show that the proposed denoising strategy can effectively filter acoustic camera images without prior knowledge of the noise model. The denoising process is nearly end-to-end without complex parameter tuning and post-processing. It successfully removes noise while preserving fine feature details, thereby enhancing the performance of local feature matching.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) aims to enable classifiers to identify unseen classes by enhancing data efficiency at the class level. This is achieved by generating image features from pre-defined semantics of unseen classes. However, most current approaches heavily depend on the number of samples from seen classes, i.e. they do not consider instance-level effectiveness. In this paper, we demonstrate that limited seen examples generally result in deteriorated performance of generative models. To overcome these challenges, we propose ZeroDiff, a Diffusion-based Generative ZSL model. This unified framework incorporates diffusion models to improve data efficiency at both the class and instance levels. Specifically, for instance-level effectiveness, ZeroDiff utilizes a forward diffusion chain to transform limited data into an expanded set of noised data. For class-level effectiveness, we design a two-branch generation structure that consists of a Diffusion-based Feature Generator (DFG) and a Diffusion-based Representation Generator (DRG). DFG focuses on learning and sampling the distribution of cross-entropy-based features, whilst DRG learns the supervised contrastive-based representation to boost the zero-shot capabilities of DFG. Additionally, we employ three discriminators to evaluate generated features from various aspects and introduce a Wasserstein-distance-based mutual learning loss to transfer knowledge among discriminators, thereby enhancing guidance for generation. Demonstrated through extensive experiments on three popular ZSL benchmarks, our ZeroDiff not only achieves significant improvements over existing ZSL methods but also maintains robust performance even with scarce training data. Code will be released upon acceptance.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Graph self-supervised learning (SSL) holds considerable promise for mining and learning with graph-structured data. Yet, a significant challenge in graph SSL lies in the feature discrepancy among graphs across different domains. In this work, we aim to pretrain one graph neural network (GNN) on a varied collection of graphs endowed with rich node features and subsequently apply the pretrained GNN to unseen graphs. We present a general GraphAlign method that can be seamlessly integrated into the existing graph SSL framework. To align feature distributions across disparate graphs, GraphAlign designs alignment strategies of feature encoding, normalization, alongside a mixture-of-feature-expert module. Extensive experiments show that GraphAlign empowers existing graph SSL frameworks to pretrain a unified and powerful GNN across multiple graphs, showcasing performance superiority on both in-domain and out-of-domain graphs.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The concept of negative prompts, emerging from conditional generation models like Stable Diffusion, allows users to specify what to exclude from the generated images.%, demonstrating significant practical efficacy. Despite the widespread use of negative prompts, their intrinsic mechanisms remain largely unexplored. This paper presents the first comprehensive study to uncover how and when negative prompts take effect. Our extensive empirical analysis identifies two primary behaviors of negative prompts. Delayed Effect: The impact of negative prompts is observed after positive prompts render corresponding content. Deletion Through Neutralization: Negative prompts delete concepts from the generated image through a mutual cancellation effect in latent space with positive prompts. These insights reveal significant potential real-world applications; for example, we demonstrate that negative prompts can facilitate object inpainting with minimal alterations to the background via a simple adaptive algorithm. We believe our findings will offer valuable insights for the community in capitalizing on the potential of negative prompts.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Most advances in 3D Generative Adversarial Networks (3D GANs) largely depend on ray casting-based volume rendering, which incurs demanding rendering costs. One promising alternative is rasterization-based 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS), providing a much faster rendering speed and explicit 3D representation. In this paper, we exploit Gaussian as a 3D representation for 3D GANs by leveraging its efficient and explicit characteristics. However, in an adversarial framework, we observe that a naïve generator architecture suffers from training instability and lacks the capability to adjust the scale of Gaussians. This leads to model divergence and visual artifacts due to the absence of proper guidance for initialized positions of Gaussians and densification to manage their scales adaptively. To address these issues, we introduce a generator architecture with a hierarchical multi-scale Gaussian representation that effectively regularizes the position and scale of generated Gaussians. Specifically, we design a hierarchy of Gaussians where finer-level Gaussians are parameterized by their coarser-level counterparts; the position of finer-level Gaussians would be located near their coarser-level counterparts, and the scale would monotonically decrease as the level becomes finer, modeling both coarse and fine details of the 3D scene. Experimental results demonstrate that ours achieves a significantly faster rendering speed (x100) compared to state-of-the-art 3D consistent GANs with comparable 3D generation capability.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Cooperation between temporal convolutional networks (TCN) and graph convolutional networks (GCN) as a processing module has shown promising results in skeleton-based video anomaly detection (SVAD). However, to maintain a lightweight model with low computational and storage complexity, shallow GCN and TCN blocks are constrained by small receptive fields and a lack of cross-dimension interaction capture. To tackle this limitation, we propose a lightweight module called the Dual Attention Module (DAM) for capturing cross-dimension interaction relationships in spatio-temporal skeletal data. It employs the frame attention mechanism to identify the most significant frames and the skeleton attention mechanism to capture broader relationships across fixed partitions with minimal parameters and flops. Furthermore, the proposed Dual Attention Normalizing Flow (DA-Flow) integrates the DAM as a post-processing unit after GCN within the normalizing flow framework. Simulations show that the proposed model is robust against noise and negative samples. Experimental results show that DA-Flow reaches competitive or better performance than the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in terms of the micro AUC metric with the fewest number of parameters. Moreover, we found that even without training, simply using random projection without dimensionality reduction on skeleton data enables substantial anomaly detection capabilities.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Self-supervised learning (SSL), which aims to learn meaningful prior representations from unlabeled data, has been proven effective for label-efficient skeleton-based action understanding. Different from the image domain, skeleton data possesses sparser spatial structures and diverse representation forms, with the absence of background clues and the additional temporal dimension. This presents the new challenges for the pretext task design of spatial-temporal motion representation learning. Recently, many endeavors have been made for skeleton-based SSL and remarkable progress has been achieved. However, a systematic and thorough review is still lacking. In this paper, we conduct, for the first time, a comprehensive survey on self-supervised skeleton-based action representation learning, where various literature is organized according to their pre-training pretext task methodologies. Following the taxonomy of context-based, generative learning, and contrastive learning approaches, we make a thorough review and benchmark of existing works and shed light on the future possible directions. Our investigation demonstrates that most SSL works rely on the single paradigm, learning representations of a single level, and are evaluated on the action recognition task solely, which leaves the generalization power of skeleton SSL models under-explored. To this end, a novel and effective SSL method for skeleton is further proposed, which integrates multiple pretext tasks to jointly learn versatile representations of different granularity, substantially boosting the generalization capacity for different downstream tasks. Extensive experiments under three large-scale datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the superior generalization performance on various downstream tasks, including recognition, retrieval, detection, and few-shot learning.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advancements in foundation models (FMs) have unlocked new prospects in autonomous driving, yet the experimental settings of these studies are preliminary, over-simplified, and fail to capture the complexity of real-world driving scenarios in human environments. It remains under-explored whether FM agents can handle long-horizon navigation tasks with free-from dialogue and deal with unexpected situations caused by environmental dynamics or task changes. To explore the capabilities and boundaries of FMs faced with the challenges above, we introduce DriVLMe, a video-language-model-based agent to facilitate natural and effective communication between humans and autonomous vehicles that perceive the environment and navigate. We develop DriVLMe from both embodied experiences in a simulated environment and social experiences from real human dialogue. While DriVLMe demonstrates competitive performance in both open-loop benchmarks and closed-loop human studies, we reveal several limitations and challenges, including unacceptable inference time, imbalanced training data, limited visual understanding, challenges with multi-turn interactions, simplified language generation from robotic experiences, and difficulties in handling on-the-fly unexpected situations like environmental dynamics and task changes.</li>

The Population Transformer (PopT) lowers the amount of data required for decoding experiments, while increasing accuracy, even on never-before-seen subjects and tasks. We address two key challenges in developing PopT: sparse electrode distribution and varying electrode location across patients. PopT stacks on top of pretrained representations and enhances downstream tasks by enabling learned aggregation of multiple spatially-sparse data channels. Beyond decoding, we interpret the pretrained PopT and fine-tuned models to show how it can be used to provide neuroscience insights learned from massive amounts of data. We release a pretrained PopT to enable off-the-shelf improvements in multi-channel intracranial data decoding and interpretability, and code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has become increasingly important as foundation models continue to grow in both popularity and size. Adapter has been particularly well-received due to their potential for parameter reduction and adaptability across diverse tasks. However, striking a balance between high efficiency and robust generalization across tasks remains a challenge for adapter-based methods. We analyze existing methods and find that: 1) parameter sharing is the key to reducing redundancy; 2) more tunable parameters, dynamic allocation, and block-specific design are keys to improving performance. Unfortunately, no previous work considers all these factors. Inspired by this insight, we introduce a novel framework named Adapter-X. First, a Sharing Mixture of Adapters (SMoA) module is proposed to fulfill token-level dynamic allocation, increased tunable parameters, and inter-block sharing at the same time. Second, some block-specific designs like Prompt Generator (PG) are introduced to further enhance the ability of adaptation. Extensive experiments across 2D image and 3D point cloud modalities demonstrate that Adapter-X represents a significant milestone as it is the first to outperform full fine-tuning in both 2D image and 3D point cloud modalities with significantly fewer parameters, i.e., only 0.20% and 1.88% of original trainable parameters for 2D and 3D classification tasks.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Radiology report summarization is a crucial task that can help doctors quickly identify clinically significant findings without the need to review detailed sections of reports. This study proposes RadBARTsum, a domain-specific and ontology facilitated adaptation of the BART model for abstractive radiology report summarization. The approach involves two main steps: 1) re-training the BART model on a large corpus of radiology reports using a novel entity masking strategy to improving biomedical domain knowledge learning, and 2) fine-tuning the model for the summarization task using the Findings and Background sections to predict the Impression section. Experiments are conducted using different masking strategies. Results show that the re-training process with domain knowledge facilitated masking improves performances consistently across various settings. This work contributes a domain-specific generative language model for radiology report summarization and a method for utilising medical knowledge to realise entity masking language model. The proposed approach demonstrates a promising direction of enhancing the efficiency of language models by deepening its understanding of clinical knowledge in radiology reports.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>How to accurately and efficiently assess AI-generated images (AIGIs) remains a critical challenge for generative models. Given the high costs and extensive time commitments required for user studies, many researchers have turned towards employing large multi-modal models (LMMs) as AIGI evaluators, the precision and validity of which are still questionable. Furthermore, traditional benchmarks often utilize mostly natural-captured content rather than AIGIs to test the abilities of LMMs, leading to a noticeable gap for AIGIs. Therefore, we introduce A-Bench in this paper, a benchmark designed to diagnose whether LMMs are masters at evaluating AIGIs. Specifically, A-Bench is organized under two key principles: 1) Emphasizing both high-level semantic understanding and low-level visual quality perception to address the intricate demands of AIGIs. 2) Various generative models are utilized for AIGI creation, and various LMMs are employed for evaluation, which ensures a comprehensive validation scope. Ultimately, 2,864 AIGIs from 16 text-to-image models are sampled, each paired with question-answers annotated by human experts, and tested across 18 leading LMMs. We hope that A-Bench will significantly enhance the evaluation process and promote the generation quality for AIGIs.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The advent of large language models (LLMs) has facilitated the development of natural language text generation. It also poses unprecedented challenges, with content hallucination emerging as a significant concern. Existing solutions often involve expensive and complex interventions during the training process. Moreover, some approaches emphasize problem disassembly while neglecting the crucial validation process, leading to performance degradation or limited applications. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Markov Chain-based multi-agent debate verification framework to enhance hallucination detection accuracy in concise claims. Our method integrates the fact-checking process, including claim detection, evidence retrieval, and multi-agent verification. In the verification stage, we deploy multiple agents through flexible Markov Chain-based debates to validate individual claims, ensuring meticulous verification outcomes. Experimental results across three generative tasks demonstrate that our approach achieves significant improvements over baselines.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vision-based autonomous driving requires reliable and efficient object detection. This work proposes a DiffusionDet-based framework that exploits data fusion from the monocular camera and depth sensor to provide the RGB and depth (RGB-D) data. Within this framework, ground truth bounding boxes are randomly reshaped as part of the training phase, allowing the model to learn the reverse diffusion process of noise addition. The system methodically enhances a randomly generated set of boxes at the inference stage, guiding them toward accurate final detections. By integrating the textural and color features from RGB images with the spatial depth information from the LiDAR sensors, the proposed framework employs a feature fusion that substantially enhances object detection of automotive targets. The $2.3$ AP gain in detecting automotive targets is achieved through comprehensive experiments using the KITTI dataset. Specifically, the improved performance of the proposed approach in detecting small objects is demonstrated.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Adversarial purification is a kind of defense technique that can defend various unseen adversarial attacks without modifying the victim classifier. Existing methods often depend on external generative models or cooperation between auxiliary functions and victim classifiers. However, retraining generative models, auxiliary functions, or victim classifiers relies on the domain of the fine-tuned dataset and is computation-consuming. In this work, we suppose that adversarial images are outliers of the natural image manifold and the purification process can be considered as returning them to this manifold. Following this assumption, we present a simple adversarial purification method without further training to purify adversarial images, called ZeroPur. ZeroPur contains two steps: given an adversarial example, Guided Shift obtains the shifted embedding of the adversarial example by the guidance of its blurred counterparts; after that, Adaptive Projection constructs a directional vector by this shifted embedding to provide momentum, projecting adversarial images onto the manifold adaptively. ZeroPur is independent of external models and requires no retraining of victim classifiers or auxiliary functions, relying solely on victim classifiers themselves to achieve purification. Extensive experiments on three datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-1K) using various classifier architectures (ResNet, WideResNet) demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art robust performance.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, foundation model, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Few-shot image classification involves classifying images using very few training examples. Recent vision foundation models show excellent few-shot transfer abilities, but are large and slow at inference. Using knowledge distillation, the capabilities of high-performing but slow models can be transferred to tiny, efficient models. However, common distillation methods require a large set of unlabeled data, which is not available in the few-shot setting. To overcome this lack of data, there has been a recent interest in using synthetic data. We expand on this work by presenting a novel diffusion model inversion technique (TINT) combining the diversity of textual inversion with the specificity of null-text inversion. Using this method in a few-shot distillation pipeline leads to state-of-the-art accuracy among small student models on popular benchmarks, while being significantly faster than prior work. This allows us to push even tiny models to high accuracy using only a tiny application-specific dataset, albeit relying on extra data for pre-training. Popular few-shot benchmarks involve evaluation over a large number of episodes, which is computationally cumbersome for methods involving synthetic data generation. Therefore, we also present a theoretical analysis on how the variance of the accuracy estimator depends on the number of episodes and query examples, and use these results to lower the computational effort required for method evaluation. In addition, to further motivate the use of generative models in few-shot distillation, we demonstrate that our method performs better compared to training on real data mined from the dataset used to train the diffusion model.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the recent advances of large language models (LLMs), it is no longer infeasible to build an automated debate system that helps people to synthesise persuasive arguments. Previous work attempted this task by integrating multiple components. In our work, we introduce an argument mining dataset that captures the end-to-end process of preparing an argumentative essay for a debate, which covers the tasks of claim and evidence identification (Task 1 ED), evidence convincingness ranking (Task 2 ECR), argumentative essay summarisation and human preference ranking (Task 3 ASR) and metric learning for automated evaluation of resulting essays, based on human feedback along argument quality dimensions (Task 4 SQE). Our dataset contains 14k examples of claims that are fully annotated with the various properties supporting the aforementioned tasks. We evaluate multiple generative baselines for each of these tasks, including representative LLMs. We find, that while they show promising results on individual tasks in our benchmark, their end-to-end performance on all four tasks in succession deteriorates significantly, both in automated measures as well as in human-centred evaluation. This challenge presented by our proposed dataset motivates future research on end-to-end argument mining and summarisation. The repository of this project is available at this https URL</li>

In this work, we release the StatBot.Swiss dataset, the first bilingual benchmark for evaluating Text-to-SQL systems based on real-world applications. The StatBot.Swiss dataset contains 455 natural language/SQL-pairs over 35 big databases with varying level of complexity for both English and German. We evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-3.5-Turbo and mixtral-8x7b-instruct for the Text-to-SQL translation task using an in-context learning approach. Our experimental analysis illustrates that current LLMs struggle to generalize well in generating SQL queries on our novel bilingual dataset.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Existing single image-to-3D creation methods typically involve a two-stage process, first generating multi-view images, and then using these images for 3D reconstruction. However, training these two stages separately leads to significant data bias in the inference phase, thus affecting the quality of reconstructed results. We introduce a unified 3D generation framework, named Ouroboros3D, which integrates diffusion-based multi-view image generation and 3D reconstruction into a recursive diffusion process. In our framework, these two modules are jointly trained through a self-conditioning mechanism, allowing them to adapt to each other's characteristics for robust inference. During the multi-view denoising process, the multi-view diffusion model uses the 3D-aware maps rendered by the reconstruction module at the previous timestep as additional conditions. The recursive diffusion framework with 3D-aware feedback unites the entire process and improves geometric consistency.Experiments show that our framework outperforms separation of these two stages and existing methods that combine them at the inference phase.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Significant advancements in video diffusion models have brought substantial progress to the field of text-to-video (T2V) synthesis. However, existing T2V synthesis model struggle to accurately generate complex motion dynamics, leading to a reduction in video realism. One possible solution is to collect massive data and train the model on it, but this would be extremely expensive. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we reformulate the typical T2V generation process as a search-based generation pipeline. Instead of scaling up the model training, we employ existing videos as the motion prior database. Specifically, we divide T2V generation process into two steps: (i) For a given prompt input, we search existing text-video datasets to find videos with text labels that closely match the prompt motions. We propose a tailored search algorithm that emphasizes object motion features. (ii) Retrieved videos are processed and distilled into motion priors to fine-tune a pre-trained base T2V model, followed by generating desired videos using input prompt. By utilizing the priors gleaned from the searched videos, we enhance the realism of the generated videos' motion. All operations can be finished on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU. We validate our method against state-of-the-art T2V models across diverse prompt inputs. The code will be public.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Reconstructing jets, which provide vital insights into the properties and histories of subatomic particles produced in high-energy collisions, is a main problem in data analyses in collider physics. This intricate task deals with estimating the latent structure of a jet (binary tree) and involves parameters such as particle energy, momentum, and types. While Bayesian methods offer a natural approach for handling uncertainty and leveraging prior knowledge, they face significant challenges due to the super-exponential growth of potential jet topologies as the number of observed particles increases. To address this, we introduce a Combinatorial Sequential Monte Carlo approach for inferring jet latent structures. As a second contribution, we leverage the resulting estimator to develop a variational inference algorithm for parameter learning. Building on this, we introduce a variational family using a pseudo-marginal framework for a fully Bayesian treatment of all variables, unifying the generative model with the inference process. We illustrate our method's effectiveness through experiments using data generated with a collider physics generative model, highlighting superior speed and accuracy across a range of tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Visual anomaly detection aims to identify anomalous regions in images through unsupervised learning paradigms, with increasing application demand and value in fields such as industrial inspection and medical lesion detection. Despite significant progress in recent years, there is a lack of comprehensive benchmarks to adequately evaluate the performance of various mainstream methods across different datasets under the practical multi-class setting. The absence of standardized experimental setups can lead to potential biases in training epochs, resolution, and metric results, resulting in erroneous conclusions. This paper addresses this issue by proposing a comprehensive visual anomaly detection benchmark, \textbf{\textit{ADer}}, which is a modular framework that is highly extensible for new methods. The benchmark includes multiple datasets from industrial and medical domains, implementing fifteen state-of-the-art methods and nine comprehensive metrics. Additionally, we have open-sourced the GPU-assisted \href{this https URL}{ADEval} package to address the slow evaluation problem of metrics like time-consuming mAU-PRO on large-scale data, significantly reducing evaluation time by more than \textit{1000-fold}. Through extensive experimental results, we objectively reveal the strengths and weaknesses of different methods and provide insights into the challenges and future directions of multi-class visual anomaly detection. We hope that \textbf{\textit{ADer}} will become a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field, promoting the development of more robust and generalizable anomaly detection systems.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Simulating detector responses is a crucial part of understanding the inner-workings of particle collisions in the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. The current reliance on statistical Monte-Carlo simulations strains CERN's computational grid, underscoring the urgency for more efficient alternatives. Addressing these challenges, recent proposals advocate for generative machine learning methods. In this study, we present an innovative deep learning simulation approach tailored for the proton Zero Degree Calorimeter in the ALICE experiment. Leveraging a Generative Adversarial Network model with Selective Diversity Increase loss, we directly simulate calorimeter responses. To enhance its capabilities in modeling a broad range of calorimeter response intensities, we expand the SDI-GAN architecture with additional regularization. Moreover, to improve the spatial fidelity of the generated data, we introduce an auxiliary regressor network. Our method offers a significant speedup when comparing to the traditional Monte-Carlo based approaches.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools to accurately predict materials and molecular properties in computational discovery pipelines. In this article, we exploit the invertible nature of these neural networks to directly generate molecular structures with desired electronic properties. Starting from a random graph or an existing molecule, we perform a gradient ascent while holding the GNN weights fixed in order to optimize its input, the molecular graph, towards the target property. Valence rules are enforced strictly through a judicious graph construction. The method relies entirely on the property predictor; no additional training is required on molecular structures. We demonstrate the application of this method by generating molecules with specific DFT-verified energy gaps and octanol-water partition coefficients (logP). Our approach hits target properties with rates comparable to or better than state-of-the-art generative models while consistently generating more diverse molecules.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large-scale diffusion models have achieved remarkable performance in generative tasks. Beyond their initial training applications, these models have proven their ability to function as versatile plug-and-play priors. For instance, 2D diffusion models can serve as loss functions to optimize 3D implicit models. Rectified flow, a novel class of generative models, enforces a linear progression from the source to the target distribution and has demonstrated superior performance across various domains. Compared to diffusion-based methods, rectified flow approaches surpass in terms of generation quality and efficiency, requiring fewer inference steps. In this work, we present theoretical and experimental evidence demonstrating that rectified flow based methods offer similar functionalities to diffusion models - they can also serve as effective priors. Besides the generative capabilities of diffusion priors, motivated by the unique time-symmetry properties of rectified flow models, a variant of our method can additionally perform image inversion. Experimentally, our rectified flow-based priors outperform their diffusion counterparts - the SDS and VSD losses - in text-to-3D generation. Our method also displays competitive performance in image inversion and editing.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Visual prompting infuses visual information into the input image to adapt models toward specific predictions and tasks. Recently, manually crafted markers such as red circles are shown to guide the model to attend to a target region on the image. However, these markers only work on models trained with data containing those markers. Moreover, finding these prompts requires guesswork or prior knowledge of the domain on which the model is trained. This work circumvents manual design constraints by proposing to learn the visual prompts for guiding the attention of vision transformers. The learned visual prompt, added to any input image would redirect the attention of the pre-trained vision transformer to its spatial location on the image. Specifically, the prompt is learned in a self-supervised manner without requiring annotations and without fine-tuning the vision transformer. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed optimization-based visual prompting strategy across various pre-trained vision encoders.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The Mean Square Error (MSE) is commonly utilized to estimate the solution of the optimal value function in the vast majority of offline reinforcement learning (RL) models and has achieved outstanding performance. However, we find that its principle can lead to overestimation phenomenon for the value function. In this paper, we first theoretically analyze overestimation phenomenon led by MSE and provide the theoretical upper bound of the overestimated error. Furthermore, to address it, we propose a novel Bellman underestimated operator to counteract overestimation phenomenon and then prove its contraction characteristics. At last, we propose the offline RL algorithm based on underestimated operator and diffusion policy model. Extensive experimental results on D4RL tasks show that our method can outperform state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms, which demonstrates that our theoretical analysis and underestimation way are effective for offline RL tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Current approximate posteriors in Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) exhibit a crucial limitation: they fail to maintain invariance under reparameterization, i.e. BNNs assign different posterior densities to different parametrizations of identical functions. This creates a fundamental flaw in the application of Bayesian principles as it breaks the correspondence between uncertainty over the parameters with uncertainty over the parametrized function. In this paper, we investigate this issue in the context of the increasingly popular linearized Laplace approximation. Specifically, it has been observed that linearized predictives alleviate the common underfitting problems of the Laplace approximation. We develop a new geometric view of reparametrizations from which we explain the success of linearization. Moreover, we demonstrate that these reparameterization invariance properties can be extended to the original neural network predictive using a Riemannian diffusion process giving a straightforward algorithm for approximate posterior sampling, which empirically improves posterior fit.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Chatbots have been an interesting application of natural language generation since its inception. With novel transformer based Generative AI methods, building chatbots have become trivial. Chatbots which are targeted at specific domains such as medicine, psychology, and general information retrieval are implemented rapidly. This, however, should not distract from the need to evaluate the chatbot responses. Especially because the natural language generation community does not entirely agree upon how to effectively evaluate such applications. With this work we discuss the issue further with the increasingly popular LLM based evaluations and how they correlate with human evaluations. Additionally, we introduce a comprehensive factored evaluation mechanism that can be utilized in conjunction with both human and LLM-based evaluations. We present the results of an experimental evaluation conducted using this scheme in one of our chatbot implementations, and subsequently compare automated, traditional human evaluation, factored human evaluation, and factored LLM evaluation. Results show that factor based evaluation produces better insights on which aspects need to be improved in LLM applications and further strengthens the argument to use human evaluation in critical spaces where main functionality is not direct retrieval.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid progress of generative AI technology has sparked significant copyright concerns, leading to numerous lawsuits filed against AI developers. While some studies explore methods to mitigate copyright risks by steering the outputs of generative models away from those resembling copyrighted data, little attention has been paid to the question of how much of a resemblance is undesirable; more original or unique data are afforded stronger protection, and the threshold level of resemblance for constituting infringement correspondingly lower. Here, leveraging this principle, we propose a genericization method that modifies the outputs of a generative model to make them more generic and less likely to infringe copyright. To achieve this, we introduce a metric for quantifying the level of originality of data in a manner that is consistent with the legal framework. This metric can be practically estimated by drawing samples from a generative model, which is then used for the genericization process. Experiments demonstrate that our genericization method successfully modifies the output of a text-to-image generative model so that it produces more generic, copyright-compliant images.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Depth maps produced by consumer-grade sensors suffer from inaccurate measurements and missing data from either system or scene-specific sources. Data-driven denoising algorithms can mitigate such problems. However, they require vast amounts of ground truth depth data. Recent research has tackled this limitation using self-supervised learning techniques, but it requires multiple RGB-D sensors. Moreover, most existing approaches focus on denoising single isolated depth maps or specific subjects of interest, highlighting a need for methods to effectively denoise depth maps in real-time dynamic environments. This paper extends state-of-the-art approaches for depth-denoising commodity depth devices, proposing SelfReDepth, a self-supervised deep learning technique for depth restoration, via denoising and hole-filling by inpainting full-depth maps captured with RGB-D sensors. The algorithm targets depth data in video streams, utilizing multiple sequential depth frames coupled with color data to achieve high-quality depth videos with temporal coherence. Finally, SelfReDepth is designed to be compatible with various RGB-D sensors and usable in real-time scenarios as a pre-processing step before applying other depth-dependent algorithms. Our results demonstrate our approach's real-time performance on real-world datasets. They show that it outperforms state-of-the-art denoising and restoration performance at over 30fps on Commercial Depth Cameras, with potential benefits for augmented and mixed-reality applications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Currently, the field of structure-based drug design is dominated by three main types of algorithms: search-based algorithms, deep generative models, and reinforcement learning. While existing works have typically focused on comparing models within a single algorithmic category, cross-algorithm comparisons remain scarce. In this paper, to fill the gap, we establish a benchmark to evaluate the performance of sixteen models across these different algorithmic foundations by assessing the pharmaceutical properties of the generated molecules and their docking affinities with specified target proteins. We highlight the unique advantages of each algorithmic approach and offer recommendations for the design of future SBDD models. We emphasize that 1D/2D ligand-centric drug design methods can be used in SBDD by treating the docking function as a black-box oracle, which is typically neglected. The empirical results show that 1D/2D methods achieve competitive performance compared with 3D-based methods that use the 3D structure of the target protein explicitly. Also, AutoGrow4, a 2D molecular graph-based genetic algorithm, dominates SBDD in terms of optimization ability. The relevant code is available in this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Event cameras are advantageous for tasks that require vision sensors with low-latency and sparse output responses. However, the development of deep network algorithms using event cameras has been slow because of the lack of large labelled event camera datasets for network training. This paper reports a method for creating new labelled event datasets by using a text-to-X model, where X is one or multiple output modalities, in the case of this work, events. Our proposed text-to-events model produces synthetic event frames directly from text prompts. It uses an autoencoder which is trained to produce sparse event frames representing event camera outputs. By combining the pretrained autoencoder with a diffusion model architecture, the new text-to-events model is able to generate smooth synthetic event streams of moving objects. The autoencoder was first trained on an event camera dataset of diverse scenes. In the combined training with the diffusion model, the DVS gesture dataset was used. We demonstrate that the model can generate realistic event sequences of human gestures prompted by different text statements. The classification accuracy of the generated sequences, using a classifier trained on the real dataset, ranges between 42% to 92%, depending on the gesture group. The results demonstrate the capability of this method in synthesizing event datasets.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper demonstrates a self-supervised approach for learning semantic video representations. Recent vision studies show that a masking strategy for vision and natural language supervision has contributed to developing transferable visual pretraining. Our goal is to achieve a more semantic video representation by leveraging the text related to the video content during the pretraining in a fully self-supervised manner. To this end, we present FILS, a novel self-supervised video Feature prediction In semantic Language Space (FILS). The vision model can capture valuable structured information by correctly predicting masked feature semantics in language space. It is learned using a patch-wise video-text contrastive strategy, in which the text representations act as prototypes for transforming vision features into a language space, which are then used as targets for semantically meaningful feature prediction using our masked encoder-decoder structure. FILS demonstrates remarkable transferability on downstream action recognition tasks, achieving state-of-the-art on challenging egocentric datasets, like Epic-Kitchens, Something-SomethingV2, Charades-Ego, and EGTEA, using ViT-Base. Our efficient method requires less computation and smaller batches compared to previous works.</li>
