<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>User and Entity Behaviour Analytics (UEBA) is a broad branch of data analytics that attempts to build a normal behavioural profile in order to detect anomalous events. Among the techniques used to detect anomalies, Deep Autoencoders constitute one of the most promising deep learning models on UEBA tasks, allowing explainable detection of security incidents that could lead to the leak of personal data, hijacking of systems, or access to sensitive business information. In this study, we introduce the first implementation of an explainable UEBA-based anomaly detection framework that leverages Deep Autoencoders in combination with Doc2Vec to process both numerical and textual features. Additionally, based on the theoretical foundations of neural networks, we offer a novel proof demonstrating the equivalence of two widely used definitions for fully-connected neural networks. The experimental results demonstrate the proposed framework capability to detect real and synthetic anomalies effectively generated from real attack data, showing that the models provide not only correct identification of anomalies but also explainable results that enable the reconstruction of the possible origin of the anomaly. Our findings suggest that the proposed UEBA framework can be seamlessly integrated into enterprise environments, complementing existing security systems for explainable threat detection.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated Learning (FL) enables distributed model training across edge devices in a privacy-friendly manner. However, its efficiency heavily depends on effective device selection and high-dimensional resource allocation in dynamic and heterogeneous wireless environments. Conventional methods demand a confluence of domain-specific expertise, extensive hyperparameter tuning, and/or heavy interaction cost. This paper proposes a Tool-aided Evolutionary Large Language Model (T-ELLM) framework to generate a qualified policy for device selection in a wireless FL environment. Unlike conventional optimization methods, T-ELLM leverages natural language-based scenario prompts to enhance generalization across varying network conditions. The framework decouples the joint optimization problem mathematically, enabling tractable learning of device selection policies while delegating resource allocation to convex optimization tools. To improve adaptability, T-ELLM integrates a sample-efficient, model-based virtual learning environment that captures the relationship between device selection and learning performance, facilitating subsequent group relative policy optimization. This concerted approach reduces reliance on real-world interactions, minimizing communication overhead while maintaining high-fidelity decision-making. Theoretical analysis proves that the discrepancy between virtual and real environments is bounded, ensuring the advantage function learned in the virtual environment maintains a provably small deviation from real-world conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that T-ELLM outperforms benchmark methods in energy efficiency and exhibits robust adaptability to environmental changes.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This research confronts the challenge of substantial physical equation discrepancies encountered in the generation of spatiotemporal physical fields through data-driven trained models. A spatiotemporal physical field generation model, named HMT-PF, is developed based on the hybrid Mamba-Transformer architecture, incorporating unstructured grid information as input. A fine-tuning block, enhanced with physical information, is introduced to effectively reduce the physical equation discrepancies. The physical equation residuals are computed through a point query mechanism for efficient gradient evaluation, then encoded into latent space for refinement. The fine-tuning process employs a self-supervised learning approach to achieve physical consistency while maintaining essential field characteristics. Results show that the hybrid Mamba-Transformer model achieves good performance in generating spatiotemporal fields, while the physics-informed fine-tuning mechanism further reduces significant physical errors effectively. A MSE-R evaluation method is developed to assess the accuracy and realism of physical field generation.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Invariant Point Attention (IPA) is a key algorithm for geometry-aware modeling in structural biology, central to many protein and RNA models. However, its quadratic complexity limits the input sequence length. We introduce FlashIPA, a factorized reformulation of IPA that leverages hardware-efficient FlashAttention to achieve linear scaling in GPU memory and wall-clock time with sequence length. FlashIPA matches or exceeds standard IPA performance while substantially reducing computational costs. FlashIPA extends training to previously unattainable lengths, and we demonstrate this by re-training generative models without length restrictions and generating structures of thousands of residues.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Feature selection removes redundant features to enhanc performance and computational efficiency in downstream tasks. Existing works often struggle to capture complex feature interactions and adapt to diverse scenarios. Recent advances in this domain have incorporated generative intelligence to address these drawbacks by uncovering intricate relationships between features. However, two key limitations remain: 1) embedding feature subsets in a continuous space is challenging due to permutation sensitivity, as changes in feature order can introduce biases and weaken the embedding learning process; 2) gradient-based search in the embedding space assumes convexity, which is rarely guaranteed, leading to reduced search effectiveness and suboptimal subsets. To address these limitations, we propose a new framework that can: 1) preserve feature subset knowledge in a continuous embedding space while ensuring permutation invariance; 2) effectively explore the embedding space without relying on strong convex assumptions. For the first objective, we develop an encoder-decoder paradigm to preserve feature selection knowledge into a continuous embedding space. This paradigm captures feature interactions through pairwise relationships within the subset, removing the influence of feature order on the embedding. Moreover, an inducing point mechanism is introduced to accelerate pairwise relationship computations. For the second objective, we employ a policy-based reinforcement learning (RL) approach to guide the exploration of the embedding space. The RL agent effectively navigates the space by balancing multiple objectives. By prioritizing high-potential regions adaptively and eliminating the reliance on convexity assumptions, the RL agent effectively reduces the risk of converging to local optima. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, robustness and explicitness of our model.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Clinical guidelines, typically structured as decision trees, are central to evidence-based medical practice and critical for ensuring safe and accurate diagnostic decision-making. However, it remains unclear whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can reliably follow such structured protocols. In this work, we introduce MedGUIDE, a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs on their ability to make guideline-consistent clinical decisions. MedGUIDE is constructed from 55 curated NCCN decision trees across 17 cancer types and uses clinical scenarios generated by LLMs to create a large pool of multiple-choice diagnostic questions. We apply a two-stage quality selection process, combining expert-labeled reward models and LLM-as-a-judge ensembles across ten clinical and linguistic criteria, to select 7,747 high-quality samples. We evaluate 25 LLMs spanning general-purpose, open-source, and medically specialized models, and find that even domain-specific LLMs often underperform on tasks requiring structured guideline adherence. We also test whether performance can be improved via in-context guideline inclusion or continued pretraining. Our findings underscore the importance of MedGUIDE in assessing whether LLMs can operate safely within the procedural frameworks expected in real-world clinical settings.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative, anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Quantum computing may offer new approaches for advancing machine learning, including in complex tasks such as anomaly detection in network traffic. In this paper, we introduce a quantum generative adversarial network (QGAN) architecture for multivariate time-series anomaly detection that leverages variational quantum circuits (VQCs) in combination with a time-window shifting technique, data re-uploading, and successive data injection (SuDaI). The method encodes multivariate time series data as rotation angles. By integrating both data re-uploading and SuDaI, the approach maps classical data into quantum states efficiently, helping to address hardware limitations such as the restricted number of available qubits. In addition, the approach employs an anomaly scoring technique that utilizes both the generator and the discriminator output to enhance the accuracy of anomaly detection. The QGAN was trained using the parameter shift rule and benchmarked against a classical GAN. Experimental results indicate that the quantum model achieves a accuracy high along with high recall and F1-scores in anomaly detection, and attains a lower MSE compared to the classical model. Notably, the QGAN accomplishes this performance with only 80 parameters, demonstrating competitive results with a compact architecture. Tests using a noisy simulator suggest that the approach remains effective under realistic noise-prone conditions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Many real-world tasks, from associative memory to symbolic reasoning, demand discrete, structured representations that standard continuous latent models struggle to express naturally. We introduce the Gaussian-Multinoulli Restricted Boltzmann Machine (GM-RBM), a generative energy-based model that extends the Gaussian-Bernoulli RBM (GB-RBM) by replacing binary hidden units with $q$-state Potts variables. This modification enables a combinatorially richer latent space and supports learning over multivalued, interpretable latent concepts. We formally derive GM-RBM's energy function, learning dynamics, and conditional distributions, showing that it preserves tractable inference and training through contrastive divergence. Empirically, we demonstrate that GM-RBMs model complex multimodal distributions more effectively than binary RBMs, outperforming them on tasks involving analogical recall and structured memory. Our results highlight GM-RBMs as a scalable framework for discrete latent inference with enhanced expressiveness and interoperability.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Parameter estimation in inverse problems involving partial differential equations (PDEs) underpins modeling across scientific disciplines, especially when parameters vary in space or time. Physics-informed Machine Learning (PhiML) integrates PDE constraints into deep learning, but prevailing approaches depend on recursive automatic differentiation (autodiff), which produces inaccurate high-order derivatives, inflates memory usage, and underperforms in noisy settings. We propose Mollifier Layers, a lightweight, architecture-agnostic module that replaces autodiff with convolutional operations using analytically defined mollifiers. This reframing of derivative computation as smoothing integration enables efficient, noise-robust estimation of high-order derivatives directly from network outputs. Mollifier Layers attach at the output layer and require no architectural modifications. We compare them with three distinct architectures and benchmark performance across first-, second-, and fourth-order PDEs -- including Langevin dynamics, heat diffusion, and reaction-diffusion systems -- observing significant improvements in memory efficiency, training time and accuracy for parameter recovery across tasks. To demonstrate practical relevance, we apply Mollifier Layers to infer spatially varying epigenetic reaction rates from super-resolution chromatin imaging data -- a real-world inverse problem with biomedical significance. Our results establish Mollifier Layers as an efficient and scalable tool for physics-constrained learning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technologies have transformed human-computer interaction; however, low-resource languages in Africa remain significantly underrepresented in both research and practical applications. This study investigates the major challenges hindering the development of ASR systems for these languages, which include data scarcity, linguistic complexity, limited computational resources, acoustic variability, and ethical concerns surrounding bias and privacy. The primary goal is to critically analyze these barriers and identify practical, inclusive strategies to advance ASR technologies within the African context. Recent advances and case studies emphasize promising strategies such as community-driven data collection, self-supervised and multilingual learning, lightweight model architectures, and techniques that prioritize privacy. Evidence from pilot projects involving various African languages showcases the feasibility and impact of customized solutions, which encompass morpheme-based modeling and domain-specific ASR applications in sectors like healthcare and education. The findings highlight the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and sustained investment to tackle the distinct linguistic and infrastructural challenges faced by the continent. This study offers a progressive roadmap for creating ethical, efficient, and inclusive ASR systems that not only safeguard linguistic diversity but also improve digital accessibility and promote socioeconomic participation for speakers of African languages.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce Qronos -- a new state-of-the-art post-training quantization algorithm that sequentially rounds and updates neural network weights. Qronos not only explicitly corrects errors due to both weight and activation quantization, but also errors resulting from quantizing previous layers. Our iterative algorithm is based on an interpretable and disciplined optimization framework that subsumes and surpasses existing data-driven approaches. At each step, Qronos alternates between error correction and diffusion via optimal update rules. Importantly, we prove that Qronos admits an efficient implementation that uses the Cholesky decomposition for solving least-squares problems. We also demonstrate that Qronos is compatible with existing transformation techniques such as Hadamard-based incoherence processing and weight-activation scaling equalization, among others. We evaluate Qronos using recent autoregressive language generation models in the Llama3 family; Qronos consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art adaptive rounding methods when quantizing the weights, activations, and/or KV caches.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion transformers have shown exceptional performance in visual generation but incur high computational costs. Token reduction techniques that compress models by sharing the denoising process among similar tokens have been introduced. However, existing approaches neglect the denoising priors of the diffusion models, leading to suboptimal acceleration and diminished image quality. This study proposes a novel concept: attend to prune feature redundancies in areas not attended by the diffusion process. We analyze the location and degree of feature redundancies based on the structure-then-detail denoising priors. Subsequently, we introduce SDTM, a structure-then-detail token merging approach that dynamically compresses feature redundancies. Specifically, we design dynamic visual token merging, compression ratio adjusting, and prompt reweighting for different stages. Served in a post-training way, the proposed method can be integrated seamlessly into any DiT architecture. Extensive experiments across various backbones, schedulers, and datasets showcase the superiority of our method, for example, it achieves 1.55 times acceleration with negligible impact on image quality.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Imitation learning for manipulation has a well-known data scarcity problem. Unlike natural language and 2D computer vision, there is no Internet-scale corpus of data for dexterous manipulation. One appealing option is egocentric human video, a passively scalable data source. However, existing large-scale datasets such as Ego4D do not have native hand pose annotations and do not focus on object manipulation. To this end, we use Apple Vision Pro to collect EgoDex: the largest and most diverse dataset of dexterous human manipulation to date. EgoDex has 829 hours of egocentric video with paired 3D hand and finger tracking data collected at the time of recording, where multiple calibrated cameras and on-device SLAM can be used to precisely track the pose of every joint of each hand. The dataset covers a wide range of diverse manipulation behaviors with everyday household objects in 194 different tabletop tasks ranging from tying shoelaces to folding laundry. Furthermore, we train and systematically evaluate imitation learning policies for hand trajectory prediction on the dataset, introducing metrics and benchmarks for measuring progress in this increasingly important area. By releasing this large-scale dataset, we hope to push the frontier of robotics, computer vision, and foundation models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in data-centric deep generative models have led to significant progress in solving inverse imaging problems. However, these models (e.g., diffusion models (DMs)) typically require large amounts of fully sampled (clean) training data, which is often impractical in medical and scientific settings such as dynamic imaging. On the other hand, training-data-free approaches like the Deep Image Prior (DIP) do not require clean ground-truth images but suffer from noise overfitting and can be computationally expensive as the network parameters need to be optimized for each measurement set independently. Moreover, DIP-based methods often overlook the potential of learning a prior using a small number of sub-sampled measurements (or degraded images) available during training. In this paper, we propose UGoDIT, an Unsupervised Group DIP via Transferable weights, designed for the low-data regime where only a very small number, M, of sub-sampled measurement vectors are available during training. Our method learns a set of transferable weights by optimizing a shared encoder and M disentangled decoders. At test time, we reconstruct the unseen degraded image using a DIP network, where part of the parameters are fixed to the learned weights, while the remaining are optimized to enforce measurement consistency. We evaluate UGoDIT on both medical (multi-coil MRI) and natural (super resolution and non-linear deblurring) image recovery tasks under various settings. Compared to recent standalone DIP methods, UGoDIT provides accelerated convergence and notable improvement in reconstruction quality. Furthermore, our method achieves performance competitive with SOTA DM-based and supervised approaches, despite not requiring large amounts of clean training data.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text-guided diffusion models have significantly advanced image editing, enabling highly realistic and local modifications based on textual prompts. While these developments expand creative possibilities, their malicious use poses substantial challenges for detection of such subtle deepfake edits. To this end, we introduce Explain Edit (X-Edit), a novel method for localizing diffusion-based edits in images. To localize the edits for an image, we invert the image using a pretrained diffusion model, then use these inverted features as input to a segmentation network that explicitly predicts the edited masked regions via channel and spatial attention. Further, we finetune the model using a combined segmentation and relevance loss. The segmentation loss ensures accurate mask prediction by balancing pixel-wise errors and perceptual similarity, while the relevance loss guides the model to focus on low-frequency regions and mitigate high-frequency artifacts, enhancing the localization of subtle edits. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to address and model the problem of localizing diffusion-based modified regions in images. We additionally contribute a new dataset of paired original and edited images addressing the current lack of resources for this task. Experimental results demonstrate that X-Edit accurately localizes edits in images altered by text-guided diffusion models, outperforming baselines in PSNR and SSIM metrics. This highlights X-Edit's potential as a robust forensic tool for detecting and pinpointing manipulations introduced by advanced image editing techniques.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Self-supervised learning (SSL) on graphs generates node and graph representations (i.e., embeddings) that can be used for downstream tasks such as node classification, node clustering, and link prediction. Graph SSL is particularly useful in scenarios with limited or no labeled data. Existing SSL methods predominantly follow contrastive or generative paradigms, each excelling in different tasks: contrastive methods typically perform well on classification tasks, while generative methods often excel in link prediction. In this paper, we present a novel architecture for graph SSL that integrates the strengths of both approaches. Our framework introduces community-aware node-level contrastive learning, providing more robust and effective positive and negative node pairs generation, alongside graph-level contrastive learning to capture global semantic information. Additionally, we employ a comprehensive augmentation strategy that combines feature masking, node perturbation, and edge perturbation, enabling robust and diverse representation learning. By incorporating these enhancements, our model achieves superior performance across multiple tasks, including node classification, clustering, and link prediction. Evaluations on open benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a performance lift of 0.23%-2.01% depending on the task and dataset.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in various visual generation tasks, including image, video, and 3D content generation. Preference optimization (PO) is a prominent and growing area of research that aims to align these models with human preferences. While existing PO methods primarily concentrate on producing favorable outputs, they often overlook the significance of classifier-free guidance (CFG) in mitigating undesirable results. Diffusion-NPO addresses this gap by introducing negative preference optimization (NPO), training models to generate outputs opposite to human preferences and thereby steering them away from unfavorable outcomes. However, prior NPO approaches, including Diffusion-NPO, rely on costly and fragile procedures for obtaining explicit preference annotations (e.g., manual pairwise labeling or reward model training), limiting their practicality in domains where such data are scarce or difficult to acquire. In this work, we introduce Self-NPO, a Negative Preference Optimization approach that learns exclusively from the model itself, thereby eliminating the need for manual data labeling or reward model training. Moreover, our method is highly efficient and does not require exhaustive data sampling. We demonstrate that Self-NPO integrates seamlessly into widely used diffusion models, including SD1.5, SDXL, and CogVideoX, as well as models already optimized for human preferences, consistently enhancing both their generation quality and alignment with human preferences.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative, anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Anomaly detection (AD) has attracted remarkable attention in hyperspectral image (HSI) processing fields, and most existing deep learning (DL)-based algorithms indicate dramatic potential for detecting anomaly samples through specific training process under current scenario. However, the limited prior information and the catastrophic forgetting problem indicate crucial challenges for existing DL structure in open scenarios cross-domain detection. In order to improve the detection performance, a novel continual learning-based capsule differential generative adversarial network (CL-CaGAN) is proposed to elevate the cross-scenario learning performance for facilitating the real application of DL-based structure in hyperspectral AD (HAD) task. First, a modified capsule structure with adversarial learning network is constructed to estimate the background distribution for surmounting the deficiency of prior information. To mitigate the catastrophic forgetting phenomenon, clustering-based sample replay strategy and a designed extra self-distillation regularization are integrated for merging the history and future knowledge in continual AD task, while the discriminative learning ability from previous detection scenario to current scenario is retained by the elaborately designed structure with continual learning (CL) strategy. In addition, the differentiable enhancement is enforced to augment the generation performance of the training data. This further stabilizes the training process with better convergence and efficiently consolidates the reconstruction ability of background samples. To verify the effectiveness of our proposed CL-CaGAN, we conduct experiments on several real HSIs, and the results indicate that the proposed CL-CaGAN demonstrates higher detection performance and continuous learning capacity for mitigating the catastrophic forgetting under cross-domain scenarios.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Memory stability and learning flexibility in continual learning (CL) is a core challenge for cross-scene Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection (HAD) task. Biological neural networks can actively forget history knowledge that conflicts with the learning of new experiences by regulating learning-triggered synaptic expansion and synaptic convergence. Inspired by this phenomenon, we propose a novel Biologically-Inspired Continual Learning Generative Adversarial Network (CL-BioGAN) for augmenting continuous distribution fitting ability for cross-domain HAD task, where Continual Learning Bio-inspired Loss (CL-Bio Loss) and self-attention Generative Adversarial Network (BioGAN) are incorporated to realize forgetting history knowledge as well as involving replay strategy in the proposed BioGAN. Specifically, a novel Bio-Inspired Loss composed with an Active Forgetting Loss (AF Loss) and a CL loss is designed to realize parameters releasing and enhancing between new task and history tasks from a Bayesian perspective. Meanwhile, BioGAN loss with L2-Norm enhances self-attention (SA) to further balance the stability and flexibility for better fitting background distribution for open scenario HAD (OHAD) tasks. Experiment results underscore that the proposed CL-BioGAN can achieve more robust and satisfying accuracy for cross-domain HAD with fewer parameters and computation cost. This dual contribution not only elevates CL performance but also offers new insights into neural adaptation mechanisms in OHAD task.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Hyperspectral and multispectral image (HSI-MSI) fusion involves combining a low-resolution hyperspectral image (LR-HSI) with a high-resolution multispectral image (HR-MSI) to generate a high-resolution hyperspectral image (HR-HSI). Most deep learning-based methods for HSI-MSI fusion rely on large amounts of hyperspectral data for supervised training, which is often scarce in practical applications. In this paper, we propose a self-learning Adaptive Residual Guided Subspace Diffusion Model (ARGS-Diff), which only utilizes the observed images without any extra training data. Specifically, as the LR-HSI contains spectral information and the HR-MSI contains spatial information, we design two lightweight spectral and spatial diffusion models to separately learn the spectral and spatial distributions from them. Then, we use these two models to reconstruct HR-HSI from two low-dimensional components, i.e, the spectral basis and the reduced coefficient, during the reverse diffusion process. Furthermore, we introduce an Adaptive Residual Guided Module (ARGM), which refines the two components through a residual guided function at each sampling step, thereby stabilizing the sampling process. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that ARGS-Diff outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of both performance and computational efficiency in the field of HSI-MSI fusion.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Advanced healthcare predictions offer significant improvements in patient outcomes by leveraging predictive analytics. Existing works primarily utilize various views of Electronic Health Record (EHR) data, such as diagnoses, lab tests, or clinical notes, for model training. These methods typically assume the availability of complete EHR views and that the designed model could fully leverage the potential of each view. However, in practice, random missing views and view laziness present two significant challenges that hinder further improvements in multi-view utilization. To address these challenges, we introduce Diffmv, an innovative diffusion-based generative framework designed to advance the exploitation of multiple views of EHR data. Specifically, to address random missing views, we integrate various views of EHR data into a unified diffusion-denoising framework, enriched with diverse contextual conditions to facilitate progressive alignment and view transformation. To mitigate view laziness, we propose a novel reweighting strategy that assesses the relative advantages of each view, promoting a balanced utilization of various data views within the model. Our proposed strategy achieves superior performance across multiple health prediction tasks derived from three popular datasets, including multi-view and multi-modality scenarios.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Robustness against uncertain and ambiguous inputs is a critical challenge for deep learning models. While recent advancements in large scale vision language models (VLMs, e.g. GPT4o) might suggest that increasing model and training dataset size would mitigate this issue, our empirical evaluation shows a more complicated picture. Testing models using two classic uncertainty quantification tasks, anomaly detection and classification under inherently ambiguous conditions, we find that newer and larger VLMs indeed exhibit improved robustness compared to earlier models, but still suffer from a tendency to strictly follow instructions, often causing them to hallucinate confident responses even when faced with unclear or anomalous inputs. Remarkably, for natural images such as ImageNet, this limitation can be overcome without pipeline modifications: simply prompting models to abstain from uncertain predictions enables significant reliability gains, achieving near-perfect robustness in several settings. However, for domain-specific tasks such as galaxy morphology classification, a lack of specialized knowledge prevents reliable uncertainty estimation. Finally, we propose a novel mechanism based on caption diversity to reveal a model's internal uncertainty, enabling practitioners to predict when models will successfully abstain without relying on labeled data.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Data augmentation for domain-specific image classification tasks often struggles to simultaneously address diversity, faithfulness, and label clarity of generated data, leading to suboptimal performance in downstream tasks. While existing generative diffusion model-based methods aim to enhance augmentation, they fail to cohesively tackle these three critical aspects and often overlook intrinsic challenges of diffusion models, such as sensitivity to model characteristics and stochasticity under strong transformations. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that explicitly integrates diversity, faithfulness, and label clarity into the augmentation process. Our approach employs saliency-guided mixing and a fine-tuned diffusion model to preserve foreground semantics, enrich background diversity, and ensure label consistency, while mitigating diffusion model limitations. Extensive experiments across fine-grained, long-tail, few-shot, and background robustness tasks demonstrate our method's superior performance over state-of-the-art approaches.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Continual learning aims to learn multiple tasks sequentially while preserving prior knowledge, but faces the challenge of catastrophic forgetting when acquiring new knowledge. Recently, approaches leveraging pre-trained models have gained increasing popularity to mitigate this issue, due to the strong generalization ability of foundation models. To adjust pre-trained models for new tasks, existing methods usually employ low-rank adaptation, which restricts parameter updates to a fixed low-rank subspace. However, constraining the optimization space inherently compromises the model's learning capacity, resulting in inferior performance. To address the limitation, we propose Continuous Subspace Optimization for Continual Learning (CoSO) to fine-tune the model in a series of subspaces rather than a single one. These sequential subspaces are dynamically determined through the singular value decomposition of gradients. CoSO updates the model by projecting gradients into these subspaces, ensuring memory-efficient optimization. To mitigate forgetting, the optimization subspaces of each task are set to be orthogonal to the historical task subspace. During task learning, CoSO maintains a task-specific component that captures the critical update directions associated with the current task. Upon completing a task, this component is used to update the historical task subspace, laying the groundwork for subsequent learning. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that CoSO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in challenging scenarios with long task sequences.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Training diffusion models requires large datasets. However, acquiring large volumes of high-quality data can be challenging, for example, collecting large numbers of high-resolution images and long videos. On the other hand, there are many complementary data that are usually considered corrupted or partial, such as low-resolution images and short videos. Other examples of corrupted data include videos that contain subtitles, watermarks, and logos. In this study, we investigate the theoretical problem of whether the above partial data can be utilized to train conventional diffusion models. Motivated by our theoretical analysis in this study, we propose a straightforward approach of training diffusion models utilizing partial data views, where we consider each form of complementary data as a view of conventional data. Our proposed approach first trains one separate diffusion model for each individual view, and then trains a model for predicting the residual score function. We prove generalization error bounds, which show that the proposed diffusion model training approach can achieve lower generalization errors if proper regularizations are adopted in the residual score function training. In particular, we prove that the difficulty in training the residual score function scales proportionally with the signal correlations not captured by partial data views. Consequently, the proposed approach achieves near first-order optimal data efficiency.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have fueled the vision of automated scientific discovery, often called AI Co-Scientists. To date, prior work casts these systems as generative co-authors responsible for crafting hypotheses, synthesizing code, or drafting manuscripts. In this work, we explore a complementary application: using LLMs as verifiers to automate the \textbf{academic verification of scientific manuscripts}. To that end, we introduce SPOT, a dataset of 83 published papers paired with 91 errors significant enough to prompt errata or retraction, cross-validated with actual authors and human annotators. Evaluating state-of-the-art LLMs on SPOT, we find that none surpasses 21.1\% recall or 6.1\% precision (o3 achieves the best scores, with all others near zero). Furthermore, confidence estimates are uniformly low, and across eight independent runs, models rarely rediscover the same errors, undermining their reliability. Finally, qualitative analysis with domain experts reveals that even the strongest models make mistakes resembling student-level misconceptions derived from misunderstandings. These findings highlight the substantial gap between current LLM capabilities and the requirements for dependable AI-assisted academic verification.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As generative agents become increasingly capable, alignment of their behavior with complex human values remains a fundamental challenge. Existing approaches often simplify human intent through reduction to a scalar reward, overlooking the multi-faceted nature of human feedback. In this work, we introduce a theoretical framework for preference-based Multi-Objective Inverse Reinforcement Learning (MO-IRL), where human preferences are modeled as latent vector-valued reward functions. We formalize the problem of recovering a Pareto-optimal reward representation from noisy preference queries and establish conditions for identifying the underlying multi-objective structure. We derive tight sample complexity bounds for recovering $\epsilon$-approximations of the Pareto front and introduce a regret formulation to quantify suboptimality in this multi-objective setting. Furthermore, we propose a provably convergent algorithm for policy optimization using preference-inferred reward cones. Our results bridge the gap between practical alignment techniques and theoretical guarantees, providing a principled foundation for learning aligned behaviors in a high-dimension and value-pluralistic environment.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Remarkable progress in zero-shot learning (ZSL) has been achieved using generative models. However, existing generative ZSL methods merely generate (imagine) the visual features from scratch guided by the strong class semantic vectors annotated by experts, resulting in suboptimal generative performance and limited scene generalization. To address these and advance ZSL, we propose an inductive variational autoencoder for generative zero-shot learning, dubbed GenZSL. Mimicking human-level concept learning, GenZSL operates by inducting new class samples from similar seen classes using weak class semantic vectors derived from target class names (i.e., CLIP text embedding). To ensure the generation of informative samples for training an effective ZSL classifier, our GenZSL incorporates two key strategies. Firstly, it employs class diversity promotion to enhance the diversity of class semantic vectors. Secondly, it utilizes target class-guided information boosting criteria to optimize the model. Extensive experiments conducted on three popular benchmark datasets showcase the superiority and potential of our GenZSL with significant efficacy and efficiency over f-VAEGAN, e.g., 24.7% performance gains and more than $60\times$ faster training speed on AWA2.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent unified multi-modal encoders align a wide range of modalities into a shared representation space, enabling diverse cross-modal tasks. Despite their impressive capabilities, the robustness of these models under adversarial perturbations remains underexplored, which is a critical concern for safety-sensitive applications. In this work, we present the first comprehensive study of adversarial vulnerability in unified multi-modal encoders. We find that even mild adversarial perturbations lead to substantial performance drops across all modalities. Non-visual inputs, such as audio and point clouds, are especially fragile, while visual inputs like images and videos also degrade significantly. To address this, we propose an efficient adversarial calibration framework that improves robustness across modalities without modifying pretrained encoders or semantic centers, ensuring compatibility with existing foundation models. Our method introduces modality-specific projection heads trained solely on adversarial examples, while keeping the backbone and embeddings frozen. We explore three training objectives: fixed-center cross-entropy, clean-to-adversarial L2 alignment, and clean-adversarial InfoNCE, and we introduce a regularization strategy to ensure modality-consistent alignment under attack. Experiments on six modalities and three Bind-style models show that our method improves adversarial robustness by up to 47.3 percent at epsilon = 4/255, while preserving or even improving clean zero-shot and retrieval performance with less than 1 percent trainable parameters.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The transformer architecture has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in modern artificial intelligence, among which the capability of implicitly learning an internal model during inference time is widely believed to play a key role in the under standing of pre-trained large language models. However, most recent works have been focusing on studying supervised learning topics such as in-context learning, leaving the field of unsupervised learning largely unexplored. This paper investigates the capabilities of transformers in solving Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), a fundamental unsupervised learning problem through the lens of statistical estimation. We propose a transformer-based learning framework called TGMM that simultaneously learns to solve multiple GMM tasks using a shared transformer backbone. The learned models are empirically demonstrated to effectively mitigate the limitations of classical methods such as Expectation-Maximization (EM) or spectral algorithms, at the same time exhibit reasonable robustness to distribution shifts. Theoretically, we prove that transformers can approximate both the EM algorithm and a core component of spectral methods (cubic tensor power iterations). These results bridge the gap between practical success and theoretical understanding, positioning transformers as versatile tools for unsupervised learning.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper presents a comprehensive collection of industrial screw driving datasets designed to advance research in manufacturing process monitoring and quality control. The collection comprises six distinct datasets with over 34,000 individual screw driving operations conducted under controlled experimental conditions, capturing the multifaceted nature of screw driving processes in plastic components. Each dataset systematically investigates specific aspects: natural thread degradation patterns through repeated use (s01), variations in surface friction conditions including contamination and surface treatments (s02), diverse assembly faults with up to 27 error types (s03-s04), and fabrication parameter variations in both upper and lower workpieces through modified injection molding settings (s05-s06). We detail the standardized experimental setup used across all datasets, including hardware specifications, process phases, and data acquisition methods. The hierarchical data model preserves the temporal and operational structure of screw driving processes, facilitating both exploratory analysis and the development of machine learning models. To maximize accessibility, we provide dual access pathways: raw data through Zenodo with a persistent DOI, and a purpose-built Python library (PyScrew) that offers consistent interfaces for data loading, preprocessing, and integration with common analysis workflows. These datasets serve diverse research applications including anomaly detection, predictive maintenance, quality control system development, feature extraction methodology evaluation, and classification of specific error conditions. By addressing the scarcity of standardized, comprehensive datasets in industrial manufacturing, this collection enables reproducible research and fair comparison of analytical approaches in an area of growing importance for industrial automation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in static data generation, their deployment in streaming or continual learning (CL) scenarios faces a major challenge: catastrophic forgetting (CF), where newly acquired generative capabilities overwrite previously learned ones. To systematically address this, we introduce a formal Continual Diffusion Generation (CDG) paradigm that characterizes and redefines CL in the context of generative diffusion models. Prior efforts often adapt heuristic strategies from continual classification tasks but lack alignment with the underlying diffusion process. In this work, we develop the first theoretical framework for CDG by analyzing cross-task dynamics in diffusion-based generative modeling. Our analysis reveals that the retention and stability of generative knowledge across tasks are governed by three key consistency criteria: inter-task knowledge consistency (IKC), unconditional knowledge consistency (UKC), and label knowledge consistency (LKC). Building on these insights, we propose Continual Consistency Diffusion (CCD), a principled framework that integrates these consistency objectives into training via hierarchical loss terms $\mathcal{L}_{IKC}$, $\mathcal{L}_{UKC}$, and $\mathcal{L}_{LKC}$. This promotes effective knowledge retention while enabling the assimilation of new generative capabilities. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that CCD achieves state-of-the-art performance under continual settings, with substantial gains in Mean Fidelity (MF) and Incremental Mean Fidelity (IMF), particularly in tasks with rich cross-task knowledge overlap.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a powerful foundation model for image segmentation, showing robust zero-shot generalization through prompt engineering. However, relying on manual prompts is impractical for real-world applications, particularly in scenarios where rapid prompt provision and resource efficiency are crucial. In this paper, we propose the Automation of Prompts for SAM (AoP-SAM), a novel approach that learns to generate essential prompts in optimal locations automatically. AoP-SAM enhances SAM's efficiency and usability by eliminating manual input, making it better suited for real-world tasks. Our approach employs a lightweight yet efficient Prompt Predictor model that detects key entities across images and identifies the optimal regions for placing prompt candidates. This method leverages SAM's image embeddings, preserving its zero-shot generalization capabilities without requiring fine-tuning. Additionally, we introduce a test-time instance-level Adaptive Sampling and Filtering mechanism that generates prompts in a coarse-to-fine manner. This notably enhances both prompt and mask generation efficiency by reducing computational overhead and minimizing redundant mask refinements. Evaluations of three datasets demonstrate that AoP-SAM substantially improves both prompt generation efficiency and mask generation accuracy, making SAM more effective for automated segmentation tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Novel view synthesis (NVS) boosts immersive experiences in computer vision and graphics. Existing techniques, though progressed, rely on dense multi-view observations, restricting their application. This work takes on the challenge of reconstructing photorealistic 3D scenes from sparse or single-view inputs. We introduce SpatialCrafter, a framework that leverages the rich knowledge in video diffusion models to generate plausible additional observations, thereby alleviating reconstruction ambiguity. Through a trainable camera encoder and an epipolar attention mechanism for explicit geometric constraints, we achieve precise camera control and 3D consistency, further reinforced by a unified scale estimation strategy to handle scale discrepancies across datasets. Furthermore, by integrating monocular depth priors with semantic features in the video latent space, our framework directly regresses 3D Gaussian primitives and efficiently processes long-sequence features using a hybrid network structure. Extensive experiments show our method enhances sparse view reconstruction and restores the realistic appearance of 3D scenes.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Considering the inherent limitations of parametric knowledge in large language models (LLMs), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is widely employed to expand their knowledge scope. Since RAG has shown promise in knowledge-intensive tasks like open-domain question answering, its broader application to complex tasks and intelligent assistants has further advanced its utility. Despite this progress, the underlying knowledge utilization mechanisms of LLM-based RAG remain underexplored. In this paper, we present a systematic investigation of the intrinsic mechanisms by which LLMs integrate internal (parametric) and external (retrieved) knowledge in RAG scenarios. Specially, we employ knowledge stream analysis at the macroscopic level, and investigate the function of individual modules at the microscopic level. Drawing on knowledge streaming analyses, we decompose the knowledge utilization process into four distinct stages within LLM layers: knowledge refinement, knowledge elicitation, knowledge expression, and knowledge contestation. We further demonstrate that the relevance of passages guides the streaming of knowledge through these stages. At the module level, we introduce a new method, knowledge activation probability entropy (KAPE) for neuron identification associated with either internal or external knowledge. By selectively deactivating these neurons, we achieve targeted shifts in the LLM's reliance on one knowledge source over the other. Moreover, we discern complementary roles for multi-head attention and multi-layer perceptron layers during knowledge formation. These insights offer a foundation for improving interpretability and reliability in retrieval-augmented LLMs, paving the way for more robust and transparent generative solutions in knowledge-intensive domains.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>1-Lipschitz neural networks are fundamental for generative modelling, inverse problems, and robust classifiers. In this paper, we focus on 1-Lipschitz residual networks (ResNets) based on explicit Euler steps of negative gradient flows and study their approximation capabilities. Leveraging the Restricted Stone-Weierstrass Theorem, we first show that these 1-Lipschitz ResNets are dense in the set of scalar 1-Lipschitz functions on any compact domain when width and depth are allowed to grow. We also show that these networks can exactly represent scalar piecewise affine 1-Lipschitz functions. We then prove a stronger statement: by inserting norm-constrained linear maps between the residual blocks, the same density holds when the hidden width is fixed. Because every layer obeys simple norm constraints, the resulting models can be trained with off-the-shelf optimisers. This paper provides the first universal approximation guarantees for 1-Lipschitz ResNets, laying a rigorous foundation for their practical use.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization capabilities across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Similarly, graph foundation models (GFMs) have emerged as a promising direction in graph learning, aiming to generalize across diverse datasets through large-scale pre-training. However, unlike language models that rely on explicit token representations, graphs lack a well-defined unit for generalization, making it challenging to design effective pre-training strategies. In this work, we propose REEF, a novel framework that leverages relation tokens as the basic units for GFMs. Inspired by the token vocabulary in LLMs, we construct a relation vocabulary of relation tokens to store relational information within graphs. To accommodate diverse relations, we introduce two hypernetworks that adaptively generate the parameters of aggregators and classifiers in graph neural networks based on relation tokens. In addition, we design another hypernetwork to construct dataset-specific projectors and incorporate a dataset-level feature bias into the initial node representations, enhancing flexibility across different datasets with the same relation. Further, we adopt graph data augmentation and a mixed-dataset pre-training strategy, allowing REEF to capture relational diversity more effectively and exhibit strong generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments show that REEF significantly outperforms existing methods on both pre-training and transfer learning tasks, underscoring its potential as a powerful foundation model for graph-based applications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models have gained attention for their success in modeling complex distributions, achieving impressive perceptual quality in SR tasks. However, existing diffusion-based SR methods often suffer from high computational costs, requiring numerous iterative steps for training and inference. Existing acceleration techniques, such as distillation and solver optimization, are generally task-agnostic and do not fully leverage the specific characteristics of low-level tasks like super-resolution (SR). In this study, we analyze the frequency- and spatial-domain properties of diffusion-based SR methods, revealing key insights into the temporal and spatial dependencies of high-frequency signal recovery. Specifically, high-frequency details benefit from concentrated optimization during early and late diffusion iterations, while spatially textured regions demand adaptive denoising strategies. Building on these observations, we propose the Time-Spatial-aware Sampling strategy (TSS) for the acceleration of Diffusion SR without any extra training cost. TSS combines Time Dynamic Sampling (TDS), which allocates more iterations to refining textures, and Spatial Dynamic Sampling (SDS), which dynamically adjusts strategies based on image content. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that TSS achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with significantly fewer iterations, improving MUSIQ scores by 0.2 - 3.0 and outperforming the current acceleration methods with only half the number of steps.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Modern video generation frameworks based on Latent Diffusion Models suffer from inefficiencies in tokenization due to the Frame-Proportional Information Assumption. Existing tokenizers provide fixed temporal compression rates, causing the computational cost of the diffusion model to scale linearly with the frame rate. The paper proposes the Duration-Proportional Information Assumption: the upper bound on the information capacity of a video is proportional to the duration rather than the number of frames. Based on this insight, the paper introduces VFRTok, a Transformer-based video tokenizer, that enables variable frame rate encoding and decoding through asymmetric frame rate training between the encoder and decoder. Furthermore, the paper proposes Partial Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) to decouple position and content modeling, which groups correlated patches into unified tokens. The Partial RoPE effectively improves content-awareness, enhancing the video generation capability. Benefiting from the compact and continuous spatio-temporal representation, VFRTok achieves competitive reconstruction quality and state-of-the-art generation fidelity while using only 1/8 tokens compared to existing tokenizers.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Demonstrations and instructions are two primary approaches for prompting language models to perform in-context learning (ICL) tasks. Do identical tasks elicited in different ways result in similar representations of the task? An improved understanding of task representation mechanisms would offer interpretability insights and may aid in steering models. We study this through function vectors, recently proposed as a mechanism to extract few-shot ICL task representations. We generalize function vectors to alternative task presentations, focusing on short textual instruction prompts, and successfully extract instruction function vectors that promote zero-shot task accuracy. We find evidence that demonstration- and instruction-based function vectors leverage different model components, and offer several controls to dissociate their contributions to task performance. Our results suggest that different task presentations do not induce a common task representation but elicit different, partly overlapping mechanisms. Our findings offer principled support to the practice of combining textual instructions and task demonstrations, imply challenges in universally monitoring task inference across presentation forms, and encourage further examinations of LLM task inference mechanisms.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Discovering symbolic differential equations from data uncovers fundamental dynamical laws underlying complex systems. However, existing methods often struggle with the vast search space of equations and may produce equations that violate known physical laws. In this work, we address these problems by introducing the concept of \textit{symmetry invariants} in equation discovery. We leverage the fact that differential equations admitting a symmetry group can be expressed in terms of differential invariants of symmetry transformations. Thus, we propose to use these invariants as atomic entities in equation discovery, ensuring the discovered equations satisfy the specified symmetry. Our approach integrates seamlessly with existing equation discovery methods such as sparse regression and genetic programming, improving their accuracy and efficiency. We validate the proposed method through applications to various physical systems, such as fluid and reaction-diffusion, demonstrating its ability to recover parsimonious and interpretable equations that respect the laws of physics.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) push the bound-aries in natural language processing and generative AI, driving progress across various aspects of modern society. Unfortunately, the pervasive issue of bias in LLMs responses (i.e., predictions) poses a significant and open challenge, hindering their application in tasks involving ethical sensitivity and responsible decision-making. In this work, we propose a straightforward, user-friendly and practical method to mitigate such biases, enhancing the reliability and trustworthiness of LLMs. Our method creates multiple variations of a given sentence by modifying specific attributes and evaluates the corresponding prediction behavior compared to the original, unaltered, prediction/sentence. The idea behind this process is that critical ethical predictions often exhibit notable inconsistencies, indicating the presence of bias. Unlike previous approaches, our method relies solely on forward passes (i.e., testing-time adversaries), eliminating the need for training, fine-tuning, or prior knowledge of the training data distribution. Through extensive experiments on the popular Llama family, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in improving various fairness metrics, focusing on the reduction of disparities in how the model treats individuals from different racial groups. Specifically, using standard metrics, we improve the fairness in Llama3 in up to 27 percentage points. Overall, our approach significantly enhances fairness, equity, and reliability in LLM-generated results without parameter tuning or training data modifications, confirming its effectiveness in practical scenarios. We believe our work establishes an important step toward enabling the use of LLMs in tasks that require ethical considerations and responsible decision-making.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Remote sensing image (RSI) interpretation typically faces challenges due to the scarcity of labeled data, which limits the performance of RSI interpretation tasks. To tackle this challenge, we propose EarthSynth, a diffusion-based generative foundation model that enables synthesizing multi-category, cross-satellite labeled Earth observation for downstream RSI interpretation tasks. To the best of our knowledge, EarthSynth is the first to explore multi-task generation for remote sensing. EarthSynth, trained on the EarthSynth-180K dataset, employs the Counterfactual Composition training strategy to improve training data diversity and enhance category control. Furthermore, a rule-based method of R-Filter is proposed to filter more informative synthetic data for downstream tasks. We evaluate our EarthSynth on scene classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation in open-world scenarios, offering a practical solution for advancing RSI interpretation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Transformers have shown a remarkable ability for in-context learning (ICL), making predictions based on contextual examples. However, while theoretical analyses have explored this prediction capability, the nature of the inferred context and its utility for downstream predictions remain open questions. This paper aims to address these questions by examining ICL for inverse linear regression (ILR), where context inference can be characterized by unsupervised learning of underlying weight vectors. Focusing on the challenging scenario of rank-deficient inverse problems, where context length is smaller than the number of unknowns in the weight vectors and regularization is necessary, we introduce a linear transformer to learn the inverse mapping from contextual examples to the underlying weight vector. Our findings reveal that the transformer implicitly learns both a prior distribution and an effective regularization strategy, outperforming traditional ridge regression and regularization methods. A key insight is the necessity of low task dimensionality relative to the context length for successful learning. Furthermore, we numerically verify that the error of the transformer estimator scales linearly with the noise level, the ratio of task dimension to context length, and the condition number of the input data. These results not only demonstrate the potential of transformers for solving ill-posed inverse problems, but also provide a new perspective towards understanding the knowledge extraction mechanism within transformers.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Socioeconomic status (SES) fundamentally influences how people interact with each other and more recently, with digital technologies like Large Language Models (LLMs). While previous research has highlighted the interaction between SES and language technology, it was limited by reliance on proxy metrics and synthetic data. We survey 1,000 individuals from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds about their use of language technologies and generative AI, and collect 6,482 prompts from their previous interactions with LLMs. We find systematic differences across SES groups in language technology usage (i.e., frequency, performed tasks), interaction styles, and topics. Higher SES entails a higher level of abstraction, convey requests more concisely, and topics like 'inclusivity' and 'travel'. Lower SES correlates with higher anthropomorphization of LLMs (using ''hello'' and ''thank you'') and more concrete language. Our findings suggest that while generative language technologies are becoming more accessible to everyone, socioeconomic linguistic differences still stratify their use to exacerbate the digital divide. These differences underscore the importance of considering SES in developing language technologies to accommodate varying linguistic needs rooted in socioeconomic factors and limit the AI Gap across SES groups.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has become a powerful solution to extract rich representations from unlabeled data. Yet, SSL research is mostly focused on clean, curated and high-quality datasets. As a result, applying SSL on noisy data remains a challenge, despite being crucial to applications such as astrophysics, medical imaging, geophysics or finance. In this work, we present a fully self-supervised framework that enables noise-robust representation learning without requiring a denoiser at inference or downstream fine-tuning. Our method first trains an SSL denoiser on noisy data, then uses it to construct a denoised-to-noisy data curriculum (i.e., training first on denoised, then noisy samples) for pretraining a SSL backbone (e.g., DINOv2), combined with a teacher-guided regularization that anchors noisy embeddings to their denoised counterparts. This process encourages the model to internalize noise robustness. Notably, the denoiser can be discarded after pretraining, simplifying deployment. On ImageNet-1k with ViT-B under extreme Gaussian noise ($\sigma=255$, SNR = 0.72 dB), our method improves linear probing accuracy by 4.8% over DINOv2, demonstrating that denoiser-free robustness can emerge from noise-aware pretraining.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Monocular depth estimation is critical for applications such as autonomous driving and scene reconstruction. While existing methods perform well under normal scenarios, their performance declines in adverse weather, due to challenging domain shifts and difficulties in extracting scene information. To address this issue, we present a robust monocular depth estimation method called \textbf{ACDepth} from the perspective of high-quality training data generation and domain adaptation. Specifically, we introduce a one-step diffusion model for generating samples that simulate adverse weather conditions, constructing a multi-tuple degradation dataset during training. To ensure the quality of the generated degradation samples, we employ LoRA adapters to fine-tune the generation weights of diffusion model. Additionally, we integrate circular consistency loss and adversarial training to guarantee the fidelity and naturalness of the scene contents. Furthermore, we elaborate on a multi-granularity knowledge distillation strategy (MKD) that encourages the student network to absorb knowledge from both the teacher model and pretrained Depth Anything V2. This strategy guides the student model in learning degradation-agnostic scene information from various degradation inputs. In particular, we introduce an ordinal guidance distillation mechanism (OGD) that encourages the network to focus on uncertain regions through differential ranking, leading to a more precise depth estimation. Experimental results demonstrate that our ACDepth surpasses md4all-DD by 2.50\% for night scene and 2.61\% for rainy scene on the nuScenes dataset in terms of the absRel metric.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on task-specific data is essential for their effective deployment. As dataset sizes grow, efficiently selecting optimal subsets for training becomes crucial to balancing performance and computational costs. Traditional data selection methods often require fine-tuning a scoring model on the target dataset, which is time-consuming and resource-intensive, or rely on heuristics that fail to fully leverage the model's predictive capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose Data Whisperer, an efficient, training-free, attention-based method that leverages few-shot in-context learning with the model to be fine-tuned. Comprehensive evaluations were conducted on both raw and synthetic datasets across diverse tasks and models. Notably, Data Whisperer achieves superior performance compared to the full GSM8K dataset on the Llama-3-8B-Instruct model, using just 10% of the data, and outperforms existing methods with a 3.1-point improvement and a 7.4$\times$ speedup.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The diffusion model has provided a strong tool for implementing text-to-image (T2I) and image-to-image (I2I) generation. Recently, topology and texture control are popular explorations, e.g., ControlNet, IP-Adapter, Ctrl-X, and DSG. These methods explicitly consider high-fidelity controllable editing based on external signals or diffusion feature manipulations. As for diversity, they directly choose different noise latents. However, the diffused noise is capable of implicitly representing the topological and textural manifold of the corresponding image. Moreover, it's an effective workbench to conduct the trade-off between content preservation and controllable variations. Previous T2I and I2I diffusion works do not explore the information within the compressed contextual latent. In this paper, we first propose a plug-and-play noise finetune NOFT module employed by Stable Diffusion to generate highly correlated and diverse images. We fine-tune seed noise or inverse noise through an optimal-transported (OT) information bottleneck (IB) with around only 14K trainable parameters and 10 minutes of training. Our test-time NOFT is good at producing high-fidelity image variations considering topology and texture alignments. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that NOFT is a powerful general reimagine approach to efficiently fine-tune the 2D/3D AIGC assets with text or image guidance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative, in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Few-Shot Relation Extraction (FSRE) remains a challenging task due to the scarcity of annotated data and the limited generalization capabilities of existing models. Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in FSRE through in-context learning (ICL), their general-purpose training objectives often result in suboptimal performance for task-specific relation extraction. To overcome these challenges, we propose TKRE (Two-Stage Knowledge-Guided Pre-training for Relation Extraction), a novel framework that synergistically integrates LLMs with traditional relation extraction models, bridging generative and discriminative learning paradigms. TKRE introduces two key innovations: (1) leveraging LLMs to generate explanation-driven knowledge and schema-constrained synthetic data, addressing the issue of data scarcity; and (2) a two-stage pre-training strategy combining Masked Span Language Modeling (MSLM) and Span-Level Contrastive Learning (SCL) to enhance relational reasoning and generalization. Together, these components enable TKRE to effectively tackle FSRE tasks. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficacy of TKRE, achieving new state-of-the-art performance in FSRE and underscoring its potential for broader application in low-resource scenarios. \footnote{The code and data are released on this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Autoregressive transformers have recently shown impressive image generation quality and efficiency on par with state-of-the-art diffusion models. Unlike diffusion architectures, autoregressive models can naturally incorporate arbitrary modalities into a single, unified token sequence--offering a concise solution for multi-conditional image generation tasks. In this work, we propose $\textbf{ContextAR}$, a flexible and effective framework for multi-conditional image generation. ContextAR embeds diverse conditions (e.g., canny edges, depth maps, poses) directly into the token sequence, preserving modality-specific semantics. To maintain spatial alignment while enhancing discrimination among different condition types, we introduce hybrid positional encodings that fuse Rotary Position Embedding with Learnable Positional Embedding. We design Conditional Context-aware Attention to reduces computational complexity while preserving effective intra-condition perception. Without any fine-tuning, ContextAR supports arbitrary combinations of conditions during inference time. Experimental results demonstrate the powerful controllability and versatility of our approach, and show that the competitive perpormance than diffusion-based multi-conditional control approaches the existing autoregressive baseline across diverse multi-condition driven scenarios.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Foundation models have demonstrated remarkable performance across modalities such as language and vision. However, model reuse across distinct modalities (e.g., text and vision) remains limited due to the difficulty of aligning internal representations. Existing methods require extensive paired training data or are constrained to specific domains. We introduce a semi-supervised approach for model alignment via conditional flow matching. The conditional flow between latent spaces of different modalities (e.g., text-to-image or biological-to-artificial neuronal activity) can be learned in two settings: ($1$) solving a (balanced or unbalanced) optimal transport problem with an inter-space bridge cost, and ($2$) performing memory-efficient alignment using labelled exemplars. Despite being constrained by the original models' capacity, our method--under both settings--matches downstream task performance of end-to-end trained models on object recognition and image generation tasks across MNIST, ImageNet, and \cite{majaj2015simple} datasets, particularly when labelled training data is scarce ($<20\%$). Our method provides a data-efficient solution for inter-modal model alignment with minimal supervision.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid advancement of generative models, such as GANs and Diffusion models, has enabled the creation of highly realistic synthetic images, raising serious concerns about misinformation, deepfakes, and copyright infringement. Although numerous Artificial Intelligence Generated Image (AIGI) detectors have been proposed, often reporting high accuracy, their effectiveness in real-world scenarios remains questionable. To bridge this gap, we introduce AIGIBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate the robustness and generalization capabilities of state-of-the-art AIGI detectors. AIGIBench simulates real-world challenges through four core tasks: multi-source generalization, robustness to image degradation, sensitivity to data augmentation, and impact of test-time pre-processing. It includes 23 diverse fake image subsets that span both advanced and widely adopted image generation techniques, along with real-world samples collected from social media and AI art platforms. Extensive experiments on 11 advanced detectors demonstrate that, despite their high reported accuracy in controlled settings, these detectors suffer significant performance drops on real-world data, limited benefits from common augmentations, and nuanced effects of pre-processing, highlighting the need for more robust detection strategies. By providing a unified and realistic evaluation framework, AIGIBench offers valuable insights to guide future research toward dependable and generalizable AIGI detection.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the development of generative artificial intelligence, new forgery methods are rapidly emerging. Social platforms are flooded with vast amounts of unlabeled synthetic data and authentic data, making it increasingly challenging to distinguish real from fake. Due to the lack of labels, existing supervised detection methods struggle to effectively address the detection of unknown deepfake methods. Moreover, in open world scenarios, the amount of unlabeled data greatly exceeds that of labeled data. Therefore, we define a new deepfake detection generalization task which focuses on how to achieve efficient detection of large amounts of unlabeled data based on limited labeled data to simulate a open world scenario. To solve the above mentioned task, we propose a novel Open-World Deepfake Detection Generalization Enhancement Training Strategy (OWG-DS) to improve the generalization ability of existing methods. Our approach aims to transfer deepfake detection knowledge from a small amount of labeled source domain data to large-scale unlabeled target domain data. Specifically, we introduce the Domain Distance Optimization (DDO) module to align different domain features by optimizing both inter-domain and intra-domain distances. Additionally, the Similarity-based Class Boundary Separation (SCBS) module is used to enhance the aggregation of similar samples to ensure clearer class boundaries, while an adversarial training mechanism is adopted to learn the domain-invariant features. Extensive experiments show that the proposed deepfake detection generalization enhancement training strategy excels in cross-method and cross-dataset scenarios, improving the model's generalization.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Complementarity Determining Regions (CDRs) are critical segments of an antibody that facilitate binding to specific antigens. Current computational methods for CDR design utilize reconstruction losses and do not jointly optimize binding energy, a crucial metric for antibody efficacy. Rather, binding energy optimization is done through computationally expensive Online Reinforcement Learning (RL) pipelines rely heavily on unreliable binding energy estimators. In this paper, we propose AbFlowNet, a novel generative framework that integrates GFlowNet with Diffusion models. By framing each diffusion step as a state in the GFlowNet framework, AbFlowNet jointly optimizes standard diffusion losses and binding energy by directly incorporating energy signals into the training process, thereby unifying diffusion and reward optimization in a single procedure. Experimental results show that AbFlowNet outperforms the base diffusion model by 3.06% in amino acid recovery, 20.40% in geometric reconstruction (RMSD), and 3.60% in binding energy improvement ratio. ABFlowNet also decreases Top-1 total energy and binding energy errors by 24.8% and 38.1% without pseudo-labeling the test dataset or using computationally expensive online RL regimes.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Image Generation models are a trending topic nowadays, with many people utilizing Artificial Intelligence models in order to generate images. There are many such models which, given a prompt of a text, will generate an image which depicts said prompt. There are many image generation models, such as Latent Diffusion Models, Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models, Generative Adversarial Networks and many more. When generating images, these models can generate sensitive image data, which can be threatening to privacy or may violate copyright laws of private entities. Machine unlearning aims at removing the influence of specific data subsets from the trained models and in the case of image generation models, remove the influence of a concept such that the model is unable to generate said images of the concept when prompted. Conventional retraining of the model can take upto days, hence fast algorithms are the need of the hour. In this paper we propose an algorithm that aims to remove the influence of concepts in diffusion models through updating the gradients of the final layers of the text encoders. Using a weighted loss function, we utilize backpropagation in order to update the weights of the final layers of the Text Encoder componet of the Stable Diffusion Model, removing influence of the concept from the text-image embedding space, such that when prompted, the result is an image not containing the concept. The weighted loss function makes use of Textual Inversion and Low-Rank this http URL perform our experiments on Latent Diffusion Models, namely the Stable Diffusion v2 model, with an average concept unlearning runtime of 50 seconds using 4-5 images.</li>

In this article, we demonstrate the ability of pattern-based similarity detection for AI paraphrased news recognition. We propose an algorithmic scheme, which is not limited to detect whether an article is an AI paraphrase, but, more importantly, to identify that the source of infringement is the ChatGPT. The proposed method is tested with a benchmark dataset specifically created for this task that incorporates real articles from BBC, incorporating a total of 2,224 articles across five different news categories, as well as 2,224 paraphrased articles created with ChatGPT. Results show that our pattern similarity-based method, that makes no use of deep learning, can detect ChatGPT assisted paraphrased articles at percentages 96.23% for accuracy, 96.25% for precision, 96.21% for sensitivity, 96.25% for specificity and 96.23% for F1 score.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at analyzing graph-structured data but struggle on heterophilic graphs, where connected nodes often belong to different classes. While this challenge is commonly addressed with specialized GNN architectures, graph rewiring remains an underexplored strategy in this context. We provide theoretical foundations linking edge homophily, GNN embedding smoothness, and node classification performance, motivating the need to enhance homophily. Building on this insight, we introduce a rewiring framework that increases graph homophily using a reference graph, with theoretical guarantees on the homophily of the rewired graph. To broaden applicability, we propose a label-driven diffusion approach for constructing a homophilic reference graph from node features and training labels. Through extensive simulations, we analyze how the homophily of both the original and reference graphs influences the rewired graph homophily and downstream GNN performance. We evaluate our method on 11 real-world heterophilic datasets and show that it outperforms existing rewiring techniques and specialized GNNs for heterophilic graphs, achieving improved node classification accuracy while remaining efficient and scalable to large graphs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Drag-based editing within pretrained diffusion model provides a precise and flexible way to manipulate foreground objects. Traditional methods optimize the input feature obtained from DDIM inversion directly, adjusting them iteratively to guide handle points towards target locations. However, these approaches often suffer from limited accuracy due to the low representation ability of the feature in motion supervision, as well as inefficiencies caused by the large search space required for point tracking. To address these limitations, we present DragLoRA, a novel framework that integrates LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) adapters into the drag-based editing pipeline. To enhance the training of LoRA adapters, we introduce an additional denoising score distillation loss which regularizes the online model by aligning its output with that of the original model. Additionally, we improve the consistency of motion supervision by adapting the input features using the updated LoRA, giving a more stable and accurate input feature for subsequent operations. Building on this, we design an adaptive optimization scheme that dynamically toggles between two modes, prioritizing efficiency without compromising precision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DragLoRA significantly enhances the control precision and computational efficiency for drag-based image editing.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Few-shot classification of hyperspectral images (HSI) faces the challenge of scarce labeled samples. Self-Supervised learning (SSL) and Few-Shot Learning (FSL) offer promising avenues to address this issue. However, existing methods often struggle to adapt to the spatial geometric diversity of HSIs and lack sufficient spectral prior knowledge. To tackle these challenges, we propose a method, Spectral-Spatial Self-Supervised Learning for Few-Shot Hyperspectral Image Classification (S4L-FSC), aimed at improving the performance of few-shot HSI classification. Specifically, we first leverage heterogeneous datasets to pretrain a spatial feature extractor using a designed Rotation-Mirror Self-Supervised Learning (RM-SSL) method, combined with FSL. This approach enables the model to learn the spatial geometric diversity of HSIs using rotation and mirroring labels as supervisory signals, while acquiring transferable spatial meta-knowledge through few-shot learning. Subsequently, homogeneous datasets are utilized to pretrain a spectral feature extractor via a combination of FSL and Masked Reconstruction Self-Supervised Learning (MR-SSL). The model learns to reconstruct original spectral information from randomly masked spectral vectors, inferring spectral dependencies. In parallel, FSL guides the model to extract pixel-level discriminative features, thereby embedding rich spectral priors into the model. This spectral-spatial pretraining method, along with the integration of knowledge from heterogeneous and homogeneous sources, significantly enhances model performance. Extensive experiments on four HSI datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed S4L-FSC approach for few-shot HSI classification.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text-to-image generation models have achieved remarkable capabilities in synthesizing images, but often struggle to provide fine-grained control over the output. Existing guidance approaches, such as segmentation maps and depth maps, introduce spatial rigidity that restricts the inherent diversity of diffusion models. In this work, we introduce Deep Geometric Moments (DGM) as a novel form of guidance that encapsulates the subject's visual features and nuances through a learned geometric prior. DGMs focus specifically on the subject itself compared to DINO or CLIP features, which suffer from overemphasis on global image features or semantics. Unlike ResNets, which are sensitive to pixel-wise perturbations, DGMs rely on robust geometric moments. Our experiments demonstrate that DGM effectively balance control and diversity in diffusion-based image generation, allowing a flexible control mechanism for steering the diffusion process.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>GPT has shown its remarkable success in natural language processing. However, the language sequence is not sufficient to describe spatial-temporal details in the visual world. Alternatively, the video sequence is good at capturing such details. Motivated by this fact, we propose a concise Video-GPT in this paper by treating video as new language for visual world modeling. By analogy to next token prediction in GPT, we introduce a novel next clip diffusion paradigm for pretraining Video-GPT. Different from the previous works, this distinct paradigm allows Video-GPT to tackle both short-term generation and long-term prediction, by autoregressively denoising the noisy clip according to the clean clips in the history. Extensive experiments show our Video-GPT achieves the state-of-the-art performance on video prediction, which is the key factor towards world modeling (Physics-IQ Benchmark: Video-GPT 34.97 vs. Kling 23.64 vs. Wan 20.89). Moreover, it can be well adapted on 6 mainstream video tasks in both video generation and understanding, showing its great generalization capacity in downstream.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose a novel unsupervised framework for \emph{Invariant Risk Minimization} (IRM), extending the concept of invariance to settings where labels are unavailable. Traditional IRM methods rely on labeled data to learn representations that are robust to distributional shifts across environments. In contrast, our approach redefines invariance through feature distribution alignment, enabling robust representation learning from unlabeled data. We introduce two methods within this framework: Principal Invariant Component Analysis (PICA), a linear method that extracts invariant directions under Gaussian assumptions, and Variational Invariant Autoencoder (VIAE), a deep generative model that disentangles environment-invariant and environment-dependent latent factors. Our approach is based on a novel ``unsupervised'' structural causal model and supports environment-conditioned sample-generation and intervention. Empirical evaluations on synthetic dataset and modified versions of MNIST demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods in capturing invariant structure, preserving relevant information, and generalizing across environments without access to labels.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Outside of transfer learning settings, reinforcement learning agents start their learning process from a clean slate. As a result, such agents have to go through a slow process to learn even the most obvious skills required to solve a problem. In this paper, we present InnateCoder, a system that leverages human knowledge encoded in foundation models to provide programmatic policies that encode "innate skills" in the form of temporally extended actions, or options. In contrast to existing approaches to learning options, InnateCoder learns them from the general human knowledge encoded in foundation models in a zero-shot setting, and not from the knowledge the agent gains by interacting with the environment. Then, InnateCoder searches for a programmatic policy by combining the programs encoding these options into larger and more complex programs. We hypothesized that InnateCoder's way of learning and using options could improve the sampling efficiency of current methods for learning programmatic policies. Empirical results in MicroRTS and Karel the Robot support our hypothesis, since they show that InnateCoder is more sample efficient than versions of the system that do not use options or learn them from experience.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Efficiently adapting large foundation models is critical, especially with tight compute and memory budgets. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods such as LoRA offer limited granularity and effectiveness in few-parameter regimes. We propose Wavelet Fine-Tuning (WaveFT), a novel PEFT method that learns highly sparse updates in the wavelet domain of residual matrices. WaveFT allows precise control of trainable parameters, offering fine-grained capacity adjustment and excelling with remarkably low parameter count, potentially far fewer than LoRA's minimum -- ideal for extreme parameter-efficient scenarios. In order to demonstrate the effect of the wavelet transform, we compare WaveFT with a special case, called SHiRA, that entails applying sparse updates directly in the weight domain. Evaluated on personalized text-to-image generation using Stable Diffusion XL as baseline, WaveFT significantly outperforms LoRA and other PEFT methods, especially at low parameter counts; achieving superior subject fidelity, prompt alignment, and image diversity.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Analysing the generalisation capabilities of relation extraction (RE) models is crucial for assessing whether they learn robust relational patterns or rely on spurious correlations. Our cross-dataset experiments find that RE models struggle with unseen data, even within similar domains. Notably, higher intra-dataset performance does not indicate better transferability, instead often signaling overfitting to dataset-specific artefacts. Our results also show that data quality, rather than lexical similarity, is key to robust transfer, and the choice of optimal adaptation strategy depends on the quality of data available: while fine-tuning yields the best cross-dataset performance with high-quality data, few-shot in-context learning (ICL) is more effective with noisier data. However, even in these cases, zero-shot baselines occasionally outperform all cross-dataset results. Structural issues in RE benchmarks, such as single-relation per sample constraints and non-standardised negative class definitions, further hinder model transferability.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Foundation models have shown remarkable success across scientific domains, yet their impact in chemistry remains limited due to the absence of diverse, large-scale, high-quality datasets that reflect the field's multifaceted nature. We present the ChemPile, an open dataset containing over 75 billion tokens of curated chemical data, specifically built for training and evaluating general-purpose models in the chemical sciences. The dataset mirrors the human learning journey through chemistry -- from educational foundations to specialized expertise -- spanning multiple modalities and content types including structured data in diverse chemical representations (SMILES, SELFIES, IUPAC names, InChI, molecular renderings), scientific and educational text, executable code, and chemical images. ChemPile integrates foundational knowledge (textbooks, lecture notes), specialized expertise (scientific articles and language-interfaced data), visual understanding (molecular structures, diagrams), and advanced reasoning (problem-solving traces and code) -- mirroring how human chemists develop expertise through diverse learning materials and experiences. Constructed through hundreds of hours of expert curation, the ChemPile captures both foundational concepts and domain-specific complexity. We provide standardized training, validation, and test splits, enabling robust benchmarking. ChemPile is openly released via HuggingFace with a consistent API, permissive license, and detailed documentation. We hope the ChemPile will serve as a catalyst for chemical AI, enabling the development of the next generation of chemical foundation models.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Alternators have recently been introduced as a framework for modeling time-dependent data. They often outperform other popular frameworks, such as state-space models and diffusion models, on challenging time-series tasks. This paper introduces a new Alternator model, called Alternator++, which enhances the flexibility of traditional Alternators by explicitly modeling the noise terms used to sample the latent and observed trajectories, drawing on the idea of noise models from the diffusion modeling literature. Alternator++ optimizes the sum of the Alternator loss and a noise-matching loss. The latter forces the noise trajectories generated by the two noise models to approximate the noise trajectories that produce the observed and latent trajectories. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Alternator++ in tasks such as density estimation, time series imputation, and forecasting, showing that it outperforms several strong baselines, including Mambas, ScoreGrad, and Dyffusion.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Plaintiffs and defendants in copyright lawsuits over generative AI often make sweeping, opposing claims about the extent to which large language models (LLMs) have memorized plaintiffs' protected expression. Drawing on adversarial ML and copyright law, we show that these polarized positions dramatically oversimplify the relationship between memorization and copyright. To do so, we leverage a recent probabilistic extraction technique to extract pieces of the Books3 dataset from 13 open-weight LLMs. Through numerous experiments, we show that it's possible to extract substantial parts of at least some books from different LLMs. This is evidence that the LLMs have memorized the extracted text; this memorized content is copied inside the model parameters. But the results are complicated: the extent of memorization varies both by model and by book. With our specific experiments, we find that the largest LLMs don't memorize most books -- either in whole or in part. However, we also find that Llama 3.1 70B memorizes some books, like Harry Potter and 1984, almost entirely. We discuss why our results have significant implications for copyright cases, though not ones that unambiguously favor either side.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>A key factor in effective Self-Supervised learning (SSL) is preventing dimensional collapse, which is where higher-dimensional representation spaces span a lower-dimensional subspace. Therefore, SSL optimization strategies involve guiding a model to produce representations ($R$) with a higher dimensionality. Dimensionality is either optimized through a dimension-contrastive approach that encourages feature decorrelation or through a sample-contrastive method that promotes a uniform spread of sample representations. Both families of SSL algorithms also utilize a projection head that maps $R$ into a lower-dimensional embedding space $Z$. Recent work has characterized the projection head as a filter of irrelevant features from the SSL objective by reducing mutual information, $I(R;Z)$. Therefore, the current literature's view is that a good SSL representation space should have a high $H(R)$ and a low $I(R;Z)$. However, this view of the problem is lacking in terms of an understanding of the underlying training dynamics that influences both terms, as well as how the values of $H(R)$ and $I(R;Z)$ arrived at the end of training reflect the downstream performance of an SSL model. We address both gaps in the literature by demonstrating that increases in $H(R)$ due to feature decorrelation at the start of training lead to a higher $I(R;Z)$, while increases in $H(R)$ due to samples distributing uniformly in a high-dimensional space at the end of training cause $I(R;Z)$ to plateau or decrease. Furthermore, our analysis shows that the best performing SSL models do not have the highest $H(R)$ nor the lowest $I(R;Z)$, but arrive at an optimal intermediate point for both. We develop a method called AdaDim to exploit these observed training dynamics by adaptively weighting between losses based on feature decorrelation and uniform sample spread.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Understanding surveillance video content remains a critical yet underexplored challenge in vision-language research, particularly due to its real-world complexity, irregular event dynamics, and safety-critical implications. In this work, we introduce SurveillanceVQA-589K, the largest open-ended video question answering benchmark tailored to the surveillance domain. The dataset comprises 589,380 QA pairs spanning 12 cognitively diverse question types, including temporal reasoning, causal inference, spatial understanding, and anomaly interpretation, across both normal and abnormal video scenarios. To construct the benchmark at scale, we design a hybrid annotation pipeline that combines temporally aligned human-written captions with Large Vision-Language Model-assisted QA generation using prompt-based techniques. We also propose a multi-dimensional evaluation protocol to assess contextual, temporal, and causal comprehension. We evaluate eight LVLMs under this framework, revealing significant performance gaps, especially in causal and anomaly-related tasks, underscoring the limitations of current models in real-world surveillance contexts. Our benchmark provides a practical and comprehensive resource for advancing video-language understanding in safety-critical applications such as intelligent monitoring, incident analysis, and autonomous decision-making.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Anomaly detection (AD) is essential in areas such as fraud detection, network monitoring, and scientific research. However, the diversity of data modalities and the increasing number of specialized AD libraries pose challenges for non-expert users who lack in-depth library-specific knowledge and advanced programming skills. To tackle this, we present AD-AGENT, an LLM-driven multi-agent framework that turns natural-language instructions into fully executable AD pipelines. AD-AGENT coordinates specialized agents for intent parsing, data preparation, library and model selection, documentation mining, and iterative code generation and debugging. Using a shared short-term workspace and a long-term cache, the agents integrate popular AD libraries like PyOD, PyGOD, and TSLib into a unified workflow. Experiments demonstrate that AD-AGENT produces reliable scripts and recommends competitive models across libraries. The system is open-sourced to support further research and practical applications in AD.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multi-modal object tracking integrates auxiliary modalities such as depth, thermal infrared, event flow, and language to provide additional information beyond RGB images, showing great potential in improving tracking stabilization in complex scenarios. Existing methods typically start from an RGB-based tracker and learn to understand auxiliary modalities only from training data. Constrained by the limited multi-modal training data, the performance of these methods is unsatisfactory. To alleviate this limitation, this work proposes a unified multi-modal tracker Diff-MM by exploiting the multi-modal understanding capability of the pre-trained text-to-image generation model. Diff-MM leverages the UNet of pre-trained Stable Diffusion as a tracking feature extractor through the proposed parallel feature extraction pipeline, which enables pairwise image inputs for object tracking. We further introduce a multi-modal sub-module tuning method that learns to gain complementary information between different modalities. By harnessing the extensive prior knowledge in the generation model, we achieve a unified tracker with uniform parameters for RGB-N/D/T/E tracking. Experimental results demonstrate the promising performance of our method compared with recently proposed trackers, e.g., its AUC outperforms OneTracker by 8.3% on TNL2K.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Advances in AI generative models facilitate super-realistic video synthesis, amplifying misinformation risks via social media and eroding trust in digital content. Several research works have explored new deepfake detection methods on AI-generated images to alleviate these risks. However, with the fast development of video generation models, such as Sora and WanX, there is currently a lack of large-scale, high-quality AI-generated video datasets for forgery detection. In addition, existing detection approaches predominantly treat the task as binary classification, lacking explainability in model decision-making and failing to provide actionable insights or guidance for the public. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{GenBuster-200K}, a large-scale AI-generated video dataset featuring 200K high-resolution video clips, diverse latest generative techniques, and real-world scenes. We further introduce \textbf{BusterX}, a novel AI-generated video detection and explanation framework leveraging multimodal large language model (MLLM) and reinforcement learning for authenticity determination and explainable rationale. To our knowledge, GenBuster-200K is the {\it \textbf{first}} large-scale, high-quality AI-generated video dataset that incorporates the latest generative techniques for real-world scenarios. BusterX is the {\it \textbf{first}} framework to integrate MLLM with reinforcement learning for explainable AI-generated video detection. Extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods and ablation studies validate the effectiveness and generalizability of BusterX. The code, models, and datasets will be released.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recently, significant advances have been made in 3D object generation. Building upon the generated geometry, current pipelines typically employ image diffusion models to generate multi-view RGB images, followed by UV texture reconstruction through texture baking. While 3D geometry generation has improved significantly, supported by multiple open-source frameworks, 3D texture generation remains underexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate 3D texture generation through the lens of three core dimensions: reference-texture alignment, geometry-texture consistency, and local texture quality. To tackle these issues, we propose MVPainter, which employs data filtering and augmentation strategies to enhance texture fidelity and detail, and introduces ControlNet-based geometric conditioning to improve texture-geometry alignment. Furthermore, we extract physically-based rendering (PBR) attributes from the generated views to produce PBR meshes suitable for real-world rendering applications. MVPainter achieves state-of-the-art results across all three dimensions, as demonstrated by human-aligned evaluations. To facilitate further research and reproducibility, we also release our full pipeline as an open-source system, including data construction, model architecture, and evaluation tools.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The explosive growth of generative video models has amplified the demand for reliable copyright preservation of AI-generated content. Despite its popularity in image synthesis, invisible generative watermarking remains largely underexplored in video generation. To address this gap, we propose Safe-Sora, the first framework to embed graphical watermarks directly into the video generation process. Motivated by the observation that watermarking performance is closely tied to the visual similarity between the watermark and cover content, we introduce a hierarchical coarse-to-fine adaptive matching mechanism. Specifically, the watermark image is divided into patches, each assigned to the most visually similar video frame, and further localized to the optimal spatial region for seamless embedding. To enable spatiotemporal fusion of watermark patches across video frames, we develop a 3D wavelet transform-enhanced Mamba architecture with a novel spatiotemporal local scanning strategy, effectively modeling long-range dependencies during watermark embedding and retrieval. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply state space models to watermarking, opening new avenues for efficient and robust watermark protection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Safe-Sora achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of video quality, watermark fidelity, and robustness, which is largely attributed to our proposals. We will release our code upon publication.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion distillation has emerged as a promising strategy for accelerating text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models by distilling a pretrained score network into a one- or few-step generator. While existing methods have made notable progress, they often rely on real or teacher-synthesized images to perform well when distilling high-resolution T2I diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL), and their use of classifier-free guidance (CFG) introduces a persistent trade-off between text-image alignment and generation diversity. We address these challenges by optimizing Score identity Distillation (SiD) -- a data-free, one-step distillation framework -- for few-step generation. Backed by theoretical analysis that justifies matching a uniform mixture of outputs from all generation steps to the data distribution, our few-step distillation algorithm avoids step-specific networks and integrates seamlessly into existing pipelines, achieving state-of-the-art performance on SDXL at 1024x1024 resolution. To mitigate the alignment-diversity trade-off when real text-image pairs are available, we introduce a Diffusion GAN-based adversarial loss applied to the uniform mixture and propose two new guidance strategies: Zero-CFG, which disables CFG in the teacher and removes text conditioning in the fake score network, and Anti-CFG, which applies negative CFG in the fake score network. This flexible setup improves diversity without sacrificing alignment. Comprehensive experiments on SD1.5 and SDXL demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in both one-step and few-step generation settings, along with robustness to the absence of real images. Our efficient PyTorch implementation, along with the resulting one- and few-step distilled generators, will be released publicly as a separate branch at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As Text-to-Image models continue to evolve, so does the risk of generating unsafe, copyrighted, or privacy-violating content. Existing safety interventions - ranging from training data curation and model fine-tuning to inference-time filtering and guidance - often suffer from incomplete concept removal, susceptibility to jail-breaking, computational inefficiency, or collateral damage to unrelated capabilities. In this paper, we introduce CURE, a training-free concept unlearning framework that operates directly in the weight space of pre-trained diffusion models, enabling fast, interpretable, and highly specific suppression of undesired concepts. At the core of our method is the Spectral Eraser, a closed-form, orthogonal projection module that identifies discriminative subspaces using Singular Value Decomposition over token embeddings associated with the concepts to forget and retain. Intuitively, the Spectral Eraser identifies and isolates features unique to the undesired concept while preserving safe attributes. This operator is then applied in a single step update to yield an edited model in which the target concept is effectively unlearned - without retraining, supervision, or iterative optimization. To balance the trade-off between filtering toxicity and preserving unrelated concepts, we further introduce an Expansion Mechanism for spectral regularization which selectively modulates singular vectors based on their relative significance to control the strength of forgetting. All the processes above are in closed-form, guaranteeing extremely efficient erasure in only $2$ seconds. Benchmarking against prior approaches, CURE achieves a more efficient and thorough removal for targeted artistic styles, objects, identities, or explicit content, with minor damage to original generation ability and demonstrates enhanced robustness against red-teaming.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in graph machine learning have shifted to data-centric paradigms, driven by two emerging fields: (1) Federated graph learning (FGL) enables multi-client collaboration but faces challenges from data and task heterogeneity, limiting its practicality; (2) Graph foundation models (GFM) offer strong domain generalization but are usually trained on single machines, missing out on cross-silo data and resources. These paradigms are complementary, and their integration brings notable benefits. Motivated by this, we propose FedGFM, a novel decentralized GFM training paradigm. However, a key challenge is knowledge entanglement, where multi-domain knowledge merges into indistinguishable representations, hindering downstream adaptation. To address this, we present FedGFM+, an enhanced framework with two core modules to reduce knowledge entanglement: (1) AncDAI: A global anchor-based domain-aware initialization strategy. Before pre-training, each client encodes its local graph into domain-specific prototypes that serve as semantic anchors. Synthetic embeddings around these anchors initialize the global model. We theoretically prove these prototypes are distinguishable across domains, providing a strong inductive bias to disentangle domain-specific knowledge. (2) AdaDPP: A local adaptive domain-sensitive prompt pool. Each client learns a lightweight graph prompt capturing domain semantics during pre-training. During fine-tuning, prompts from all clients form a pool from which the GFM selects relevant prompts to augment target graph attributes, improving downstream adaptation. FedGFM+ is evaluated on 8 diverse benchmarks across multiple domains and tasks, outperforming 20 baselines from supervised learning, FGL, and federated GFM variants.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Advances in deep generative modelling have made it increasingly plausible to train human-level embodied agents. Yet progress has been limited by the absence of large-scale, real-time, multi-modal, and socially interactive datasets that reflect the sensory-motor complexity of natural environments. To address this, we present PLAICraft, a novel data collection platform and dataset capturing multiplayer Minecraft interactions across five time-aligned modalities: video, game output audio, microphone input audio, mouse, and keyboard actions. Each modality is logged with millisecond time precision, enabling the study of synchronous, embodied behaviour in a rich, open-ended world. The dataset comprises over 10,000 hours of gameplay from more than 10,000 global participants.\footnote{We have done a privacy review for the public release of an initial 200-hour subset of the dataset, with plans to release most of the dataset over time.} Alongside the dataset, we provide an evaluation suite for benchmarking model capabilities in object recognition, spatial awareness, language grounding, and long-term memory. PLAICraft opens a path toward training and evaluating agents that act fluently and purposefully in real time, paving the way for truly embodied artificial intelligence.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vehicular metaverses are an emerging paradigm that merges intelligent transportation systems with virtual spaces, leveraging advanced digital twin and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies to seamlessly integrate vehicles, users, and digital environments. In this paradigm, vehicular AI agents are endowed with environment perception, decision-making, and action execution capabilities, enabling real-time processing and analysis of multi-modal data to provide users with customized interactive services. Since vehicular AI agents require substantial resources for real-time decision-making, given vehicle mobility and network dynamics conditions, the AI agents are deployed in RoadSide Units (RSUs) with sufficient resources and dynamically migrated among them. However, AI agent migration requires frequent data exchanges, which may expose vehicular metaverses to potential cyber attacks. To this end, we propose a reliable vehicular AI agent migration framework, achieving reliable dynamic migration and efficient resource scheduling through cooperation between vehicles and RSUs. Additionally, we design a trust evaluation model based on the theory of planned behavior to dynamically quantify the reputation of RSUs, thereby better accommodating the personalized trust preferences of users. We then model the vehicular AI agent migration process as a partially observable markov decision process and develop a Confidence-regulated Generative Diffusion Model (CGDM) to efficiently generate AI agent migration decisions. Numerical results demonstrate that the CGDM algorithm significantly outperforms baseline methods in reducing system latency and enhancing robustness against cyber attacks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) have transformed educational content creation, particularly in developing tutor training materials. However, biases embedded in AI-generated content--such as gender, racial, or national stereotypes--raise significant ethical and educational concerns. Despite the growing use of GenAI, systematic methods for detecting and evaluating such biases in educational materials remain limited. This study proposes an automated bias assessment approach that integrates the Contextualized Embedding Association Test with a prompt-engineered word extraction method within a Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework. We applied this method to AI-generated texts used in tutor training lessons. Results show a high alignment between the automated and manually curated word sets, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of r = 0.993, indicating reliable and consistent bias assessment. Our method reduces human subjectivity and enhances fairness, scalability, and reproducibility in auditing GenAI-produced educational content.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Advanced epidemic forecasting is critical for enabling precision containment strategies, highlighting its strategic importance for public health security. While recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated effectiveness as foundation models for domain-specific tasks, their potential for epidemic forecasting remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce EpiLLM, a novel LLM-based framework tailored for spatio-temporal epidemic forecasting. Considering the key factors in real-world epidemic transmission: infection cases and human mobility, we introduce a dual-branch architecture to achieve fine-grained token-level alignment between such complex epidemic patterns and language tokens for LLM adaptation. To unleash the multi-step forecasting and generalization potential of LLM architectures, we propose an autoregressive modeling paradigm that reformulates the epidemic forecasting task into next-token prediction. To further enhance LLM perception of epidemics, we introduce spatio-temporal prompt learning techniques, which strengthen forecasting capabilities from a data-driven perspective. Extensive experiments show that EpiLLM significantly outperforms existing baselines on real-world COVID-19 datasets and exhibits scaling behavior characteristic of LLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Anomaly detection is a fundamental problem in domains such as healthcare, manufacturing, and cybersecurity. This thesis proposes new unsupervised methods for anomaly detection in both structured and streaming data settings. In the first part, we focus on structure-based anomaly detection, where normal data follows low-dimensional manifolds while anomalies deviate from them. We introduce Preference Isolation Forest (PIF), which embeds data into a high-dimensional preference space via manifold fitting, and isolates outliers using two variants: Voronoi-iForest, based on geometric distances, and RuzHash-iForest, leveraging Locality Sensitive Hashing for scalability. We also propose Sliding-PIF, which captures local manifold information for streaming scenarios. Our methods outperform existing techniques on synthetic and real datasets. We extend this to structure-based clustering with MultiLink, a novel method for recovering multiple geometric model families in noisy data. MultiLink merges clusters via a model-aware linkage strategy, enabling robust multi-class structure recovery. It offers key advantages over existing approaches, such as speed, reduced sensitivity to thresholds, and improved robustness to poor initial sampling. The second part of the thesis addresses online anomaly detection in evolving data streams. We propose Online Isolation Forest (Online-iForest), which uses adaptive, multi-resolution histograms and dynamically updates tree structures to track changes over time. It avoids retraining while achieving accuracy comparable to offline models, with superior efficiency for real-time applications. Finally, we tackle anomaly detection in cybersecurity via open-set recognition for malware classification. We enhance a Gradient Boosting classifier with MaxLogit to detect unseen malware families, a method now integrated into Cleafy's production system.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Open set recognition (OSR) is devised to address the problem of detecting novel classes during model inference. Even in recent vision models, this remains an open issue which is receiving increasing attention. Thereby, a crucial challenge is to learn features that are relevant for unseen categories from given data, for which these features might not be discriminative. To facilitate this process and "optimize to learn" more diverse features, we propose GradMix, a data augmentation method that dynamically leverages gradient-based attribution maps of the model during training to mask out already learned concepts. Thus GradMix encourages the model to learn a more complete set of representative features from the same data source. Extensive experiments on open set recognition, close set classification, and out-of-distribution detection reveal that our method can often outperform the state-of-the-art. GradMix can further increase model robustness to corruptions as well as downstream classification performance for self-supervised learning, indicating its benefit for model generalization.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Isolation Forest (iForest) stands out as a widely-used unsupervised anomaly detector valued for its exceptional runtime efficiency and performance on large-scale tasks. Despite its widespread adoption, a theoretical foundation explaining iForest's success remains unclear. This paper theoretically investigates the conditions and extent of iForest's effectiveness by analyzing its inductive bias through the formulation of depth functions and growth processes. Since directly analyzing the depth function proves intractable due to iForest's random splitting mechanism, we model the growth process of iForest as a random walk, enabling us to derive the expected depth function using transition probabilities. Our case studies reveal key inductive biases: iForest exhibits lower sensitivity to central anomalies while demonstrating greater parameter adaptability compared to $k$-Nearest Neighbor anomaly detectors. Our study provides theoretical understanding of the effectiveness of iForest and establishes a foundation for further theoretical exploration.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Handwritten fonts have a distinct expressive character, but they are often difficult to read due to unclear or inconsistent handwriting. FontFusionGAN (FFGAN) is a novel method for improving handwritten fonts by combining them with printed fonts. Our method implements generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate font that mix the desirable features of handwritten and printed fonts. By training the GAN on a dataset of handwritten and printed fonts, it can generate legible and visually appealing font images. We apply our method to a dataset of handwritten fonts and demonstrate that it significantly enhances the readability of the original fonts while preserving their unique aesthetic. Our method has the potential to improve the readability of handwritten fonts, which would be helpful for a variety of applications including document creation, letter writing, and assisting individuals with reading and writing difficulties. In addition to addressing the difficulties of font creation for languages with complex character sets, our method is applicable to other text-image-related tasks, such as font attribute control and multilingual font style transfer.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Data Assimilation (DA) plays a critical role in atmospheric science by reconstructing spatially continous estimates of the system state, which serves as initial conditions for scientific analysis. While recent advances in diffusion models have shown great potential for DA tasks, most existing approaches remain purely data-driven and often overlook the physical laws that govern complex atmospheric dynamics. As a result, they may yield physically inconsistent reconstructions that impair downstream applications. To overcome this limitation, we propose PhyDA, a physics-guided diffusion framework designed to ensure physical coherence in atmospheric data assimilation. PhyDA introduces two key components: (1) a Physically Regularized Diffusion Objective that integrates physical constraints into the training process by penalizing deviations from known physical laws expressed as partial differential equations, and (2) a Virtual Reconstruction Encoder that bridges observational sparsity for structured latent representations, further enhancing the model's ability to infer complete and physically coherent states. Experiments on the ERA5 reanalysis dataset demonstrate that PhyDA achieves superior accuracy and better physical plausibility compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Our results emphasize the importance of combining generative modeling with domain-specific physical knowledge and show that PhyDA offers a promising direction for improving real-world data assimilation systems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The real-world complexity of surgeries necessitates surgeons to have deep and holistic comprehension to ensure precision, safety, and effective interventions. Computational systems are required to have a similar level of comprehension within the operating room. Prior works, limited to single-task efforts like phase recognition or scene graph generation, lack scope and generalizability. In this work, we introduce ORQA, a novel OR question answering benchmark and foundational multimodal model to advance OR intelligence. By unifying all four public OR datasets into a comprehensive benchmark, we enable our approach to concurrently address a diverse range of OR challenges. The proposed multimodal large language model fuses diverse OR signals such as visual, auditory, and structured data, for a holistic modeling of the OR. Finally, we propose a novel, progressive knowledge distillation paradigm, to generate a family of models optimized for different speed and memory requirements. We show the strong performance of ORQA on our proposed benchmark, and its zero-shot generalization, paving the way for scalable, unified OR modeling and significantly advancing multimodal surgical intelligence. We will release our code and data upon acceptance.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Exhaustive virtual screening is highly informative but often intractable against the expensive objective functions involved in modern drug discovery. This problem is exacerbated in combinatorial contexts such as multi-vector expansion, where molecular spaces can quickly become ultra-large. Here, we introduce Scalable Active Learning via Synthon Acquisition (SALSA): a simple algorithm applicable to multi-vector expansion which extends pool-based active learning to non-enumerable spaces by factoring modeling and acquisition over synthon or fragment choices. Through experiments on ligand- and structure-based objectives, we highlight SALSA's sample efficiency, and its ability to scale to spaces of trillions of compounds. Further, we demonstrate application toward multi-parameter objective design tasks on three protein targets - finding SALSA-generated molecules have comparable chemical property profiles to known bioactives, and exhibit greater diversity and higher scores over an industry-leading generative approach.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>There is a growing interest in the use of latent diffusion models (LDMs) for image restoration (IR) tasks due to their ability to model effectively the distribution of natural images. While significant progress has been made, there are still key challenges that need to be addressed. First, many approaches depend on a predefined degradation operator, making them ill-suited for complex or unknown degradations that deviate from standard analytical models. Second, many methods struggle to provide a stable guidance in the latent space and finally most methods convert latent representations back to the pixel domain for guidance at every sampling iteration, which significantly increases computational and memory overhead. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a wavelet-inspired invertible neural network (INN) that simulates degradations through a forward transform and reconstructs lost details via the inverse transform. We further integrate this design into a latent diffusion pipeline through two proposed approaches: LatentINDIGO-PixelINN, which operates in the pixel domain, and LatentINDIGO-LatentINN, which stays fully in the latent space to reduce complexity. Both approaches alternate between updating intermediate latent variables under the guidance of our INN and refining the INN forward model to handle unknown degradations. In addition, a regularization step preserves the proximity of latent variables to the natural image manifold. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and real-world low-quality images, and can be readily adapted to arbitrary output sizes.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Legal Passage Retrieval (LPR) systems are crucial as they help practitioners save time when drafting legal arguments. However, it remains an underexplored avenue. One primary reason is the significant vocabulary mismatch between the query and the target passage. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective method, the Generative query REwriter (GuRE). We leverage the generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by training the LLM for query rewriting. "Rewritten queries" help retrievers to retrieve target passages by mitigating vocabulary mismatch. Experimental results show that GuRE significantly improves performance in a retriever-agnostic manner, outperforming all baseline methods. Further analysis reveals that different training objectives lead to distinct retrieval behaviors, making GuRE more suitable than direct retriever fine-tuning for real-world applications.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recognizing biomedical concepts in the text is vital for ontology refinement, knowledge graph construction, and concept relationship discovery. However, traditional concept recognition methods, relying on explicit mention identification, often fail to capture complex concepts not explicitly stated in the text. To overcome this limitation, we introduce MA-COIR, a framework that reformulates concept recognition as an indexing-recognition task. By assigning semantic search indexes (ssIDs) to concepts, MA-COIR resolves ambiguities in ontology entries and enhances recognition efficiency. Using a pretrained BART-based model fine-tuned on small datasets, our approach reduces computational requirements to facilitate adoption by domain experts. Furthermore, we incorporate large language models (LLMs)-generated queries and synthetic data to improve recognition in low-resource settings. Experimental results on three scenarios (CDR, HPO, and HOIP) highlight the effectiveness of MA-COIR in recognizing both explicit and implicit concepts without the need for mention-level annotations during inference, advancing ontology-driven concept recognition in biomedical domain applications.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep generative models are promising tools for science and engineering, but their reliance on abundant, high-quality data limits applicability. We present a novel framework for generative modeling of random fields (probability distributions over continuous functions) that incorporates domain knowledge to supplement limited, sparse, and indirect data. The foundation of the approach is latent flow matching, where generative modeling occurs on compressed function representations in the latent space of a pre-trained variational autoencoder (VAE). Innovations include the adoption of a function decoder within the VAE and integration of physical/statistical constraints into the VAE training process. In this way, a latent function representation is learned that yields continuous random field samples satisfying domain-specific constraints when decoded, even in data-limited regimes. Efficacy is demonstrated on two challenging applications: wind velocity field reconstruction from sparse sensors and material property inference from a limited number of indirect measurements. Results show that the proposed framework achieves significant improvements in reconstruction accuracy compared to unconstrained methods and enables effective inference with relatively small training datasets that is intractable without constraints.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As diffusion-based malicious image manipulation becomes increasingly prevalent, multiple proactive defense methods are developed to safeguard images against unauthorized tampering. However, most proactive defense methods only can safeguard images against manipulation under known conditions, and fail to protect images from manipulations guided by tampering conditions crafted by malicious users. To tackle this issue, we propose Anti-Inpainting, a proactive defense method that achieves adequate protection under unknown conditions through a triple mechanism to address this challenge. Specifically, a multi-level deep feature extractor is presented to obtain intricate features during the diffusion denoising process to improve protective effectiveness. We design multi-scale semantic-preserving data augmentation to enhance the transferability of adversarial perturbations across unknown conditions by multi-scale transformations while preserving semantic integrity. In addition, we propose a selection-based distribution deviation optimization strategy to improve the protection of adversarial perturbation against manipulation under diverse random seeds. Extensive experiments indicate the proactive defensive performance of Anti-Inpainting against diffusion-based inpainters guided by unknown conditions in InpaintGuardBench and CelebA-HQ. At the same time, we also demonstrate the proposed approach's robustness under various image purification methods and its transferability across different versions of diffusion models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rise of time-series pre-trained models has advanced temporal representation learning, but current state-of-the-art models are often large-scale, requiring substantial compute. We introduce TSPulse, ultra-compact time-series pre-trained models with only 1M parameters, specialized to perform strongly across classification, anomaly detection, imputation, and retrieval tasks. TSPulse introduces innovations at both the architecture and task levels. At the architecture level, it employs a dual-space masked reconstruction, learning from both time and frequency domains to capture complementary signals. This is further enhanced by a dual-embedding disentanglement, generating both detailed embeddings for fine-grained analysis and high-level semantic embeddings for broader task understanding. Notably, TSPulse's semantic embeddings are robust to shifts in time, magnitude, and noise, which is important for robust retrieval. At the task level, TSPulse incorporates TSLens, a fine-tuning component enabling task-specific feature attention. It also introduces a multi-head triangulation technique that correlates deviations from multiple prediction heads, enhancing anomaly detection by fusing complementary model outputs. Additionally, a hybrid mask pretraining is proposed to improves zero-shot imputation by reducing pre-training bias. These architecture and task innovations collectively contribute to TSPulse's significant performance gains: 5-16% on the UEA classification benchmarks, +20% on the TSB-AD anomaly detection leaderboard, +50% in zero-shot imputation, and +25% in time-series retrieval. Remarkably, these results are achieved with just 1M parameters, making TSPulse 10-100X smaller than existing pre-trained models. Its efficiency enables GPU-free inference and rapid pre-training, setting a new standard for efficient time-series pre-trained models. Models will be open-sourced soon.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Polarization images provide rich physical information that is fundamentally absent from standard RGB images, benefiting a wide range of computer vision applications such as reflection separation and material classification. However, the acquisition of polarization images typically requires additional optical components, which increases both the cost and the complexity of the applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new task: RGB-to-polarization image estimation, which aims to infer polarization information directly from RGB images. In this work, we establish the first comprehensive benchmark for this task by leveraging existing polarization datasets and evaluating a diverse set of state-of-the-art deep learning models, including both restoration-oriented and generative architectures. Through extensive quantitative and qualitative analysis, our benchmark not only establishes the current performance ceiling of RGB-to-polarization estimation, but also systematically reveals the respective strengths and limitations of different model families -- such as direct reconstruction versus generative synthesis, and task-specific training versus large-scale pre-training. In addition, we provide some potential directions for future research on polarization estimation. This benchmark is intended to serve as a foundational resource to facilitate the design and evaluation of future methods for polarization estimation from standard RGB inputs.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose a novel benchmarking methodology for graph neural networks (GNNs) based on the graph alignment problem, a combinatorial optimization task that generalizes graph isomorphism by aligning two unlabeled graphs to maximize overlapping edges. We frame this problem as a self-supervised learning task and present several methods to generate graph alignment datasets using synthetic random graphs and real-world graph datasets from multiple domains. For a given graph dataset, we generate a family of graph alignment datasets with increasing difficulty, allowing us to rank the performance of various architectures. Our experiments indicate that anisotropic graph neural networks outperform standard convolutional architectures. To further demonstrate the utility of the graph alignment task, we show its effectiveness for unsupervised GNN pre-training, where the learned node embeddings outperform other positional encodings on three molecular regression tasks and achieve state-of-the-art results on the PCQM4Mv2 dataset with significantly fewer parameters. To support reproducibility and further research, we provide an open-source Python package to generate graph alignment datasets and benchmark new GNN architectures.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models have made breakthroughs in 3D generation tasks. Current 3D diffusion models focus on reconstructing target shape from images or a set of partial observations. While excelling in global context understanding, they struggle to capture the local details of complex shapes and limited to the occlusion and lighting conditions. To overcome these limitations, we utilize tactile images to capture the local 3D information and propose a Touch2Shape model, which leverages a touch-conditioned diffusion model to explore and reconstruct the target shape from touch. For shape reconstruction, we have developed a touch embedding module to condition the diffusion model in creating a compact representation and a touch shape fusion module to refine the reconstructed shape. For shape exploration, we combine the diffusion model with reinforcement learning to train a policy. This involves using the generated latent vector from the diffusion model to guide the touch exploration policy training through a novel reward design. Experiments validate the reconstruction quality thorough both qualitatively and quantitative analysis, and our touch exploration policy further boosts reconstruction performance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Pre-training on real-image datasets has been widely proven effective for improving instance segmentation. However, industrial applications face two key challenges: (1) legal and ethical restrictions, such as ImageNet's prohibition of commercial use, and (2) limited transferability due to the domain gap between web images and industrial imagery. Even recent vision foundation models, including the segment anything model (SAM), show notable performance degradation in industrial settings. These challenges raise critical questions: Can we build a vision foundation model for industrial applications without relying on real images or manual annotations? And can such models outperform even fine-tuned SAM on industrial datasets? To address these questions, we propose the Instance Core Segmentation Dataset (InsCore), a synthetic pre-training dataset based on formula-driven supervised learning (FDSL). InsCore generates fully annotated instance segmentation images that reflect key characteristics of industrial data, including complex occlusions, dense hierarchical masks, and diverse non-rigid shapes, distinct from typical web imagery. Unlike previous methods, InsCore requires neither real images nor human annotations. Experiments on five industrial datasets show that models pre-trained with InsCore outperform those trained on COCO and ImageNet-21k, as well as fine-tuned SAM, achieving an average improvement of 6.2 points in instance segmentation performance. This result is achieved using only 100k synthetic images, more than 100 times fewer than the 11 million images in SAM's SA-1B dataset, demonstrating the data efficiency of our approach. These findings position InsCore as a practical and license-free vision foundation model for industrial applications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Knowledge distillation (KD) is a core component in the training and deployment of modern generative models, particularly large language models (LLMs). While its empirical benefits are well documented--enabling smaller student models to emulate the performance of much larger teachers--the underlying mechanisms by which KD improves generative quality remain poorly understood. In this work, we present a minimal working explanation of KD in generative modeling. Using a controlled simulation with mixtures of Gaussians, we demonstrate that distillation induces a trade-off between precision and recall in the student model. As the teacher distribution becomes more selective, the student concentrates more probability mass on high-likelihood regions at the expense of coverage--a behavior modulated by a single entropy-controlling parameter. We then validate this effect in a large-scale language modeling setup using the SmolLM2 family of models. Empirical results reveal the same precision-recall dynamics observed in simulation, where precision corresponds to sample quality and recall to distributional coverage. This precision-recall trade-off proves especially beneficial in scenarios where sample quality outweighs diversity, such as instruction tuning or downstream generation. Our analysis provides a simple and general explanation for the effectiveness of KD in generative modeling.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Weakly-supervised methods for video anomaly detection (VAD) are conventionally based merely on RGB spatio-temporal features, which continues to limit their reliability in real-world scenarios. This is due to the fact that RGB-features are not sufficiently distinctive in setting apart categories such as shoplifting from visually similar events. Therefore, towards robust complex real-world VAD, it is essential to augment RGB spatio-temporal features by additional modalities. Motivated by this, we introduce the Poly-modal Induced framework for VAD: "PI-VAD", a novel approach that augments RGB representations by five additional modalities. Specifically, the modalities include sensitivity to fine-grained motion (Pose), three dimensional scene and entity representation (Depth), surrounding objects (Panoptic masks), global motion (optical flow), as well as language cues (VLM). Each modality represents an axis of a polygon, streamlined to add salient cues to RGB. PI-VAD includes two plug-in modules, namely Pseudo-modality Generation module and Cross Modal Induction module, which generate modality-specific prototypical representation and, thereby, induce multi-modal information into RGB cues. These modules operate by performing anomaly-aware auxiliary tasks and necessitate five modality backbones -- only during training. Notably, PI-VAD achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on three prominent VAD datasets encompassing real-world scenarios, without requiring the computational overhead of five modality backbones at inference.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Neurosymbolic (NeSy) predictors combine neural perception with symbolic reasoning to solve tasks like visual reasoning. However, standard NeSy predictors assume conditional independence between the symbols they extract, thus limiting their ability to model interactions and uncertainty - often leading to overconfident predictions and poor out-of-distribution generalisation. To overcome the limitations of the independence assumption, we introduce neurosymbolic diffusion models (NeSyDMs), a new class of NeSy predictors that use discrete diffusion to model dependencies between symbols. Our approach reuses the independence assumption from NeSy predictors at each step of the diffusion process, enabling scalable learning while capturing symbol dependencies and uncertainty quantification. Across both synthetic and real-world benchmarks - including high-dimensional visual path planning and rule-based autonomous driving - NeSyDMs achieve state-of-the-art accuracy among NeSy predictors and demonstrate strong calibration.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Many density estimation techniques for 3D human motion prediction require a significant amount of inference time, often exceeding the duration of the predicted time horizon. To address the need for faster density estimation for 3D human motion prediction, we introduce a novel flow-based method for human motion prediction called CacheFlow. Unlike previous conditional generative models that suffer from time efficiency, CacheFlow takes advantage of an unconditional flow-based generative model that transforms a Gaussian mixture into the density of future motions. The results of the computation of the flow-based generative model can be precomputed and cached. Then, for conditional prediction, we seek a mapping from historical trajectories to samples in the Gaussian mixture. This mapping can be done by a much more lightweight model, thus saving significant computation overhead compared to a typical conditional flow model. In such a two-stage fashion and by caching results from the slow flow model computation, we build our CacheFlow without loss of prediction accuracy and model expressiveness. This inference process is completed in approximately one millisecond, making it 4 times faster than previous VAE methods and 30 times faster than previous diffusion-based methods on standard benchmarks such as Human3.6M and AMASS datasets. Furthermore, our method demonstrates improved density estimation accuracy and comparable prediction accuracy to a SOTA method on Human3.6M. Our code and models will be publicly available.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The goal of offline reinforcement learning (RL) is to extract a high-performance policy from the fixed datasets, minimizing performance degradation due to out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. Offline model-based RL (MBRL) is a promising approach that ameliorates OOD issues by enriching state-action transitions with augmentations synthesized via a learned dynamics model. Unfortunately, seminal offline MBRL methods often struggle in sparse-reward, long-horizon tasks. In this work, we introduce a novel MBRL framework, dubbed Temporal Distance-Aware Transition Augmentation (TempDATA), that generates augmented transitions in a temporally structured latent space rather than in raw state space. To model long-horizon behavior, TempDATA learns a latent abstraction that captures a temporal distance from both trajectory and transition levels of state space. Our experiments confirm that TempDATA outperforms previous offline MBRL methods and achieves matching or surpassing the performance of diffusion-based trajectory augmentation and goal-conditioned RL on the D4RL AntMaze, FrankaKitchen, CALVIN, and pixel-based FrankaKitchen.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Behavioral Foundation Models (BFMs) proved successful in producing policies for arbitrary tasks in a zero-shot manner, requiring no test-time training or task-specific fine-tuning. Among the most promising BFMs are the ones that estimate the successor measure learned in an unsupervised way from task-agnostic offline data. However, these methods fail to react to changes in the dynamics, making them inefficient under partial observability or when the transition function changes. This hinders the applicability of BFMs in a real-world setting, e.g., in robotics, where the dynamics can unexpectedly change at test time. In this work, we demonstrate that Forward-Backward (FB) representation, one of the methods from the BFM family, cannot distinguish between distinct dynamics, leading to an interference among the latent directions, which parametrize different policies. To address this, we propose a FB model with a transformer-based belief estimator, which greatly facilitates zero-shot adaptation. We also show that partitioning the policy encoding space into dynamics-specific clusters, aligned with the context-embedding directions, yields additional gain in performance. These traits allow our method to respond to the dynamics observed during training and to generalize to unseen ones. Empirically, in the changing dynamics setting, our approach achieves up to a 2x higher zero-shot returns compared to the baselines for both discrete and continuous tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model, generative, in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Complex, temporally evolving phenomena, from climate to brain activity, are governed by dynamical systems (DS). DS reconstruction (DSR) seeks to infer generative surrogate models of these from observed data, reproducing their long-term behavior. Existing DSR approaches require purpose-training for any new system observed, lacking the zero-shot and in-context inference capabilities known from LLMs. Here we introduce DynaMix, a novel multivariate ALRNN-based mixture-of-experts architecture pre-trained for DSR, the first DSR model able to generalize zero-shot to out-of-domain DS. Just from a provided context signal, without any re-training, DynaMix faithfully forecasts the long-term evolution of novel DS where existing time series (TS) foundation models, like Chronos, fail -- at a fraction of the number of parameters and orders of magnitude faster inference times. DynaMix outperforms TS foundation models in terms of long-term statistics, and often also short-term forecasts, even on real-world time series, like traffic or weather data, typically used for training and evaluating TS models, but not at all part of DynaMix' training corpus. We illustrate some of the failure modes of TS models for DSR problems, and conclude that models built on DS principles may bear a huge potential also for advancing the TS prediction field.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce Velocity-Regularized Adam (VRAdam), a physics-inspired optimizer for training deep neural networks that draws on ideas from quartic terms for kinetic energy with its stabilizing effects on various system dynamics. Previous algorithms, including the ubiquitous Adam, operate at the so called adaptive edge of stability regime during training leading to rapid oscillations and slowed convergence of loss. However, VRAdam adds a higher order penalty on the learning rate based on the velocity such that the algorithm automatically slows down whenever weight updates become large. In practice, we observe that the effective dynamic learning rate shrinks in high-velocity regimes, damping oscillations and allowing for a more aggressive base step size when necessary without divergence. By combining this velocity-based regularizer for global damping with per-parameter scaling of Adam to create a hybrid optimizer, we demonstrate that VRAdam consistently exceeds the performance against standard optimizers including AdamW. We benchmark various tasks such as image classification, language modeling, image generation and generative modeling using diverse architectures and training methodologies including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Transformers, and GFlowNets.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) achieve remarkable performance within the domain of image generation through the incorporation of the transformer architecture. Conventionally, DiTs are constructed by stacking serial isotropic global information modeling transformers, which face significant computational cost when processing high-resolution images. We empirically analyze that latent space image generation does not exhibit a strong dependence on global information as traditionally assumed. Most of the layers in the model demonstrate redundancy in global computation. In addition, conventional attention mechanisms exhibit low-frequency inertia issues. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{P}seudo \textbf{S}hifted \textbf{W}indow \textbf{A}ttention (PSWA), which fundamentally mitigates global model redundancy. PSWA achieves intermediate global-local information interaction through window attention, while employing a high-frequency bridging branch to simulate shifted window operations, supplementing appropriate global and high-frequency information. Furthermore, we propose the Progressive Coverage Channel Allocation(PCCA) strategy that captures high-order attention similarity without additional computational cost. Building upon all of them, we propose a series of Pseudo \textbf{S}hifted \textbf{Win}dow DiTs (\textbf{Swin DiT}), accompanied by extensive experiments demonstrating their superior performance. For example, our proposed Swin-DiT-L achieves a 54%$\uparrow$ FID improvement over DiT-XL/2 while requiring less computational. this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the rapid advancement of global digitalization, users from different countries increasingly rely on social media for information exchange. In this context, multilingual multi-label emotion detection has emerged as a critical research area. This study addresses SemEval-2025 Task 11: Bridging the Gap in Text-Based Emotion Detection. Our paper focuses on two sub-tracks of this task: (1) Track A: Multi-label emotion detection, and (2) Track B: Emotion intensity. To tackle multilingual challenges, we leverage pre-trained multilingual models and focus on two architectures: (1) a fine-tuned BERT-based classification model and (2) an instruction-tuned generative LLM. Additionally, we propose two methods for handling multi-label classification: the base method, which maps an input directly to all its corresponding emotion labels, and the pairwise method, which models the relationship between the input text and each emotion category individually. Experimental results demonstrate the strong generalization ability of our approach in multilingual emotion recognition. In Track A, our method achieved Top 4 performance across 10 languages, ranking 1st in Hindi. In Track B, our approach also secured Top 5 performance in 7 languages, highlighting its simplicity and effectiveness\footnote{Our code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vocal feedback (e.g., `mhm', `yeah', `okay') is an important component of spoken dialogue and is crucial to ensuring common ground in conversational systems. The exact meaning of such feedback is conveyed through both lexical and prosodic form. In this work, we investigate the perceived prosodic similarity of vocal feedback with the same lexical form, and to what extent existing speech representations reflect such similarities. A triadic comparison task with recruited participants is used to measure perceived similarity of feedback responses taken from two different datasets. We find that spectral and self-supervised speech representations encode prosody better than extracted pitch features, especially in the case of feedback from the same speaker. We also find that it is possible to further condense and align the representations to human perception through contrastive learning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Despite significant advancements in the area, adversarial robustness remains a critical challenge in systems employing machine learning models. The removal of adversarial perturbations at inference time, known as adversarial purification, has emerged as a promising defense strategy. To achieve this, state-of-the-art methods leverage diffusion models that inject Gaussian noise during a forward process to dilute adversarial perturbations, followed by a denoising step to restore clean samples before classification. In this work, we propose FlowPure, a novel purification method based on Continuous Normalizing Flows (CNFs) trained with Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) to learn mappings from adversarial examples to their clean counterparts. Unlike prior diffusion-based approaches that rely on fixed noise processes, FlowPure can leverage specific attack knowledge to improve robustness under known threats, while also supporting a more general stochastic variant trained on Gaussian perturbations for settings where such knowledge is unavailable. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art purification-based defenses in preprocessor-blind and white-box scenarios, and can do so while fully preserving benign accuracy in the former. Moreover, our results show that not only is FlowPure a highly effective purifier but it also holds a strong potential for adversarial detection, identifying preprocessor-blind PGD samples with near-perfect accuracy.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Taxonomies are hierarchical knowledge graphs crucial for recommendation systems, and web applications. As data grows, expanding taxonomies is essential, but existing methods face key challenges: (1) discriminative models struggle with representation limits and generalization, while (2) generative methods either process all candidates at once, introducing noise and exceeding context limits, or discard relevant entities by selecting noisy candidates. We propose LORex ($\textbf{L}$ineage-$\textbf{O}$riented $\textbf{Re}$asoning for Taxonomy E$\textbf{x}$pansion), a plug-and-play framework that combines discriminative ranking and generative reasoning for efficient taxonomy expansion. Unlike prior methods, LORex ranks and chunks candidate terms into batches, filtering noise and iteratively refining selections by reasoning candidates' hierarchy to ensure contextual efficiency. Extensive experiments across four benchmarks and twelve baselines show that LORex improves accuracy by 12% and Wu & Palmer similarity by 5% over state-of-the-art methods.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Efficient compression of low-bit-rate point clouds is critical for bandwidth-constrained applications. However, existing techniques mainly focus on high-fidelity reconstruction, requiring many bits for compression. This paper proposes a "Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model" (DDPM) architecture for point cloud compression (DDPM-PCC) at low bit-rates. A PointNet encoder produces the condition vector for the generation, which is then quantized via a learnable vector quantizer. This configuration allows to achieve a low bitrates while preserving quality. Experiments on ShapeNet and ModelNet40 show improved rate-distortion at low rates compared to standardized and state-of-the-art approaches. We publicly released the code at this https URL.</li>

We first extract dense optical flow from a reference video, and utilize the resulting motion offsets to warp the complex-exponential tensors of RoPE, effectively encoding motion into the generation process. These embeddings are then further optimized during denoising time steps via trajectory alignment between the predicted and target velocities using a flow-matching objective. To keep the output faithful to the text prompt and prevent duplicate generations, we incorporate a regularization term based on the phase components of the reference video's Fourier transform, projecting the phase angles onto a smooth manifold to suppress high-frequency artifacts. Experiments on benchmarks reveal that RoPECraft outperforms all recently published methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>To keep pace with the increasing pace of large language models (LLM) development, model output evaluation has transitioned away from time-consuming human evaluation to automatic evaluation, where LLMs themselves are tasked with assessing and critiquing other model outputs. LLM-as-judge models are a class of generative evaluators that excel in evaluating relatively simple domains, like chat quality, but struggle in reasoning intensive domains where model responses contain more substantive and challenging content. To remedy existing judge shortcomings, we explore training judges with reinforcement learning (RL). We make three key contributions: (1) We propose the Equivalent Initial State Group Relative Policy Optimization (EIS-GRPO) algorithm, which allows us to train our judge to be robust to positional biases that arise in more complex evaluation settings. (2) We introduce ReasoningJudgeBench, a benchmark that evaluates judges in diverse reasoning settings not covered by prior work. (3) We train Judge for Reasoning (J4R), a 7B judge trained with EIS-GRPO that outperforms GPT-4o and the next best small judge by 6.7% and 9%, matching or exceeding the performance of larger GRPO-trained judges on both JudgeBench and ReasoningJudgeBench.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Although modern Large Language Models (LLMs) support extremely large contexts, their effectiveness in utilizing long context for code reasoning remains unclear. This paper investigates LLM reasoning ability over code snippets within large repositories and how it relates to their recall ability. Specifically, we differentiate between lexical code recall (verbatim retrieval) and semantic code recall (remembering what the code does). To measure semantic recall, we propose SemTrace, a code reasoning technique where the impact of specific statements on output is attributable and unpredictable. We also present a method to quantify semantic recall sensitivity in existing benchmarks. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs reveals a significant drop in code reasoning accuracy as a code snippet approaches the middle of the input context, particularly with techniques requiring high semantic recall like SemTrace. Moreover, we find that lexical recall varies by granularity, with models excelling at function retrieval but struggling with line-by-line recall. Notably, a disconnect exists between lexical and semantic recall, suggesting different underlying mechanisms. Finally, our findings indicate that current code reasoning benchmarks may exhibit low semantic recall sensitivity, potentially underestimating LLM challenges in leveraging in-context information.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion-based generative models have demonstrated exceptional performance, yet their iterative sampling procedures remain computationally expensive. A prominent strategy to mitigate this cost is distillation, with offline distillation offering particular advantages in terms of efficiency, modularity, and flexibility. In this work, we identify two key observations that motivate a principled distillation framework: (1) while diffusion models have been viewed through the lens of dynamical systems theory, powerful and underexplored tools can be further leveraged; and (2) diffusion models inherently impose structured, semantically coherent trajectories in latent space. Building on these observations, we introduce the Koopman Distillation Model KDM, a novel offline distillation approach grounded in Koopman theory-a classical framework for representing nonlinear dynamics linearly in a transformed space. KDM encodes noisy inputs into an embedded space where a learned linear operator propagates them forward, followed by a decoder that reconstructs clean samples. This enables single-step generation while preserving semantic fidelity. We provide theoretical justification for our approach: (1) under mild assumptions, the learned diffusion dynamics admit a finite-dimensional Koopman representation; and (2) proximity in the Koopman latent space correlates with semantic similarity in the generated outputs, allowing for effective trajectory alignment. Empirically, KDM achieves state-of-the-art performance across standard offline distillation benchmarks, improving FID scores by up to 40% in a single generation step.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Learning generative models from corrupted data is a fundamental yet persistently challenging task across scientific disciplines, particularly when access to clean data is limited or expensive. Denoising Score Distillation (DSD) \cite{chen2025denoising} recently introduced a novel and surprisingly effective strategy that leverages score distillation to train high-fidelity generative models directly from noisy observations. Building upon this foundation, we propose \textit{Restoration Score Distillation} (RSD), a principled generalization of DSD that accommodates a broader range of corruption types, such as blurred, incomplete, or low-resolution images. RSD operates by first pretraining a teacher diffusion model solely on corrupted data and subsequently distilling it into a single-step generator that produces high-quality reconstructions. Empirically, RSD consistently surpasses its teacher model across diverse restoration tasks on both natural and scientific datasets. Moreover, beyond standard diffusion objectives, the RSD framework is compatible with several corruption-aware training techniques such as Ambient Tweedie, Ambient Diffusion, and its Fourier-space variant, enabling flexible integration with recent advances in diffusion modeling. Theoretically, we demonstrate that in a linear regime, RSD recovers the eigenspace of the clean data covariance matrix from linear measurements, thereby serving as an implicit regularizer. This interpretation recasts score distillation not only as a sampling acceleration technique but as a principled approach to enhancing generative performance in severely degraded data regimes.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Scaling video diffusion transformers (DiTs) is limited by their quadratic 3D attention, even though most of the attention mass concentrates on a small subset of positions. We turn this observation into VSA, a trainable, hardware-efficient sparse attention that replaces full attention at \emph{both} training and inference. In VSA, a lightweight coarse stage pools tokens into tiles and identifies high-weight \emph{critical tokens}; a fine stage computes token-level attention only inside those tiles subjecting to block computing layout to ensure hard efficiency. This leads to a single differentiable kernel that trains end-to-end, requires no post-hoc profiling, and sustains 85\% of FlashAttention3 MFU. We perform a large sweep of ablation studies and scaling-law experiments by pretraining DiTs from 60M to 1.4B parameters. VSA reaches a Pareto point that cuts training FLOPS by 2.53$\times$ with no drop in diffusion loss. Retrofitting the open-source Wan-2.1 model speeds up attention time by 6$\times$ and lowers end-to-end generation time from 31s to 18s with comparable quality. These results establish trainable sparse attention as a practical alternative to full attention and a key enabler for further scaling of video diffusion models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Tabular data, a fundamental data format in machine learning, is predominantly utilized in competitions and real-world applications. The performance of tabular models--such as gradient boosted decision trees and neural networks--can vary significantly across datasets due to differences in feature distributions and task characteristics. Achieving top performance on each dataset often requires specialized expert knowledge. To address this variability, practitioners often aggregate the predictions of multiple models. However, conventional aggregation strategies typically rely on static combination rules and lack instance-level adaptability. In this work, we propose an in-context ensemble framework for tabular prediction that leverages large language models (LLMs) to perform dynamic, instance-specific integration of external model predictions. Without access to raw tabular features or semantic information, our method constructs a context around each test instance using its nearest neighbors and the predictions from a pool of external models. Within this enriched context, we introduce Chain of Tabular Thoughts (CoT$^2$), a prompting strategy that guides LLMs through multi-step, interpretable reasoning, making still further progress toward expert-level decision-making. Experimental results show that our method outperforms well-tuned baselines and standard ensemble techniques across a wide range of tabular datasets.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As the size of large language models grows exponentially, GPU memory has become a bottleneck for adapting these models to downstream tasks. In this paper, we aim to push the limits of memory-efficient training by minimizing memory usage on model weights, gradients, and optimizer states, within a unified framework. Our idea is to eliminate both gradients and optimizer states using zeroth-order optimization, which approximates gradients by perturbing weights during forward passes to identify gradient directions. To minimize memory usage on weights, we employ model quantization, e.g., converting from bfloat16 to int4. However, directly applying zeroth-order optimization to quantized weights is infeasible due to the precision gap between discrete weights and continuous gradients, which would otherwise require de-quantization and re-quantization. To overcome this challenge, we propose Quantized Zeroth-order Optimization (QZO), a novel approach that perturbs the continuous quantization scale for gradient estimation and uses a directional derivative clipping method to stabilize training. QZO is orthogonal to both scalar-based and codebook-based post-training quantization methods. Compared to full-parameter fine-tuning in bfloat16, QZO can reduce the total memory cost by more than 18$\times$ for 4-bit LLMs, and enables fine-tuning Llama-2-13B and Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large within a single 24GB GPU.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Conformal prediction is a framework for predictive inference with a distribution-free, finite-sample guarantee. However, it tends to provide uninformative prediction sets when calibration data are scarce. This paper introduces Synthetic-powered predictive inference (SPPI), a novel framework that incorporates synthetic data -- e.g., from a generative model -- to improve sample efficiency. At the core of our method is a score transporter: an empirical quantile mapping that aligns nonconformity scores from trusted, real data with those from synthetic data. By carefully integrating the score transporter into the calibration process, SPPI provably achieves finite-sample coverage guarantees without making any assumptions about the real and synthetic data distributions. When the score distributions are well aligned, SPPI yields substantially tighter and more informative prediction sets than standard conformal prediction. Experiments on image classification and tabular regression demonstrate notable improvements in predictive efficiency in data-scarce settings.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Despite significant advances in video generation, synthesizing physically plausible human actions remains a persistent challenge, particularly in modeling fine-grained semantics and complex temporal dynamics. For instance, generating gymnastics routines such as "switch leap with 0.5 turn" poses substantial difficulties for current methods, often yielding unsatisfactory results. To bridge this gap, we propose FinePhys, a Fine-grained human action generation framework that incorporates Physics to obtain effective skeletal guidance. Specifically, FinePhys first estimates 2D poses in an online manner and then performs 2D-to-3D dimension lifting via in-context learning. To mitigate the instability and limited interpretability of purely data-driven 3D poses, we further introduce a physics-based motion re-estimation module governed by Euler-Lagrange equations, calculating joint accelerations via bidirectional temporal updating. The physically predicted 3D poses are then fused with data-driven ones, offering multi-scale 2D heatmap guidance for the diffusion process. Evaluated on three fine-grained action subsets from FineGym (FX-JUMP, FX-TURN, and FX-SALTO), FinePhys significantly outperforms competitive baselines. Comprehensive qualitative results further demonstrate FinePhys's ability to generate more natural and plausible fine-grained human actions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Currently almost all state-of-the-art novel view synthesis and reconstruction models rely on calibrated cameras or additional geometric priors for training. These prerequisites significantly limit their applicability to massive uncalibrated data. To alleviate this requirement and unlock the potential for self-supervised training on large-scale uncalibrated videos, we propose a novel two-stage strategy to train a view synthesis model from only raw video frames or multi-view images, without providing camera parameters or other priors. In the first stage, we learn to reconstruct the scene implicitly in a latent space without relying on any explicit 3D representation. Specifically, we predict per-frame latent camera and scene context features, and employ a view synthesis model as a proxy for explicit rendering. This pretraining stage substantially reduces the optimization complexity and encourages the network to learn the underlying 3D consistency in a self-supervised manner. The learned latent camera and implicit scene representation have a large gap compared with the real 3D world. To reduce this gap, we introduce the second stage training by explicitly predicting 3D Gaussian primitives. We additionally apply explicit Gaussian Splatting rendering loss and depth projection loss to align the learned latent representations with physically grounded 3D geometry. In this way, Stage 1 provides a strong initialization and Stage 2 enforces 3D consistency - the two stages are complementary and mutually beneficial. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving high-quality novel view synthesis and accurate camera pose estimation, compared to methods that employ supervision with calibration, pose, or depth information.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose a principled and effective framework for one-step generative modeling. We introduce the notion of average velocity to characterize flow fields, in contrast to instantaneous velocity modeled by Flow Matching methods. A well-defined identity between average and instantaneous velocities is derived and used to guide neural network training. Our method, termed the MeanFlow model, is self-contained and requires no pre-training, distillation, or curriculum learning. MeanFlow demonstrates strong empirical performance: it achieves an FID of 3.43 with a single function evaluation (1-NFE) on ImageNet 256x256 trained from scratch, significantly outperforming previous state-of-the-art one-step diffusion/flow models. Our study substantially narrows the gap between one-step diffusion/flow models and their multi-step predecessors, and we hope it will motivate future research to revisit the foundations of these powerful models.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Aligning language models with user intent is becoming increasingly relevant to enhance user experience. This calls for designing methods that can allow users to control the properties of the language that LMs generate. For example, controlling the length of the generation, the complexity of the language that gets chosen, the sentiment, tone, etc. Most existing work attempts to integrate users' control by conditioning LM generations on natural language prompts or discrete control signals, which are often brittle and hard to scale. In this work, we are interested in \textit{continuous} control signals, ones that exist along a spectrum that can't easily be captured in a natural language prompt or via existing techniques in conditional generation. Through a case study in controlling the precise response-length of generations produced by LMs, we demonstrate how after fine-tuning, behaviors of language models can be controlled via continuous signals -- as vectors that are interpolated between a "low" and a "high" token embedding. Our method more reliably exerts response-length control than in-context learning methods or fine-tuning methods that represent the control signal as a discrete signal.
