<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recently, a number of image-mixing-based augmentation techniques have been introduced to improve the generalization of deep neural networks. In these techniques, two or more randomly selected natural images are mixed together to generate an augmented image. Such methods may not only omit important portions of the input images but also introduce label ambiguities by mixing images across labels resulting in misleading supervisory signals. To address these limitations, we propose DiffuseMix, a novel data augmentation technique that leverages a diffusion model to reshape training images, supervised by our bespoke conditional prompts. First, concatenation of a partial natural image and its generated counterpart is obtained which helps in avoiding the generation of unrealistic images or label ambiguities. Then, to enhance resilience against adversarial attacks and improves safety measures, a randomly selected structural pattern from a set of fractal images is blended into the concatenated image to form the final augmented image for training. Our empirical results on seven different datasets reveal that DiffuseMix achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of the-art methods on tasks including general classification,fine-grained classification, fine-tuning, data scarcity, and adversarial robustness.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In-context learning (ICL) allows transformer-based language models that are pre-trained on general text to quickly learn a specific task with a few "task demonstrations" without updating their parameters, significantly boosting their flexibility and generality. ICL possesses many distinct characteristics from conventional machine learning, thereby requiring new approaches to interpret this learning paradigm. Taking the viewpoint of recent works showing that transformers learn in context by formulating an internal optimizer, we propose an influence function-based attribution technique, DETAIL, that addresses the specific characteristics of ICL. We empirically verify the effectiveness of our approach for demonstration attribution while being computationally efficient. Leveraging the results, we then show how DETAIL can help improve model performance in real-world scenarios through demonstration reordering and curation. Finally, we experimentally prove the wide applicability of DETAIL by showing our attribution scores obtained on white-box models are transferable to black-box models in improving model performance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While diffusion models effectively generate remarkable synthetic images, a key limitation is the inference inefficiency, requiring numerous sampling steps. To accelerate inference and maintain high-quality synthesis, teacher-student distillation is applied to compress the diffusion models in a progressive and binary manner by retraining, e.g., reducing the 1024-step model to a 128-step model in 3 folds. In this paper, we propose a single-fold distillation algorithm, SFDDM, which can flexibly compress the teacher diffusion model into a student model of any desired step, based on reparameterization of the intermediate inputs from the teacher model. To train the student diffusion, we minimize not only the output distance but also the distribution of the hidden variables between the teacher and student model. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that our student model trained by the proposed SFDDM is able to sample high-quality data with steps reduced to as little as approximately 1%, thus, trading off inference time. Our remarkable performance highlights that SFDDM effectively transfers knowledge in single-fold distillation, achieving semantic consistency and meaningful image interpolation.</li>

          Two-Stage ML-Guided Decision Rules for Sequential Decision Making under Uncertainty(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Sequential Decision Making under Uncertainty (SDMU) is ubiquitous in many domains such as energy, finance, and supply chains. Some SDMU applications are naturally modeled as Multistage Stochastic Optimization Problems (MSPs), but the resulting optimizations are notoriously challenging from a computational standpoint. Under assumptions of convexity and stage-wise independence of the uncertainty, the resulting optimization can be solved efficiently using Stochastic Dual Dynamic Programming (SDDP). Two-stage Linear Decision Rules (TS-LDRs) have been proposed to solve MSPs without the stage-wise independence assumption. TS-LDRs are computationally tractable, but using a policy that is a linear function of past observations is typically not suitable for non-convex environments arising, for example, in energy systems. This paper introduces a novel approach, Two-Stage General Decision Rules (TS-GDR), to generalize the policy space beyond linear functions, making them suitable for non-convex environments. TS-GDR is a self-supervised learning algorithm that trains the nonlinear decision rules using stochastic gradient descent (SGD); its forward passes solve the policy implementation optimization problems, and the backward passes leverage duality theory to obtain closed-form gradients. The effectiveness of TS-GDR is demonstrated through an instantiation using Deep Recurrent Neural Networks named Two-Stage Deep Decision Rules (TS-DDR). The method inherits the flexibility and computational performance of Deep Learning methodologies to solve SDMU problems generally tackled through large-scale optimization techniques. Applied to the Long-Term Hydrothermal Dispatch (LTHD) problem using actual power system data from Bolivia, the TS-DDR not only enhances solution quality but also significantly reduces computation times by several orders of magnitude.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) demonstrate in-context learning ability to perform various functions based solely on the provided context, without updating model parameters. To fully utilize the in-context capabilities in time series forecasting (TSF) problems, unlike previous Transformer-based or LLM-based time series forecasting methods, we reformulate "time series forecasting tasks" as input tokens by constructing a series of (lookback, future) pairs within the tokens. This method aligns more closely with the inherent in-context mechanisms, and is more parameter-efficient without the need of using pre-trained LLM parameters. Furthermore, it addresses issues such as overfitting in existing Transformer-based TSF models, consistently achieving better performance across full-data, few-shot, and zero-shot settings compared to previous architectures.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Understanding the connections between artificial and biological intelligent systems can reveal fundamental principles underlying general intelligence. While many artificial intelligence (AI) models have a neuroscience counterpart, such connections are largely missing in Transformer models and the self-attention mechanism. Here, we examine the relationship between attention heads and human episodic memory. We focus on the induction heads, which contribute to the in-context learning capabilities of Transformer-based large language models (LLMs). We demonstrate that induction heads are behaviorally, functionally, and mechanistically similar to the contextual maintenance and retrieval (CMR) model of human episodic memory. Our analyses of LLMs pre-trained on extensive text data show that CMR-like heads often emerge in the intermediate model layers and that their behavior qualitatively mirrors the memory biases seen in humans. Our findings uncover a parallel between the computational mechanisms of LLMs and human memory, offering valuable insights into both research fields.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The optimization of the latents and parameters of diffusion models with respect to some differentiable metric defined on the output of the model is a challenging and complex problem. The sampling for diffusion models is done by solving either the probability flow ODE or diffusion SDE wherein a neural network approximates the score function or related quantity, allowing a numerical ODE/SDE solver to be used. However, naïve backpropagation techniques are memory intensive, requiring the storage of all intermediate states, and face additional complexity in handling the injected noise from the diffusion term of the diffusion SDE. We propose a novel method based on the stochastic adjoint sensitivity method to calculate the gradientwith respect to the initial noise, conditional information, and model parameters by solving an additional SDE whose solution is the gradient of the diffusion SDE. We exploit the unique construction of diffusion SDEs to further simplify the formulation of the adjoint diffusion SDE and use a change-of-variables to simplify the solution to an exponentially weighted integral. Using this formulation we derive a custom solver for the adjoint SDE as well as the simpler adjoint ODE. The proposed adjoint diffusion solvers can efficiently compute the gradients for both the probability flow ODE and diffusion SDE for latents and parameters of the model. Lastly, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the adjoint diffusion solvers onthe face morphing problem.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This technical report introduces Aya 23, a family of multilingual language models. Aya 23 builds on the recent release of the Aya model (Üstün et al., 2024), focusing on pairing a highly performant pre-trained model with the recently released Aya collection (Singh et al., 2024). The result is a powerful multilingual large language model serving 23 languages, expanding state-of-art language modeling capabilities to approximately half of the world's population. The Aya model covered 101 languages whereas Aya 23 is an experiment in depth vs breadth, exploring the impact of allocating more capacity to fewer languages that are included during pre-training. Aya 23 outperforms both previous massively multilingual models like Aya 101 for the languages it covers, as well as widely used models like Gemma, Mistral and Mixtral on an extensive range of discriminative and generative tasks. We release the open weights for both the 8B and 35B models as part of our continued commitment for expanding access to multilingual progress.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present ElastoGen, a knowledge-driven model that generates physically accurate and coherent 4D elastodynamics. Instead of relying on petabyte-scale data-driven learning, ElastoGen leverages the principles of physics-in-the-loop and learns from established physical knowledge, such as partial differential equations and their numerical solutions. The core idea of ElastoGen is converting the global differential operator, corresponding to the nonlinear elastodynamic equations, into iterative local convolution-like operations, which naturally fit modern neural networks. Each network module is specifically designed to support this goal rather than functioning as a black box. As a result, ElastoGen is exceptionally lightweight in terms of both training requirements and network scale. Additionally, due to its alignment with physical procedures, ElastoGen efficiently generates accurate dynamics for a wide range of hyperelastic materials and can be easily integrated with upstream and downstream deep modules to enable end-to-end 4D generation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>RLHF has emerged as a pivotal step in aligning language models with human objectives and values. It typically involves learning a reward model from human preference data and then using reinforcement learning to update the generative model accordingly. Conversely, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) directly optimizes the generative model with preference data, skipping reinforcement learning. However, both RLHF and DPO assume uniform preferences, overlooking the reality of diverse human annotators. This paper presents a new method to align generative models with varied human preferences. We propose an Expectation-Maximization adaptation to DPO, generating a mixture of models based on latent preference types of the annotators. We then introduce a min-max regret ensemble learning model to produce a single generative method to minimize worst-case regret among annotator subgroups with similar latent factors. Our algorithms leverage the simplicity of DPO while accommodating diverse preferences. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach in producing equitable generative policies.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Peer prediction mechanisms motivate high-quality feedback with provable guarantees. However, current methods only apply to rather simple reports, like multiple-choice or scalar numbers. We aim to broaden these techniques to the larger domain of text-based reports, drawing on the recent developments in large language models. This vastly increases the applicability of peer prediction mechanisms as textual feedback is the norm in a large variety of feedback channels: peer reviews, e-commerce customer reviews, and comments on social media. We introduce two mechanisms, the Generative Peer Prediction Mechanism (GPPM) and the Generative Synopsis Peer Prediction Mechanism (GSPPM). These mechanisms utilize LLMs as predictors, mapping from one agent's report to a prediction of her peer's report. Theoretically, we show that when the LLM prediction is sufficiently accurate, our mechanisms can incentivize high effort and truth-telling as an (approximate) Bayesian Nash equilibrium. Empirically, we confirm the efficacy of our mechanisms through experiments conducted on two real datasets: the Yelp review dataset and the ICLR OpenReview dataset. We highlight the results that on the ICLR dataset, our mechanisms can differentiate three quality levels -- human-written reviews, GPT-4-generated reviews, and GPT-3.5-generated reviews in terms of expected scores. Additionally, GSPPM penalizes LLM-generated reviews more effectively than GPPM.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Predicting simple function classes has been widely used as a testbed for developing theory and understanding of the trained Transformer's in-context learning (ICL) ability. In this paper, we revisit the training of Transformers on linear regression tasks, and different from all the existing literature, we consider a bi-objective prediction task of predicting both the conditional expectation $\mathbb{E}[Y|X]$ and the conditional variance Var$(Y|X)$. This additional uncertainty quantification objective provides a handle to (i) better design out-of-distribution experiments to distinguish ICL from in-weight learning (IWL) and (ii) make a better separation between the algorithms with and without using the prior information of the training distribution. Theoretically, we show that the trained Transformer reaches near Bayes-optimum, suggesting the usage of the information of the training distribution. Our method can be extended to other cases. Specifically, with the Transformer's context window $S$, we prove a generalization bound of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{\min\{S, T\}/(n T)})$ on $n$ tasks with sequences of length $T$, providing sharper analysis compared to previous results of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{1/n})$. Empirically, we illustrate that while the trained Transformer behaves as the Bayes-optimal solution as a natural consequence of supervised training in distribution, it does not necessarily perform a Bayesian inference when facing task shifts, in contrast to the \textit{equivalence} between these two proposed in many existing literature. We also demonstrate the trained Transformer's ICL ability over covariates shift and prompt-length shift and interpret them as a generalization over a meta distribution.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Go-Explore is a powerful family of algorithms designed to solve hard-exploration problems, built on the principle of archiving discovered states, and iteratively returning to and exploring from the most promising states. This approach has led to superhuman performance across a wide variety of challenging problems including Atari games and robotic control, but requires manually designing heuristics to guide exploration, which is time-consuming and infeasible in general. To resolve this, we propose Intelligent Go-Explore (IGE) which greatly extends the scope of the original Go-Explore by replacing these heuristics with the intelligence and internalized human notions of interestingness captured by giant foundation models (FMs). This provides IGE with a human-like ability to instinctively identify how interesting or promising any new state is (e.g. discovering new objects, locations, or behaviors), even in complex environments where heuristics are hard to define. Moreover, IGE offers the exciting and previously impossible opportunity to recognize and capitalize on serendipitous discoveries that cannot be predicted ahead of time. We evaluate IGE on a range of language-based tasks that require search and exploration. In Game of 24, a multistep mathematical reasoning problem, IGE reaches 100% success rate 70.8% faster than the best classic graph search baseline. Next, in BabyAI-Text, a challenging partially observable gridworld, IGE exceeds the previous SOTA with orders of magnitude fewer online samples. Finally, in TextWorld, we show the unique ability of IGE to succeed in settings requiring long-horizon exploration where prior SOTA FM agents like Reflexion completely fail. Overall, IGE combines the tremendous strengths of FMs and the powerful Go-Explore algorithm, opening up a new frontier of research into creating more generally capable agents with impressive exploration capabilities.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper presents a new self-supervised video representation learning framework, ARVideo, which autoregressively predicts the next video token in a tailored sequence order. Two key designs are included. First, we organize autoregressive video tokens into clusters that span both spatially and temporally, thereby enabling a richer aggregation of contextual information compared to the standard spatial-only or temporal-only clusters. Second, we adopt a randomized spatiotemporal prediction order to facilitate learning from multi-dimensional data, addressing the limitations of a handcrafted spatial-first or temporal-first sequence order. Extensive experiments establish ARVideo as an effective paradigm for self-supervised video representation learning. For example, when trained with the ViT-B backbone, ARVideo competitively attains 81.2% on Kinetics-400 and 70.9% on Something-Something V2, which are on par with the strong benchmark set by VideoMAE. Importantly, ARVideo also demonstrates higher training efficiency, i.e., it trains 14% faster and requires 58% less GPU memory compared to VideoMAE.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective in addressing complex decision-making and control tasks. However, in most traditional RL algorithms, the policy is typically parameterized as a diagonal Gaussian distribution with learned mean and variance, which constrains their capability to acquire complex policies. In response to this problem, we propose an online RL algorithm termed diffusion actor-critic with entropy regulator (DACER). This algorithm conceptualizes the reverse process of the diffusion model as a novel policy function and leverages the capability of the diffusion model to fit multimodal distributions, thereby enhancing the representational capacity of the policy. Since the distribution of the diffusion policy lacks an analytical expression, its entropy cannot be determined analytically. To mitigate this, we propose a method to estimate the entropy of the diffusion policy utilizing Gaussian mixture model. Building on the estimated entropy, we can learn a parameter $\alpha$ that modulates the degree of exploration and exploitation. Parameter $\alpha$ will be employed to adaptively regulate the variance of the added noise, which is applied to the action output by the diffusion model. Experimental trials on MuJoCo benchmarks and a multimodal task demonstrate that the DACER algorithm achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in most MuJoCo control tasks while exhibiting a stronger representational capacity of the diffusion policy.</li>

This paper presents ODGEN, a novel method to generate high-quality images conditioned on bounding boxes, thereby facilitating data synthesis for object detection. Given a domain-specific object detection dataset, we first fine-tune a pre-trained diffusion model on both cropped foreground objects and entire images to fit target distributions. Then we propose to control the diffusion model using synthesized visual prompts with spatial constraints and object-wise textual descriptions. ODGEN exhibits robustness in handling complex scenes and specific domains. Further, we design a dataset synthesis pipeline to evaluate ODGEN on 7 domain-specific benchmarks to demonstrate its effectiveness. Adding training data generated by ODGEN improves up to 25.3% mAP@.50:.95 with object detectors like YOLOv5 and YOLOv7, outperforming prior controllable generative methods. In addition, we design an evaluation protocol based on COCO-2014 to validate ODGEN in general domains and observe an advantage up to 5.6% in mAP@.50:.95 against existing methods.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Achieving optimal performance with frame-based vision sensors on aerial platforms poses a significant challenge due to the fundamental tradeoffs between bandwidth and latency. Event cameras, which draw inspiration from biological vision systems, present a promising alternative due to their exceptional temporal resolution, superior dynamic range, and minimal power requirements. Due to these properties, they are well-suited for processing and segmenting fast motions that require rapid reactions. However, previous methods for event-based motion segmentation encountered limitations, such as the need for per-scene parameter tuning or manual labelling to achieve satisfactory results. To overcome these issues, our proposed method leverages features from self-supervised transformers on both event data and optical flow information, eliminating the need for human annotations and reducing the parameter tuning problem. In this paper, we use an event camera with HD resolution onboard a highly dynamic aerial platform in an urban setting. We conduct extensive evaluations of our framework across multiple datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance compared to existing works. Our method can effectively handle various types of motion and an arbitrary number of moving objects. Code and dataset are available at: \url{this https URL}</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Language models (LMs) have long been used to improve results of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems, but they are unaware of the errors that ASR systems make. Error correction models are designed to fix ASR errors, however, they showed little improvement over traditional LMs mainly due to the lack of supervised training data. In this paper, we present Denoising LM (DLM), which is a $\textit{scaled}$ error correction model trained with vast amounts of synthetic data, significantly exceeding prior attempts meanwhile achieving new state-of-the-art ASR performance. We use text-to-speech (TTS) systems to synthesize audio, which is fed into an ASR system to produce noisy hypotheses, which are then paired with the original texts to train the DLM. DLM has several $\textit{key ingredients}$: (i) up-scaled model and data; (ii) usage of multi-speaker TTS systems; (iii) combination of multiple noise augmentation strategies; and (iv) new decoding techniques. With a Transformer-CTC ASR, DLM achieves 1.5% word error rate (WER) on $\textit{test-clean}$ and 3.3% WER on $\textit{test-other}$ on Librispeech, which to our knowledge are the best reported numbers in the setting where no external audio data are used and even match self-supervised methods which use external audio data. Furthermore, a single DLM is applicable to different ASRs, and greatly surpassing the performance of conventional LM based beam-search rescoring. These results indicate that properly investigated error correction models have the potential to replace conventional LMs, holding the key to a new level of accuracy in ASR systems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The success of denoising diffusion models in representing rich data distributions over 2D raster images has prompted research on extending them to other data representations, such as vector graphics. Unfortunately due to their variable structure and scarcity of vector training data, directly applying diffusion models on this domain remains a challenging problem. Using workarounds like optimization via Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) is also fraught with difficulty, as vector representations are non trivial to directly optimize and tend to result in implausible geometries such as redundant or self-intersecting shapes. NIVeL addresses these challenges by reinterpreting the problem on an alternative, intermediate domain which preserves the desirable properties of vector graphics -- mainly sparsity of representation and resolution-independence. This alternative domain is based on neural implicit fields expressed in a set of decomposable, editable layers. Based on our experiments, NIVeL produces text-to-vector graphics results of significantly better quality than the state-of-the-art.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>World models empower model-based agents to interactively explore, reason, and plan within imagined environments for real-world decision-making. However, the high demand for interactivity poses challenges in harnessing recent advancements in video generative models for developing world models at scale. This work introduces Interactive VideoGPT (iVideoGPT), a scalable autoregressive transformer framework that integrates multimodal signals--visual observations, actions, and rewards--into a sequence of tokens, facilitating an interactive experience of agents via next-token prediction. iVideoGPT features a novel compressive tokenization technique that efficiently discretizes high-dimensional visual observations. Leveraging its scalable architecture, we are able to pre-train iVideoGPT on millions of human and robotic manipulation trajectories, establishing a versatile foundation that is adaptable to serve as interactive world models for a wide range of downstream tasks. These include action-conditioned video prediction, visual planning, and model-based reinforcement learning, where iVideoGPT achieves competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art methods. Our work advances the development of interactive general world models, bridging the gap between generative video models and practical model-based reinforcement learning applications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The development of large language models (LLMs) has significantly advanced the emergence of large multimodal models (LMMs). While LMMs have achieved tremendous success by promoting the synergy between multimodal comprehension and creation, they often face challenges when confronted with out-of-distribution data. This is primarily due to their reliance on image encoders trained to encode images into task-relevant features, which may lead them to disregard irrelevant details. Delving into the modeling capabilities of diffusion models for images naturally prompts the question: Can diffusion models serve as the eyes of large language models for image perception? In this paper, we propose DEEM, a simple and effective approach that utilizes the generative feedback of diffusion models to align the semantic distributions of the image encoder. This addresses the drawbacks of previous methods that solely relied on image encoders like ViT, thereby enhancing the model's resilience against out-of-distribution samples and reducing visual hallucinations. Importantly, this is achieved without requiring additional training modules and with fewer training parameters. We extensively evaluated DEEM on both our newly constructed RobustVQA benchmark and another well-known benchmark, POPE, for object hallucination. Compared to the state-of-the-art interleaved content generation models, DEEM exhibits enhanced robustness and a superior capacity to alleviate model hallucinations while utilizing fewer trainable parameters, less pre-training data (10%), and a smaller base model size.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models (DMs) have achieved remarkable success in text-to-image generation, but they also pose safety risks, such as the potential generation of harmful content and copyright violations. The techniques of machine unlearning, also known as concept erasing, have been developed to address these risks. However, these techniques remain vulnerable to adversarial prompt attacks, which can prompt DMs post-unlearning to regenerate undesired images containing concepts (such as nudity) meant to be erased. This work aims to enhance the robustness of concept erasing by integrating the principle of adversarial training (AT) into machine unlearning, resulting in the robust unlearning framework referred to as AdvUnlearn. However, achieving this effectively and efficiently is highly nontrivial. First, we find that a straightforward implementation of AT compromises DMs' image generation quality post-unlearning. To address this, we develop a utility-retaining regularization on an additional retain set, optimizing the trade-off between concept erasure robustness and model utility in AdvUnlearn. Moreover, we identify the text encoder as a more suitable module for robustification compared to UNet, ensuring unlearning effectiveness. And the acquired text encoder can serve as a plug-and-play robust unlearner for various DM types. Empirically, we perform extensive experiments to demonstrate the robustness advantage of AdvUnlearn across various DM unlearning scenarios, including the erasure of nudity, objects, and style concepts. In addition to robustness, AdvUnlearn also achieves a balanced tradeoff with model utility. To our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically explore robust DM unlearning through AT, setting it apart from existing methods that overlook robustness in concept erasing.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>To facilitate the application of motion prediction in practice, recently, the few-shot motion prediction task has attracted increasing research attention. Yet, in existing few-shot motion prediction works, a specific model that is dedicatedly trained over human motions is generally required. In this work, rather than tackling this task through training a specific human motion prediction model, we instead propose a novel FMP-OC framework. In FMP-OC, in a totally training-free manner, we enable Few-shot Motion Prediction, which is a non-language task, to be performed directly via utilizing the Off-the-shelf language model ChatGPT. Specifically, to lead ChatGPT as a language model to become an accurate motion predictor, in FMP-OC, we first introduce several novel designs to facilitate extracting implicit knowledge from ChatGPT. Moreover, we also incorporate our framework with a motion-in-context learning mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed framework.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Time series anomaly detection plays a vital role in a wide range of applications. Existing methods require training one specific model for each dataset, which exhibits limited generalization capability across different target datasets, hindering anomaly detection performance in various scenarios with scarce training data. Aiming at this problem, we propose constructing a general time series anomaly detection model, which is pre-trained on extensive multi-domain datasets and can subsequently apply to a multitude of downstream scenarios. The significant divergence of time series data across different domains presents two primary challenges in building such a general model: (1) meeting the diverse requirements of appropriate information bottlenecks tailored to different datasets in one unified model, and (2) enabling distinguishment between multiple normal and abnormal patterns, both are crucial for effective anomaly detection in various target scenarios. To tackle these two challenges, we propose a General time series anomaly Detector with Adaptive Bottlenecks and Dual Adversarial Decoders (DADA), which enables flexible selection of bottlenecks based on different data and explicitly enhances clear differentiation between normal and abnormal series. We conduct extensive experiments on nine target datasets from different domains. After pre-training on multi-domain data, DADA, serving as a zero-shot anomaly detector for these datasets, still achieves competitive or even superior results compared to those models tailored to each specific dataset.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model, in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Visual In-Context Learning (VICL) is a prevailing way to transfer visual foundation models to new tasks by leveraging contextual information contained in in-context examples to enhance learning and prediction of query sample. The fundamental problem in VICL is how to select the best prompt to activate its power as much as possible, which is equivalent to the ranking problem to test the in-context behavior of each candidate in the alternative set and select the best one. To utilize more appropriate ranking metric and leverage more comprehensive information among the alternative set, we propose a novel in-context example selection framework to approximately identify the global optimal prompt, i.e. choosing the best performing in-context examples from all alternatives for each query sample. Our method, dubbed Partial2Global, adopts a transformer-based list-wise ranker to provide a more comprehensive comparison within several alternatives, and a consistency-aware ranking aggregator to generate globally consistent ranking. The effectiveness of Partial2Global is validated through experiments on foreground segmentation, single object detection and image colorization, demonstrating that Partial2Global selects consistently better in-context examples compared with other methods, and thus establish the new state-of-the-arts.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has become the standard for customising Foundation Models (FMs) to user-specific downstream tasks. However, typical PEFT methods require storing multiple task-specific adapters, creating scalability issues as these adapters must be housed and run at the FM server. Traditional prompt tuning offers a potential solution by customising them through task-specific input prefixes, but it under-performs compared to other PEFT methods like LoRA. To address this gap, we propose Low-Rank Prompt Adaptation (LOPA), a prompt-tuning-based approach that performs on par with state-of-the-art PEFT methods and full fine-tuning while being more parameter-efficient and not requiring a server-based adapter. LOPA generates soft prompts by balancing between sharing task-specific information across instances and customization for each instance. It uses a low-rank decomposition of the soft-prompt component encoded for each instance to achieve parameter efficiency. We provide a comprehensive evaluation on multiple natural language understanding and code generation and understanding tasks across a wide range of foundation models with varying sizes.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Stylized Text-to-Image Generation (STIG) aims to generate images based on text prompts and style reference images. We in this paper propose a novel framework dubbed as StyleMaster for this task by leveraging pretrained Stable Diffusion (SD), which tries to solve the previous problems such as insufficient style and inconsistent semantics. The enhancement lies in two novel module, namely multi-source style embedder and dynamic attention adapter. In order to provide SD with better style embeddings, we propose the multi-source style embedder considers both global and local level visual information along with textual one, which provide both complementary style-related and semantic-related knowledge. Additionally, aiming for better balance between the adaptor capacity and semantic control, the proposed dynamic attention adapter is applied to the diffusion UNet in which adaptation weights are dynamically calculated based on the style embeddings. Two objective functions are introduced to optimize the model together with denoising loss, which can further enhance semantic and style consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of StyleMaster over existing methods, rendering images with variable target styles while successfully maintaining the semantic information from the text prompts.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Current text-to-image diffusion models have achieved groundbreaking results in image generation tasks. However, the unavoidable inclusion of sensitive information during pre-training introduces significant risks such as copyright infringement and privacy violations in the generated images. Machine Unlearning (MU) provides a effective way to the sensitive concepts captured by the model, has been shown to be a promising approach to addressing these issues. Nonetheless, existing MU methods for concept erasure encounter two primary bottlenecks: 1) generalization issues, where concept erasure is effective only for the data within the unlearn set, and prompts outside the unlearn set often still result in the generation of sensitive concepts; and 2) utility drop, where erasing target concepts significantly degrades the model's performance. To this end, this paper first proposes a concept domain correction framework for unlearning concepts in diffusion models. By aligning the output domains of sensitive concepts and anchor concepts through adversarial training, we enhance the generalizability of the unlearning results. Secondly, we devise a concept-preserving scheme based on gradient surgery. This approach alleviates the parts of the unlearning gradient that contradict the relearning gradient, ensuring that the process of unlearning minimally disrupts the model's performance. Finally, extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our model, demonstrating our method's capability to address the challenges of concept unlearning in diffusion models while preserving model utility.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) driven by In-Context Learning (ICL) have significantly improved the performance of text-to-SQL. Previous methods generally employ a two-stage reasoning framework, namely 1) schema linking and 2) logical synthesis, making the framework not only effective but also interpretable. Despite these advancements, the inherent bad nature of the generalization of LLMs often results in hallucinations, which limits the full potential of LLMs. In this work, we first identify and categorize the common types of hallucinations at each stage in text-to-SQL. We then introduce a novel strategy, Task Alignment (TA), designed to mitigate hallucinations at each stage. TA encourages LLMs to take advantage of experiences from similar tasks rather than starting the tasks from scratch. This can help LLMs reduce the burden of generalization, thereby mitigating hallucinations effectively. We further propose TA-SQL, a text-to-SQL framework based on this strategy. The experimental results and comprehensive analysis demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our framework. Specifically, it enhances the performance of the GPT-4 baseline by 21.23% relatively on BIRD dev and it yields significant improvements across six models and four mainstream, complex text-to-SQL benchmarks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Self-supervised learning (SSL) is gaining attention for its ability to learn effective representations with large amounts of unlabeled data. Lightweight models can be distilled from larger self-supervised pre-trained models using contrastive and consistency constraints. Still, the different sizes of the projection heads make it challenging for students to mimic the teacher's embedding accurately. We propose \textsc{Retro}, which reuses the teacher's projection head for students, and our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over the state-of-the-art on all lightweight models. For instance, when training EfficientNet-B0 using ResNet-50/101/152 as teachers, our approach improves the linear result on ImageNet to $66.9\%$, $69.3\%$, and $69.8\%$, respectively, with significantly fewer parameters.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recently, text-to-image (T2I) editing has been greatly pushed forward by applying diffusion models. Despite the visual promise of the generated images, inconsistencies with the expected textual prompt remain prevalent. This paper aims to systematically improve the text-guided image editing techniques based on diffusion models, by addressing their limitations. Notably, the common idea in diffusion-based editing firstly reconstructs the source image via inversion techniques e.g., DDIM Inversion. Then following a fusion process that carefully integrates the source intermediate (hidden) states (obtained by inversion) with the ones of the target image. Unfortunately, such a standard pipeline fails in many cases due to the interference of texture retention and the new characters creation in some regions. To mitigate this, we incorporate human annotation as an external knowledge to confine editing within a ``Mask-informed'' region. Then we carefully Fuse the edited image with the source image and a constructed intermediate image within the model's Self-Attention module. Extensive empirical results demonstrate the proposed ``MaSaFusion'' significantly improves the existing T2I editing techniques.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In contrast to prevalent Federated Learning (FL) privacy inference techniques such as generative adversarial networks attacks, membership inference attacks, property inference attacks, and model inversion attacks, we devise an innovative privacy threat: the Data Distribution Decompose Attack on FL, termed Decaf. This attack enables an honest-but-curious FL server to meticulously profile the proportion of each class owned by the victim FL user, divulging sensitive information like local market item distribution and business competitiveness. The crux of Decaf lies in the profound observation that the magnitude of local model gradient changes closely mirrors the underlying data distribution, including the proportion of each class. Decaf addresses two crucial challenges: accurately identify the missing/null class(es) given by any victim user as a premise and then quantify the precise relationship between gradient changes and each remaining non-null class. Notably, Decaf operates stealthily, rendering it entirely passive and undetectable to victim users regarding the infringement of their data distribution privacy. Experimental validation on five benchmark datasets (MNIST, FASHION-MNIST, CIFAR-10, FER-2013, and SkinCancer) employing diverse model architectures, including customized convolutional networks, standardized VGG16, and ResNet18, demonstrates Decaf's efficacy. Results indicate its ability to accurately decompose local user data distribution, regardless of whether it is IID or non-IID distributed. Specifically, the dissimilarity measured using $L_{\infty}$ distance between the distribution decomposed by Decaf and ground truth is consistently below 5\% when no null classes exist. Moreover, Decaf achieves 100\% accuracy in determining any victim user's null classes, validated through formal proof.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advancements in text-to-image generation have been propelled by the development of diffusion models and multi-modality learning. However, since text is typically represented sequentially in these models, it often falls short in providing accurate contextualization and structural control. So the generated images do not consistently align with human expectations, especially in complex scenarios involving multiple objects and relationships. In this paper, we introduce the Scene Graph Adapter(SG-Adapter), leveraging the structured representation of scene graphs to rectify inaccuracies in the original text embeddings. The SG-Adapter's explicit and non-fully connected graph representation greatly improves the fully connected, transformer-based text representations. This enhancement is particularly notable in maintaining precise correspondence in scenarios involving multiple relationships. To address the challenges posed by low-quality annotated datasets like Visual Genome, we have manually curated a highly clean, multi-relational scene graph-image paired dataset MultiRels. Furthermore, we design three metrics derived from GPT-4V to effectively and thoroughly measure the correspondence between images and scene graphs. Both qualitative and quantitative results validate the efficacy of our approach in controlling the correspondence in multiple relationships.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recently, the strong latent Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DPM) has been applied to high-quality Text-to-Image (T2I) generation (e.g., Stable Diffusion), by injecting the encoded target text prompt into the gradually denoised diffusion image generator. Despite the success of DPM in practice, the mechanism behind it remains to be explored. To fill this blank, we begin by examining the intermediate statuses during the gradual denoising generation process in DPM. The empirical observations indicate, the shape of image is reconstructed after the first few denoising steps, and then the image is filled with details (e.g., texture). The phenomenon is because the low-frequency signal (shape relevant) of the noisy image is not corrupted until the final stage in the forward process (initial stage of generation) of adding noise in DPM. Inspired by the observations, we proceed to explore the influence of each token in the text prompt during the two stages. After a series of experiments of T2I generations conditioned on a set of text prompts. We conclude that in the earlier generation stage, the image is mostly decided by the special token [\texttt{EOS}] in the text prompt, and the information in the text prompt is already conveyed in this stage. After that, the diffusion model completes the details of generated images by information from themselves. Finally, we propose to apply this observation to accelerate the process of T2I generation by properly removing text guidance, which finally accelerates the sampling up to 25\%+.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As the size and context length of Large Language Models (LLMs) grow, weight-activation quantization has emerged as a crucial technique for efficient deployment of LLMs. Compared to weight-only quantization, weight-activation quantization presents greater challenges due to the presence of outliers in activations. Existing methods have made significant progress by exploring mixed-precision quantization and outlier suppression. However, these methods primarily focus on optimizing the results of single matrix multiplication, neglecting the bidirectional propagation of quantization errors in LLMs. Specifically, errors accumulate vertically within the same token through layers, and diffuse horizontally across different tokens due to self-attention mechanisms. To address this issue, we introduce BiSup, a Bidirectional quantization error Suppression method. By constructing appropriate optimizable parameter spaces, BiSup utilizes a small amount of data for quantization-aware parameter-efficient fine-tuning to suppress the error vertical accumulation. Besides, BiSup employs prompt mixed-precision quantization strategy, which preserves high precision for the key-value cache of system prompts, to mitigate the error horizontal diffusion. Extensive experiments on Llama and Qwen families demonstrate that BiSup can improve performance over two state-of-the-art methods (the average WikiText2 perplexity decreases from 13.26 to 9.41 for Atom and from 14.33 to 7.85 for QuaRot under the W3A3-g128 configuration), further facilitating the practical applications of low-bit weight-activation quantization.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>By harnessing the potent generative capabilities of pre-trained large video diffusion models, we propose NVS-Solver, a new novel view synthesis (NVS) paradigm that operates \textit{without} the need for training. NVS-Solver adaptively modulates the diffusion sampling process with the given views to enable the creation of remarkable visual experiences from single or multiple views of static scenes or monocular videos of dynamic scenes. Specifically, built upon our theoretical modeling, we iteratively modulate the score function with the given scene priors represented with warped input views to control the video diffusion process. Moreover, by theoretically exploring the boundary of the estimation error, we achieve the modulation in an adaptive fashion according to the view pose and the number of diffusion steps. Extensive evaluations on both static and dynamic scenes substantiate the significant superiority of our NVS-Solver over state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. \textit{ Source code in } \href{this https URL}{this https URL\_$Solver}.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly, in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) plays a crucial role in various industries by identifying atypical patterns that deviate from standard trends, thereby maintaining system integrity and enabling prompt response measures. Traditional TSAD models, which often rely on deep learning, require extensive training data and operate as black boxes, lacking interpretability for detected anomalies. To address these challenges, we propose LLMAD, a novel TSAD method that employs Large Language Models (LLMs) to deliver accurate and interpretable TSAD results. LLMAD innovatively applies LLMs for in-context anomaly detection by retrieving both positive and negative similar time series segments, significantly enhancing LLMs' effectiveness. Furthermore, LLMAD employs the Anomaly Detection Chain-of-Thought (AnoCoT) approach to mimic expert logic for its decision-making process. This method further enhances its performance and enables LLMAD to provide explanations for their detections through versatile perspectives, which are particularly important for user decision-making. Experiments on three datasets indicate that our LLMAD achieves detection performance comparable to state-of-the-art deep learning methods while offering remarkable interpretability for detections. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that directly employs LLMs for TSAD.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text-driven human motion generation is an emerging task in animation and humanoid robot design. Existing algorithms directly generate the full sequence which is computationally expensive and prone to errors as it does not pay special attention to key poses, a process that has been the cornerstone of animation for decades. We propose KeyMotion, that generates plausible human motion sequences corresponding to input text by first generating keyframes followed by in-filling. We use a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with Kullback-Leibler regularization to project the keyframes into a latent space to reduce dimensionality and further accelerate the subsequent diffusion process. For the reverse diffusion, we propose a novel Parallel Skip Transformer that performs cross-modal attention between the keyframe latents and text condition. To complete the motion sequence, we propose a text-guided Transformer designed to perform motion-in-filling, ensuring the preservation of both fidelity and adherence to the physical constraints of human motion. Experiments show that our method achieves state-of-theart results on the HumanML3D dataset outperforming others on all R-precision metrics and MultiModal Distance. KeyMotion also achieves competitive performance on the KIT dataset, achieving the best results on Top3 R-precision, FID, and Diversity metrics.</li>

          Semantic Aware Diffusion Inverse Tone Mapping(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The range of real-world scene luminance is larger than the capture capability of many digital camera sensors which leads to details being lost in captured images, most typically in bright regions. Inverse tone mapping attempts to boost these captured Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) images back to High Dynamic Range (HDR) by creating a mapping that linearizes the well exposed values from the SDR image, and provides a luminance boost to the clipped content. However, in most cases, the details in the clipped regions cannot be recovered or estimated. In this paper, we present a novel inverse tone mapping approach for mapping SDR images to HDR that generates lost details in clipped regions through a semantic-aware diffusion based inpainting approach. Our method proposes two major contributions - first, we propose to use a semantic graph to guide SDR diffusion based inpainting in masked regions in a saturated image. Second, drawing inspiration from traditional HDR imaging and bracketing methods, we propose a principled formulation to lift the SDR inpainted regions to HDR that is compatible with generative inpainting methods. Results show that our method demonstrates superior performance across different datasets on objective metrics, and subjective experiments show that the proposed method matches (and in most cases outperforms) state-of-art inverse tone mapping operators in terms of objective metrics and outperforms them for visual fidelity.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) are powerful generative models showing competitive performance in various domains, including image synthesis and 3D point cloud generation. However, sampling from pre-trained DPMs involves multiple neural function evaluations (NFE) to transform Gaussian noise samples into images, resulting in higher computational costs compared to single-step generative models such as GANs or VAEs. Therefore, a crucial problem is to reduce NFE while preserving generation quality. To this end, we propose LD3, a lightweight framework for learning time discretization while sampling from the diffusion ODE encapsulated by DPMs. LD3 can be combined with various diffusion ODE solvers and consistently improves performance without retraining resource-intensive neural networks. We demonstrate analytically and empirically that LD3 enhances sampling efficiency compared to distillation-based methods, without the extensive computational overhead. We evaluate our method with extensive experiments on 5 datasets, covering unconditional and conditional sampling in both pixel-space and latent-space DPMs. For example, in about 5 minutes of training on a single GPU, our method reduces the FID score from 6.63 to 2.68 on CIFAR10 (7 NFE), and in around 20 minutes, decreases the FID from 8.51 to 5.03 on class-conditional ImageNet-256 (5 NFE). LD3 complements distillation methods, offering a more efficient approach to sampling from pre-trained diffusion models.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>It has recently been demonstrated that pretraining backbones in a self-supervised manner generally provides better fine-tuned polyp segmentation performance, and that models with ViT-B backbones typically perform better than models with ResNet50 backbones. In this paper, we extend this recent work to consider generalisability. I.e., we assess the performance of models on a different dataset to that used for fine-tuning, accounting for variation in network architecture and pretraining pipeline (algorithm and dataset). This reveals how well models with different pretrained backbones generalise to data of a somewhat different distribution to the training data, which will likely arise in deployment due to different cameras and demographics of patients, amongst other factors. We observe that the previous findings, regarding pretraining pipelines for polyp segmentation, hold true when considering generalisability. However, our results imply that models with ResNet50 backbones typically generalise better, despite being outperformed by models with ViT-B backbones in evaluation on the test set from the same dataset used for fine-tuning.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The dominant paradigm for learning on graph-structured data is message passing. Despite being a strong inductive bias, the local message passing mechanism suffers from pathological issues such as over-smoothing, over-squashing, and limited node-level expressivity. To address these limitations we propose Bundle Neural Networks (BuNN), a new type of GNN that operates via message diffusion over flat vector bundles - structures analogous to connections on Riemannian manifolds that augment the graph by assigning to each node a vector space and an orthogonal map. A BuNN layer evolves the features according to a diffusion-type partial differential equation. When discretized, BuNNs are a special case of Sheaf Neural Networks (SNNs), a recently proposed MPNN capable of mitigating over-smoothing. The continuous nature of message diffusion enables BuNNs to operate on larger scales of the graph and, therefore, to mitigate over-squashing. Finally, we prove that BuNN can approximate any feature transformation over nodes on any (potentially infinite) family of graphs given injective positional encodings, resulting in universal node-level expressivity. We support our theory via synthetic experiments and showcase the strong empirical performance of BuNNs over a range of real-world tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results on several standard benchmarks in transductive and inductive settings.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLM) based end-to-end task-oriented dialog (TOD) systems built using few-shot (in-context) learning perform better than supervised models only when the train data is limited. This is due to the inherent ability of LLMs to learn any task with just a few demonstrations. As the number of train dialogs increases, supervised SoTA models surpass in-context learning LLMs as they learn to better align with the style of the system responses in the training data, which LLMs struggle to mimic. In response, we propose SyncTOD, which synergizes LLMs with useful hints about the task for improved alignment. At a high level, SyncTOD trains auxiliary models to provide these hints and select exemplars for the in-context prompts. With ChatGPT, SyncTOD achieves superior performance compared to LLM-based baselines and SoTA models in low-data settings, while retaining competitive performance in full-data settings</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Self-supervised features are the cornerstone of modern machine learning systems. They are typically pre-trained on data collections whose construction and curation typically require extensive human effort. This manual process has some limitations similar to those encountered in supervised learning, e.g., the crowd-sourced selection of data is costly and time-consuming, preventing scaling the dataset size. In this work, we consider the problem of automatic curation of high-quality datasets for self-supervised pre-training. We posit that such datasets should be large, diverse and balanced, and propose a clustering-based approach for building ones satisfying all these criteria. Our method involves successive and hierarchical applications of $k$-means on a large and diverse data repository to obtain clusters that distribute uniformly among data concepts, followed by a hierarchical, balanced sampling step from these clusters. Extensive experiments on three different data domains including web-based images, satellite images and text show that features trained on our automatically curated datasets outperform those trained on uncurated data while being on par or better than ones trained on manually curated data.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In-context learning (ICL), the remarkable ability to solve a task from only input exemplars, has commonly been assumed to be a unique hallmark of Transformer models. In this study, we demonstrate that multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) can also learn in-context. Moreover, we find that MLPs, and the closely related MLP-Mixer models, learn in-context competitively with Transformers given the same compute budget. We further show that MLPs outperform Transformers on a subset of ICL tasks designed to test relational reasoning. These results suggest that in-context learning is not exclusive to Transformers and highlight the potential of exploring this phenomenon beyond attention-based architectures. In addition, MLPs' surprising success on relational tasks challenges prior assumptions about simple connectionist models. Altogether, our results endorse the broad trend that ``less inductive bias is better" and contribute to the growing interest in all-MLP alternatives to task-specific architectures.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Monocular camera calibration is a key precondition for numerous 3D vision applications. Despite considerable advancements, existing methods often hinge on specific assumptions and struggle to generalize across varied real-world scenarios, and the performance is limited by insufficient training data. Recently, diffusion models trained on expansive datasets have been confirmed to maintain the capability to generate diverse, high-quality images. This success suggests a strong potential of the models to effectively understand varied visual information. In this work, we leverage the comprehensive visual knowledge embedded in pre-trained diffusion models to enable more robust and accurate monocular camera intrinsic estimation. Specifically, we reformulate the problem of estimating the four degrees of freedom (4-DoF) of camera intrinsic parameters as a dense incident map generation task. The map details the angle of incidence for each pixel in the RGB image, and its format aligns well with the paradigm of diffusion models. The camera intrinsic then can be derived from the incident map with a simple non-learning RANSAC algorithm during inference. Moreover, to further enhance the performance, we jointly estimate a depth map to provide extra geometric information for the incident map estimation. Extensive experiments on multiple testing datasets demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance, gaining up to a 40% reduction in prediction errors. Besides, the experiments also show that the precise camera intrinsic and depth maps estimated by our pipeline can greatly benefit practical applications such as 3D reconstruction from a single in-the-wild image.</li>

          GECKO: Generative Language Model for English, Code and Korean(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce GECKO, a bilingual large language model (LLM) optimized for Korean and English, along with programming languages. GECKO is pretrained on the balanced, high-quality corpus of Korean and English employing LLaMA architecture. In this report, we share the experiences of several efforts to build a better data pipeline for the corpus and to train our model. GECKO shows great efficiency in token generations for both Korean and English, despite its small size of vocabulary. We measure the performance on the representative benchmarks in terms of Korean, English and Code, and it exhibits great performance on KMMLU (Korean MMLU) and modest performance in English and Code, even with its smaller number of trained tokens compared to English-focused LLMs. GECKO is available to the open-source community under a permissive license. We hope our work offers a research baseline and practical insights for Korean LLM research. The model can be found at: this https URL</li>

          Consistency of Neural Causal Partial Identification(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent progress in Neural Causal Models (NCMs) showcased how identification and partial identification of causal effects can be automatically carried out via training of neural generative models that respect the constraints encoded in a given causal graph [Xia et al. 2022, Balazadeh et al. 2022]. However, formal consistency of these methods has only been proven for the case of discrete variables or only for linear causal models. In this work, we prove consistency of partial identification via NCMs in a general setting with both continuous and categorical variables. Further, our results highlight the impact of the design of the underlying neural network architecture in terms of depth and connectivity as well as the importance of applying Lipschitz regularization in the training phase. In particular, we provide a counterexample showing that without Lipschitz regularization the NCM may not be asymptotically consistent. Our results are enabled by new results on the approximability of structural causal models via neural generative models, together with an analysis of the sample complexity of the resulting architectures and how that translates into an error in the constrained optimization problem that defines the partial identification bounds.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Unsupervised 3D object detection methods have emerged to leverage vast amounts of data efficiently without requiring manual labels for training. Recent approaches rely on dynamic objects for learning to detect objects but penalize the detections of static instances during training. Multiple rounds of (self) training are used in which detected static instances are added to the set of training targets; this procedure to improve performance is computationally expensive. To address this, we propose the method UNION. We use spatial clustering and self-supervised scene flow to obtain a set of static and dynamic object proposals from LiDAR. Subsequently, object proposals' visual appearances are encoded to distinguish static objects in the foreground and background by selecting static instances that are visually similar to dynamic objects. As a result, static and dynamic foreground objects are obtained together, and existing detectors can be trained with a single training. In addition, we extend 3D object discovery to detection by using object appearance-based cluster labels as pseudo-class labels for training object classification. We conduct extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset and increase the state-of-the-art performance for unsupervised object discovery, i.e. UNION more than doubles the average precision to 33.9. The code will be made publicly available.</li>

          The Impact of Geometric Complexity on Neural Collapse in Transfer Learning(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Many of the recent remarkable advances in computer vision and language models can be attributed to the success of transfer learning via the pre-training of large foundation models. However, a theoretical framework which explains this empirical success is incomplete and remains an active area of research. Flatness of the loss surface and neural collapse have recently emerged as useful pre-training metrics which shed light on the implicit biases underlying pre-training. In this paper, we explore the geometric complexity of a model's learned representations as a fundamental mechanism that relates these two concepts. We show through experiments and theory that mechanisms which affect the geometric complexity of the pre-trained network also influence the neural collapse. Furthermore, we show how this effect of the geometric complexity generalizes to the neural collapse of new classes as well, thus encouraging better performance on downstream tasks, particularly in the few-shot setting.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>When solving ill-posed inverse problems, one often desires to explore the space of potential solutions rather than be presented with a single plausible reconstruction. Valuable insights into these feasible solutions and their associated probabilities are embedded in the posterior distribution. However, when confronted with data of high dimensionality (such as images), visualizing this distribution becomes a formidable challenge, necessitating the application of effective summarization techniques before user examination. In this work, we introduce a new approach for visualizing posteriors across multiple levels of granularity using tree-valued predictions. Our method predicts a tree-valued hierarchical summarization of the posterior distribution for any input measurement, in a single forward pass of a neural network. We showcase the efficacy of our approach across diverse datasets and image restoration challenges, highlighting its prowess in uncertainty quantification and visualization. Our findings reveal that our method performs comparably to a baseline that hierarchically clusters samples from a diffusion-based posterior sampler, yet achieves this with orders of magnitude greater speed.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Softmax attention is the principle backbone of foundation models for various artificial intelligence applications, yet its quadratic complexity in sequence length can limit its inference throughput in long-context settings. To address this challenge, alternative architectures such as linear attention, State Space Models (SSMs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been considered as more efficient alternatives. While connections between these approaches exist, such models are commonly developed in isolation and there is a lack of theoretical understanding of the shared principles underpinning these architectures and their subtle differences, greatly influencing performance and scalability. In this paper, we introduce the Dynamical Systems Framework (DSF), which allows a principled investigation of all these architectures in a common representation. Our framework facilitates rigorous comparisons, providing new insights on the distinctive characteristics of each model class. For instance, we compare linear attention and selective SSMs, detailing their differences and conditions under which both are equivalent. We also provide principled comparisons between softmax attention and other model classes, discussing the theoretical conditions under which softmax attention can be approximated. Additionally, we substantiate these new insights with empirical validations and mathematical arguments. This shows the DSF's potential to guide the systematic development of future more efficient and scalable foundation models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper introduces StreamV2V, a diffusion model that achieves real-time streaming video-to-video (V2V) translation with user prompts. Unlike prior V2V methods using batches to process limited frames, we opt to process frames in a streaming fashion, to support unlimited frames. At the heart of StreamV2V lies a backward-looking principle that relates the present to the past. This is realized by maintaining a feature bank, which archives information from past frames. For incoming frames, StreamV2V extends self-attention to include banked keys and values and directly fuses similar past features into the output. The feature bank is continually updated by merging stored and new features, making it compact but informative. StreamV2V stands out for its adaptability and efficiency, seamlessly integrating with image diffusion models without fine-tuning. It can run 20 FPS on one A100 GPU, being 15x, 46x, 108x, and 158x faster than FlowVid, CoDeF, Rerender, and TokenFlow, respectively. Quantitative metrics and user studies confirm StreamV2V's exceptional ability to maintain temporal consistency.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent talking avatar generation models have made strides in achieving realistic and accurate lip synchronization with the audio, but often fall short in controlling and conveying detailed expressions and emotions of the avatar, making the generated video less vivid and controllable. In this paper, we propose a novel text-guided approach for generating emotionally expressive 2D avatars, offering fine-grained control, improved interactivity, and generalizability to the resulting video. Our framework, named InstructAvatar, leverages a natural language interface to control the emotion as well as the facial motion of avatars. Technically, we design an automatic annotation pipeline to construct an instruction-video paired training dataset, equipped with a novel two-branch diffusion-based generator to predict avatars with audio and text instructions at the same time. Experimental results demonstrate that InstructAvatar produces results that align well with both conditions, and outperforms existing methods in fine-grained emotion control, lip-sync quality, and naturalness.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Drag-based image editing using generative models provides precise control over image contents, enabling users to manipulate anything in an image with a few clicks. However, prevailing methods typically adopt $n$-step iterations for latent semantic optimization to achieve drag-based image editing, which is time-consuming and limits practical applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel one-step drag-based image editing method, i.e., FastDrag, to accelerate the editing process. Central to our approach is a latent warpage function (LWF), which simulates the behavior of a stretched material to adjust the location of individual pixels within the latent space. This innovation achieves one-step latent semantic optimization and hence significantly promotes editing speeds. Meanwhile, null regions emerging after applying LWF are addressed by our proposed bilateral nearest neighbor interpolation (BNNI) strategy. This strategy interpolates these regions using similar features from neighboring areas, thus enhancing semantic integrity. Additionally, a consistency-preserving strategy is introduced to maintain the consistency between the edited and original images by adopting semantic information from the original image, saved as key and value pairs in self-attention module during diffusion inversion, to guide the diffusion sampling. Our FastDrag is validated on the DragBench dataset, demonstrating substantial improvements in processing time over existing methods, while achieving enhanced editing performance.</li>
