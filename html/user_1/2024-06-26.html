<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this research, patent prosecution is conceptualized as a system of reinforcement learning from human feedback. The objective of the system is to increase the likelihood for a language model to generate patent claims that have a higher chance of being granted. To showcase the controllability of the language model, the system learns from granted patents and pre-grant applications with different rewards. The status of "granted" and "pre-grant" are perceived as labeled human feedback implicitly. In addition, specific to patent drafting, the experiments in this research demonstrate the model's capability to learn from adjusting claim length and inclusion of limiting terms for narrowing claim scope. As proof of concept, the experiments focus on claim ones only and the training data originates from a patent dataset tailored specifically for artificial intelligence. Although the available human feedback in patent prosecution are limited and the quality of generated patent text requires improvement, the experiments following the 3-stage reinforcement learning from human feedback have demonstrated that generative language models are capable of reflecting the human feedback or intent in patent prosecution. To enhance the usability of language models, the implementation in this research utilizes modern techniques that enable execution on a single consumer-grade GPU. The demonstrated proof of concept, which reduces hardware requirements, will prove valuable in the future as more human feedback in patent prosecution become available for broader use, either within patent offices or in the public domain.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Data assimilation of observational data into full atmospheric states is essential for weather forecast model initialization. Recently, methods for deep generative data assimilation have been proposed which allow for using new input data without retraining the model. They could also dramatically accelerate the costly data assimilation process used in operational regional weather models. Here, in a central US testbed, we demonstrate the viability of score-based data assimilation in the context of realistically complex km-scale weather. We train an unconditional diffusion model to generate snapshots of a state-of-the-art km-scale analysis product, the High Resolution Rapid Refresh. Then, using score-based data assimilation to incorporate sparse weather station data, the model produces maps of precipitation and surface winds. The generated fields display physically plausible structures, such as gust fronts, and sensitivity tests confirm learnt physics through multivariate relationships. Preliminary skill analysis shows the approach already outperforms a naive baseline of the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh system itself. By incorporating observations from 40 weather stations, 10\% lower RMSEs on left-out stations are attained. Despite some lingering imperfections such as insufficiently disperse ensemble DA estimates, we find the results overall an encouraging proof of concept, and the first at km-scale. It is a ripe time to explore extensions that combine increasingly ambitious regional state generators with an increasing set of in situ, ground-based, and satellite remote sensing data streams.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have positioned deep learning (DL) as a pivotal technology in fields like computer vision, data mining, and natural language processing. A critical factor in DL performance is the selection of neural network architecture. Traditional predefined architectures often fail to adapt to different data distributions, making it challenging to achieve optimal performance. Neural architecture search (NAS) offers a solution by automatically designing architectures tailored to specific datasets. However, the effectiveness of NAS diminishes on long-tailed datasets, where a few classes have abundant samples, and many have few, leading to biased this http URL this paper, we explore to improve the searching and training performance of NAS on long-tailed datasets. Specifically, we first discuss the related works about NAS and the deep learning method for long-tailed datasets.Then, we focus on an existing work, called SSF-NAS, which integrates the self-supervised learning and fair differentiable NAS to making NAS achieve better performance on long-tailed this http URL detailed description about the fundamental techniques for SSF-NAS is provided in this paper, including DARTS, FairDARTS, and Barlow Twins. Finally, we conducted a series of experiments on the CIFAR10-LT dataset for performance evaluation, where the results are align with our expectation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models (DMs) have achieved significant success in generating imaginative images given textual descriptions. However, they are likely to fall short when it comes to real-life scenarios with intricate details.The low-quality, unrealistic human faces in text-to-image generation are one of the most prominent issues, hindering the wide application of DMs in practice. Targeting addressing such an issue, we first assess the face quality of generations from popular pre-trained DMs with the aid of human annotators and then evaluate the alignment between existing metrics such as ImageReward, Human Preference Score, Aesthetic Score Predictor, and Face Quality Assessment, with human judgments. Observing that existing metrics can be unsatisfactory for quantifying face quality, we develop a novel metric named Face Score (FS) by fine-tuning ImageReward on a dataset of (good, bad) face pairs cheaply crafted by an inpainting pipeline of DMs. Extensive studies reveal that FS enjoys a superior alignment with humans. On the other hand, FS opens up the door for refining DMs for better face generation. To achieve this, we incorporate a guidance loss on the denoising trajectories of the aforementioned face pairs for fine-tuning pre-trained DMs such as Stable Diffusion V1.5 and Realistic Vision V5.1. Intuitively, such a loss pushes the trajectory of bad faces toward that of good ones. Comprehensive experiments verify the efficacy of our approach for improving face quality while preserving general capability.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative, anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As telecommunications networks become increasingly complex, the integration of advanced technologies such as network digital twins and generative artificial intelligence (AI) emerges as a pivotal solution to enhance network operations and resilience. This paper explores the synergy between network digital twins, which provide a dynamic virtual representation of physical networks, and generative AI, particularly focusing on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). We propose a novel architectural framework that incorporates these technologies to significantly improve predictive maintenance, network scenario simulation, and real-time data-driven decision-making. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate how generative AI can enhance the accuracy and operational efficiency of network digital twins, effectively handling real-world complexities such as unpredictable traffic loads and network failures. The findings suggest that this integration not only boosts the capability of digital twins in scenario forecasting and anomaly detection but also facilitates a more adaptive and intelligent network management system.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Efficient training and inference algorithms, such as low-rank adaption and model pruning, have shown impressive performance for learning Transformer-based large foundation models. However, due to the technical challenges of the non-convex optimization caused by the complicated architecture of Transformers, the theoretical study of why these methods can be applied to learn Transformers is mostly elusive. To the best of our knowledge, this paper shows the first theoretical analysis of the property of low-rank and sparsity of one-layer Transformers by characterizing the trained model after convergence using stochastic gradient descent. By focusing on a data model based on label-relevant and label-irrelevant patterns, we quantify that the gradient updates of trainable parameters are low-rank, which depends on the number of label-relevant patterns. We also analyze how model pruning affects the generalization while improving computation efficiency and conclude that proper magnitude-based pruning has a slight effect on the testing performance. We implement numerical experiments to support our findings.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper introduces a robust zero-trust architecture (ZTA) tailored for the decentralized system that empowers efficient remote work and collaboration within IoT networks. Using blockchain-based federated learning principles, our proposed framework includes a robust aggregation mechanism designed to counteract malicious updates from compromised clients, enhancing the security of the global learning process. Moreover, secure and reliable trust computation is essential for remote work and collaboration. The robust ZTA framework integrates anomaly detection and trust computation, ensuring secure and reliable device collaboration in a decentralized fashion. We introduce an adaptive algorithm that dynamically adjusts to varying user contexts, using unsupervised clustering to detect novel anomalies, like zero-day attacks. To ensure a reliable and scalable trust computation, we develop an algorithm that dynamically adapts to varying user contexts by employing incremental anomaly detection and clustering techniques to identify and share local and global anomalies between nodes. Future directions include scalability improvements, Dirichlet process for advanced anomaly detection, privacy-preserving techniques, and the integration of post-quantum cryptographic methods to safeguard against emerging quantum threats.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Graph matching has important applications in pattern recognition and beyond. Current approaches predominantly adopt supervised learning, demanding extensive labeled data which can be limited or costly. Meanwhile, self-supervised learning methods for graph matching often require additional side information such as extra categorical information and input features, limiting their application to the general case. Moreover, designing the optimal graph augmentations for self-supervised graph matching presents another challenge to ensure robustness and efficacy. To address these issues, we introduce a novel Graph-centric Contrastive framework for Graph Matching (GCGM), capitalizing on a vast pool of graph augmentations for contrastive learning, yet without needing any side information. Given the variety of augmentation choices, we further introduce a Boosting-inspired Adaptive Augmentation Sampler (BiAS), which adaptively selects more challenging augmentations tailored for graph matching. Through various experiments, our GCGM surpasses state-of-the-art self-supervised methods across various datasets, marking a significant step toward more effective, efficient and general graph matching.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the realm of medical imaging, leveraging large-scale datasets from various institutions is crucial for developing precise deep learning models, yet privacy concerns frequently impede data sharing. federated learning (FL) emerges as a prominent solution for preserving privacy while facilitating collaborative learning. However, its application in real-world scenarios faces several obstacles, such as task & data heterogeneity, label scarcity, non-identically distributed (non-IID) data, computational vaiation, etc. In real-world, medical institutions may not want to disclose their tasks to FL server and generalization challenge of out-of-network institutions with un-seen task want to join the on-going federated system. This study address task-agnostic and generalization problem on un-seen tasks by adapting self-supervised FL framework. Utilizing Vision Transformer (ViT) as consensus feature encoder for self-supervised pre-training, no initial labels required, the framework enabling effective representation learning across diverse datasets and tasks. Our extensive evaluations, using various real-world non-IID medical imaging datasets, validate our approach's efficacy, retaining 90\% of F1 accuracy with only 5\% of the training data typically required for centralized approaches and exhibiting superior adaptability to out-of-distribution task. The result indicate that federated learning architecture can be a potential approach toward multi-task foundation modeling.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Although recent years have witnessed significant advancements in image editing thanks to the remarkable progress of text-to-image diffusion models, the problem of non-rigid image editing still presents its complexities and challenges. Existing methods often fail to achieve consistent results due to the absence of unique identity characteristics. Thus, learning a personalized identity prior might help with consistency in the edited results. In this paper, we explore a novel task: learning the personalized identity prior for text-based non-rigid image editing. To address the problems in jointly learning prior and editing the image, we present LIPE, a two-stage framework designed to customize the generative model utilizing a limited set of images of the same subject, and subsequently employ the model with learned prior for non-rigid image editing. Experimental results demonstrate the advantages of our approach in various editing scenarios over past related leading methods in qualitative and quantitative ways.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The challenge of limited availability of data for training in machine learning arises in many applications and the impact on performance and generalization is serious. Traditional data augmentation methods aim to enhance training with a moderately sufficient data set. Generative models like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) often face problematic convergence when generating significant and diverse data samples. Diffusion models, though effective, still struggle with high computational cost and long training times. This paper introduces an innovative Expansive Synthesis model that generates large-scale, high-fidelity datasets from minimal samples. The proposed approach exploits expander graph mappings and feature interpolation to synthesize expanded datasets while preserving the intrinsic data distribution and feature structural relationships. The rationale of the model is rooted in the non-linear property of neural networks' latent space and in its capture by a Koopman operator to yield a linear space of features to facilitate the construction of larger and enriched consistent datasets starting with a much smaller dataset. This process is optimized by an autoencoder architecture enhanced with self-attention layers and further refined for distributional consistency by optimal transport. We validate our Expansive Synthesis by training classifiers on the generated datasets and comparing their performance to classifiers trained on larger, original datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that classifiers trained on synthesized data achieve performance metrics on par with those trained on full-scale datasets, showcasing the model's potential to effectively augment training data. This work represents a significant advancement in data generation, offering a robust solution to data scarcity and paving the way for enhanced data availability in machine learning applications.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Video frame interpolation (VFI) aims to synthesize intermediate frames in between existing frames to enhance visual smoothness and quality. Beyond the conventional methods based on the reconstruction loss, recent works employ the high quality generative models for perceptual quality. However, they require complex training and large computational cost for modeling on the pixel space. In this paper, we introduce disentangled Motion Modeling (MoMo), a diffusion-based approach for VFI that enhances visual quality by focusing on intermediate motion modeling. We propose disentangled two-stage training process, initially training a frame synthesis model to generate frames from input pairs and their optical flows. Subsequently, we propose a motion diffusion model, equipped with our novel diffusion U-Net architecture designed for optical flow, to produce bi-directional flows between frames. This method, by leveraging the simpler low-frequency representation of motions, achieves superior perceptual quality with reduced computational demands compared to generative modeling methods on the pixel space. Our method surpasses state-of-the-art methods in perceptual metrics across various benchmarks, demonstrating its efficacy and efficiency in VFI. Our code is available at: this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In task-oriented conversational AI evaluation, unsupervised methods poorly correlate with human judgments, and supervised approaches lack generalization. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) show robust zeroshot and few-shot capabilities across NLP tasks. This paper explores using LLMs for automated dialogue quality evaluation, experimenting with various configurations on public and proprietary datasets. Manipulating factors such as model size, in-context examples, and selection techniques, we examine "chain-of-thought" (CoT) reasoning and label extraction procedures. Our results show that (1) larger models yield more accurate dialogue labels; (2) algorithmic selection of in-context examples outperforms random selection; (3) CoT reasoning where an LLM is asked to provide justifications before outputting final labels improves performance; and (4) fine-tuned LLMs outperform out-of-the-box ones. Our results indicate that LLMs that are suitably fine-tuned and have sufficient reasoning capabilities can be leveraged for automated dialogue evaluation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Graph diffusion models have emerged as state-of-the-art techniques in graph generation, yet integrating domain knowledge into these models remains challenging. Domain knowledge is particularly important in real-world scenarios, where invalid generated graphs hinder deployment in practical applications. Unconstrained and conditioned graph generative models fail to guarantee such domain-specific structural properties. We present ConStruct, a novel framework that allows for hard-constraining graph diffusion models to incorporate specific properties, such as planarity or acyclicity. Our approach ensures that the sampled graphs remain within the domain of graphs that verify the specified property throughout the entire trajectory in both the forward and reverse processes. This is achieved by introducing a specific edge-absorbing noise model and a new projector operator. ConStruct demonstrates versatility across several structural and edge-deletion invariant constraints and achieves state-of-the-art performance for both synthetic benchmarks and attributed real-world datasets. For example, by leveraging planarity in digital pathology graph datasets, the proposed method outperforms existing baselines and enhances generated data validity by up to 71.1 percentage points.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the field of 2D image generation modeling and representation learning, Masked Generative Encoder (MAGE) has demonstrated the synergistic potential between generative modeling and representation learning. Inspired by this, we propose Point-MAGE to extend this concept to point cloud data. Specifically, this framework first utilizes a Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQVAE) to reconstruct a neural field representation of 3D shapes, thereby learning discrete semantic features of point patches. Subsequently, by combining the masking model with variable masking ratios, we achieve synchronous training for both generation and representation learning. Furthermore, our framework seamlessly integrates with existing point cloud self-supervised learning (SSL) models, thereby enhancing their performance. We extensively evaluate the representation learning and generation capabilities of Point-MAGE. In shape classification tasks, Point-MAGE achieved an accuracy of 94.2% on the ModelNet40 dataset and 92.9% (+1.3%) on the ScanObjectNN dataset. Additionally, it achieved new state-of-the-art performance in few-shot learning and part segmentation tasks. Experimental results also confirmed that Point-MAGE can generate detailed and high-quality 3D shapes in both unconditional and conditional settings.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advancements in diffusion models, particularly the trend of architectural transformation from UNet-based Diffusion to Diffusion Transformer (DiT), have significantly improved the quality and scalability of image synthesis. Despite the incredible generative quality, the large computational requirements of these large-scale models significantly hinder the deployments in real-world scenarios. Post-training Quantization (PTQ) offers a promising solution by compressing model sizes and speeding up inference for the pretrained models while eliminating model retraining. However, we have observed the existing PTQ frameworks exclusively designed for both ViT and conventional Diffusion models fall into biased quantization and result in remarkable performance degradation. In this paper, we find that the DiTs typically exhibit considerable variance in terms of both weight and activation, which easily runs out of the limited numerical representations. To address this issue, we devise Q-DiT, which seamlessly integrates three techniques: fine-grained quantization to manage substantial variance across input channels of weights and activations, an automatic search strategy to optimize the quantization granularity and mitigate redundancies, and dynamic activation quantization to capture the activation changes across timesteps. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Q-DiT. Specifically, when quantizing DiT-XL/2 to W8A8 on ImageNet 256x256, Q-DiT achieves a remarkable reduction in FID by 1.26 compared to the baseline. Under a W4A8 setting, it maintains high fidelity in image generation, showcasing only a marginal increase in FID and setting a new benchmark for efficient, high-quality quantization in diffusion transformers.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Low-resource languages, by its very definition, tend to be under represented in the pre-training corpora of Large Language Models. In this work, we investigate three low-resource cross-lingual approaches that enable an LLM adapt to tasks in previously unseen languages. Llama-2 is an LLM where Indic languages, among many other language families, contribute to less than $0.005\%$ of the total $2$ trillion token pre-training corpora. In this work, we experiment with the English-dominated Llama-2 for cross-lingual transfer to three Indic languages, Bengali, Hindi, and Tamil as target languages. We study three approaches for cross-lingual transfer, under ICL and fine-tuning. One, we find that adding additional supervisory signals via a dominant language in the LLM, leads to improvements, both under in-context learning and fine-tuning. Two, adapting the target languages to word reordering may be beneficial under ICL, but its impact diminishes with fine tuning. Finally, continued pre-training in one low-resource language can improve model performance for other related low-resource languages.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text embeddings from large language models (LLMs) have achieved excellent results in tasks such as information retrieval, semantic textual similarity, etc. In this work, we show an interesting finding: when feeding a text into the embedding LLMs, the obtained text embedding will be able to be aligned with the key tokens in the input text. We first fully analyze this phenomenon on eight embedding LLMs and show that this phenomenon is universal and is not affected by model architecture, training strategy, and embedding method. With a deeper analysis, we then find that the main change in embedding space between the embedding LLMs and their original generative LLMs is in the first principal component. By adjusting the first principal component, we can align text embedding with the key tokens. Finally, we give several examples to demonstrate the vast application potential of this finding: (1) we propose a simple and practical sparse retrieval method based on the aligned tokens, which can achieve 80\% of the dense retrieval effect of the same model while reducing the computation significantly; (2) we show that our findings provide a fresh perspective to help understand fuzzy concepts (e.g., semantic relatedness vs. semantic similarity) and emerging technologies (e.g., instruction-following embedding) in this field.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text-based 2D diffusion models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in image generation and editing. Meanwhile, the 2D diffusion models also exhibit substantial potentials for 3D editing tasks. However, how to achieve consistent edits across multiple viewpoints remains a challenge. While the iterative dataset update method is capable of achieving global consistency, it suffers from slow convergence and over-smoothed textures. We propose SyncNoise, a novel geometry-guided multi-view consistent noise editing approach for high-fidelity 3D scene editing. SyncNoise synchronously edits multiple views with 2D diffusion models while enforcing multi-view noise predictions to be geometrically consistent, which ensures global consistency in both semantic structure and low-frequency appearance. To further enhance local consistency in high-frequency details, we set a group of anchor views and propagate them to their neighboring frames through cross-view reprojection. To improve the reliability of multi-view correspondences, we introduce depth supervision during training to enhance the reconstruction of precise geometries. Our method achieves high-quality 3D editing results respecting the textual instructions, especially in scenes with complex textures, by enhancing geometric consistency at the noise and pixel levels.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>To sample from an unconditionally trained Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM), classifier guidance adds conditional information during sampling, but the gradients from classifiers, especially those not trained on noisy images, are often unstable. This study conducts a gradient analysis comparing robust and non-robust classifiers, as well as multiple gradient stabilization techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that these techniques significantly improve the quality of class-conditional samples for non-robust classifiers by providing more stable and informative classifier guidance gradients. The findings highlight the importance of gradient stability in enhancing the performance of classifier guidance, especially on non-robust classifiers.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Nowadays, data augmentation through synthetic data has been widely used in the field of Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) to alleviate the problem of data scarcity. However, these synthetic data are mainly used in the pre-training phase rather than the data-limited fine-tuning phase due to inconsistent error distribution and noisy labels. In this paper, we propose a synthetic data construction method based on contextual augmentation, which can ensure an efficient augmentation of the original data with a more consistent error distribution. Specifically, we combine rule-based substitution with model-based generation, using the generative model to generate a richer context for the extracted error patterns. Besides, we also propose a relabeling-based data cleaning method to mitigate the effects of noisy labels in synthetic data. Experiments on CoNLL14 and BEA19-Test show that our proposed augmentation method consistently and substantially outperforms strong baselines and achieves the state-of-the-art level with only a few synthetic data.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vision transformers combined with self-supervised learning have enabled the development of models which scale across large datasets for several downstream tasks like classification, segmentation and detection. The low-shot learning capability of these models, across several low-shot downstream tasks, has been largely under explored. We perform a system level study of different self supervised pretext tasks, namely contrastive learning, clustering, and masked image modelling for their low-shot capabilities by comparing the pretrained models. In addition we also study the effects of collapse avoidance methods, namely centring, ME-MAX, sinkhorn, on these downstream tasks. Based on our detailed analysis, we introduce a framework involving both mask image modelling and clustering as pretext tasks, which performs better across all low-shot downstream tasks, including multi-class classification, multi-label classification and semantic segmentation. Furthermore, when testing the model on full scale datasets, we show performance gains in multi-class classification, multi-label classification and semantic segmentation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models generate high-quality samples by corrupting data with Gaussian noise and iteratively reconstructing it with deep learning, slowly transforming noisy images into refined outputs. Understanding this data evolution is important for interpretability but is complex due to its high-dimensional evolutionary nature. While traditional dimensionality reduction methods like t-distributed stochastic neighborhood embedding (t-SNE) aid in understanding high-dimensional spaces, they neglect evolutionary structure preservation. Hence, we propose Tree of Diffusion Life (TDL), a method to understand data evolution in the generative process of diffusion models. TDL samples a diffusion model's generative space via instances with varying prompts and employs image encoders to extract semantic meaning from these samples, projecting them to an intermediate space. It employs a novel evolutionary embedding algorithm that explicitly encodes the iterations while preserving the high-dimensional relations, facilitating the visualization of data evolution. This embedding leverages three metrics: a standard t-SNE loss to group semantically similar elements, a displacement loss to group elements from the same iteration step, and an instance alignment loss to align elements of the same instance across iterations. We present rectilinear and radial layouts to represent iterations, enabling comprehensive exploration. We assess various feature extractors and highlight TDL's potential with prominent diffusion models like GLIDE and Stable Diffusion with different prompt sets. TDL simplifies understanding data evolution within diffusion models, offering valuable insights into their functioning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Tool learning aims to enhance and expand large language models' (LLMs) capabilities with external tools, which has gained significant attention recently. Current methods have shown that LLMs can effectively handle a certain amount of tools through in-context learning or fine-tuning. However, in real-world scenarios, the number of tools is typically extensive and irregularly updated, emphasizing the necessity for a dedicated tool retrieval component. Tool retrieval is nontrivial due to the following challenges: 1) complex user instructions and tool descriptions; 2) misalignment between tool retrieval and tool usage models. To address the above issues, we propose to enhance tool retrieval with iterative feedback from the large language model. Specifically, we prompt the tool usage model, i.e., the LLM, to provide feedback for the tool retriever model in multi-round, which could progressively improve the tool retriever's understanding of instructions and tools and reduce the gap between the two standalone components. We build a unified and comprehensive benchmark to evaluate tool retrieval models. The extensive experiments indicate that our proposed approach achieves advanced performance in both in-domain evaluation and out-of-domain evaluation.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The usage of medical image data for the training of large-scale machine learning approaches is particularly challenging due to its scarce availability and the costly generation of data annotations, typically requiring the engagement of medical professionals. The rapid development of generative models allows towards tackling this problem by leveraging large amounts of realistic synthetically generated data for the training process. However, randomly choosing synthetic samples, might not be an optimal strategy. In this work, we investigate the targeted generation of synthetic training data, in order to improve the accuracy and robustness of image classification. Therefore, our approach aims to guide the generative model to synthesize data with high epistemic uncertainty, since large measures of epistemic uncertainty indicate underrepresented data points in the training set. During the image generation we feed images reconstructed by an auto encoder into the classifier and compute the mutual information over the class-probability distribution as a measure for uncertainty.We alter the feature space of the autoencoder through an optimization process with the objective of maximizing the classifier uncertainty on the decoded image. By training on such data we improve the performance and robustness against test time data augmentations and adversarial attacks on several classifications tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While numerous works have assessed the generative performance of language models (LMs) on tasks requiring Theory of Mind reasoning, research into the models' internal representation of mental states remains limited. Recent work has used probing to demonstrate that LMs can represent beliefs of themselves and others. However, these claims are accompanied by limited evaluation, making it difficult to assess how mental state representations are affected by model design and training choices. We report an extensive benchmark with various LM types with different model sizes, fine-tuning approaches, and prompt designs to study the robustness of mental state representations and memorisation issues within the probes. Our results show that the quality of models' internal representations of the beliefs of others increases with model size and, more crucially, with fine-tuning. We are the first to study how prompt variations impact probing performance on theory of mind tasks. We demonstrate that models' representations are sensitive to prompt variations, even when such variations should be beneficial. Finally, we complement previous activation editing experiments on Theory of Mind tasks and show that it is possible to improve models' reasoning performance by steering their activations without the need to train any probe.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Graph autoencoders (GAEs), as a kind of generative self-supervised learning approach, have shown great potential in recent years. GAEs typically rely on distance-based criteria, such as mean-square-error (MSE), to reconstruct the input graph. However, relying solely on a single reconstruction criterion may lead to a loss of distinctiveness in the reconstructed graph, causing nodes to collapse into similar representations and resulting in sub-optimal performance. To address this issue, we have developed a simple yet effective strategy to preserve the necessary distinctness in the reconstructed graph. Inspired by the knowledge distillation technique, we found that the dual encoder-decoder architecture of GAEs can be viewed as a teacher-student relationship. Therefore, we propose transferring the knowledge of distinctness from the raw graph to the reconstructed graph, achieved through a simple KL constraint. Specifically, we compute pairwise node similarity scores in the raw graph and reconstructed graph. During the training process, the KL constraint is optimized alongside the reconstruction criterion. We conducted extensive experiments across three types of graph tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness and generality of our strategy. This indicates that the proposed approach can be employed as a plug-and-play method to avoid vague reconstructions and enhance overall performance.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) exhibit a variety of promising capabilities in robotics, including long-horizon planning and commonsense reasoning. However, their performance in place recognition is still underexplored. In this work, we introduce multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) to visual place recognition (VPR), where a robot must localize itself using visual observations. Our key design is to use vision-based retrieval to propose several candidates and then leverage language-based reasoning to carefully inspect each candidate for a final decision. Specifically, we leverage the robust visual features produced by off-the-shelf vision foundation models (VFMs) to obtain several candidate locations. We then prompt an MLLM to describe the differences between the current observation and each candidate in a pairwise manner, and reason about the best candidate based on these descriptions. Our results on three datasets demonstrate that integrating the general-purpose visual features from VFMs with the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs already provides an effective place recognition solution, without any VPR-specific supervised training. We believe our work can inspire new possibilities for applying and designing foundation models, i.e., VFMs, LLMs, and MLLMs, to enhance the localization and navigation of mobile robots.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Hierarchical text classification (HTC) is an important task with broad applications, while few-shot HTC has gained increasing interest recently. While in-context learning (ICL) with large language models (LLMs) has achieved significant success in few-shot learning, it is not as effective for HTC because of the expansive hierarchical label sets and extremely-ambiguous labels. In this work, we introduce the first ICL-based framework with LLM for few-shot HTC. We exploit a retrieval database to identify relevant demonstrations, and an iterative policy to manage multi-layer hierarchical labels. Particularly, we equip the retrieval database with HTC label-aware representations for the input texts, which is achieved by continual training on a pretrained language model with masked language modeling (MLM), layer-wise classification (CLS, specifically for HTC), and a novel divergent contrastive learning (DCL, mainly for adjacent semantically-similar labels) objective. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance of our method, and we can achieve state-of-the-art results in few-shot HTC.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Over the past few decades, electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring has become a pivotal tool for diagnosing neurological disorders, particularly for detecting seizures. Epilepsy, one of the most prevalent neurological diseases worldwide, affects approximately the 1 \% of the population. These patients face significant risks, underscoring the need for reliable, continuous seizure monitoring in daily life. Most of the techniques discussed in the literature rely on supervised Machine Learning (ML) methods. However, the challenge of accurately labeling variations in epileptic EEG waveforms complicates the use of these approaches. Additionally, the rarity of ictal events introduces an high imbalancing within the data, which could lead to poor prediction performance in supervised learning approaches. Instead, a semi-supervised approach allows to train the model only on data not containing seizures, thus avoiding the issues related to the data imbalancing. This work proposes a semi-supervised approach for detecting epileptic seizures from EEG data, utilizing a novel Deep Learning-based method called SincVAE. This proposal incorporates the learning of an ad-hoc array of bandpass filter as a first layer of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE), potentially eliminating the preprocessing stage where informative band frequencies are identified and isolated. Results indicate that SincVAE improves seizure detection in EEG data and is capable of identifying early seizures during the preictal stage as well as monitoring patients throughout the postictal stage.</li>

Our approach eliminates the need for additional models specifically trained on segmentation data and is part of our submission to the CVPR 2024 workshop challenge, entitled CVPR 2024 workshop challenge "SyntaGen Harnessing Generative Models for Synthetic Visual Datasets". Our methodology uses self-attentions to facilitate a novel head-wise semantic information condensation, thereby enabling the direct acquisition of class-agnostic image segmentation from the Stable Diffusion latents. Furthermore, we employ non-prompt-influencing cross-attentions from text to pixel, thus facilitating the classification of the previously generated masks. Finally, we propose a mask refinement step by using only the output image by Stable Diffusion.</li>

          Detection of Synthetic Face Images: Accuracy, Robustness, Generalization(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>An experimental study on detecting synthetic face images is presented. We collected a dataset, called FF5, of five fake face image generators, including recent diffusion models. We find that a simple model trained on a specific image generator can achieve near-perfect accuracy in separating synthetic and real images. The model handles common image distortions (reduced resolution, compression) by using data augmentation. Moreover, partial manipulations, where synthetic images are blended into real ones by inpainting, are identified and the area of the manipulation is localized by a simple model of YOLO architecture. However, the model turned out to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks and does not generalize to unseen generators. Failure to generalize to detect images produced by a newer generator also occurs for recent state-of-the-art methods, which we tested on Realistic Vision, a fine-tuned version of StabilityAI's Stable Diffusion image generator.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advancements in 3D generation have leveraged synthetic datasets with ground truth 3D assets and predefined cameras. However, the potential of adopting real-world datasets, which can produce significantly more realistic 3D scenes, remains largely unexplored. In this work, we delve into the key challenge of the complex and scene-specific camera trajectories found in real-world captures. We introduce Director3D, a robust open-world text-to-3D generation framework, designed to generate both real-world 3D scenes and adaptive camera trajectories. To achieve this, (1) we first utilize a Trajectory Diffusion Transformer, acting as the Cinematographer, to model the distribution of camera trajectories based on textual descriptions. (2) Next, a Gaussian-driven Multi-view Latent Diffusion Model serves as the Decorator, modeling the image sequence distribution given the camera trajectories and texts. This model, fine-tuned from a 2D diffusion model, directly generates pixel-aligned 3D Gaussians as an immediate 3D scene representation for consistent denoising. (3) Lastly, the 3D Gaussians are refined by a novel SDS++ loss as the Detailer, which incorporates the prior of the 2D diffusion model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Director3D outperforms existing methods, offering superior performance in real-world 3D generation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The escalating sophistication of cyberattacks has encouraged the integration of machine learning techniques in intrusion detection systems, but the rise of adversarial examples presents a significant challenge. These crafted perturbations mislead ML models, enabling attackers to evade detection or trigger false alerts. As a reaction, adversarial purification has emerged as a compelling solution, particularly with diffusion models showing promising results. However, their purification potential remains unexplored in the context of intrusion detection. This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of diffusion models in purifying adversarial examples in network intrusion detection. Through a comprehensive analysis of the diffusion parameters, we identify optimal configurations maximizing adversarial robustness with minimal impact on normal performance. Importantly, this study reveals insights into the relationship between diffusion noise and diffusion steps, representing a novel contribution to the field. Our experiments are carried out on two datasets and against 5 adversarial attacks. The implementation code is publicly available.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we propose a novel approach to enhance medical image segmentation during test time. Instead of employing hand-crafted transforms or functions on the input test image to create multiple views for test-time augmentation, we advocate for the utilization of an advanced domain-fine-tuned generative model (GM), e.g., stable diffusion (SD), for test-time augmentation. Given that the GM has been trained to comprehend and encapsulate comprehensive domain data knowledge, it is superior than segmentation models in terms of representing the data characteristics and distribution. Hence, by integrating the GM into test-time augmentation, we can effectively generate multiple views of a given test sample, aligning with the content and appearance characteristics of the sample and the related local data distribution. This approach renders the augmentation process more adaptable and resilient compared to conventional handcrafted transforms. Comprehensive experiments conducted across three medical image segmentation tasks (nine datasets) demonstrate the efficacy and versatility of the proposed TTGA in enhancing segmentation outcomes. Moreover, TTGA significantly improves pixel-wise error estimation, thereby facilitating the deployment of a more reliable segmentation system. Code will be released at: this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Computational social science (CSS) practitioners often rely on human-labeled data to fine-tune supervised text classifiers. We assess the potential for researchers to augment or replace human-generated training data with surrogate training labels from generative large language models (LLMs). We introduce a recommended workflow and test this LLM application by replicating 14 classification tasks and measuring performance. We employ a novel corpus of English-language text classification data sets from recent CSS articles in high-impact journals. Because these data sets are stored in password-protected archives, our analyses are less prone to issues of contamination. For each task, we compare supervised classifiers fine-tuned using GPT-4 labels against classifiers fine-tuned with human annotations and against labels from GPT-4 and Mistral-7B with few-shot in-context learning. Our findings indicate that supervised classification models fine-tuned on LLM-generated labels perform comparably to models fine-tuned with labels from human annotators. Fine-tuning models using LLM-generated labels can be a fast, efficient and cost-effective method of building supervised text classifiers.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advancements in human preference optimization, initially developed for Language Models (LMs), have shown promise for text-to-image Diffusion Models, enhancing prompt alignment, visual appeal, and user preference. Unlike LMs, Diffusion Models typically optimize in pixel or VAE space, which does not align well with human perception, leading to slower and less efficient training during the preference alignment stage. We propose using a perceptual objective in the U-Net embedding space of the diffusion model to address these issues. Our approach involves fine-tuning Stable Diffusion 1.5 and XL using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Contrastive Preference Optimization (CPO), and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) within this embedding space. This method significantly outperforms standard latent-space implementations across various metrics, including quality and computational cost. For SDXL, our approach provides 60.8\% general preference, 62.2\% visual appeal, and 52.1\% prompt following against original open-sourced SDXL-DPO on the PartiPrompts dataset, while significantly reducing compute. Our approach not only improves the efficiency and quality of human preference alignment for diffusion models but is also easily integrable with other optimization techniques.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce LLM-ARC, a neuro-symbolic framework designed to enhance the logical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), by combining them with an Automated Reasoning Critic (ARC). LLM-ARC employs an Actor-Critic method where the LLM Actor generates declarative logic programs along with tests for semantic correctness, while the Automated Reasoning Critic evaluates the code, runs the tests and provides feedback on test failures for iterative refinement. Implemented using Answer Set Programming (ASP), LLM-ARC achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 88.32% on the FOLIO benchmark which tests complex logical reasoning capabilities. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements over LLM-only baselines, highlighting the importance of logic test generation and iterative self-refinement. We achieve our best result using a fully automated self-supervised training loop where the Actor is trained on end-to-end dialog traces with Critic feedback. We discuss potential enhancements and provide a detailed error analysis, showcasing the robustness and efficacy of LLM-ARC for complex natural language reasoning tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Tabular data is one of the most ubiquitous modalities, yet the literature on tabular generative foundation models is lagging far behind its text and vision counterparts. Creating such a model is hard, due to the heterogeneous feature spaces of different tabular datasets, tabular metadata (e.g. dataset description and feature headers), and tables lacking prior knowledge (e.g. feature order). In this work we propose LaTable: a novel tabular diffusion model that addresses these challenges and can be trained across different datasets. Through extensive experiments we find that LaTable outperforms baselines on in-distribution generation, and that finetuning LaTable can generate out-of-distribution datasets better with fewer samples. On the other hand, we explore the poor zero-shot performance of LaTable, and what it may teach us about building generative tabular foundation models with better zero- and few-shot generation capabilities.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose UAD, a method for vision-based end-to-end autonomous driving (E2EAD), achieving the best open-loop evaluation performance in nuScenes, meanwhile showing robust closed-loop driving quality in CARLA. Our motivation stems from the observation that current E2EAD models still mimic the modular architecture in typical driving stacks, with carefully designed supervised perception and prediction subtasks to provide environment information for oriented planning. Although achieving groundbreaking progress, such design has certain drawbacks: 1) preceding subtasks require massive high-quality 3D annotations as supervision, posing a significant impediment to scaling the training data; 2) each submodule entails substantial computation overhead in both training and inference. To this end, we propose UAD, an E2EAD framework with an unsupervised proxy to address all these issues. Firstly, we design a novel Angular Perception Pretext to eliminate the annotation requirement. The pretext models the driving scene by predicting the angular-wise spatial objectness and temporal dynamics, without manual annotation. Secondly, a self-supervised training strategy, which learns the consistency of the predicted trajectories under different augment views, is proposed to enhance the planning robustness in steering scenarios. Our UAD achieves 38.7% relative improvements over UniAD on the average collision rate in nuScenes and surpasses VAD for 41.32 points on the driving score in CARLA's Town05 Long benchmark. Moreover, the proposed method only consumes 44.3% training resources of UniAD and runs 3.4 times faster in inference. Our innovative design not only for the first time demonstrates unarguable performance advantages over supervised counterparts, but also enjoys unprecedented efficiency in data, training, and inference.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, self-supervised, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>At the core of both successful generative and self-supervised representation learning models there is a reconstruction objective that incorporates some form of image corruption. Diffusion models implement this approach through a scheduled Gaussian corruption process, while masked auto-encoder models do so by masking patches of the image. Despite their different approaches, the underlying similarity in their methodologies suggests a promising avenue for an auto-encoder capable of both de-noising tasks. We propose a unified self-supervised objective, dubbed Unified Masked Diffusion (UMD), that combines patch-based and noise-based corruption techniques within a single auto-encoding framework. Specifically, UMD modifies the diffusion transformer (DiT) training process by introducing an additional noise-free, high masking representation step in the diffusion noising schedule, and utilizes a mixed masked and noised image for subsequent timesteps. By integrating features useful for diffusion modeling and for predicting masked patch tokens, UMD achieves strong performance in downstream generative and representation learning tasks, including linear probing and class-conditional generation. This is achieved without the need for heavy data augmentations, multiple views, or additional encoders. Furthermore, UMD improves over the computational efficiency of prior diffusion based methods in total training time. We release our code at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The alignment process changes several properties of a large language model's (LLM's) output distribution. We analyze two aspects of post-alignment distributional shift of LLM responses. First, we re-examine previously reported reductions in response diversity post-alignment. Our analysis suggests that an apparent drop in the diversity of responses is largely explained by quality control and information aggregation. Alignment suppresses irrelevant and unhelpful content while shifting the output distribution toward longer responses that cover information spanning several responses from the base LLM, essentially presenting diverse information in a single response. Finding little evidence that alignment suppresses useful information, it is natural to ask the opposite question: do aligned models surface information that cannot be recovered from base models? Our second investigation shows this is not the case and the behavior of aligned models is recoverable from base models without fine-tuning. A combination of in-context examples and lower-resolution semantic hints about response content can elicit responses from base LLMs that are as similar to alignment-tuned LLM responses as alignment-tuned LLM responses are to each other. Taken together, these results indicate that current alignment techniques capture but do not extend the useful subset of assistant-like base LLM behavior, providing further evidence for the Superficial Alignment Hypothesis. They also show that in-context alignment can go surprisingly far as a strategy for imitating aligned LLMs without fine-tuning. Our code and data is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The development of 2D foundation models for image segmentation has been significantly advanced by the Segment Anything Model (SAM). However, achieving similar success in 3D models remains a challenge due to issues such as non-unified data formats, lightweight models, and the scarcity of labeled data with diverse masks. To this end, we propose a 3D promptable segmentation model (Point-SAM) focusing on point clouds. Our approach utilizes a transformer-based method, extending SAM to the 3D domain. We leverage part-level and object-level annotations and introduce a data engine to generate pseudo labels from SAM, thereby distilling 2D knowledge into our 3D model. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art models on several indoor and outdoor benchmarks and demonstrates a variety of applications, such as 3D annotation.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Automatic medical discovery by AI is a dream of many. One step toward that goal is to create an AI model to understand clinical studies and synthesize clinical evidence from the literature. Clinical evidence synthesis currently relies on systematic reviews of clinical trials and retrospective analyses from medical literature. However, the rapid expansion of publications presents challenges in efficiently identifying, summarizing, and updating evidence. We introduce TrialMind, a generative AI-based pipeline for conducting medical systematic reviews, encompassing study search, screening, and data extraction phases. We utilize large language models (LLMs) to drive each pipeline component while incorporating human expert oversight to minimize errors. To facilitate evaluation, we also create a benchmark dataset TrialReviewBench, a custom dataset with 870 annotated clinical studies from 25 meta-analysis papers across various medical treatments. Our results demonstrate that TrialMind significantly improves the literature review process, achieving high recall rates (0.897-1.000) in study searching from over 20 million PubMed studies and outperforming traditional language model embeddings-based methods in screening (Recall@20 of 0.227-0.246 vs. 0.000-0.102). Furthermore, our approach surpasses direct GPT-4 performance in result extraction, with accuracy ranging from 0.65 to 0.84. We also support clinical evidence synthesis in forest plots, as validated by eight human annotators who preferred TrialMind over the GPT-4 baseline with a winning rate of 62.5%-100% across the involved reviews. Our findings suggest that an LLM-based clinical evidence synthesis approach, such as TrialMind, can enable reliable and high-quality clinical evidence synthesis to improve clinical research efficiency.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce a general framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) using generative diffusion models. In particular, we focus on the scenarios where we do not have the full knowledge of the scene necessary to apply classical solvers. Most existing forward or inverse PDE approaches perform poorly when the observations on the data or the underlying coefficients are incomplete, which is a common assumption for real-world measurements. In this work, we propose DiffusionPDE that can simultaneously fill in the missing information and solve a PDE by modeling the joint distribution of the solution and coefficient spaces. We show that the learned generative priors lead to a versatile framework for accurately solving a wide range of PDEs under partial observation, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art methods for both forward and inverse directions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) possess extensive parametric knowledge, but this knowledge is difficult to update with new information because retraining is very expensive and infeasible for closed-source models. Knowledge editing (KE) has emerged as a viable solution for updating the knowledge of LLMs without compromising their overall performance. On-the-fly KE methods, inspired by in-context learning (ICL), have shown great promise and allow LLMs to be treated as black boxes. In the past, KE was primarily employed in English contexts, whereas the potential for cross-lingual KE in current English-centric LLMs has not been fully explored. To foster more research in this direction, we introduce the BMIKE-53 benchmark for evaluating cross-lingual KE on 53 diverse languages across three KE task types. We also propose a gradient-free KE method called Multilingual In-context Knowledge Editing (MIKE) and evaluate it on BMIKE-53. Our evaluation focuses on cross-lingual knowledge transfer in terms of reliability, generality, locality, and portability, offering valuable insights and a framework for future research in cross-lingual KE. Our code and data are publicly accessible via the anonymous repository at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MIKE.</li>
