<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Foundation models serve as the backbone for numerous specialized models developed through fine-tuning. However, when the underlying pretrained model is updated or retrained (e.g., on larger and more curated datasets), the fine-tuned model becomes obsolete, losing its utility and requiring retraining. This raises the question: is it possible to transfer fine-tuning to a new release of the model? In this work, we investigate how to transfer fine-tuning to a new checkpoint without having to re-train, in a data-free manner. To do so, we draw principles from model re-basin and provide a recipe based on weight permutations to re-base the modifications made to the original base model, often called task vector. In particular, our approach tailors model re-basin for Transformer models, taking into account the challenges of residual connections and multi-head attention layers. Specifically, we propose a two-level method rooted in spectral theory, initially permuting the attention heads and subsequently adjusting parameters within select pairs of heads. Through extensive experiments on visual and textual tasks, we achieve the seamless transfer of fine-tuned knowledge to new pre-trained backbones without relying on a single training step or datapoint.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, foundation model, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advancements in image generative foundation models have prioritized quality improvements but often at the cost of increased computational complexity and inference latency. To address this critical trade-off, we introduce HiDream-I1, a new open-source image generative foundation model with 17B parameters that achieves state-of-the-art image generation quality within seconds. HiDream-I1 is constructed with a new sparse Diffusion Transformer (DiT) structure. Specifically, it starts with a dual-stream decoupled design of sparse DiT with dynamic Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, in which two separate encoders are first involved to independently process image and text tokens. Then, a single-stream sparse DiT structure with dynamic MoE architecture is adopted to trigger multi-model interaction for image generation in a cost-efficient manner. To support flexiable accessibility with varied model capabilities, we provide HiDream-I1 in three variants: HiDream-I1-Full, HiDream-I1-Dev, and HiDream-I1-Fast. Furthermore, we go beyond the typical text-to-image generation and remould HiDream-I1 with additional image conditions to perform precise, instruction-based editing on given images, yielding a new instruction-based image editing model namely HiDream-E1. Ultimately, by integrating text-to-image generation and instruction-based image editing, HiDream-I1 evolves to form a comprehensive image agent (HiDream-A1) capable of fully interactive image creation and refinement. To accelerate multi-modal AIGC research, we have open-sourced all the codes and model weights of HiDream-I1-Full, HiDream-I1-Dev, HiDream-I1-Fast, HiDream-E1 through our project websites: this https URL and this https URL.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multi-token prediction (MTP) is a recently proposed pre-training objective for language models. Rather than predicting only the next token (NTP), MTP predicts the next $k$ tokens at each prediction step, using multiple prediction heads. MTP has shown promise in improving downstream performance, inference speed, and training efficiency, particularly for large models. However, prior work has shown that smaller language models (SLMs) struggle with the MTP objective. To address this, we propose a curriculum learning strategy for MTP training, exploring two variants: a forward curriculum, which gradually increases the complexity of the pre-training objective from NTP to MTP, and a reverse curriculum, which does the opposite. Our experiments show that the forward curriculum enables SLMs to better leverage the MTP objective during pre-training, improving downstream NTP performance and generative output quality, while retaining the benefits of self-speculative decoding. The reverse curriculum achieves stronger NTP performance and output quality, but fails to provide any self-speculative decoding benefits.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The development of speech foundation models (SFMs) like Whisper and SeamlessM4T has significantly advanced the field of speech processing. However, their closed nature--with inaccessible training data and code--poses major reproducibility and fair evaluation challenges. While other domains have made substantial progress toward open science by developing fully transparent models trained on open-source (OS) code and data, similar efforts in speech remain limited. To fill this gap, we introduce FAMA, the first family of open science SFMs for English and Italian, trained on 150k+ hours of OS speech data. Moreover, we present a new dataset containing 16k hours of cleaned and pseudo-labeled speech for both languages. Results show that FAMA achieves competitive performance compared to existing SFMs while being up to 8 times faster. All artifacts, including code, datasets, and models, are released under OS-compliant licenses, promoting openness in speech technology research.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper presents MIAS-SAM, a novel approach for the segmentation of anomalous regions in medical images. MIAS-SAM uses a patch-based memory bank to store relevant image features, which are extracted from normal data using the SAM encoder. At inference time, the embedding patches extracted from the SAM encoder are compared with those in the memory bank to obtain the anomaly map. Finally, MIAS-SAM computes the center of gravity of the anomaly map to prompt the SAM decoder, obtaining an accurate segmentation from the previously extracted features. Differently from prior works, MIAS-SAM does not require to define a threshold value to obtain the segmentation from the anomaly map. Experimental results conducted on three publicly available datasets, each with a different imaging modality (Brain MRI, Liver CT, and Retina OCT) show accurate anomaly segmentation capabilities measured using DICE score.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Time series forecasting remains a challenging task for foundation models due to temporal heterogeneity, high dimensionality, and the lack of inherent symbolic structure. In this work, we propose DRAGON (Discrete Representation and Augmented Graph encoding Over deBruijN Graphs), a novel encoder that introduces Multivariate de Bruijn Graphs (MdBGs) to bridge the gap between symbolic representations and neural modeling. DRAGON discretizes continuous input sequences and maps them onto a fixed graph structure, enabling dynamic context recovery via graph-based attention. Integrated as an auxiliary module within a dual-branch architecture, DRAGON augments conventional CNN-based encoders with symbolic, structure-aware representations.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This study illustrates how incorporating feedback-oriented annotations into the scoring pipeline can enhance the accuracy of automated essay scoring (AES). This approach is demonstrated with the Persuasive Essays for Rating, Selecting, and Understanding Argumentative and Discourse Elements (PERSUADE) corpus. We integrate two types of feedback-driven annotations: those that identify spelling and grammatical errors, and those that highlight argumentative components. To illustrate how this method could be applied in real-world scenarios, we employ two LLMs to generate annotations -- a generative language model used for spell-correction and an encoder-based token classifier trained to identify and mark argumentative elements. By incorporating annotations into the scoring process, we demonstrate improvements in performance using encoder-based large language models fine-tuned as classifiers.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Neural networks transform high-dimensional data into compact, structured representations, often modeled as elements of a lower dimensional latent space. In this paper, we present an alternative interpretation of neural models as dynamical systems acting on the latent manifold. Specifically, we show that autoencoder models implicitly define a latent vector field on the manifold, derived by iteratively applying the encoding-decoding map, without any additional training. We observe that standard training procedures introduce inductive biases that lead to the emergence of attractor points within this vector field. Drawing on this insight, we propose to leverage the vector field as a representation for the network, providing a novel tool to analyze the properties of the model and the data. This representation enables to: (i) analyze the generalization and memorization regimes of neural models, even throughout training; (ii) extract prior knowledge encoded in the network's parameters from the attractors, without requiring any input data; (iii) identify out-of-distribution samples from their trajectories in the vector field. We further validate our approach on vision foundation models, showcasing the applicability and effectiveness of our method in real-world scenarios.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generating images from rhetorical languages remains a critical challenge for text-to-image models. Even state-of-the-art (SOTA) multimodal large language models (MLLM) fail to generate images based on the hidden meaning inherent in rhetorical language--despite such content being readily mappable to visual representations by humans. A key limitation is that current models emphasize object-level word embedding alignment, causing metaphorical expressions to steer image generation towards their literal visuals and overlook the intended semantic meaning. To address this, we propose Rhet2Pix, a framework that formulates rhetorical text-to-image generation as a multi-step policy optimization problem, incorporating a two-layer MDP diffusion module. In the outer layer, Rhet2Pix converts the input prompt into incrementally elaborated sub-sentences and executes corresponding image-generation actions, constructing semantically richer visuals. In the inner layer, Rhet2Pix mitigates reward sparsity during image generation by discounting the final reward and optimizing every adjacent action pair along the diffusion denoising trajectory. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Rhet2Pix in rhetorical text-to-image generation. Our model outperforms SOTA MLLMs such as GPT-4o, Grok-3 and leading academic baselines across both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. The code and dataset used in this work are publicly available.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised, foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Irregular Multivariate Time Series (IMTS) forecasting is challenging due to the unaligned nature of multi-channel signals and the prevalence of extensive missing data. Existing methods struggle to capture reliable temporal patterns from such data due to significant missing values. While pre-trained foundation models show potential for addressing these challenges, they are typically designed for Regularly Sampled Time Series (RTS). Motivated by the visual Mask AutoEncoder's (MAE) powerful capability for modeling sparse multi-channel information and its success in RTS forecasting, we propose VIMTS, a framework adapting Visual MAE for IMTS forecasting. To mitigate the effect of missing values, VIMTS first processes IMTS along the timeline into feature patches at equal intervals. These patches are then complemented using learned cross-channel dependencies. Then it leverages visual MAE's capability in handling sparse multichannel data for patch reconstruction, followed by a coarse-to-fine technique to generate precise predictions from focused contexts. In addition, we integrate self-supervised learning for improved IMTS modeling by adapting the visual MAE to IMTS data. Extensive experiments demonstrate VIMTS's superior performance and few-shot capability, advancing the application of visual foundation models in more general time series tasks.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper investigates the integration of response time data into human preference learning frameworks for more effective reward model elicitation. While binary preference data has become fundamental in fine-tuning foundation models, generative AI systems, and other large-scale models, the valuable temporal information inherent in user decision-making remains largely unexploited. We propose novel methodologies to incorporate response time information alongside binary choice data, leveraging the Evidence Accumulation Drift Diffusion (EZ) model, under which response time is informative of the preference strength. We develop Neyman-orthogonal loss functions that achieve oracle convergence rates for reward model learning, matching the theoretical optimal rates that would be attained if the expected response times for each query were known a priori. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that for linear reward functions, conventional preference learning suffers from error rates that scale exponentially with reward magnitude. In contrast, our response time-augmented approach reduces this to polynomial scaling, representing a significant improvement in sample efficiency. We extend these guarantees to non-parametric reward function spaces, establishing convergence properties for more complex, realistic reward models. Our extensive experiments validate our theoretical findings in the context of preference learning over images.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent findings suggest that diffusion models significantly enhance empirical adversarial robustness. While some intuitive explanations have been proposed, the precise mechanisms underlying these improvements remain unclear. In this work, we systematically investigate how and how well diffusion models improve adversarial robustness. First, we observe that diffusion models intriguingly increase, rather than decrease, the $\ell_p$ distance to clean samples--challenging the intuition that purification denoises inputs closer to the original data. Second, we find that the purified images are heavily influenced by the internal randomness of diffusion models, where a compression effect arises within each randomness configuration. Motivated by this observation, we evaluate robustness under fixed randomness and find that the improvement drops to approximately 24% on CIFAR-10--substantially lower than prior reports approaching 70%. Importantly, we show that this remaining robustness gain strongly correlates with the model's ability to compress the input space, revealing the compression rate as a reliable robustness indicator without requiring gradient-based analysis. Our findings provide novel insights into the mechanisms underlying diffusion-based purification, and offer guidance for developing more effective and principled adversarial purification systems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models now set the benchmark in high-fidelity generative sampling, yet they can, in principle, be prone to memorization. In this case, their learned score overfits the finite dataset so that the reverse-time SDE samples are mostly training points. In this paper, we interpret the empirical score as a noisy version of the true score and show that its covariance matrix is asymptotically a re-weighted data PCA. In large dimension, the small time limit makes the noise variance blow up while simultaneously reducing spatial correlation. To reduce this variance, we introduce a kernel-smoothed empirical score and analyze its bias-variance trade-off. We derive asymptotic bounds on the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the true distribution and the one generated by the modified reverse SDE. Regularization on the score has the same effect as increasing the size of the training dataset, and thus helps prevent memorization. A spectral decomposition of the forward diffusion suggests better variance control under some regularity conditions of the true data distribution. Reverse diffusion with kernel-smoothed empirical score can be reformulated as a gradient descent drifted toward a Log-Exponential Double-Kernel Density Estimator (LED-KDE). This perspective highlights two regularization mechanisms taking place in denoising diffusions: an initial Gaussian kernel first diffuses mass isotropically in the ambient space, while a second kernel applied in score space concentrates and spreads that mass along the data manifold. Hence, even a straightforward regularization-without any learning-already mitigates memorization and enhances generalization. Numerically, we illustrate our results with several experiments on synthetic and MNIST datasets.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative artificial intelligence is developing rapidly, impacting humans' interaction with information and digital media. It is increasingly used to create deceptively realistic misinformation, so lawmakers have imposed regulations requiring the disclosure of AI-generated content. However, only little is known about whether these labels reduce the risks of AI-generated misinformation. Our work addresses this research gap. Focusing on AI-generated images, we study the implications of labels, including the possibility of mislabeling. Assuming that simplicity, transparency, and trust are likely to impact the successful adoption of such labels, we first qualitatively explore users' opinions and expectations of AI labeling using five focus groups. Second, we conduct a pre-registered online survey with over 1300 U.S. and EU participants to quantitatively assess the effect of AI labels on users' ability to recognize misinformation containing either human-made or AI-generated images. Our focus groups illustrate that, while participants have concerns about the practical implementation of labeling, they consider it helpful in identifying AI-generated images and avoiding deception. However, considering security benefits, our survey revealed an ambiguous picture, suggesting that users might over-rely on labels. While inaccurate claims supported by labeled AI-generated images were rated less credible than those with unlabeled AI-images, the belief in accurate claims also decreased when accompanied by a labeled AI-generated image. Moreover, we find the undesired side effect that human-made images conveying inaccurate claims were perceived as more credible in the presence of labels.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Interactive Theorem Proving was repeatedly shown to be fruitful combined with Generative Artificial Intelligence. This paper assesses multiple approaches to Rocq generation and illuminates potential avenues for improvement. We highlight the importance of thorough premise selection for generating Rocq proofs and propose a novel approach, leveraging retrieval via a self-attentive embedder model. The evaluation of the designed approach shows up to 28% relative increase of the generator's performance. We tackle the problem of writing Rocq proofs using a multi-stage agentic system, tailored for formal verification, and demonstrate its high effectiveness. We conduct an ablation study and show the use of multi-agent debate on the planning stage of proof synthesis.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Gaussian Splatting (GS) has recently emerged as an efficient representation for rendering 3D scenes from 2D images and has been extended to images, videos, and dynamic 4D content. However, applying style transfer to GS-based representations, especially beyond simple color changes, remains challenging. In this work, we introduce CLIPGaussians, the first unified style transfer framework that supports text- and image-guided stylization across multiple modalities: 2D images, videos, 3D objects, and 4D scenes. Our method operates directly on Gaussian primitives and integrates into existing GS pipelines as a plug-in module, without requiring large generative models or retraining from scratch. CLIPGaussians approach enables joint optimization of color and geometry in 3D and 4D settings, and achieves temporal coherence in videos, while preserving a model size. We demonstrate superior style fidelity and consistency across all tasks, validating CLIPGaussians as a universal and efficient solution for multimodal style transfer.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Open-world egocentric activity recognition poses a fundamental challenge due to its unconstrained nature, requiring models to infer unseen activities from an expansive, partially observed search space. We introduce ProbRes, a Probabilistic Residual search framework based on jump-diffusion that efficiently navigates this space by balancing prior-guided exploration with likelihood-driven exploitation. Our approach integrates structured commonsense priors to construct a semantically coherent search space, adaptively refines predictions using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and employs a stochastic search mechanism to locate high-likelihood activity labels while minimizing exhaustive enumeration efficiently. We systematically evaluate ProbRes across multiple openness levels (L0--L3), demonstrating its adaptability to increasing search space complexity. In addition to achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets (GTEA Gaze, GTEA Gaze+, EPIC-Kitchens, and Charades-Ego), we establish a clear taxonomy for open-world recognition, delineating the challenges and methodological advancements necessary for egocentric activity understanding.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion and flow models have emerged as powerful generative approaches capable of modeling diverse and multimodal behavior. However, applying these models to offline reinforcement learning (RL) remains challenging due to the iterative nature of their noise sampling processes, making policy optimization difficult. In this paper, we introduce Scalable Offline Reinforcement Learning (SORL), a new offline RL algorithm that leverages shortcut models - a novel class of generative models - to scale both training and inference. SORL's policy can capture complex data distributions and can be trained simply and efficiently in a one-stage training procedure. At test time, SORL introduces both sequential and parallel inference scaling by using the learned Q-function as a verifier. We demonstrate that SORL achieves strong performance across a range of offline RL tasks and exhibits positive scaling behavior with increased test-time compute.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Existing PLMs generate protein sequences based on a single-condition constraint from a specific modality, struggling to simultaneously satisfy multiple constraints across different modalities. In this work, we introduce CFP-Gen, a novel diffusion language model for Combinatorial Functional Protein GENeration. CFP-Gen facilitates the de novo protein design by integrating multimodal conditions with functional, sequence, and structural constraints. Specifically, an Annotation-Guided Feature Modulation (AGFM) module is introduced to dynamically adjust the protein feature distribution based on composable functional annotations, e.g., GO terms, IPR domains and EC numbers. Meanwhile, the Residue-Controlled Functional Encoding (RCFE) module captures residue-wise interaction to ensure more precise control. Additionally, off-the-shelf 3D structure encoders can be seamlessly integrated to impose geometric constraints. We demonstrate that CFP-Gen enables high-throughput generation of novel proteins with functionality comparable to natural proteins, while achieving a high success rate in designing multifunctional proteins.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The widespread success of foundation models in natural language processing and computer vision has inspired researchers to extend the concept to scientific machine learning and computational science. However, this position paper argues that as the term "foundation model" is an evolving concept, its application in computational science is increasingly used without a universally accepted definition, potentially creating confusion and diluting its precise scientific meaning. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing a formal definition of foundation models in computational science, grounded in the core values of generality, reusability, and scalability. We articulate a set of essential and desirable characteristics that such models must exhibit, drawing parallels with traditional foundational methods, like the finite element and finite volume methods. Furthermore, we introduce the Data-Driven Finite Element Method (DD-FEM), a framework that fuses the modular structure of classical FEM with the representational power of data-driven learning. We demonstrate how DD-FEM addresses many of the key challenges in realizing foundation models for computational science, including scalability, adaptability, and physics consistency. By bridging traditional numerical methods with modern AI paradigms, this work provides a rigorous foundation for evaluating and developing novel approaches toward future foundation models in computational science.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have become the de-facto model for generating high-quality visual content like videos and images. A huge bottleneck is the attention mechanism where complexity scales quadratically with resolution and video length. One logical way to lessen this burden is sparse attention, where only a subset of tokens or patches are included in the calculation. However, existing techniques fail to preserve visual quality at extremely high sparsity levels and might even incur non-negligible compute overheads. % To address this concern, we propose Re-ttention, which implements very high sparse attention for visual generation models by leveraging the temporal redundancy of Diffusion Models to overcome the probabilistic normalization shift within the attention mechanism. Specifically, Re-ttention reshapes attention scores based on the prior softmax distribution history in order to preserve the visual quality of the full quadratic attention at very high sparsity levels. % Experimental results on T2V/T2I models such as CogVideoX and the PixArt DiTs demonstrate that Re-ttention requires as few as 3.1\% of the tokens during inference, outperforming contemporary methods like FastDiTAttn, Sparse VideoGen and MInference. Further, we measure latency to show that our method can attain over 45\% end-to-end % and over 92\% self-attention latency reduction on an H100 GPU at negligible overhead cost.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We investigate whether synthetic images generated by diffusion models can enhance multi-label classification of protein subcellular localization. Specifically, we implement a simplified class-conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to produce label-consistent samples and explore their integration with real data via two hybrid training strategies: Mix Loss and Mix Representation. While these approaches yield promising validation performance, our proposed MixModel exhibits poor generalization to unseen test data, underscoring the challenges of leveraging synthetic data effectively. In contrast, baseline classifiers built on ResNet backbones with conventional loss functions demonstrate greater stability and test-time performance. Our findings highlight the importance of realistic data generation and robust supervision when incorporating generative augmentation into biomedical image classification.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Explicit noise-level conditioning is widely regarded as essential for the effective operation of Graph Diffusion Models (GDMs). In this work, we challenge this assumption by investigating whether denoisers can implicitly infer noise levels directly from corrupted graph structures, potentially eliminating the need for explicit noise conditioning. To this end, we develop a theoretical framework centered on Bernoulli edge-flip corruptions and extend it to encompass more complex scenarios involving coupled structure-attribute noise. Extensive empirical evaluations on both synthetic and real-world graph datasets, using models such as GDSS and DiGress, provide strong support for our theoretical findings. Notably, unconditional GDMs achieve performance comparable or superior to their conditioned counterparts, while also offering reductions in parameters (4-6%) and computation time (8-10%). Our results suggest that the high-dimensional nature of graph data itself often encodes sufficient information for the denoising process, opening avenues for simpler, more efficient GDM architectures.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose a unified framework for motion control in video generation that seamlessly integrates camera movement, object-level translation, and fine-grained local motion using trajectory-based inputs. In contrast to prior methods that address these motion types through separate modules or task-specific designs, our approach offers a cohesive solution by projecting user-defined trajectories into the latent space of pre-trained image-to-video generation models via a lightweight motion injector. Users can specify keypoints and their motion paths to control localized deformations, entire object motion, virtual camera dynamics, or combinations of these. The injected trajectory signals guide the generative process to produce temporally consistent and semantically aligned motion sequences. Our framework demonstrates superior performance across multiple video motion control tasks, including stylized motion effects (e.g., motion brushes), dynamic viewpoint changes, and precise local motion manipulation. Experiments show that our method provides significantly better controllability and visual quality compared to prior approaches and commercial solutions, while remaining broadly compatible with various state-of-the-art video generation backbones.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are a class of graphs commonly used in practice, with examples that include electronic circuits, Bayesian networks, and neural architectures. While many effective encoders exist for DAGs, it remains challenging to decode them in a principled manner, because the nodes of a DAG can have many different topological orders. In this work, we propose a grammar-based approach to constructing a principled, compact and equivalent sequential representation of a DAG. Specifically, we view a graph as derivations over an unambiguous grammar, where the DAG corresponds to a unique sequence of production rules. Equivalently, the procedure to construct such a description can be viewed as a lossless compression of the data. Such a representation has many uses, including building a generative model for graph generation, learning a latent space for property prediction, and leveraging the sequence representational continuity for Bayesian Optimization over structured data.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE) compliance assessment demands dynamic real-time decision-making under complicated regulations and complex human-machine-environment interactions. While large language models (LLMs) hold significant potential for decision intelligence and contextual dialogue, their capacity for domain-specific knowledge in HSE and structured legal reasoning remains underexplored. We introduce HSE-Bench, the first benchmark dataset designed to evaluate the HSE compliance assessment capabilities of LLM. HSE-Bench comprises over 1,000 manually curated questions drawn from regulations, court cases, safety exams, and fieldwork videos, and integrates a reasoning flow based on Issue spotting, rule Recall, rule Application, and rule Conclusion (IRAC) to assess the holistic reasoning pipeline. We conduct extensive evaluations on different prompting strategies and more than 10 LLMs, including foundation models, reasoning models and multimodal vision models. The results show that, although current LLMs achieve good performance, their capabilities largely rely on semantic matching rather than principled reasoning grounded in the underlying HSE compliance context. Moreover, their native reasoning trace lacks the systematic legal reasoning required for rigorous HSE compliance assessment. To alleviate these, we propose a new prompting technique, Reasoning of Expert (RoE), which guides LLMs to simulate the reasoning process of different experts for compliance assessment and reach a more accurate unified decision. We hope our study highlights reasoning gaps in LLMs for HSE compliance and inspires further research on related tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The emergence of scaling laws has profoundly shaped the development of large language models (LLMs), enabling predictable performance gains through systematic increases in model size, dataset volume, and compute. Yet, these principles remain largely unexplored in the context of electronic health records (EHRs) -- a rich, sequential, and globally abundant data source that differs structurally from natural language. In this work, we present the first empirical investigation of scaling laws for EHR foundation models. By training transformer architectures on patient timeline data from the MIMIC-IV database across varying model sizes and compute budgets, we identify consistent scaling patterns, including parabolic IsoFLOPs curves and power-law relationships between compute, model parameters, data size, and clinical utility. These findings demonstrate that EHR models exhibit scaling behavior analogous to LLMs, offering predictive insights into resource-efficient training strategies. Our results lay the groundwork for developing powerful EHR foundation models capable of transforming clinical prediction tasks and advancing personalized healthcare.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models represent the state-of-the-art for solving inverse problems such as image restoration tasks. In the Bayesian framework, diffusion-based inverse solvers incorporate a likelihood term to guide the prior sampling process, generating data consistent with the posterior distribution. However, due to the intractability of the likelihood term, many current methods rely on isotropic Gaussian approximations, which lead to deviations from the data manifold and result in inconsistent, unstable reconstructions. We propose Equivariance Regularized (EquiReg) diffusion, a general framework for regularizing posterior sampling in diffusion-based inverse problem solvers. EquiReg enhances reconstructions by reweighting diffusion trajectories and penalizing those that deviate from the data manifold. We define a new distribution-dependent equivariance error, empirically identify functions that exhibit low error for on-manifold samples and higher error for off-manifold samples, and leverage these functions to regularize the diffusion sampling process. When applied to a variety of solvers, EquiReg outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion models in both linear and nonlinear image restoration tasks, as well as in reconstructing partial differential equations.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved conditional video generation, particularly in the pose-guided human image animation task. Although existing methods are capable of generating high-fidelity and time-consistent animation sequences in regular motions and static scenes, there are still obvious limitations when facing complex human body motions (Hypermotion) that contain highly dynamic, non-standard motions, and the lack of a high-quality benchmark for evaluation of complex human motion animations. To address this challenge, we introduce the \textbf{Open-HyperMotionX Dataset} and \textbf{HyperMotionX Bench}, which provide high-quality human pose annotations and curated video clips for evaluating and improving pose-guided human image animation models under complex human motion conditions. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet powerful DiT-based video generation baseline and design spatial low-frequency enhanced RoPE, a novel module that selectively enhances low-frequency spatial feature modeling by introducing learnable frequency scaling. Our method significantly improves structural stability and appearance consistency in highly dynamic human motion sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our dataset and proposed approach in advancing the generation quality of complex human motion image animations.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in diffusion-based text-to-video (T2V) models have demonstrated remarkable progress, but these models still face challenges in generating videos with multiple objects. Most models struggle with accurately capturing complex object interactions, often treating some objects as static background elements and limiting their movement. In addition, they often fail to generate multiple distinct objects as specified in the prompt, resulting in incorrect generations or mixed features across objects. In this paper, we present a novel training-free approach for multi-object video generation that leverages the open world knowledge of diffusion models and large language models (LLMs). We use an LLM as the ``director'' of object trajectories, and apply the trajectories through noise re-initialization to achieve precise control of realistic movements. We further refine the generation process by manipulating the attention mechanism to better capture object-specific features and motion patterns, and prevent cross-object feature interference. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our training free approach in significantly enhancing the multi-object generation capabilities of existing video diffusion models, resulting in 42% absolute improvement in motion dynamics and object generation accuracy, while also maintaining high fidelity and motion smoothness.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Bargaining, a critical aspect of real-world interactions, presents challenges for large language models (LLMs) due to limitations in strategic depth and adaptation to complex human factors. Existing benchmarks often fail to capture this real-world complexity. To address this and enhance LLM capabilities in realistic bargaining, we introduce a comprehensive framework centered on utility-based feedback. Our contributions are threefold: (1) BargainArena, a novel benchmark dataset with six intricate scenarios (e.g., deceptive practices, monopolies) to facilitate diverse strategy modeling; (2) human-aligned, economically-grounded evaluation metrics inspired by utility theory, incorporating agent utility and negotiation power, which implicitly reflect and promote opponent-aware reasoning (OAR); and (3) a structured feedback mechanism enabling LLMs to iteratively refine their bargaining strategies. This mechanism can positively collaborate with in-context learning (ICL) prompts, including those explicitly designed to foster OAR. Experimental results show that LLMs often exhibit negotiation strategies misaligned with human preferences, and that our structured feedback mechanism significantly improves their performance, yielding deeper strategic and opponent-aware reasoning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Traditional approaches in unsupervised or self supervised learning for skeleton-based action classification have concentrated predominantly on the dynamic aspects of skeletal sequences. Yet, the intricate interaction between the moving and static elements of the skeleton presents a rarely tapped discriminative potential for action classification. This paper introduces a novel measurement, referred to as spatial-temporal joint density (STJD), to quantify such interaction. Tracking the evolution of this density throughout an action can effectively identify a subset of discriminative moving and/or static joints termed "prime joints" to steer self-supervised learning. A new contrastive learning strategy named STJD-CL is proposed to align the representation of a skeleton sequence with that of its prime joints while simultaneously contrasting the representations of prime and nonprime joints. In addition, a method called STJD-MP is developed by integrating it with a reconstruction-based framework for more effective learning. Experimental evaluations on the NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and PKUMMD datasets in various downstream tasks demonstrate that the proposed STJD-CL and STJD-MP improved performance, particularly by 3.5 and 3.6 percentage points over the state-of-the-art contrastive methods on the NTU RGB+D 120 dataset using X-sub and X-set evaluations, respectively.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting (PTSF) plays a crucial role in decision-making across various fields, including economics, energy, and transportation. Most existing methods excell at short-term forecasting, while overlooking the hurdles of Long-term Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting (LPTSF). As the forecast horizon extends, the inherent nonlinear dynamics have a significant adverse effect on prediction accuracy, and make generative models inefficient by increasing the cost of each iteration. To overcome these limitations, we introduce $K^2$VAE, an efficient VAE-based generative model that leverages a KoopmanNet to transform nonlinear time series into a linear dynamical system, and devises a KalmanNet to refine predictions and model uncertainty in such linear system, which reduces error accumulation in long-term forecasting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that $K^2$VAE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both short- and long-term PTSF, providing a more efficient and accurate solution.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In-Context Learning (ICL) technique based on Large Language Models (LLMs) has gained prominence in Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks for its lower computing resource consumption, less manual labeling overhead, and stronger generalizability. Nevertheless, most ICL-based NER methods depend on large-parameter LLMs: the open-source models demand substantial computational resources for deployment and inference, while the closed-source ones incur high API costs, raise data-privacy concerns, and hinder community collaboration. To address this question, we propose an Ensemble Learning Method for Named Entity Recognition (EL4NER), which aims at aggregating the ICL outputs of multiple open-source, small-parameter LLMs to enhance overall performance in NER tasks at less deployment and inference cost. Specifically, our method comprises three key components. First, we design a task decomposition-based pipeline that facilitates deep, multi-stage ensemble learning. Second, we introduce a novel span-level sentence similarity algorithm to establish an ICL demonstration retrieval mechanism better suited for NER tasks. Third, we incorporate a self-validation mechanism to mitigate the noise introduced during the ensemble process. We evaluated EL4NER on multiple widely adopted NER datasets from diverse domains. Our experimental results indicate that EL4NER surpasses most closed-source, large-parameter LLM-based methods at a lower parameter cost and even attains state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among ICL-based methods on certain datasets. These results show the parameter efficiency of EL4NER and underscore the feasibility of employing open-source, small-parameter LLMs within the ICL paradigm for NER tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advancements in Large Language Models have inspired the development of foundation models across various domains. In this study, we evaluate the efficacy of Large EEG Models (LEMs) by fine-tuning LaBraM, a state-of-the-art foundation EEG model, on a real-world stress classification dataset collected in a graduate classroom. Unlike previous studies that primarily evaluate LEMs using data from controlled clinical settings, our work assesses their applicability to real-world environments. We train a binary classifier that distinguishes between normal and elevated stress states using resting-state EEG data recorded from 18 graduate students during a class session. The best-performing fine-tuned model achieves a balanced accuracy of 90.47% with a 5-second window, significantly outperforming traditional stress classifiers in both accuracy and inference efficiency. We further evaluate the robustness of the fine-tuned LEM under random data shuffling and reduced channel counts. These results demonstrate the capability of LEMs to effectively process real-world EEG data and highlight their potential to revolutionize brain-computer interface applications by shifting the focus from model-centric to data-centric design.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Trajectory data is crucial for various applications but often suffers from incompleteness due to device limitations and diverse collection scenarios. Existing imputation methods rely on sparse trajectory or travel information, such as velocity, to infer missing points. However, these approaches assume that sparse trajectories retain essential behavioral patterns, which place significant demands on data acquisition and overlook the potential of large-scale human trajectory embeddings. To address this, we propose ProDiff, a trajectory imputation framework that uses only two endpoints as minimal information. It integrates prototype learning to embed human movement patterns and a denoising diffusion probabilistic model for robust spatiotemporal reconstruction. Joint training with a tailored loss function ensures effective imputation. ProDiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improving accuracy by 6.28\% on FourSquare and 2.52\% on WuXi. Further analysis shows a 0.927 correlation between generated and real trajectories, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative 3D reconstruction shows strong potential in incomplete observations. While sparse-view and single-image reconstruction are well-researched, partial observation remains underexplored. In this context, dense views are accessible only from a specific angular range, with other perspectives remaining inaccessible. This task presents two main challenges: (i) limited View Range: observations confined to a narrow angular scope prevent effective traditional interpolation techniques that require evenly distributed perspectives. (ii) inconsistent Generation: views created for invisible regions often lack coherence with both visible regions and each other, compromising reconstruction consistency. To address these challenges, we propose \method, a novel training-free approach that integrates the local dense observations and multi-source priors for reconstruction. Our method introduces a fusion-based strategy to effectively align these priors in DDIM sampling, thereby generating multi-view consistent images to supervise invisible views. We further design an iterative refinement strategy, which uses the geometric structures of the object to enhance reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets show the superiority of our method over SOTAs, especially in invisible regions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion LLMs have emerged as a promising alternative to conventional autoregressive LLMs, offering significant potential for improved runtime efficiency. However, existing diffusion models lack the ability to provably enforce user-specified formal constraints, such as regular expressions, which makes them unreliable for tasks that require structured outputs, such as fixed-schema JSON generation. Unlike autoregressive models that generate tokens sequentially, diffusion LLMs predict a block of tokens in parallel. This parallelism makes traditional constrained decoding algorithms, which are designed for sequential token prediction, ineffective at preserving the true output distribution. To address this limitation, we propose DINGO, a dynamic programming-based constrained decoding strategy that is both efficient and provably distribution-preserving. DINGO enables sampling of output strings with the highest probability under the model's predicted distribution, while strictly satisfying any user-specified regular expression. On standard symbolic math and JSON generation benchmarks, DINGO achieves up to a 68 percentage point improvement over unconstrained inference</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Estimating accurate and temporally consistent 3D human geometry from videos is a challenging problem in computer vision. Existing methods, primarily optimized for single images, often suffer from temporal inconsistencies and fail to capture fine-grained dynamic details. To address these limitations, we present GeoMan, a novel architecture designed to produce accurate and temporally consistent depth and normal estimations from monocular human videos. GeoMan addresses two key challenges: the scarcity of high-quality 4D training data and the need for metric depth estimation to accurately model human size. To overcome the first challenge, GeoMan employs an image-based model to estimate depth and normals for the first frame of a video, which then conditions a video diffusion model, reframing video geometry estimation task as an image-to-video generation problem. This design offloads the heavy lifting of geometric estimation to the image model and simplifies the video model's role to focus on intricate details while using priors learned from large-scale video datasets. Consequently, GeoMan improves temporal consistency and generalizability while requiring minimal 4D training data. To address the challenge of accurate human size estimation, we introduce a root-relative depth representation that retains critical human-scale details and is easier to be estimated from monocular inputs, overcoming the limitations of traditional affine-invariant and metric depth representations. GeoMan achieves state-of-the-art performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, demonstrating its effectiveness in overcoming longstanding challenges in 3D human geometry estimation from videos.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large-scale foundation models have demonstrated remarkable versatility across a wide range of downstream tasks. However, fully fine-tuning these models incurs prohibitive computational costs, motivating the development of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods such as LoRA, which introduces low-rank updates to pre-trained weights. Despite their empirical success, the underlying mechanisms by which PEFT modifies model parameters remain underexplored. In this work, we present a systematic investigation into the structural changes of weight matrices during fully fine-tuning. Through singular value decomposition (SVD), we reveal that fine-tuning predominantly amplifies the top singular values while leaving the remainder largely intact, suggesting that task-specific knowledge is injected into a low-dimensional subspace. Furthermore, we find that the dominant singular vectors are reoriented in task-specific directions, whereas the non-dominant subspace remains stable. Building on these insights, we propose a novel method that leverages learnable rescaling of top singular directions, enabling precise modulation of the most influential components without disrupting the global structure. Our approach achieves consistent improvements over strong baselines across multiple tasks, highlighting the efficacy of structurally informed fine-tuning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate training data can potentially be a preferable way to improve zero or few-shot NLP tasks. However, many problems remain to be investigated for this direction. For the task of Relation Extraction (RE), we find that samples generated by directly prompting LLMs may easily have high structural similarities with each other. They tend to use a limited variety of phrasing while expressing the relation between a pair of entities. Therefore, in this paper, we study how to effectively improve the diversity of the training samples generated with LLMs for RE, while also maintaining their correctness. We first try to make the LLMs produce dissimilar samples by directly giving instructions in In-Context Learning (ICL) prompts. Then, we propose an approach to fine-tune LLMs for diversity training sample generation through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Our experiments on commonly used RE datasets show that both attempts can improve the quality of the generated training data. We also find that comparing with directly performing RE with an LLM, training a non-LLM RE model with its generated samples may lead to better performance.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Accurately predicting 3D occupancy grids from visual inputs is critical for autonomous driving, but current discriminative methods struggle with noisy data, incomplete observations, and the complex structures inherent in 3D scenes. In this work, we reframe 3D occupancy prediction as a generative modeling task using diffusion models, which learn the underlying data distribution and incorporate 3D scene priors. This approach enhances prediction consistency, noise robustness, and better handles the intricacies of 3D spatial structures. Our extensive experiments show that diffusion-based generative models outperform state-of-the-art discriminative approaches, delivering more realistic and accurate occupancy predictions, especially in occluded or low-visibility regions. Moreover, the improved predictions significantly benefit downstream planning tasks, highlighting the practical advantages of our method for real-world autonomous driving applications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While recent advancements in Image Super-Resolution (SR) using diffusion models have shown promise in improving overall image quality, their application to scene text images has revealed limitations. These models often struggle with accurate text region localization and fail to effectively model image and multilingual character-to-shape priors. This leads to inconsistencies, the generation of hallucinated textures, and a decrease in the perceived quality of the super-resolved text. To address these issues, we introduce TextSR, a multimodal diffusion model specifically designed for Multilingual Scene Text Image Super-Resolution. TextSR leverages a text detector to pinpoint text regions within an image and then employs Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract multilingual text from these areas. The extracted text characters are then transformed into visual shapes using a UTF-8 based text encoder and cross-attention. Recognizing that OCR may sometimes produce inaccurate results in real-world scenarios, we have developed two innovative methods to enhance the robustness of our model. By integrating text character priors with the low-resolution text images, our model effectively guides the super-resolution process, enhancing fine details within the text and improving overall legibility. The superior performance of our model on both the TextZoom and TextVQA datasets sets a new benchmark for STISR, underscoring the efficacy of our approach.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Co-Speech Gesture Video Generation aims to generate vivid speech videos from audio-driven still images, which is challenging due to the diversity of different parts of the body in terms of amplitude of motion, audio relevance, and detailed features. Relying solely on audio as the control signal often fails to capture large gesture movements in video, leading to more pronounced artifacts and distortions. Existing approaches typically address this issue by introducing additional a priori information, but this can limit the practical application of the task. Specifically, we propose a Motion Mask-Guided Two-Stage Network (MMGT) that uses audio, as well as motion masks and motion features generated from the audio signal to jointly drive the generation of synchronized speech gesture videos. In the first stage, the Spatial Mask-Guided Audio Pose Generation (SMGA) Network generates high-quality pose videos and motion masks from audio, effectively capturing large movements in key regions such as the face and gestures. In the second stage, we integrate the Motion Masked Hierarchical Audio Attention (MM-HAA) into the Stabilized Diffusion Video Generation model, overcoming limitations in fine-grained motion generation and region-specific detail control found in traditional methods. This guarantees high-quality, detailed upper-body video generation with accurate texture and motion details. Evaluations show improved video quality, lip-sync, and gesture.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>End-to-end autonomous driving faces persistent challenges in both generating diverse, rule-compliant trajectories and robustly selecting the optimal path from these options via learned, multi-faceted evaluation. To address these challenges, we introduce HMAD, a framework integrating a distinctive Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) based trajectory proposal mechanism with learned multi-criteria scoring. HMAD leverages BEVFormer and employs learnable anchored queries, initialized from a trajectory dictionary and refined via iterative offset decoding (inspired by DiffusionDrive), to produce numerous diverse and stable candidate trajectories. A key innovation, our simulation-supervised scorer module, then evaluates these proposals against critical metrics including no at-fault collisions, drivable area compliance, comfortableness, and overall driving quality (i.e., extended PDM score). Demonstrating its efficacy, HMAD achieves a 44.5% driving score on the CVPR 2025 private test set. This work highlights the benefits of effectively decoupling robust trajectory generation from comprehensive, safety-aware learned scoring for advanced autonomous driving.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Appearance editing according to user needs is a pivotal task in video editing. Existing text-guided methods often lead to ambiguities regarding user intentions and restrict fine-grained control over editing specific aspects of objects. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a novel approach named {Zero-to-Hero}, which focuses on reference-based video editing that disentangles the editing process into two distinct problems. It achieves this by first editing an anchor frame to satisfy user requirements as a reference image and then consistently propagating its appearance across other frames. We leverage correspondence within the original frames to guide the attention mechanism, which is more robust than previously proposed optical flow or temporal modules in memory-friendly video generative models, especially when dealing with objects exhibiting large motions. It offers a solid ZERO-shot initialization that ensures both accuracy and temporal consistency. However, intervention in the attention mechanism results in compounded imaging degradation with over-saturated colors and unknown blurring issues. Starting from Zero-Stage, our Hero-Stage Holistically learns a conditional generative model for vidEo RestOration. To accurately evaluate the consistency of the appearance, we construct a set of videos with multiple appearances using Blender, enabling a fine-grained and deterministic evaluation. Our method outperforms the best-performing baseline with a PSNR improvement of 2.6 dB. The project page is at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent inversion-free, flow-based image editing methods such as FlowEdit leverages a pre-trained noise-to-image flow model such as Stable Diffusion 3, enabling text-driven manipulation by solving an ordinary differential equation (ODE). While the lack of exact latent inversion is a core advantage of these methods, it often results in unstable editing trajectories and poor source consistency. To address this limitation, we propose FlowAlign, a novel inversion-free flow-based framework for consistent image editing with principled trajectory control. FlowAlign introduces a flow-matching loss as a regularization mechanism to promote smoother and more stable trajectories during the editing process. Notably, the flow-matching loss is shown to explicitly balance semantic alignment with the edit prompt and structural consistency with the source image along the trajectory. Furthermore, FlowAlign naturally supports reverse editing by simply reversing the ODE trajectory, highlighting the reversible and consistent nature of the transformation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlowAlign outperforms existing methods in both source preservation and editing controllability.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>CLIP is a discriminative model trained to align images and text in a shared embedding space. Due to its multimodal structure, it serves as the backbone of many generative pipelines, where a decoder is trained to map from the shared space back to images. In this work, we show that image synthesis is nevertheless possible using CLIP alone -- without any decoder, training, or fine-tuning. Our approach optimizes a frequency-aware implicit neural representation that encourages coarse-to-fine generation by stratifying frequencies across network layers. To stabilize this inverse mapping, we introduce adversarially robust initialization, a lightweight Orthogonal Procrustes projection to align local text and image embeddings, and a blending loss that anchors outputs to natural image statistics. Without altering CLIP's weights, this framework unlocks capabilities such as text-to-image generation, style transfer, and image reconstruction. These findings suggest that discriminative models may hold untapped generative potential, hidden in plain sight.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Conventional bag-of-words approaches for topic modeling, like latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), struggle with literary text. Literature challenges lexical methods because narrative language focuses on immersive sensory details instead of abstractive description or exposition: writers are advised to "show, don't tell." We propose Retell, a simple, accessible topic modeling approach for literature. Here, we prompt resource-efficient, generative language models (LMs) to tell what passages show, thereby translating narratives' surface forms into higher-level concepts and themes. By running LDA on LMs' retellings of passages, we can obtain more precise and informative topics than by running LDA alone or by directly asking LMs to list topics. To investigate the potential of our method for cultural analytics, we compare our method's outputs to expert-guided annotations in a case study on racial/cultural identity in high school English language arts books.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Imitation Learning has become a fundamental approach in robotic manipulation. However, collecting large-scale real-world robot demonstrations is prohibitively expensive. Simulators offer a cost-effective alternative, but the sim-to-real gap make it extremely challenging to scale. Therefore, we introduce RoboTransfer, a diffusion-based video generation framework for robotic data synthesis. Unlike previous methods, RoboTransfer integrates multi-view geometry with explicit control over scene components, such as background and object attributes. By incorporating cross-view feature interactions and global depth/normal conditions, RoboTransfer ensures geometry consistency across views. This framework allows fine-grained control, including background edits and object swaps. Experiments demonstrate that RoboTransfer is capable of generating multi-view videos with enhanced geometric consistency and visual fidelity. In addition, policies trained on the data generated by RoboTransfer achieve a 33.3% relative improvement in the success rate in the DIFF-OBJ setting and a substantial 251% relative improvement in the more challenging DIFF-ALL scenario.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Contrastive learning has emerged as a competent approach for unsupervised representation learning. However, the design of an optimal augmentation strategy, although crucial for contrastive learning, is less explored for time series classification tasks. Existing predefined time-domain augmentation methods are primarily adopted from vision and are not specific to time series data. Consequently, this cross-modality incompatibility may distort the semantically relevant information of time series by introducing mismatched patterns into the data. To address this limitation, we present a novel perspective from the frequency domain and identify three advantages for downstream classification: global, independent, and compact. To fully utilize the three properties, we propose the lightweight yet effective Frequency Refined Augmentation (FreRA) tailored for time series contrastive learning on classification tasks, which can be seamlessly integrated with contrastive learning frameworks in a plug-and-play manner. Specifically, FreRA automatically separates critical and unimportant frequency components. Accordingly, we propose semantic-aware Identity Modification and semantic-agnostic Self-adaptive Modification to protect semantically relevant information in the critical frequency components and infuse variance into the unimportant ones respectively. Theoretically, we prove that FreRA generates semantic-preserving views. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, including UCR and UEA archives, as well as five large-scale datasets on diverse applications. FreRA consistently outperforms ten leading baselines on time series classification, anomaly detection, and transfer learning tasks, demonstrating superior capabilities in contrastive representation learning and generalization in transfer learning scenarios across diverse datasets.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion-based garment synthesis tasks primarily focus on the design phase in the fashion domain, while the garment production process remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new task: Flat Sketch to Realistic Garment Image (FS2RG), which generates realistic garment images by integrating flat sketches and textual guidance. FS2RG presents two key challenges: 1) fabric characteristics are solely guided by textual prompts, providing insufficient visual supervision for diffusion-based models, which limits their ability to capture fine-grained fabric details; 2) flat sketches and textual guidance may provide conflicting information, requiring the model to selectively preserve or modify garment attributes while maintaining structural coherence. To tackle this task, we propose HiGarment, a novel framework that comprises two core components: i) a multi-modal semantic enhancement mechanism that enhances fabric representation across textual and visual modalities, and ii) a harmonized cross-attention mechanism that dynamically balances information from flat sketches and text prompts, allowing controllable synthesis by generating either sketch-aligned (image-biased) or text-guided (text-biased) outputs. Furthermore, we collect Multi-modal Detailed Garment, the largest open-source dataset for garment generation. Experimental results and user studies demonstrate the effectiveness of HiGarment in garment synthesis. The code and dataset will be released.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Scaling laws motivate the development of Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) that pre-train vast parameters and achieve remarkable zero-shot forecasting performance. Surprisingly, even after fine-tuning, TSFMs cannot consistently outperform smaller, specialized models trained on full-shot downstream data. A key question is how to realize effective adaptation of TSFMs for a target forecasting task. Through empirical studies on various TSFMs, the pre-trained models often exhibit inherent sparsity and redundancy in computation, suggesting that TSFMs have learned to activate task-relevant network substructures to accommodate diverse forecasting tasks. To preserve this valuable prior knowledge, we propose a structured pruning method to regularize the subsequent fine-tuning process by focusing it on a more relevant and compact parameter space. Extensive experiments on seven TSFMs and six benchmarks demonstrate that fine-tuning a smaller, pruned TSFM significantly improves forecasting performance compared to fine-tuning original models. This "prune-then-finetune" paradigm often enables TSFMs to achieve state-of-the-art performance and surpass strong specialized baselines.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present UniTEX, a novel two-stage 3D texture generation framework to create high-quality, consistent textures for 3D assets. Existing approaches predominantly rely on UV-based inpainting to refine textures after reprojecting the generated multi-view images onto the 3D shapes, which introduces challenges related to topological ambiguity. To address this, we propose to bypass the limitations of UV mapping by operating directly in a unified 3D functional space. Specifically, we first propose that lifts texture generation into 3D space via Texture Functions (TFs)--a continuous, volumetric representation that maps any 3D point to a texture value based solely on surface proximity, independent of mesh topology. Then, we propose to predict these TFs directly from images and geometry inputs using a transformer-based Large Texturing Model (LTM). To further enhance texture quality and leverage powerful 2D priors, we develop an advanced LoRA-based strategy for efficiently adapting large-scale Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) for high-quality multi-view texture synthesis as our first stage. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniTEX achieves superior visual quality and texture integrity compared to existing approaches, offering a generalizable and scalable solution for automated 3D texture generation.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent Diffusion models (DMs) advancements have explored incorporating the second-order diffusion Fisher information (DF), defined as the negative Hessian of log density, into various downstream tasks and theoretical analysis. However, current practices typically approximate the diffusion Fisher by applying auto-differentiation to the learned score network. This black-box method, though straightforward, lacks any accuracy guarantee and is time-consuming. In this paper, we show that the diffusion Fisher actually resides within a space spanned by the outer products of score and initial data. Based on the outer-product structure, we develop two efficient approximation algorithms to access the trace and matrix-vector multiplication of DF, respectively. These algorithms bypass the auto-differentiation operations with time-efficient vector-product calculations. Furthermore, we establish the approximation error bounds for the proposed algorithms. Experiments in likelihood evaluation and adjoint optimization demonstrate the superior accuracy and reduced computational cost of our proposed algorithms. Additionally, based on the novel outer-product formulation of DF, we design the first numerical verification experiment for the optimal transport property of the general PF-ODE deduced map.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are of great application across many domains, such as multimodal understanding and generation. With the development of diffusion models (DM) and unified MLLMs, the performance of image generation has been significantly improved, however, the study of image screening is rare and its performance with MLLMs is unsatisfactory due to the lack of data and the week image aesthetic reasoning ability in MLLMs. In this work, we propose a complete solution to address these problems in terms of data and methodology. For data, we collect a comprehensive medical image screening dataset with 1500+ samples, each sample consists of a medical image, four generated images, and a multiple-choice answer. The dataset evaluates the aesthetic reasoning ability under four aspects: \textit{(1) Appearance Deformation, (2) Principles of Physical Lighting and Shadow, (3) Placement Layout, (4) Extension Rationality}. For methodology, we utilize long chains of thought (CoT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization with Dynamic Proportional Accuracy reward, called DPA-GRPO, to enhance the image aesthetic reasoning ability of MLLMs. Our experimental results reveal that even state-of-the-art closed-source MLLMs, such as GPT-4o and Qwen-VL-Max, exhibit performance akin to random guessing in image aesthetic reasoning. In contrast, by leveraging the reinforcement learning approach, we are able to surpass the score of both large-scale models and leading closed-source models using a much smaller model. We hope our attempt on medical image screening will serve as a regular configuration in image aesthetic reasoning in the future.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable advancements, drawing significant attention from the research community. Their capabilities are largely attributed to large-scale architectures, which require extensive training on massive datasets. However, such datasets often contain sensitive or copyrighted content sourced from the public internet, raising concerns about data privacy and ownership. Regulatory frameworks, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), grant individuals the right to request the removal of such sensitive information. This has motivated the development of machine unlearning algorithms that aim to remove specific knowledge from models without the need for costly retraining. Despite these advancements, evaluating the efficacy of unlearning algorithms remains a challenge due to the inherent complexity and generative nature of LLMs. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive auditing framework for unlearning evaluation, comprising three benchmark datasets, six unlearning algorithms, and five prompt-based auditing methods. By using various auditing algorithms, we evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of different unlearning strategies. To explore alternatives beyond prompt-based auditing, we propose a novel technique that leverages intermediate activation perturbations, addressing the limitations of auditing methods that rely solely on model inputs and outputs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Detecting forged remote sensing images is becoming increasingly critical, as such imagery plays a vital role in environmental monitoring, urban planning, and national security. While diffusion models have emerged as the dominant paradigm for image generation, their impact on remote sensing forgery detection remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks primarily target GAN-based forgeries or focus on natural images, limiting progress in this critical domain. To address this gap, we introduce RSFAKE-1M, a large-scale dataset of 500K forged and 500K real remote sensing images. The fake images are generated by ten diffusion models fine-tuned on remote sensing data, covering six generation conditions such as text prompts, structural guidance, and inpainting. This paper presents the construction of RSFAKE-1M along with a comprehensive experimental evaluation using both existing detectors and unified baselines. The results reveal that diffusion-based remote sensing forgeries remain challenging for current methods, and that models trained on RSFAKE-1M exhibit notably improved generalization and robustness. Our findings underscore the importance of RSFAKE-1M as a foundation for developing and evaluating next-generation forgery detection approaches in the remote sensing domain.

However, a major limitation of GenCAD is its inability to consistently produce feasible boundary representations (B-reps), with approximately 10% of generated designs being infeasible. To address this, we propose GenCAD-Self-Repairing, a framework that enhances the feasibility of generative CAD models through diffusion guidance and a self-repairing pipeline. This framework integrates a guided diffusion denoising process in the latent space and a regression-based correction mechanism to refine infeasible CAD command sequences while preserving geometric accuracy. Our approach successfully converted two-thirds of infeasible designs in the baseline method into feasible ones, significantly improving the feasibility rate while simultaneously maintaining a reasonable level of geometric accuracy between the point clouds of ground truth models and generated models. By significantly improving the feasibility rate of generating CAD models, our approach helps expand the availability of high-quality training data and enhances the applicability of AI-driven CAD generation in manufacturing, architecture, and product design.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This work explores the application of Federated Learning (FL) in Unsupervised Semantic image Segmentation (USS). Recent USS methods extract pixel-level features using frozen visual foundation models and refine them through self-supervised objectives that encourage semantic grouping. These features are then grouped to semantic clusters to produce segmentation masks. Extending these ideas to federated settings requires feature representation and cluster centroid alignment across distributed clients -- an inherently difficult task under heterogeneous data distributions in the absence of supervision. To address this, we propose FUSS Federated Unsupervised image Semantic Segmentation) which is, to our knowledge, the first framework to enable fully decentralized, label-free semantic segmentation training. FUSS introduces novel federation strategies that promote global consistency in feature and prototype space, jointly optimizing local segmentation heads and shared semantic centroids. Experiments on both benchmark and real-world datasets, including binary and multi-class segmentation tasks, show that FUSS consistently outperforms local-only client trainings as well as extensions of classical FL algorithms under varying client data distributions.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Determining conditional independence (CI) relationships between random variables is a fundamental yet challenging task in machine learning and statistics, especially in high-dimensional settings. Existing generative model-based CI testing methods, such as those utilizing generative adversarial networks (GANs), often struggle with undesirable modeling of conditional distributions and training instability, resulting in subpar performance. To address these issues, we propose a novel CI testing method via score-based generative modeling, which achieves precise Type I error control and strong testing power. Concretely, we first employ a sliced conditional score matching scheme to accurately estimate conditional score and use Langevin dynamics conditional sampling to generate null hypothesis samples, ensuring precise Type I error control. Then, we incorporate a goodness-of-fit stage into the method to verify generated samples and enhance interpretability in practice. We theoretically establish the error bound of conditional distributions modeled by score-based generative models and prove the validity of our CI tests. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, providing a promising way to revitalize generative model-based CI testing.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text-to-image diffusion models have shown unprecedented generative capability, but their ability to produce undesirable concepts (e.g.~pornographic content, sensitive identities, copyrighted styles) poses serious concerns for privacy, fairness, and safety. {Concept erasure} aims to remove or suppress specific concept information in a generative model. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{TRACE (Trajectory-Constrained Attentional Concept Erasure)}, a novel method to erase targeted concepts from diffusion models while preserving overall generative quality. Our approach combines a rigorous theoretical framework, establishing formal conditions under which a concept can be provably suppressed in the diffusion process, with an effective fine-tuning procedure compatible with both conventional latent diffusion (Stable Diffusion) and emerging rectified flow models (e.g.~FLUX). We first derive a closed-form update to the model's cross-attention layers that removes hidden representations of the target concept. We then introduce a trajectory-aware finetuning objective that steers the denoising process away from the concept only in the late sampling stages, thus maintaining the model's fidelity on unrelated content. Empirically, we evaluate TRACE on multiple benchmarks used in prior concept erasure studies (object classes, celebrity faces, artistic styles, and explicit content from the I2P dataset). TRACE achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming recent methods such as ANT, EraseAnything, and MACE in terms of removal efficacy and output quality.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this position paper we raise critical awareness of a realistic view of LLM capabilities that eschews extreme alternative views that LLMs are either "stochastic parrots" or in possession of "emergent" advanced reasoning capabilities, which, due to their unpredictable emergence, constitute an existential threat. Our middle-ground view is that LLMs extrapolate from priors from their training data, and that a mechanism akin to in-context learning enables the targeting of the appropriate information from which to extrapolate. We call this "context-directed extrapolation." Under this view, substantiated though existing literature, while reasoning capabilities go well beyond stochastic parroting, such capabilities are predictable, controllable, not indicative of advanced reasoning akin to high-level cognitive capabilities in humans, and not infinitely scalable with additional training. As a result, fears of uncontrollable emergence of agency are allayed, while research advances are appropriately refocused on the processes of context-directed extrapolation and how this interacts with training data to produce valuable capabilities in LLMs. Future work can therefore explore alternative augmenting techniques that do not rely on inherent advanced reasoning in LLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Video generative models can be regarded as world simulators due to their ability to capture dynamic, continuous changes inherent in real-world environments. These models integrate high-dimensional information across visual, temporal, spatial, and causal dimensions, enabling predictions of subjects in various status. A natural and valuable research direction is to explore whether a fully trained video generative model in high-dimensional space can effectively support lower-dimensional tasks such as controllable image generation. In this work, we propose a paradigm for video-to-image knowledge compression and task adaptation, termed \textit{Dimension-Reduction Attack} (\texttt{DRA-Ctrl}), which utilizes the strengths of video models, including long-range context modeling and flatten full-attention, to perform various generation tasks. Specially, to address the challenging gap between continuous video frames and discrete image generation, we introduce a mixup-based transition strategy that ensures smooth adaptation. Moreover, we redesign the attention structure with a tailored masking mechanism to better align text prompts with image-level control. Experiments across diverse image generation tasks, such as subject-driven and spatially conditioned generation, show that repurposed video models outperform those trained directly on images. These results highlight the untapped potential of large-scale video generators for broader visual applications. \texttt{DRA-Ctrl} provides new insights into reusing resource-intensive video models and lays foundation for future unified generative models across visual modalities.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Fine-tuning pre-trained generative models with Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as an effective approach for aligning outputs more closely with nuanced human preferences. In this paper, we investigate the application of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to fine-tune next-scale visual autoregressive (VAR) models. Our empirical results demonstrate that this approach enables alignment to intricate reward signals derived from aesthetic predictors and CLIP embeddings, significantly enhancing image quality and enabling precise control over the generation style. Interestingly, by leveraging CLIP, our method can help VAR models generalize beyond their initial ImageNet distribution: through RL-driven exploration, these models can generate images aligned with prompts referencing image styles that were absent during pre-training. In summary, we show that RL-based fine-tuning is both efficient and effective for VAR models, benefiting particularly from their fast inference speeds, which are advantageous for online sampling, an aspect that poses significant challenges for diffusion-based alternatives.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models often exhibit inconsistent sample quality due to stochastic variations inherent in their sampling trajectories. Although training-based fine-tuning (e.g. DDPO [1]) and inference-time alignment techniques[2] aim to improve sample fidelity, they typically necessitate full denoising processes and external reward signals. This incurs substantial computational costs, hindering their broader applicability. In this work, we unveil an intriguing phenomenon: a previously unobserved yet exploitable link between sample quality and characteristics of the denoising trajectory during classifier-free guidance (CFG). Specifically, we identify a strong correlation between high-density regions of the sample distribution and the Accumulated Score Differences (ASD)--the cumulative divergence between conditional and unconditional scores. Leveraging this insight, we introduce CFG-Rejection, an efficient, plug-and-play strategy that filters low-quality samples at an early stage of the denoising process, crucially without requiring external reward signals or model retraining. Importantly, our approach necessitates no modifications to model architectures or sampling schedules and maintains full compatibility with existing diffusion frameworks. We validate the effectiveness of CFG-Rejection in image generation through extensive experiments, demonstrating marked improvements on human preference scores (HPSv2, PickScore) and challenging benchmarks (GenEval, DPG-Bench). We anticipate that CFG-Rejection will offer significant advantages for diverse generative modalities beyond images, paving the way for more efficient and reliable high-quality sample generation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Graph self-supervised learning seeks to learn effective graph representations without relying on labeled data. Among various approaches, graph autoencoders (GAEs) have gained significant attention for their efficiency and scalability. Typically, GAEs take incomplete graphs as input and predict missing elements, such as masked nodes or edges. While effective, our experimental investigation reveals that traditional node or edge masking paradigms primarily capture low-frequency signals in the graph and fail to learn the expressive structural information. To address these issues, we propose Graph Positional Autoencoders (GraphPAE), which employs a dual-path architecture to reconstruct both node features and positions. Specifically, the feature path uses positional encoding to enhance the message-passing processing, improving GAE's ability to predict the corrupted information. The position path, on the other hand, leverages node representations to refine positions and approximate eigenvectors, thereby enabling the encoder to learn diverse frequency information. We conduct extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of GraphPAE, including heterophilic node classification, graph property prediction, and transfer learning. The results demonstrate that GraphPAE achieves state-of-the-art performance and consistently outperforms baselines by a large margin.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the rapid growth of live streaming services, Crowdsourced Cloud-edge service Platforms (CCPs) are playing an increasingly important role in meeting the increasing demand. Although stream scheduling plays a critical role in optimizing CCPs' revenue, most optimization strategies struggle to achieve practical results due to various anomalies in unstable CCPs. Additionally, the substantial scale of CCPs magnifies the difficulties of anomaly detection in time-sensitive scheduling. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes Sentinel, a proactive anomaly detection-based scheduling framework. Sentinel models the scheduling process as a two-stage Pre-Post-Scheduling paradigm: in the pre-scheduling stage, Sentinel conducts anomaly detection and constructs a strategy pool; in the post-scheduling stage, upon request arrival, it triggers an appropriate scheduling based on a pre-generated strategy to implement the scheduling process. Extensive experiments on realistic datasets show that Sentinel significantly reduces anomaly frequency by 70%, improves revenue by 74%, and doubles the scheduling speed.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Process reward models (PRMs) provide more nuanced supervision compared to outcome reward models (ORMs) for optimizing policy models, positioning them as a promising approach to enhancing the capabilities of LLMs in complex reasoning tasks. Recent efforts have advanced PRMs from step-level to token-level granularity by integrating reward modeling into the training of generative models, with reward scores derived from token generation probabilities. However, the conflict between generative language modeling and reward modeling may introduce instability and lead to inaccurate credit assignments. To address this challenge, we revisit token-level reward assignment by decoupling reward modeling from language generation and derive a token-level reward model through the optimization of a discriminative policy, termed the Q-function Reward Model (Q-RM). We theoretically demonstrate that Q-RM explicitly learns token-level Q-functions from preference data without relying on fine-grained annotations. In our experiments, Q-RM consistently outperforms all baseline methods across various benchmarks. For example, when integrated into PPO/REINFORCE algorithms, Q-RM enhances the average Pass@1 score by 5.85/4.70 points on mathematical reasoning tasks compared to the ORM baseline, and by 4.56/5.73 points compared to the token-level PRM counterpart. Moreover, reinforcement learning with Q-RM significantly enhances training efficiency, achieving convergence 12 times faster than ORM on GSM8K and 11 times faster than step-level PRM on MATH.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present Bridging Geometric and Semantic (BriGeS), an effective method that fuses geometric and semantic information within foundation models to enhance Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE). Central to BriGeS is the Bridging Gate, which integrates the complementary strengths of depth and segmentation foundation models. This integration is further refined by our Attention Temperature Scaling technique. It finely adjusts the focus of the attention mechanisms to prevent over-concentration on specific features, thus ensuring balanced performance across diverse inputs. BriGeS capitalizes on pre-trained foundation models and adopts a strategy that focuses on training only the Bridging Gate. This method significantly reduces resource demands and training time while maintaining the model's ability to generalize effectively. Extensive experiments across multiple challenging datasets demonstrate that BriGeS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in MDE for complex scenes, effectively handling intricate structures and overlapping objects.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Factual knowledge extraction aims to explicitly extract knowledge parameterized in pre-trained language models for application in downstream tasks. While prior work has been investigating the impact of supervised fine-tuning data on the factuality of large language models (LLMs), its mechanism remains poorly understood. We revisit this impact through systematic experiments, with a particular focus on the factuality gap that arises when fine-tuning on known versus unknown knowledge. Our findings show that this gap can be mitigated at the inference stage, either under out-of-distribution (OOD) settings or by using appropriate in-context learning (ICL) prompts (i.e., few-shot learning and Chain of Thought (CoT)). We prove this phenomenon theoretically from the perspective of knowledge graphs, showing that the test-time prompt may diminish or even overshadow the impact of fine-tuning data and play a dominant role in knowledge extraction. Ultimately, our results shed light on the interaction between finetuning data and test-time prompt, demonstrating that ICL can effectively compensate for shortcomings in fine-tuning data, and highlighting the need to reconsider the use of ICL prompting as a means to evaluate the effectiveness of fine-tuning data selection methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Predictive coding (PC) is an influential computational model of visual learning and inference in the brain. Classical PC was proposed as a top-down generative model, where the brain actively predicts upcoming visual inputs, and inference minimises the prediction errors. Recent studies have also shown that PC can be formulated as a discriminative model, where sensory inputs predict neural activities in a feedforward manner. However, experimental evidence suggests that the brain employs both generative and discriminative inference, while unidirectional PC models show degraded performance in tasks requiring bidirectional processing. In this work, we propose bidirectional PC (bPC), a PC model that incorporates both generative and discriminative inference while maintaining a biologically plausible circuit implementation. We show that bPC matches or outperforms unidirectional models in their specialised generative or discriminative tasks, by developing an energy landscape that simultaneously suits both tasks. We also demonstrate bPC's superior performance in two biologically relevant tasks including multimodal learning and inference with missing information, suggesting that bPC resembles biological visual inference more closely.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Due to their expressive capacity, diffusion models have shown great promise in offline RL and imitation learning. Diffusion Actor-Critic with Entropy Regulator (DACER) extended this capability to online RL by using the reverse diffusion process as a policy approximator, trained end-to-end with policy gradient methods, achieving strong performance. However, this comes at the cost of requiring many diffusion steps, which significantly hampers training efficiency, while directly reducing the steps leads to noticeable performance degradation. Critically, the lack of inference efficiency becomes a significant bottleneck for applying diffusion policies in real-time online RL settings. To improve training and inference efficiency while maintaining or even enhancing performance, we propose a Q-gradient field objective as an auxiliary optimization target to guide the denoising process at each diffusion step. Nonetheless, we observe that the independence of the Q-gradient field from the diffusion time step negatively impacts the performance of the diffusion policy. To address this, we introduce a temporal weighting mechanism that enables the model to efficiently eliminate large-scale noise in the early stages and refine actions in the later stages. Experimental results on MuJoCo benchmarks and several multimodal tasks demonstrate that the DACER2 algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance in most MuJoCo control tasks with only five diffusion steps, while also exhibiting stronger multimodality compared to DACER.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Existing neural rendering-based urban scene reconstruction methods mainly focus on the Interpolated View Synthesis (IVS) setting that synthesizes from views close to training camera trajectory. However, IVS can not guarantee the on-par performance of the novel view outside the training camera distribution (\textit{e.g.}, looking left, right, or downwards), which limits the generalizability of the urban reconstruction application. Previous methods have optimized it via image diffusion, but they fail to handle text-ambiguous or large unseen view angles due to coarse-grained control of text-only diffusion. In this paper, we design UrbanCraft, which surmounts the Extrapolated View Synthesis (EVS) problem using hierarchical sem-geometric representations serving as additional priors. Specifically, we leverage the partially observable scene to reconstruct coarse semantic and geometric primitives, establishing a coarse scene-level prior through an occupancy grid as the base representation. Additionally, we incorporate fine instance-level priors from 3D bounding boxes to enhance object-level details and spatial relationships. Building on this, we propose the \textbf{H}ierarchical \textbf{S}emantic-Geometric-\textbf{G}uided Variational Score Distillation (HSG-VSD), which integrates semantic and geometric constraints from pretrained UrbanCraft2D into the score distillation sampling process, forcing the distribution to be consistent with the observable scene. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on EVS problem.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) offers near-atomic resolution imaging of macromolecules, but developing robust models for downstream analysis is hindered by the scarcity of high-quality annotated data. While synthetic data generation has emerged as a potential solution, existing methods often fail to capture both the structural diversity of biological specimens and the complex, spatially varying noise inherent in cryo-EM imaging. To overcome these limitations, we propose CryoCCD, a synthesis framework that integrates biophysical modeling with generative techniques. Specifically, CryoCCD produces multi-scale cryo-EM micrographs that reflect realistic biophysical variability through compositional heterogeneity, cellular context, and physics-informed imaging. To generate realistic noise, we employ a conditional diffusion model, enhanced by cycle consistency to preserve structural fidelity and mask-aware contrastive learning to capture spatially adaptive noise patterns. Extensive experiments show that CryoCCD generates structurally accurate micrographs and enhances performance in downstream tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in both particle picking and reconstruction.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>At the core of reinforcement learning is the idea of learning beyond the performance in the data. However, scaling such systems has proven notoriously tricky. In contrast, techniques from generative modeling have proven remarkably scalable and are simple to train. In this work, we combine these strengths, by deriving a direct relation between policy improvement and guidance of diffusion models. The resulting framework, CFGRL, is trained with the simplicity of supervised learning, yet can further improve on the policies in the data. On offline RL tasks, we observe a reliable trend -- increased guidance weighting leads to increased performance. Of particular importance, CFGRL can operate without explicitly learning a value function, allowing us to generalize simple supervised methods (e.g., goal-conditioned behavioral cloning) to further prioritize optimality, gaining performance for "free" across the board.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Blind face restoration from low-quality (LQ) images is a challenging task that requires not only high-fidelity image reconstruction but also the preservation of facial identity. While diffusion models like Stable Diffusion have shown promise in generating high-quality (HQ) images, their VAE modules are typically trained only on HQ data, resulting in semantic misalignment when encoding LQ inputs. This mismatch significantly weakens the effectiveness of LQ conditions during the denoising process. Existing approaches often tackle this issue by retraining the VAE encoder, which is computationally expensive and memory-intensive. To address this limitation efficiently, we propose LAFR (Latent Alignment for Face Restoration), a novel codebook-based latent space adapter that aligns the latent distribution of LQ images with that of HQ counterparts, enabling semantically consistent diffusion sampling without altering the original VAE. To further enhance identity preservation, we introduce a multi-level restoration loss that combines constraints from identity embeddings and facial structural priors. Additionally, by leveraging the inherent structural regularity of facial images, we show that lightweight finetuning of diffusion prior on just 0.9% of FFHQ dataset is sufficient to achieve results comparable to state-of-the-art methods, reduce training time by 70%. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world face restoration benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of LAFR, achieving high-quality, identity-preserving face reconstruction from severely degraded inputs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Fast and scalable alignment of time series is a fundamental challenge in many domains. The standard solution, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), struggles with poor scalability and sensitivity to noise. We introduce TimePoint, a self-supervised method that dramatically accelerates DTW-based alignment while typically improving alignment accuracy by learning keypoints and descriptors from synthetic data. Inspired by 2D keypoint detection but carefully adapted to the unique challenges of 1D signals, TimePoint leverages efficient 1D diffeomorphisms, which effectively model nonlinear time warping, to generate realistic training data. This approach, along with fully convolutional and wavelet convolutional architectures, enables the extraction of informative keypoints and descriptors. Applying DTW to these sparse representations yield major speedups and typically higher alignment accuracy than standard DTW applied to the full signals. TimePoint demonstrates strong generalization to real-world time series when trained solely on synthetic data, and further improves with fine-tuning on real data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimePoint consistently achieves faster and more accurate alignments than standard DTW, making it a scalable solution for time-series analysis.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Spoken language models (SLMs) operate on acoustic units obtained by discretizing self-supervised speech representations. Although the characteristics of these units directly affect performance, the interaction between codebook size and unit coarseness (i.e., duration) remains unexplored. We investigate SLM performance as we vary codebook size and unit coarseness using the simple duration-penalized dynamic programming (DPDP) method. New analyses are performed across different linguistic levels. At the phone and word levels, coarseness provides little benefit, as long as the codebook size is chosen appropriately. However, when producing whole sentences in a resynthesis task, SLMs perform better with coarser units. In lexical and syntactic language modeling tasks, coarser units also give higher accuracies at lower bitrates. We therefore show that coarser units aren't always better, but that DPDP is a simple and efficient way to obtain coarser units for the tasks where they are beneficial.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Video Anomaly Understanding (VAU) is essential for applications such as smart cities, security surveillance, and disaster alert systems, yet remains challenging due to its demand for fine-grained spatio-temporal perception and robust reasoning under ambiguity. Despite advances in anomaly detection, existing methods often lack interpretability and struggle to capture the causal and contextual aspects of abnormal events. This limitation is further compounded by the absence of comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating reasoning ability in anomaly scenarios. To address both challenges, we introduce VAU-R1, a data-efficient framework built upon Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which enhances anomaly reasoning through Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT). Besides, we propose VAU-Bench, the first Chain-of-Thought benchmark tailored for video anomaly reasoning, featuring multiple-choice QA, detailed rationales, temporal annotations, and descriptive captions. Empirical results show that VAU-R1 significantly improves question answering accuracy, temporal grounding, and reasoning coherence across diverse contexts. Together, our method and benchmark establish a strong foundation for interpretable and reasoning-aware video anomaly understanding. Our code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Temporal Action Localization (TAL) has garnered significant attention in information retrieval. Existing supervised or weakly supervised methods heavily rely on labeled temporal boundaries and action categories, which are labor-intensive and time-consuming. Consequently, unsupervised temporal action localization (UTAL) has gained popularity. However, current methods face two main challenges: 1) Classification pre-trained features overly focus on highly discriminative regions; 2) Solely relying on visual modality information makes it difficult to determine contextual boundaries. To address these issues, we propose a CLIP-assisted cross-view audiovisual enhanced UTAL method. Specifically, we introduce visual language pre-training (VLP) and classification pre-training-based collaborative enhancement to avoid excessive focus on highly discriminative regions; we also incorporate audio perception to provide richer contextual boundary information. Finally, we introduce a self-supervised cross-view learning paradigm to achieve multi-view perceptual enhancement without additional annotations. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate our model's superiority over several state-of-the-art competitors.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generating highly dynamic and photorealistic portrait animations driven by audio and skeletal motion remains challenging due to the need for precise lip synchronization, natural facial expressions, and high-fidelity body motion dynamics. We propose a human-preference-aligned diffusion framework that addresses these challenges through two key innovations. First, we introduce direct preference optimization tailored for human-centric animation, leveraging a curated dataset of human preferences to align generated outputs with perceptual metrics for portrait motion-video alignment and naturalness of expression. Second, the proposed temporal motion modulation resolves spatiotemporal resolution mismatches by reshaping motion conditions into dimensionally aligned latent features through temporal channel redistribution and proportional feature expansion, preserving the fidelity of high-frequency motion details in diffusion-based synthesis. The proposed mechanism is complementary to existing UNet and DiT-based portrait diffusion approaches, and experiments demonstrate obvious improvements in lip-audio synchronization, expression vividness, body motion coherence over baseline methods, alongside notable gains in human preference metrics.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Modern reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have found success by using powerful probabilistic models, such as transformers, energy-based models, and diffusion/flow-based models. To this end, RL researchers often choose to pay the price of accommodating these models into their algorithms -- diffusion models are expressive, but are computationally intensive due to their reliance on solving differential equations, while autoregressive transformer models are scalable but typically require learning discrete representations. Normalizing flows (NFs), by contrast, seem to provide an appealing alternative, as they enable likelihoods and sampling without solving differential equations or autoregressive architectures. However, their potential in RL has received limited attention, partly due to the prevailing belief that normalizing flows lack sufficient expressivity. We show that this is not the case. Building on recent work in NFs, we propose a single NF architecture which integrates seamlessly into RL algorithms, serving as a policy, Q-function, and occupancy measure. Our approach leads to much simpler algorithms, and achieves higher performance in imitation learning, offline, goal conditioned RL and unsupervised RL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Graph Representation Learning (GRL) is a fundamental task in machine learning, aiming to encode high-dimensional graph-structured data into low-dimensional vectors. Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods are widely used in GRL because they can avoid expensive human annotation. In this work, we propose a novel Subgraph Gaussian Embedding Contrast (SubGEC) method. Our approach introduces a subgraph Gaussian embedding module, which adaptively maps subgraphs to a structured Gaussian space, ensuring the preservation of input subgraph characteristics while generating subgraphs with a controlled distribution. We then employ optimal transport distances, more precisely the Wasserstein and Gromov-Wasserstein distances, to effectively measure the similarity between subgraphs, enhancing the robustness of the contrastive learning process. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that \method~outperforms or presents competitive performance against state-of-the-art approaches. Our findings provide insights into the design of SSL methods for GRL, emphasizing the importance of the distribution of the generated contrastive pairs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce a novel unsupervised learning method for time series data with latent dynamical structure: the recognition-parametrized Gaussian state space model (RP-GSSM). The RP-GSSM is a probabilistic model that learns Markovian Gaussian latents explaining statistical dependence between observations at different time steps, combining the intuition of contrastive methods with the flexible tools of probabilistic generative models. Unlike contrastive approaches, the RP-GSSM is a valid probabilistic model learned via maximum likelihood. Unlike generative approaches, the RP-GSSM has no need for an explicit network mapping from latents to observations, allowing it to focus model capacity on inference of latents. The model is both tractable and expressive: it admits exact inference thanks to its jointly Gaussian latent prior, while maintaining expressivity with an arbitrarily nonlinear neural network link between observations and latents. These qualities allow the RP-GSSM to learn task-relevant latents without ad-hoc regularization, auxiliary losses, or optimizer scheduling. We show how this approach outperforms alternatives on problems that include learning nonlinear stochastic dynamics from video, with or without background distractors. Our results position the RP-GSSM as a useful foundation model for a variety of downstream applications.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Unlocking deep, interpretable biological reasoning from complex genomic data is a major AI challenge hindering scientific discovery. Current DNA foundation models, despite strong sequence representation, struggle with multi-step reasoning and lack inherent transparent, biologically intuitive explanations. We introduce BioReason, a pioneering architecture that, for the first time, deeply integrates a DNA foundation model with a Large Language Model (LLM). This novel connection enables the LLM to directly process and reason with genomic information as a fundamental input, fostering a new form of multimodal biological understanding. BioReason's sophisticated multi-step reasoning is developed through supervised fine-tuning and targeted reinforcement learning, guiding the system to generate logical, biologically coherent deductions. On biological reasoning benchmarks including KEGG-based disease pathway prediction - where accuracy improves from 88% to 97% - and variant effect prediction, BioReason demonstrates an average 15% performance gain over strong single-modality baselines. BioReason reasons over unseen biological entities and articulates decision-making through interpretable, step-by-step biological traces, offering a transformative approach for AI in biology that enables deeper mechanistic insights and accelerates testable hypothesis generation from genomic data.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Unified generation models aim to handle diverse tasks across modalities -- such as text generation, image generation, and vision-language reasoning -- within a single architecture and decoding paradigm. Autoregressive unified models suffer from slow inference due to sequential decoding, and non-autoregressive unified models suffer from weak generalization due to limited pretrained backbones. We introduce Muddit, a unified discrete diffusion transformer that enables fast and parallel generation across both text and image modalities. Unlike prior unified diffusion models trained from scratch, Muddit integrates strong visual priors from a pretrained text-to-image backbone with a lightweight text decoder, enabling flexible and high-quality multimodal generation under a unified architecture. Empirical results show that Muddit achieves competitive or superior performance compared to significantly larger autoregressive models in both quality and efficiency. The work highlights the potential of purely discrete diffusion, when equipped with strong visual priors, as a scalable and effective backbone for unified generation.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Classical search algorithms have long underpinned modern artificial intelligence. In this work, we tackle the challenge of inference-time control in diffusion models -- adapting generated outputs to meet diverse test-time objectives -- using principles from classical search. We propose a general framework that orchestrates local and global search to efficiently navigate the generative space. It employs a theoretically grounded local search via annealed Langevin MCMC and performs compute-efficient global exploration using breadth-first and depth-first tree search. We evaluate our approach on a range of challenging domains, including planning, offline reinforcement learning, and image generation. Across all tasks, we observe significant gains in both performance and efficiency. These results show that classical search provides a principled and practical foundation for inference-time scaling in diffusion models. Project page at this http URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The model context protocol (MCP) has been widely adapted as an open standard enabling the seamless integration of generative AI agents. However, recent work has shown the MCP is susceptible to retrieval-based "falsely benign" attacks (FBAs), allowing malicious system access and credential theft, but requiring that users download compromised files directly to their systems. Herein, we show that the threat model of MCP-based attacks is significantly broader than previously thought, i.e., attackers need only post malicious content online to deceive MCP agents into carrying out their attacks on unsuspecting victims' systems. To improve alignment guardrails against such attacks, we introduce a new MCP dataset of FBAs and (truly) benign samples to explore the effectiveness of direct preference optimization (DPO) for the refusal training of large language models (LLMs). While DPO improves model guardrails against such attacks, we show that the efficacy of refusal learning varies drastically depending on the model's original post-training alignment scheme--e.g., GRPO-based LLMs learn to refuse extremely poorly. Thus, to further improve FBA refusals, we introduce Retrieval Augmented Generation for Preference alignment (RAG-Pref), a novel preference alignment strategy based on RAG. We show that RAG-Pref significantly improves the ability of LLMs to refuse FBAs, particularly when combined with DPO alignment, thus drastically improving guardrails against MCP-based attacks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, self-supervised, foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advancements in text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models have enabled high-fidelity and realistic video synthesis. However, current T2V models often struggle to generate physically plausible content due to their limited inherent ability to accurately understand physics. We found that while the representations within T2V models possess some capacity for physics understanding, they lag significantly behind those from recent video self-supervised learning methods. To this end, we propose a novel framework called VideoREPA, which distills physics understanding capability from video understanding foundation models into T2V models by aligning token-level relations. This closes the physics understanding gap and enable more physics-plausible generation. Specifically, we introduce the Token Relation Distillation (TRD) loss, leveraging spatio-temporal alignment to provide soft guidance suitable for finetuning powerful pre-trained T2V models, a critical departure from prior representation alignment (REPA) methods. To our knowledge, VideoREPA is the first REPA method designed for finetuning T2V models and specifically for injecting physical knowledge. Empirical evaluations show that VideoREPA substantially enhances the physics commonsense of baseline method, CogVideoX, achieving significant improvement on relevant benchmarks and demonstrating a strong capacity for generating videos consistent with intuitive physics.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper presents Diffusion via Autoregressive models (D-AR), a new paradigm recasting the image diffusion process as a vanilla autoregressive procedure in the standard next-token-prediction fashion. We start by designing the tokenizer that converts images into sequences of discrete tokens, where tokens in different positions can be decoded into different diffusion denoising steps in the pixel space. Thanks to the diffusion properties, these tokens naturally follow a coarse-to-fine order, which directly lends itself to autoregressive modeling. Therefore, we apply standard next-token prediction on these tokens, without modifying any underlying designs (either causal masks or training/inference strategies), and such sequential autoregressive token generation directly mirrors the diffusion procedure in image space. That is, once the autoregressive model generates an increment of tokens, we can directly decode these tokens into the corresponding diffusion denoising step in the streaming manner. Our pipeline naturally reveals several intriguing properties, for example, it supports consistent previews when generating only a subset of tokens and enables zero-shot layout-controlled synthesis. On the standard ImageNet benchmark, our method achieves 2.09 FID using a 775M Llama backbone with 256 discrete tokens. We hope our work can inspire future research on unified autoregressive architectures of visual synthesis, especially with large language models.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this report, we present OpenUni, a simple, lightweight, and fully open-source baseline for unifying multimodal understanding and generation. Inspired by prevailing practices in unified model learning, we adopt an efficient training strategy that minimizes the training complexity and overhead by bridging the off-the-shelf multimodal large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models through a set of learnable queries and a light-weight transformer-based connector. With a minimalist choice of architecture, we demonstrate that OpenUni can: 1) generate high-quality and instruction-aligned images, and 2) achieve exceptional performance on standard benchmarks such as GenEval, DPG- Bench, and WISE, with only 1.1B and 3.1B activated parameters. To support open research and community advancement, we release all model weights, training code, and our curated training datasets (including 23M image-text pairs) at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Accurately predicting immunotherapy response in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) remains a critical unmet need. Existing radiomics and deep learning-based predictive models rely primarily on pre-treatment imaging to predict categorical response outcomes, limiting their ability to capture the complex morphological and textural transformations induced by immunotherapy. This study introduces ImmunoDiff, an anatomy-aware diffusion model designed to synthesize post-treatment CT scans from baseline imaging while incorporating clinically relevant constraints. The proposed framework integrates anatomical priors, specifically lobar and vascular structures, to enhance fidelity in CT synthesis. Additionally, we introduce a novel cbi-Adapter, a conditioning module that ensures pairwise-consistent multimodal integration of imaging and clinical data embeddings, to refine the generative process. Additionally, a clinical variable conditioning mechanism is introduced, leveraging demographic data, blood-based biomarkers, and PD-L1 expression to refine the generative process. Evaluations on an in-house NSCLC cohort treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors demonstrate a 21.24% improvement in balanced accuracy for response prediction and a 0.03 increase in c-index for survival prediction. Code will be released soon.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Modern phonetic research regularly makes use of automatic tools for the annotation of speech data, however few tools exist for the annotation of many variable phonetic phenomena. At the same time, pre-trained self-supervised models, such as wav2vec2.0, have been shown to perform well at speech classification tasks and latently encode fine-grained phonetic information. We demonstrate that wav2vec2.0 models can be trained to automatically classify stop burst presence with high accuracy in both English and Japanese, robust across both finely-curated and unprepared speech corpora. Patterns of variability in stop realisation are replicated with the automatic annotations, and closely follow those of manual annotations. These results demonstrate the potential of pre-trained speech models as tools for the automatic annotation and processing of speech corpus data, enabling researchers to `scale-up' the scope of phonetic research with relative ease.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Counterfactual explanations play a pivotal role in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) by offering intuitive, human-understandable alternatives that elucidate machine learning model decisions. Despite their significance, existing methods for generating counterfactuals often require constant access to the predictive model, involve computationally intensive optimization for each instance and lack the flexibility to adapt to new user-defined constraints without retraining. In this paper, we propose DiCoFlex, a novel model-agnostic, conditional generative framework that produces multiple diverse counterfactuals in a single forward pass. Leveraging conditional normalizing flows trained solely on labeled data, DiCoFlex addresses key limitations by enabling real-time user-driven customization of constraints such as sparsity and actionability at inference time. Extensive experiments on standard benchmark datasets show that DiCoFlex outperforms existing methods in terms of validity, diversity, proximity, and constraint adherence, making it a practical and scalable solution for counterfactual generation in sensitive decision-making domains.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vision-language-action (VLA) models provide a powerful approach to training control policies for physical systems, such as robots, by combining end-to-end learning with transfer of semantic knowledge from web-scale vision-language model (VLM) training. However, the constraints of real-time control are often at odds with the design of VLMs: the most powerful VLMs have tens or hundreds of billions of parameters, presenting an obstacle to real-time inference, and operate on discrete tokens rather than the continuous-valued outputs that are required for controlling robots. To address this challenge, recent VLA models have used specialized modules for efficient continuous control, such as action experts or continuous output heads, which typically require adding new untrained parameters to the pretrained VLM backbone. While these modules improve real-time and control capabilities, it remains an open question whether they preserve or degrade the semantic knowledge contained in the pretrained VLM, and what effect they have on the VLA training dynamics. In this paper, we study this question in the context of VLAs that include a continuous diffusion or flow matching action expert, showing that naively including such experts significantly harms both training speed and knowledge transfer. We provide an extensive analysis of various design choices, their impact on performance and knowledge transfer, and propose a technique for insulating the VLM backbone during VLA training that mitigates this issue.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper addresses the critical need for high-quality evaluation datasets in low-resource languages to advance cross-lingual transfer. While cross-lingual transfer offers a key strategy for leveraging multilingual pretraining to expand language technologies to understudied and typologically diverse languages, its effectiveness is dependent on quality and suitable benchmarks. We release new sense-annotated datasets of sentences containing polysemous words, spanning nine low-resource languages across diverse language families and scripts. To facilitate dataset creation, the paper presents a demonstrably beneficial semi-automatic annotation method. The utility of the datasets is demonstrated through Word-in-Context (WiC) formatted experiments that evaluate transfer on these low-resource languages. Results highlight the importance of targeted dataset creation and evaluation for effective polysemy disambiguation in low-resource settings and transfer studies. The released datasets and code aim to support further research into fair, robust, and truly multilingual NLP.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In-context learning, the ability of large language models to perform tasks using only examples provided in the prompt, has recently been adapted for time series forecasting. This paradigm enables zero-shot prediction, where past values serve as context for forecasting future values, making powerful forecasting tools accessible to non-experts and increasing the performance when training data are scarce. Most existing zero-shot forecasting approaches rely on transformer architectures, which, despite their success in language, often fall short of expectations in time series forecasting, where recurrent models like LSTMs frequently have the edge. Conversely, while LSTMs are well-suited for time series modeling due to their state-tracking capabilities, they lack strong in-context learning abilities. We introduce TiRex that closes this gap by leveraging xLSTM, an enhanced LSTM with competitive in-context learning skills. Unlike transformers, state-space models, or parallelizable RNNs such as RWKV, TiRex retains state-tracking, a critical property for long-horizon forecasting. To further facilitate its state-tracking ability, we propose a training-time masking strategy called CPM. TiRex sets a new state of the art in zero-shot time series forecasting on the HuggingFace benchmarks GiftEval and Chronos-ZS, outperforming significantly larger models including TabPFN-TS (Prior Labs), Chronos Bolt (Amazon), TimesFM (Google), and Moirai (Salesforce) across both short- and long-term forecasts.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Methods for automatic chemical retrosynthesis have found recent success through the application of models traditionally built for natural language processing, primarily through transformer neural networks. These models have demonstrated significant ability to translate between the SMILES encodings of chemical products and reactants, but are constrained as a result of their autoregressive nature. We propose DiffER, an alternative template-free method for retrosynthesis prediction in the form of categorical diffusion, which allows the entire output SMILES sequence to be predicted in unison. We construct an ensemble of diffusion models which achieves state-of-the-art performance for top-1 accuracy and competitive performance for top-3, top-5, and top-10 accuracy among template-free methods. We prove that DiffER is a strong baseline for a new class of template-free model, capable of learning a variety of synthetic techniques used in laboratory settings and outperforming a variety of other template-free methods on top-k accuracy metrics. By constructing an ensemble of categorical diffusion models with a novel length prediction component with variance, our method is able to approximately sample from the posterior distribution of reactants, producing results with strong metrics of confidence and likelihood. Furthermore, our analyses demonstrate that accurate prediction of the SMILES sequence length is key to further boosting the performance of categorical diffusion models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In-context learning (ICL) enables large language models (LLMs) to perform new tasks using only a few demonstrations. In Named Entity Recognition (NER), demonstrations are typically selected based on semantic similarity to the test instance, ignoring training labels and resulting in suboptimal performance. We introduce DEER, a new method that leverages training labels through token-level statistics to improve ICL performance. DEER first enhances example selection with a label-guided, token-based retriever that prioritizes tokens most informative for entity recognition. It then prompts the LLM to revisit error-prone tokens, which are also identified using label statistics, and make targeted corrections. Evaluated on five NER datasets using four different LLMs, DEER consistently outperforms existing ICL methods and approaches the performance of supervised fine-tuning. Further analysis shows its effectiveness on both seen and unseen entities and its robustness in low-resource settings.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Collecting high quality data for object detection tasks is challenging due to the inherent subjectivity in labeling the boundaries of an object. This makes it difficult to not only collect consistent annotations across a dataset but also to validate them, as no two annotators are likely to label the same object using the exact same coordinates. These challenges are further compounded when object boundaries are partially visible or blurred, which can be the case in many domains. Training on noisy annotations significantly degrades detector performance, rendering them unusable, particularly in few-shot settings, where just a few corrupted annotations can impact model performance. In this work, we propose FMG-Det, a simple, efficient methodology for training models with noisy annotations. More specifically, we propose combining a multiple instance learning (MIL) framework with a pre-processing pipeline that leverages powerful foundation models to correct labels prior to training. This pre-processing pipeline, along with slight modifications to the detector head, results in state-of-the-art performance across a number of datasets, for both standard and few-shot scenarios, while being much simpler and more efficient than other approaches.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Transformers have been established as the most popular backbones in sequence modeling, mainly due to their effectiveness in in-context retrieval tasks and the ability to learn at scale. Their quadratic memory and time complexity, however, bound their applicability in longer sequences and so has motivated researchers to explore effective alternative architectures such as modern recurrent neural networks (a.k.a long-term recurrent memory module). Despite their recent success in diverse downstream tasks, they struggle in tasks that requires long context understanding and extrapolation to longer sequences. We observe that these shortcomings come from three disjoint aspects in their design: (1) limited memory capacity that is bounded by the architecture of memory and feature mapping of the input; (2) online nature of update, i.e., optimizing the memory only with respect to the last input; and (3) less expressive management of their fixed-size memory. To enhance all these three aspects, we present ATLAS, a long-term memory module with high capacity that learns to memorize the context by optimizing the memory based on the current and past tokens, overcoming the online nature of long-term memory models. Building on this insight, we present a new family of Transformer-like architectures, called DeepTransformers, that are strict generalizations of the original Transformer architecture. Our experimental results on language modeling, common-sense reasoning, recall-intensive, and long-context understanding tasks show that ATLAS surpasses the performance of Transformers and recent linear recurrent models. ATLAS further improves the long context performance of Titans, achieving +80\% accuracy in 10M context length of BABILong benchmark.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present a keyframe-based framework for generating music-synchronized, choreography aware animal dance videos. Starting from a few keyframes representing distinct animal poses -- generated via text-to-image prompting or GPT-4o -- we formulate dance synthesis as a graph optimization problem: find the optimal keyframe structure that satisfies a specified choreography pattern of beats, which can be automatically estimated from a reference dance video. We also introduce an approach for mirrored pose image generation, essential for capturing symmetry in dance. In-between frames are synthesized using an video diffusion model. With as few as six input keyframes, our method can produce up to 30 second dance videos across a wide range of animals and music tracks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Image vectorization is a powerful technique that converts raster images into vector graphics, enabling enhanced flexibility and interactivity. However, popular image vectorization tools struggle with occluded regions, producing incomplete or fragmented shapes that hinder editability. While recent advancements have explored rule-based and data-driven layer-wise image vectorization, these methods face limitations in vectorization quality and flexibility. In this paper, we introduce LayerPeeler, a novel layer-wise image vectorization approach that addresses these challenges through a progressive simplification paradigm. The key to LayerPeeler's success lies in its autoregressive peeling strategy: by identifying and removing the topmost non-occluded layers while recovering underlying content, we generate vector graphics with complete paths and coherent layer structures. Our method leverages vision-language models to construct a layer graph that captures occlusion relationships among elements, enabling precise detection and description for non-occluded layers. These descriptive captions are used as editing instructions for a finetuned image diffusion model to remove the identified layers. To ensure accurate removal, we employ localized attention control that precisely guides the model to target regions while faithfully preserving the surrounding content. To support this, we contribute a large-scale dataset specifically designed for layer peeling tasks. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that LayerPeeler significantly outperforms existing techniques, producing vectorization results with superior path semantics, geometric regularity, and visual fidelity.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Video generation has made substantial strides with the emergence of deep generative models, especially diffusion-based approaches. However, video generation based on multiple reference subjects still faces significant challenges in maintaining multi-subject consistency and ensuring high generation quality. In this paper, we propose MAGREF, a unified framework for any-reference video generation that introduces masked guidance to enable coherent multi-subject video synthesis conditioned on diverse reference images and a textual prompt. Specifically, we propose (1) a region-aware dynamic masking mechanism that enables a single model to flexibly handle various subject inference, including humans, objects, and backgrounds, without architectural changes, and (2) a pixel-wise channel concatenation mechanism that operates on the channel dimension to better preserve appearance features. Our model delivers state-of-the-art video generation quality, generalizing from single-subject training to complex multi-subject scenarios with coherent synthesis and precise control over individual subjects, outperforming existing open-source and commercial baselines. To facilitate evaluation, we also introduce a comprehensive multi-subject video benchmark. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, paving the way for scalable, controllable, and high-fidelity multi-subject video synthesis.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>High-quality photography in extreme low-light conditions is challenging but impactful for digital cameras. With advanced computing hardware, traditional camera image signal processor (ISP) algorithms are gradually being replaced by efficient deep networks that enhance noisy raw images more intelligently. However, existing regression-based models often minimize pixel errors and result in oversmoothing of low-light photos or deep shadows. Recent work has attempted to address this limitation by training a diffusion model from scratch, yet those models still struggle to recover sharp image details and accurate colors. We introduce a novel framework to enhance low-light raw images by retasking pre-trained generative diffusion models with the camera ISP. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art in perceptual quality across three challenging low-light raw image benchmarks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly enhanced performance on 2D visual tasks. However, improving their spatial intelligence remains a challenge. Existing 3D MLLMs always rely on additional 3D or 2.5D data to incorporate spatial awareness, restricting their utility in scenarios with only 2D inputs, such as images or videos. In this paper, we present Spatial-MLLM, a novel framework for visual-based spatial reasoning from purely 2D observations. Unlike conventional video MLLMs which rely on CLIP-based visual encoders optimized for semantic understanding, our key insight is to unleash the strong structure prior from the feed-forward visual geometry foundation model. Specifically, we propose a dual-encoder architecture: a pretrained 2D visual encoder to extract semantic features, and a spatial encoder-initialized from the backbone of the visual geometry model-to extract 3D structure features. A connector then integrates both features into unified visual tokens for enhanced spatial understanding. Furthermore, we propose a space-aware frame sampling strategy at inference time, which selects the spatially informative frames of a video sequence, ensuring that even under limited token length, the model focuses on frames critical for spatial reasoning. Beyond architecture improvements, we construct the Spatial-MLLM-120k dataset and train the model on it using supervised fine-tuning and GRPO. Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate that our spatial-MLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance in a wide range of visual-based spatial understanding and reasoning tasks.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce LoRAShop, the first framework for multi-concept image editing with LoRA models. LoRAShop builds on a key observation about the feature interaction patterns inside Flux-style diffusion transformers: concept-specific transformer features activate spatially coherent regions early in the denoising process. We harness this observation to derive a disentangled latent mask for each concept in a prior forward pass and blend the corresponding LoRA weights only within regions bounding the concepts to be personalized. The resulting edits seamlessly integrate multiple subjects or styles into the original scene while preserving global context, lighting, and fine details. Our experiments demonstrate that LoRAShop delivers better identity preservation compared to baselines. By eliminating retraining and external constraints, LoRAShop turns personalized diffusion models into a practical `photoshop-with-LoRAs' tool and opens new avenues for compositional visual storytelling and rapid creative iteration.</li>
