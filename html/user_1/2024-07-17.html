<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The neutron diffusion equation plays a pivotal role in the analysis of nuclear reactors. Nevertheless, employing the Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) method for its solution entails certain limitations. Traditional PINN approaches often utilize fully connected network (FCN) architecture, which is susceptible to overfitting, training instability, and gradient vanishing issues as the network depth increases. These challenges result in accuracy bottlenecks in the solution. In response to these issues, the Residual-based Resample Physics-Informed Neural Network(R2-PINN) is proposed, which proposes an improved PINN architecture that replaces the FCN with a Convolutional Neural Network with a shortcut(S-CNN), incorporating skip connections to facilitate gradient propagation between network layers. Additionally, the incorporation of the Residual Adaptive Resampling (RAR) mechanism dynamically increases sampling points, enhancing the spatial representation capabilities and overall predictive accuracy of the model. The experimental results illustrate that our approach significantly improves the model's convergence capability, achieving high-precision predictions of physical fields. In comparison to traditional FCN-based PINN methods, R2-PINN effectively overcomes the limitations inherent in current methods, providing more accurate and robust solutions for neutron diffusion equations.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While diffusion models excel at conditional generating high-quality images, prior works in discrete diffusion models were not evaluated on conditional long-text generation. In this work, we address the limitations of prior discrete diffusion models for conditional long-text generation, particularly in long sequence-to-sequence tasks such as abstractive summarization. Despite fast decoding speeds compared to autoregressive methods, previous diffusion models failed on the abstractive summarization task due to the incompatibility between the backbone architectures and the random noising process. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel semantic-aware noising process that enables Transformer backbones to handle long sequences effectively. Additionally, we propose CrossMamba, an adaptation of the Mamba model to the encoder-decoder paradigm, which integrates seamlessly with the random absorbing noising process. Our approaches achieve state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark summarization datasets: Gigaword, CNN/DailyMail, and Arxiv, outperforming existing discrete diffusion models on ROUGE metrics as well as possessing much faster speed in inference compared to autoregressive models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the rapid development of large language models (LLM), the evaluation of LLM becomes increasingly important. Measuring text generation tasks such as summarization and article creation is very difficult. Especially in specific application domains (e.g., to-business or to-customer service), in-house evaluation criteria have to meet not only general standards (correctness, helpfulness and creativity, etc.) but also specific needs of customers and business security requirements at the same time, making the evaluation more difficult. So far, the evaluation of LLM in business scenarios has mainly relied on manual, which is expensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a model-based evaluation method: TALEC, which allows users to flexibly set their own evaluation criteria, and uses in-context learning (ICL) to teach judge model these in-house criteria. In addition, we try combining zero-shot and few-shot to make the judge model focus on more information. We also propose a prompt paradigm and an engineering approach to adjust and iterate the shots ,helping judge model to better understand the complex criteria. We then compare fine-tuning with ICL, finding that fine-tuning can be replaced by ICL. TALEC demonstrates a strong capability to accurately reflect human preferences and achieves a correlation of over 80% with human judgments, outperforming even the inter-human correlation in some tasks.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI systems by enabling communication with machines using natural language. Recent developments in Generative AI (GenAI) like Vision-Language Models (GPT-4V) and Gemini have shown great promise in using LLMs as multimodal systems. This new research line results in building Generative AI systems, GenAISys for short, that are capable of multimodal processing and content creation, as well as decision-making. GenAISys use natural language as a communication means and modality encoders as I/O interfaces for processing various data sources. They are also equipped with databases and external specialized tools, communicating with the system through a module for information retrieval and storage. This paper aims to explore and state new research directions in Generative AI Systems, including how to design GenAISys (compositionality, reliability, verifiability), build and train them, and what can be learned from the system-based perspective. Cross-disciplinary approaches are needed to answer open questions about the inner workings of GenAI systems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text-to-image models are known to propagate social biases. For example when prompted to generate images of people in certain professions, these models tend to systematically generate specific genders or ethnicity. In this paper, we show that this bias is already present in the text encoder of the model and introduce a Mixture-of-Experts approach by identifying text-encoded bias in the latent space and then creating a bias-identification gate. More specifically, we propose MoESD (Mixture of Experts Stable Diffusion) with BiAs (Bias Adapters) to mitigate gender bias. We also demonstrate that a special token is essential during the mitigation process. With experiments focusing on gender bias, we demonstrate that our approach successfully mitigates gender bias while maintaining image quality.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Clinical trials are fundamental in developing new drugs, medical devices, and treatments. However, they are often time-consuming and have low success rates. Although there have been initial attempts to create large language models (LLMs) for clinical trial design and patient-trial matching, these models remain task-specific and not adaptable to diverse clinical trial tasks. To address this challenge, we propose a clinical trial foundation model named Panacea, designed to handle multiple tasks, including trial search, trial summarization, trial design, and patient-trial matching. We also assemble a large-scale dataset, named TrialAlign, of 793,279 trial documents and 1,113,207 trial-related scientific papers, to infuse clinical knowledge into the model by pre-training. We further curate TrialInstruct, which has 200,866 of instruction data for fine-tuning. These resources enable Panacea to be widely applicable for a range of clinical trial tasks based on user requirements. We evaluated Panacea on a new benchmark, named TrialPanorama, which covers eight clinical trial tasks. Our method performed the best on seven of the eight tasks compared to six cutting-edge generic or medicine-specific LLMs. Specifically, Panacea showed great potential to collaborate with human experts in crafting the design of eligibility criteria, study arms, and outcome measures, in multi-round conversations. In addition, Panacea achieved 14.42% improvement in patient-trial matching, 41.78% to 52.02% improvement in trial search, and consistently ranked at the top for five aspects of trial summarization. Our approach demonstrates the effectiveness of Panacea in clinical trials and establishes a comprehensive resource, including training data, model, and benchmark, for developing clinical trial foundation models, paving the path for AI-based clinical trial development.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Mainstream LLM research has primarily focused on enhancing their generative capabilities. However, even the most advanced LLMs experience uncertainty in their outputs, often producing varied results on different runs or when faced with minor changes in input, despite no substantial change in content. Given multiple responses from the same LLM to the same input, we advocate leveraging the LLMs' discriminative capability to reduce this generative uncertainty, aiding in identifying the correct answers. Specifically, we propose and analyze three discriminative prompts: direct, inverse, and hybrid, to explore the potential of both closed-source and open-source LLMs in self-improving their generative performance on two benchmark datasets. Our insights reveal which discriminative prompt is most promising and when to use it. To our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically analyze LLMs' discriminative capacity to address generative uncertainty.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vibration sensors are essential in acquiring seismic activity for an accurate earthquake assessment. The state-of-the-art sensors can provide the best signal quality and the highest bandwidth; however, their high cost usually hinders a wide range of applicability and coverage, which is otherwise possible with their basic and cheap counterparts. But, their poor quality and low bandwidth can significantly degrade the signal fidelity and result in an imprecise analysis. To address these drawbacks, in this study, we propose a novel, high-quality, and full bandwidth seismic signal synthesis by transforming the signal acquired from an inferior sensor. We employ 1D Operational Generative Adversarial Networks (Op-GANs) with novel loss functions to achieve this. Therefore, the study's key contributions include releasing a new dataset, addressing operational constraints in seismic monitoring, and pioneering a deep-learning transformation technique to create the first virtual seismic sensor. The proposed method is extensively evaluated over the Simulated Ground Motion (SimGM) benchmark dataset, and the results demonstrated that the proposed approach significantly improves the quality and bandwidth of seismic signals acquired from a variety of sensors, including a cheap seismic sensor, the CSN-Phidgets, and the integrated accelerometers of an Android, and iOS phone, to the same level as the state-of-the-art sensor (e.g., Kinemetrics-Episensor). The SimGM dataset, our results, and the optimized PyTorch implementation of the proposed approach are publicly shared.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This review introduces the transformative potential of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) and foundation models, including large language models (LLMs), for health technology assessment (HTA). We explore their applications in four critical areas, evidence synthesis, evidence generation, clinical trials and economic modeling: (1) Evidence synthesis: Generative AI has the potential to assist in automating literature reviews and meta-analyses by proposing search terms, screening abstracts, and extracting data with notable accuracy; (2) Evidence generation: These models can potentially facilitate automating the process and analyze the increasingly available large collections of real-world data (RWD), including unstructured clinical notes and imaging, enhancing the speed and quality of real-world evidence (RWE) generation; (3) Clinical trials: Generative AI can be used to optimize trial design, improve patient matching, and manage trial data more efficiently; and (4) Economic modeling: Generative AI can also aid in the development of health economic models, from conceptualization to validation, thus streamlining the overall HTA process. Despite their promise, these technologies, while rapidly improving, are still nascent and continued careful evaluation in their applications to HTA is required. To ensure their responsible use and implementation, both developers and users of research incorporating these tools, should familiarize themselves with their current limitations, including the issues related to scientific validity, risk of bias, and consider equity and ethical implications. We also surveyed the current policy landscape and provide suggestions for HTA agencies on responsibly integrating generative AI into their workflows, emphasizing the importance of human oversight and the fast-evolving nature of these tools.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Training large language models (LLMs) requires a substantial investment of time and money. To get a good return on investment, the developers spend considerable effort ensuring that the model never produces harmful and offensive outputs. However, bad-faith actors may still try to slander the reputation of an LLM by publicly reporting a forged output. In this paper, we show that defending against such slander attacks requires reconstructing the input of the forged output or proving that it does not exist. To do so, we propose and evaluate a search based approach for targeted adversarial attacks for LLMs. Our experiments show that we are rarely able to reconstruct the exact input of an arbitrary output, thus demonstrating that LLMs are still vulnerable to slander attacks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated Class-Incremental Learning (FCIL) increasingly becomes important in the decentralized setting, where it enables multiple participants to collaboratively train a global model to perform well on a sequence of tasks without sharing their private data. In FCIL, conventional Federated Learning algorithms such as FedAVG often suffer from catastrophic forgetting, resulting in significant performance declines on earlier tasks. Recent works, based on generative models, produce synthetic images to help mitigate this issue across all classes, but these approaches' testing accuracy on previous classes is still much lower than recent classes, i.e., having better plasticity than stability. To overcome these issues, this paper presents Federated Global Twin Generator (FedGTG), an FCIL framework that exploits privacy-preserving generative-model training on the global side without accessing client data. Specifically, the server trains a data generator and a feature generator to create two types of information from all seen classes, and then it sends the synthetic data to the client side. The clients then use feature-direction-controlling losses to make the local models retain knowledge and learn new tasks well. We extensively analyze the robustness of FedGTG on natural images, as well as its ability to converge to flat local minima and achieve better-predicting confidence (calibration). Experimental results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and tiny-ImageNet demonstrate the improvements in accuracy and forgetting measures of FedGTG compared to previous frameworks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Graph-level anomaly detection (GLAD) has already gained significant importance and has become a popular field of study, attracting considerable attention across numerous downstream works. The core focus of this domain is to capture and highlight the anomalous information within given graph datasets. In most existing studies, anomalies are often the instances of few. The stark imbalance misleads current GLAD methods to focus on learning the patterns of normal graphs more, further impacting anomaly detection performance. Moreover, existing methods predominantly utilize the inherent features of nodes to identify anomalous graph patterns which is approved suboptimal according to our experiments. In this work, we propose an imbalanced GLAD method via counterfactual augmentation and feature learning. Specifically, we first construct anomalous samples based on counterfactual learning, aiming to expand and balance the datasets. Additionally, we construct a module based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which allows us to utilize degree attributes to complement the inherent attribute features of nodes. Then, we design an adaptive weight learning module to integrate features tailored to different datasets effectively to avoid indiscriminately treating all features as equivalent. Furthermore, extensive baseline experiments conducted on public datasets substantiate the robustness and effectiveness. Besides, we apply the model to brain disease datasets, which can prove the generalization capability of our work. The source code of our work is available online.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep learning methods have been considered promising for accelerating molecular screening in drug discovery and material design. Due to the limited availability of labelled data, various self-supervised molecular pre-training methods have been presented. While many existing methods utilize common pre-training tasks in computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP), they often overlook the fundamental physical principles governing molecules. In contrast, applying denoising in pre-training can be interpreted as an equivalent force learning, but the limited noise distribution introduces bias into the molecular distribution. To address this issue, we introduce a molecular pre-training framework called fractional denoising (Frad), which decouples noise design from the constraints imposed by force learning equivalence. In this way, the noise becomes customizable, allowing for incorporating chemical priors to significantly improve molecular distribution modeling. Experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing state-of-the-art results across force prediction, quantum chemical properties, and binding affinity tasks. The refined noise design enhances force accuracy and sampling coverage, which contribute to the creation of physically consistent molecular representations, ultimately leading to superior predictive performance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The synthesis of product design concepts stands at the crux of early-phase development processes for technical products, traditionally posing an intricate interdisciplinary challenge. The application of deep learning methods, particularly Deep Generative Models (DGMs), holds the promise of automating and streamlining manual iterations and therefore introducing heightened levels of innovation and efficiency. However, DGMs have yet to be widely adopted into the synthesis of product design concepts. This paper aims to explore the reasons behind this limited application and derive the requirements for successful integration of these technologies. We systematically analyze DGM-families (VAE, GAN, Diffusion, Transformer, Radiance Field), assessing their strengths, weaknesses, and general applicability for product design conception. Our objective is to provide insights that simplify the decision-making process for engineers, helping them determine which method might be most effective for their specific challenges. Recognizing the rapid evolution of this field, we hope that our analysis contributes to a fundamental understanding and guides practitioners towards the most promising approaches. This work seeks not only to illuminate current challenges but also to propose potential solutions, thereby offering a clear roadmap for leveraging DGMs in the realm of product design conception.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Quality assessment of fingerprints captured using digital cameras and smartphones, also called fingerphotos, is a challenging problem in biometric recognition systems. As contactless biometric modalities are gaining more attention, their reliability should also be improved. Many factors, such as illumination, image contrast, camera angle, etc., in fingerphoto acquisition introduce various types of distortion that may render the samples useless. Current quality estimation methods developed for fingerprints collected using contact-based sensors are inadequate for fingerphotos. We propose Utility guided Fingerphoto Quality Assessment (UFQA), a self-supervised dual encoder framework to learn meaningful feature representations to assess fingerphoto quality. A quality prediction model is trained to assess fingerphoto quality with additional supervision of quality maps. The quality metric is a predictor of the utility of fingerphotos in matching scenarios. Therefore, we use a holistic approach by including fingerphoto utility and local quality when labeling the training data. Experimental results verify that our approach performs better than the widely used fingerprint quality metric NFIQ2.2 and state-of-the-art image quality assessment algorithms on multiple publicly available fingerphoto datasets.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as powerful generative models for solving inverse problems, offering a good approximation of prior distributions of real-world image data. Typically, diffusion models rely on large-scale clean signals to accurately learn the score functions of ground truth clean image distributions. However, such a requirement for large amounts of clean data is often impractical in real-world applications, especially in fields where data samples are expensive to obtain. To address this limitation, in this work, we introduce \emph{FlowDiff}, a novel joint training paradigm that leverages a conditional normalizing flow model to facilitate the training of diffusion models on corrupted data sources. The conditional normalizing flow try to learn to recover clean images through a novel amortized inference mechanism, and can thus effectively facilitate the diffusion model's training with corrupted data. On the other side, diffusion models provide strong priors which in turn improve the quality of image recovery. The flow model and the diffusion model can therefore promote each other and demonstrate strong empirical performances. Our elaborate experiment shows that FlowDiff can effectively learn clean distributions across a wide range of corrupted data sources, such as noisy and blurry images. It consistently outperforms existing baselines with significant margins under identical conditions. Additionally, we also study the learned diffusion prior, observing its superior performance in downstream computational imaging tasks, including inpainting, denoising, and deblurring.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Self-supervised learning has recently emerged as the preeminent pretraining paradigm across and between modalities, with remarkable results. In the image domain specifically, group (or cluster) discrimination has been one of the most successful methods. However, such frameworks need to guard against heavily imbalanced cluster assignments to prevent collapse to trivial solutions. Existing works typically solve this by reweighing cluster assignments to promote balance, or with offline operations (e.g. regular re-clustering) that prevent collapse. However, the former typically requires large batch sizes, which leads to increased resource requirements, and the latter introduces scalability issues with regard to large datasets. In this work, we propose ExCB, a framework that tackles this problem with a novel cluster balancing method. ExCB estimates the relative size of the clusters across batches and balances them by adjusting cluster assignments, proportionately to their relative size and in an online manner. Thereby, it overcomes previous methods' dependence on large batch sizes and is fully online, and therefore scalable to any dataset. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our approach and demonstrate that ExCB: a) achieves state-of-the-art results with significantly reduced resource requirements compared to previous works, b) is fully online, and therefore scalable to large datasets, and c) is stable and effective even with very small batch sizes.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In-context learning (ICL) with Large Vision Models (LVMs) presents a promising avenue in medical image segmentation by reducing the reliance on extensive labeling. However, the ICL performance of LVMs highly depends on the choices of visual prompts and suffers from domain shifts. While existing works leveraging LVMs for medical tasks have focused mainly on model-centric approaches like fine-tuning, we study an orthogonal data-centric perspective on how to select good visual prompts to facilitate generalization to medical domain. In this work, we propose a label-efficient in-context medical segmentation method by introducing a novel Meta-driven Visual Prompt Selection mechanism (MVPS), where a prompt retriever obtained from a meta-learning framework actively selects the optimal images as prompts to promote model performance and generalizability. Evaluated on 8 datasets and 4 tasks across 3 medical imaging modalities, our proposed approach demonstrates consistent gains over existing methods under different scenarios, improving both computational and label efficiency. Finally, we show that MVPS is a flexible, finetuning-free module that could be easily plugged into different backbones and combined with other model-centric approaches.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce NOVIC, an innovative uNconstrained Open Vocabulary Image Classifier that uses an autoregressive transformer to generatively output classification labels as language. Leveraging the extensive knowledge of CLIP models, NOVIC harnesses the embedding space to enable zero-shot transfer from pure text to images. Traditional CLIP models, despite their ability for open vocabulary classification, require an exhaustive prompt of potential class labels, restricting their application to images of known content or context. To address this, we propose an "object decoder" model that is trained on a large-scale 92M-target dataset of templated object noun sets and LLM-generated captions to always output the object noun in question. This effectively inverts the CLIP text encoder and allows textual object labels to be generated directly from image-derived embedding vectors, without requiring any a priori knowledge of the potential content of an image. The trained decoders are tested on a mix of manually and web-curated datasets, as well as standard image classification benchmarks, and achieve fine-grained prompt-free prediction scores of up to 87.5%, a strong result considering the model must work for any conceivable image and without any contextual clues.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models such as GPTs (Generative Pre-trained Transformers) exhibit remarkable capabilities across a broad spectrum of applications. Nevertheless, due to their intrinsic complexity, these models present substantial challenges in interpreting their internal decision-making processes. This lack of transparency poses critical challenges when it comes to their adaptation by financial institutions, where concerns and accountability regarding bias, fairness, and reliability are of paramount importance. Mechanistic interpretability aims at reverse engineering complex AI models such as transformers. In this paper, we are pioneering the use of mechanistic interpretability to shed some light on the inner workings of large language models for use in financial services applications. We offer several examples of how algorithmic tasks can be designed for compliance monitoring purposes. In particular, we investigate GPT-2 Small's attention pattern when prompted to identify potential violation of Fair Lending laws. Using direct logit attribution, we study the contributions of each layer and its corresponding attention heads to the logit difference in the residual stream. Finally, we design clean and corrupted prompts and use activation patching as a causal intervention method to localize our task completion components further. We observe that the (positive) heads $10.2$ (head $2$, layer $10$), $10.7$, and $11.3$, as well as the (negative) heads $9.6$ and $10.6$ play a significant role in the task completion.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Facial Action Unit (AU) detection has gained significant research attention as AUs contain complex expression information. In this paper, we unpack two fundamental factors in AU detection: data and subject identity regularization, respectively. Motivated by recent advances in foundation models, we highlight the importance of data and collect a diverse dataset Face9M, comprising 9 million facial images, from multiple public resources. Pretraining a masked autoencoder on Face9M yields strong performance in AU detection and facial expression tasks. We then show that subject identity in AU datasets provides a shortcut learning for the model and leads to sub-optimal solutions to AU predictions. To tackle this generic issue of AU tasks, we propose Identity Adversarial Training (IAT) and demonstrate that a strong IAT regularization is necessary to learn identity-invariant features. Furthermore, we elucidate the design space of IAT and empirically show that IAT circumvents the identity shortcut learning and results in a better solution. Our proposed methods, Facial Masked Autoencoder (FMAE) and IAT, are simple, generic and effective. Remarkably, the proposed FMAE-IAT approach achieves new state-of-the-art F1 scores on BP4D (67.1\%), BP4D+ (66.8\%), and DISFA (70.1\%) databases, significantly outperforming previous work. We release the code and model at this https URL, the first open-sourced facial model pretrained on 9 million diverse images.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this work, we propose to study the global geometrical properties of generative models. We introduce a new Riemannian metric to assess the similarity between any two data points. Importantly, our metric is agnostic to the parametrization of the generative model and requires only the evaluation of its data likelihood. Moreover, the metric leads to the conceptual definition of generative distances and generative geodesics, whose computation can be done efficiently in the data space. Their approximations are proven to converge to their true values under mild conditions. We showcase three proof-of-concept applications of this global metric, including clustering, data visualization, and data interpolation, thus providing new tools to support the geometrical understanding of generative models.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The generation of large-scale urban layouts has garnered substantial interest across various disciplines. Prior methods have utilized procedural generation requiring manual rule coding or deep learning needing abundant data. However, prior approaches have not considered the context-sensitive nature of urban layout generation. Our approach addresses this gap by leveraging a canonical graph representation for the entire city, which facilitates scalability and captures the multi-layer semantics inherent in urban layouts. We introduce a novel graph-based masked autoencoder (GMAE) for city-scale urban layout generation. The method encodes attributed buildings, city blocks, communities and cities into a unified graph structure, enabling self-supervised masked training for graph autoencoder. Additionally, we employ scheduled iterative sampling for 2.5D layout generation, prioritizing the generation of important city blocks and buildings. Our approach achieves good realism, semantic consistency, and correctness across the heterogeneous urban styles in 330 US cities. Codes and datasets are released at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Context-aware emotion recognition (CAER) is a complex and significant task that requires perceiving emotions from various contextual cues. Previous approaches primarily focus on designing sophisticated architectures to extract emotional cues from images. However, their knowledge is confined to specific training datasets and may reflect the subjective emotional biases of the annotators. Furthermore, acquiring large amounts of labeled data is often challenging in real-world applications. In this paper, we systematically explore the potential of leveraging Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to empower the CAER task from three paradigms: 1) We fine-tune LVLMs on two CAER datasets, which is the most common way to transfer large models to downstream tasks. 2) We design zero-shot and few-shot patterns to evaluate the performance of LVLMs in scenarios with limited data or even completely unseen. In this case, a training-free framework is proposed to fully exploit the In-Context Learning (ICL) capabilities of LVLMs. Specifically, we develop an image similarity-based ranking algorithm to retrieve examples; subsequently, the instructions, retrieved examples, and the test example are combined to feed LVLMs to obtain the corresponding sentiment judgment. 3) To leverage the rich knowledge base of LVLMs, we incorporate Chain-of-Thought (CoT) into our framework to enhance the model's reasoning ability and provide interpretable results. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate that LVLMs achieve competitive performance in the CAER task across different paradigms. Notably, the superior performance in few-shot settings indicates the feasibility of LVLMs for accomplishing specific tasks without extensive training.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Anomaly detection is an important function in IoT applications for finding outliers caused by abnormal events. Anomaly detection sometimes comes with high-frequency data sampling which should be carried out at Edge devices rather than Cloud. In this paper, we consider the case that multiple IoT devices are installed in a single remote site and that they collaboratively detect anomalies from the observations with device-to-device communications. For this, we propose a fully distributed collaborative scheme for training distributed anomaly detectors with Wireless Ad Hoc Federated Learning, namely "WAFL-Autoencoder". We introduce the concept of Global Anomaly which sample is not only rare to the local device but rare to all the devices in the target domain. We also propose a distributed threshold-finding algorithm for Global Anomaly detection. With our standard benchmark-based evaluation, we have confirmed that our scheme trained anomaly detectors perfectly across the devices. We have also confirmed that the devices collaboratively found thresholds for Global Anomaly detection with low false positive rates while achieving high true positive rates with few exceptions.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from 2D images and generating diverse views over time presents a significant challenge due to the inherent complexity and temporal dynamics involved. While recent advancements in neural implicit models and dynamic Gaussian Splatting have shown promise, limitations persist, particularly in accurately capturing the underlying geometry of highly dynamic scenes. Some approaches address this by incorporating strong semantic and geometric priors through diffusion models. However, we explore a different avenue by investigating the potential of regularizing the native warp field within the dynamic Gaussian Splatting framework. Our method is grounded on the key intuition that an accurate warp field should produce continuous space-time motions. While enforcing the motion constraints on warp fields is non-trivial, we show that we can exploit knowledge innate to the forward warp field network to derive an analytical velocity field, then time integrate for scene flows to effectively constrain both the 2D motion and 3D positions of the Gaussians. This derived Lucas-Kanade style analytical regularization enables our method to achieve superior performance in reconstructing highly dynamic scenes, even under minimal camera movement, extending the boundaries of what existing dynamic Gaussian Splatting frameworks can achieve.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Aphasia is a language disorder that can lead to speech errors known as paraphasias, which involve the misuse, substitution, or invention of words. Automatic paraphasia detection can help those with Aphasia by facilitating clinical assessment and treatment planning options. However, most automatic paraphasia detection works have focused solely on binary detection, which involves recognizing only the presence or absence of a paraphasia. Multiclass paraphasia detection represents an unexplored area of research that focuses on identifying multiple types of paraphasias and where they occur in a given speech segment. We present novel approaches that use a generative pretrained transformer (GPT) to identify paraphasias from transcripts as well as two end-to-end approaches that focus on modeling both automatic speech recognition (ASR) and paraphasia classification as multiple sequences vs. a single sequence. We demonstrate that a single sequence model outperforms GPT baselines for multiclass paraphasia detection.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The flatfish is a major farmed species consumed globally in large quantities. However, due to the densely populated farming environment, flatfish are susceptible to injuries and diseases, making early disease detection crucial. Traditionally, diseases were detected through visual inspection, but observing large numbers of fish is challenging. Automated approaches based on deep learning technologies have been widely used, to address this problem, but accurate detection remains difficult due to the diversity of the fish and the lack of the fish disease dataset. In this study, augments fish disease images using generative adversarial networks and image harmonization methods. Next, disease detectors are trained separately for three body parts (head, fins, and body) to address individual diseases properly. In addition, a flatfish disease image dataset called \texttt{FlatIMG} is created and verified on the dataset using the proposed methods. A flash salmon disease dataset is also tested to validate the generalizability of the proposed methods. The results achieved 12\% higher performance than the baseline framework. This study is the first attempt to create a large-scale flatfish disease image dataset and propose an effective disease detection framework. Automatic disease monitoring could be achieved in farming environments based on the proposed methods and dataset.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Despite the Graph Neural Networks' (GNNs) proficiency in analyzing graph data, achieving high-accuracy and interpretable predictions remains challenging. Existing GNN interpreters typically provide post-hoc explanations disjointed from GNNs' predictions, resulting in misrepresentations. Self-explainable GNNs offer built-in explanations during the training process. However, they cannot exploit the explanatory outcomes to augment prediction performance, and they fail to provide high-quality explanations of node features and require additional processes to generate explainable subgraphs, which is costly. To address the aforementioned limitations, we propose a self-explained and self-supervised graph neural network (SES) to bridge the gap between explainability and prediction. SES comprises two processes: explainable training and enhanced predictive learning. During explainable training, SES employs a global mask generator co-trained with a graph encoder and directly produces crucial structure and feature masks, reducing time consumption and providing node feature and subgraph explanations. In the enhanced predictive learning phase, mask-based positive-negative pairs are constructed utilizing the explanations to compute a triplet loss and enhance the node representations by contrastive learning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Score distillation sampling (SDS) has emerged as an effective framework in text-driven 3D editing tasks due to its inherent 3D consistency. However, existing SDS-based 3D editing methods suffer from extensive training time and lead to low-quality results, primarily because these methods deviate from the sampling dynamics of diffusion models. In this paper, we propose DreamCatalyst, a novel framework that interprets SDS-based editing as a diffusion reverse process. Our objective function considers the sampling dynamics, thereby making the optimization process of DreamCatalyst an approximation of the diffusion reverse process in editing tasks. DreamCatalyst aims to reduce training time and improve editing quality. DreamCatalyst presents two modes: (1) a faster mode, which edits the NeRF scene in only about 25 minutes, and (2) a high-quality mode, which produces superior results in less than 70 minutes. Specifically, our high-quality mode outperforms current state-of-the-art NeRF editing methods both in terms of speed and quality. See more extensive results on our project page: this https URL.</li>

It is inconvenient for them to take advantage of various off-the-shelf 3D assets with multi-view attributes, and their results suffer from spatiotemporal inconsistency owing to the inherent ambiguity in the supervision signals. In this work, we present Animate3D, a novel framework for animating any static 3D model. The core idea is two-fold: 1) We propose a novel multi-view video diffusion model (MV-VDM) conditioned on multi-view renderings of the static 3D object, which is trained on our presented large-scale multi-view video dataset (MV-Video). 2) Based on MV-VDM, we introduce a framework combining reconstruction and 4D Score Distillation Sampling (4D-SDS) to leverage the multi-view video diffusion priors for animating 3D objects. Specifically, for MV-VDM, we design a new spatiotemporal attention module to enhance spatial and temporal consistency by integrating 3D and video diffusion models. Additionally, we leverage the static 3D model's multi-view renderings as conditions to preserve its identity. For animating 3D models, an effective two-stage pipeline is proposed: we first reconstruct motions directly from generated multi-view videos, followed by the introduced 4D-SDS to refine both appearance and motion. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that Animate3D significantly outperforms previous approaches. Data, code, and models will be open-released.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Determining the necessity of resecting malignant polyps during colonoscopy screen is crucial for patient outcomes, yet challenging due to the time-consuming and costly nature of histopathology examination. While deep learning-based classification models have shown promise in achieving optical biopsy with endoscopic images, they often suffer from a lack of explainability. To overcome this limitation, we introduce EndoFinder, a content-based image retrieval framework to find the 'digital twin' polyp in the reference database given a newly detected polyp. The clinical semantics of the new polyp can be inferred referring to the matched ones. EndoFinder pioneers a polyp-aware image encoder that is pre-trained on a large polyp dataset in a self-supervised way, merging masked image modeling with contrastive learning. This results in a generic embedding space ready for different downstream clinical tasks based on image retrieval. We validate the framework on polyp re-identification and optical biopsy tasks, with extensive experiments demonstrating that EndoFinder not only achieves explainable diagnostics but also matches the performance of supervised classification models. EndoFinder's reliance on image retrieval has the potential to support diverse downstream decision-making tasks during real-time colonoscopy procedures.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Image steganography is the process of hiding secret data in a cover image by subtle perturbation. Recent studies show that it is feasible to use a fixed neural network for data embedding and extraction. Such Fixed Neural Network Steganography (FNNS) demonstrates favorable performance without the need for training networks, making it more practical for real-world applications. However, the stego-images generated by the existing FNNS methods exhibit high distortion, which is prone to be detected by steganalysis tools. To deal with this issue, we propose a Cover-separable Fixed Neural Network Steganography, namely Cs-FNNS. In Cs-FNNS, we propose a Steganographic Perturbation Search (SPS) algorithm to directly encode the secret data into an imperceptible perturbation, which is combined with an AI-generated cover image for transmission. Through accessing the same deep generative models, the receiver could reproduce the cover image using a pre-agreed key, to separate the perturbation in the stego-image for data decoding. such an encoding/decoding strategy focuses on the secret data and eliminates the disturbance of the cover images, hence achieving a better performance. We apply our Cs-FNNS to the steganographic field that hiding secret images within cover images. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method in terms of visual quality and undetectability. Moreover, we show the flexibility of our Cs-FNNS in terms of hiding multiple secret images for different receivers.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Orthodontic treatment usually requires regular face-to-face examinations to monitor dental conditions of the patients. When in-person diagnosis is not feasible, an alternative is to utilize five intra-oral photographs for remote dental monitoring. However, it lacks of 3D information, and how to reconstruct 3D dental models from such sparse view photographs is a challenging problem. In this study, we propose a 3D teeth reconstruction framework, named TeethDreamer, aiming to restore the shape and position of the upper and lower teeth. Given five intra-oral photographs, our approach first leverages a large diffusion model's prior knowledge to generate novel multi-view images with known poses to address sparse inputs and then reconstructs high-quality 3D teeth models by neural surface reconstruction. To ensure the 3D consistency across generated views, we integrate a 3D-aware feature attention mechanism in the reverse diffusion process. Moreover, a geometry-aware normal loss is incorporated into the teeth reconstruction process to enhance geometry accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over current state-of-the-arts, giving the potential to monitor orthodontic treatment remotely.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Model inversion attacks (MIAs) aim to reconstruct private images from a target classifier's training set, thereby raising privacy concerns in AI applications. Previous GAN-based MIAs tend to suffer from inferior generative fidelity due to GAN's inherent flaws and biased optimization within latent space. To alleviate these issues, leveraging on diffusion models' remarkable synthesis capabilities, we propose Diffusion-based Model Inversion (Diff-MI) attacks. Specifically, we introduce a novel target-specific conditional diffusion model (CDM) to purposely approximate target classifier's private distribution and achieve superior accuracy-fidelity balance. Our method involves a two-step learning paradigm. Step-1 incorporates the target classifier into the entire CDM learning under a pretrain-then-finetune fashion, with creating pseudo-labels as model conditions in pretraining and adjusting specified layers with image predictions in fine-tuning. Step-2 presents an iterative image reconstruction method, further enhancing the attack performance through a combination of diffusion priors and target knowledge. Additionally, we propose an improved max-margin loss that replaces the hard max with top-k maxes, fully leveraging feature information and soft labels from the target classifier. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Diff-MI significantly improves generative fidelity with an average decrease of 20% in FID while maintaining competitive attack accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods across various datasets and models. We will release our code and models.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose a deep generative approach using latent temporal processes for modeling and holistically analyzing complex disease trajectories, with a particular focus on Systemic Sclerosis (SSc). We aim to learn temporal latent representations of the underlying generative process that explain the observed patient disease trajectories in an interpretable and comprehensive way. To enhance the interpretability of these latent temporal processes, we develop a semi-supervised approach for disentangling the latent space using established medical knowledge. By combining the generative approach with medical definitions of different characteristics of SSc, we facilitate the discovery of new aspects of the disease. We show that the learned temporal latent processes can be utilized for further data analysis and clinical hypothesis testing, including finding similar patients and clustering SSc patient trajectories into novel sub-types. Moreover, our method enables personalized online monitoring and prediction of multivariate time series with uncertainty quantification.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recognition and generation are two fundamental tasks in computer vision, which are often investigated separately in the exiting literature. However, these two tasks are highly correlated in essence as they both require understanding the underline semantics of visual concepts. In this paper, we propose a new learning framework, coined as CycleHOI, to boost the performance of human-object interaction (HOI) detection by bridging the DETR-based detection pipeline and the pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model. Our key design is to introduce a novel cycle consistency loss for the training of HOI detector, which is able to explicitly leverage the knowledge captured in the powerful diffusion model to guide the HOI detector training. Specifically, we build an extra generation task on top of the decoded instance representations from HOI detector to enforce a detection-generation cycle consistency. Moreover, we perform feature distillation from diffusion model to detector encoder to enhance its representation power. In addition, we further utilize the generation power of diffusion model to augment the training set in both aspects of label correction and sample generation. We perform extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness and generalization power of our CycleHOI with three HOI detection frameworks on two public datasets: HICO-DET and V-COCO. The experimental results demonstrate our CycleHOI can significantly improve the performance of the state-of-the-art HOI detectors.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generating as diverse molecules as possible with desired properties is crucial for drug discovery research, which invokes many approaches based on deep generative models today. Despite recent advancements in these models, particularly in variational autoencoders (VAEs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), Transformers, and diffusion models, a significant challenge known as \textit{the sample bias problem} remains. This problem occurs when generated molecules targeting the same protein tend to be structurally similar, reducing the diversity of generation. To address this, we propose leveraging multi-hop relationships among proteins and compounds. Our model, Repurformer, integrates bi-directional pretraining with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and low-pass filtering (LPF) to capture complex interactions and generate diverse molecules. A series of experiments on BindingDB dataset confirm that Repurformer successfully creates substitutes for anchor compounds that resemble positive compounds, increasing diversity between the anchor and generated compounds.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The latent space of diffusion model mostly still remains unexplored, despite its great success and potential in the field of generative modeling. In fact, the latent space of existing diffusion models are entangled, with a distorted mapping from its latent space to image space. To tackle this problem, we present Isometric Diffusion, equipping a diffusion model with a geometric regularizer to guide the model to learn a geometrically sound latent space of the training data manifold. This approach allows diffusion models to learn a more disentangled latent space, which enables smoother interpolation, more accurate inversion, and more precise control over attributes directly in the latent space. Our extensive experiments consisting of image interpolations, image inversions, and linear editing show the effectiveness of our method.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the remarkable success of generative models like ChatGPT, Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) is undergoing explosive development. Not limited to text and images, generative models can generate industrial time series data, addressing challenges such as the difficulty of data collection and data annotation. Due to their outstanding generation ability, they have been widely used in Internet of Things, metaverse, and cyber-physical-social systems to enhance the efficiency of industrial production. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of generative models for industrial time series from deep generative models (DGMs) to large generative models (LGMs). First, a DGM-based AIGC framework is proposed for industrial time series generation. Within this framework, we survey advanced industrial DGMs and present a multi-perspective categorization. Furthermore, we systematically analyze the critical technologies required to construct industrial LGMs from four aspects: large-scale industrial dataset, LGMs architecture for complex industrial characteristics, self-supervised training for industrial time series, and fine-tuning of industrial downstream tasks. Finally, we conclude the challenges and future directions to enable the development of generative models in industry.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the context of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) that exhibit an elevated prevalence and mortality, the electrocardiogram (ECG) is a popular and standard diagnostic tool for doctors, commonly utilizing a 12-lead configuration in clinical practice. However, the 10 electrodes placed on the surface would cause a lot of inconvenience and discomfort, while the rapidly advancing wearable devices adopt the reduced-lead or single-lead ECG to reduce discomfort as a solution in long-term monitoring. Since the single-lead ECG is a subset of 12-lead ECG, it provides insufficient cardiac health information and plays a substandard role in real-world healthcare applications. Hence, it is necessary to utilize signal generation technologies to reduce their clinical importance gap by reconstructing 12-lead ECG from the real single-lead ECG. Specifically, this study proposes a multi-channel masked autoencoder (MCMA) for this goal. In the experimental results, the visualized results between the generated and real signals can demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. At the same time, this study introduces a comprehensive evaluation benchmark named ECGGenEval, encompassing the signal-level, feature-level, and diagnostic-level evaluations, providing a holistic assessment of 12-lead ECG signals and generative model. Further, the quantitative experimental results are as follows, the mean square errors of 0.0178 and 0.0658, correlation coefficients of 0.7698 and 0.7237 in the signal-level evaluation, the average F1-score with two generated 12-lead ECG is 0.8319 and 0.7824 in the diagnostic-level evaluation, achieving the state-of-the-art performance.

The components of the system are (1) an Information Retrieval system combining semantic and lexical search techniques over scientific papers (PubMed), (2) a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module using fine-tuned generative model (Mistral 7B) and retrieved articles to generate claims with references to the articles from which it was derived, and (3) a Verification engine, based on a fine-tuned DeBERTa and XLM-RoBERTa models on Natural Language Inference task using SciFACT dataset. The verification engine cross-checks the generated claim and the article from which the claim was derived, verifying whether there may have been any hallucinations in generating the claim. By leveraging the Information Retrieval and RAG modules, this http URL excels in generating factual information from a vast array of scientific sources. At the same time, the Verification engine rigorously double-checks this output, ensuring its accuracy and reliability. This dual-stage process plays a crucial role in acquiring and confirming factual information, significantly enhancing the information landscape.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised, foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Current cervical cytopathology whole slide image (WSI) screening primarily relies on detection-based approaches, which are limited in performance due to the expense and time-consuming annotation process. Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), a weakly supervised approach that relies solely on bag-level labels, can effectively alleviate these challenges. Nonetheless, MIL commonly employs frozen pretrained models or self-supervised learning for feature extraction, which suffers from low efficacy or inefficiency. In this paper, we propose an efficient framework for cervical cytopathology WSI classification using only WSI-level labels through unsupervised and weakly supervised learning. Given the sparse and dispersed nature of abnormal cells within cytopathological WSIs, we propose a strategy that leverages the pretrained foundation model to filter the top$k$ high-risk patches. Subsequently, we suggest parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of a large foundation model using contrastive learning on the filtered patches to enhance its representation ability for task-specific signals. By training only the added linear adapters, we enhance the learning of patch-level features with substantially reduced time and memory consumption. Experiments conducted on the CSD and FNAC 2019 datasets demonstrate that the proposed method enhances the performance of various MIL methods and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the realm of stochastic human motion prediction (SHMP), researchers have often turned to generative models like GANS, VAEs and diffusion models. However, most previous approaches have struggled to accurately predict motions that are both realistic and coherent with past motion due to a lack of guidance on the latent distribution. In this paper, we introduce Semantic Latent Directions (SLD) as a solution to this challenge, aiming to constrain the latent space to learn meaningful motion semantics and enhance the accuracy of SHMP. SLD defines a series of orthogonal latent directions and represents the hypothesis of future motion as a linear combination of these directions. By creating such an information bottleneck, SLD excels in capturing meaningful motion semantics, thereby improving the precision of motion predictions. Moreover, SLD offers controllable prediction capabilities by adjusting the coefficients of the latent directions during the inference phase. Expanding on SLD, we introduce a set of motion queries to enhance the diversity of predictions. By aligning these motion queries with the SLD space, SLD is further promoted to more accurate and coherent motion predictions. Through extensive experiments conducted on widely used benchmarks, we showcase the superiority of our method in accurately predicting motions while maintaining a balance of realism and diversity.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised, anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The diagnostic accuracy and subjectivity of existing Knee Osteoarthritis (OA) ordinal grading systems has been a subject of on-going debate and concern. Existing automated solutions are trained to emulate these imperfect systems, whilst also being reliant on large annotated databases for fully-supervised training. This work proposes a three stage approach for automated continuous grading of knee OA that is built upon the principles of Anomaly Detection (AD); learning a robust representation of healthy knee X-rays and grading disease severity based on its distance to the centre of normality. In the first stage, SS-FewSOME is proposed, a self-supervised AD technique that learns the 'normal' representation, requiring only examples of healthy subjects and <3% of the labels that existing methods require. In the second stage, this model is used to pseudo label a subset of unlabelled data as 'normal' or 'anomalous', followed by denoising of pseudo labels with CLIP. The final stage involves retraining on labelled and pseudo labelled data using the proposed Dual Centre Representation Learning (DCRL) which learns the centres of two representation spaces; normal and anomalous. Disease severity is then graded based on the distance to the learned centres. The proposed methodology outperforms existing techniques by margins of up to 24% in terms of OA detection and the disease severity scores correlate with the Kellgren-Lawrence grading system at the same level as human expert performance.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Industrial Multivariate Time Series (MTS) is a critical view of the industrial field for people to understand the state of machines. However, due to data collection difficulty and privacy concerns, available data for building industrial intelligence and industrial large models is far from sufficient. Therefore, industrial time series data generation is of great importance. Existing research usually applies Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate MTS. However, GANs suffer from unstable training process due to the joint training of the generator and discriminator. This paper proposes a temporal-augmented conditional adaptive diffusion model, termed Diff-MTS, for MTS generation. It aims to better handle the complex temporal dependencies and dynamics of MTS data. Specifically, a conditional Adaptive Maximum-Mean Discrepancy (Ada-MMD) method has been proposed for the controlled generation of MTS, which does not require a classifier to control the generation. It improves the condition consistency of the diffusion model. Moreover, a Temporal Decomposition Reconstruction UNet (TDR-UNet) is established to capture complex temporal patterns and further improve the quality of the synthetic time series. Comprehensive experiments on the C-MAPSS and FEMTO datasets demonstrate that the proposed Diff-MTS performs substantially better in terms of diversity, fidelity, and utility compared with GAN-based methods. These results show that Diff-MTS facilitates the generation of industrial data, contributing to intelligent maintenance and the construction of industrial large models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Visual text generation has significantly advanced through diffusion models aimed at producing images with readable and realistic text. Recent works primarily use a ControlNet-based framework, employing standard font text images to control diffusion models. Recognizing the critical role of control information in generating high-quality text, we investigate its influence from three perspectives: input encoding, role at different stages, and output features. Our findings reveal that: 1) Input control information has unique characteristics compared to conventional inputs like Canny edges and depth maps. 2) Control information plays distinct roles at different stages of the denoising process. 3) Output control features significantly differ from the base and skip features of the U-Net decoder in the frequency domain. Based on these insights, we propose TextGen, a novel framework designed to enhance generation quality by optimizing control information. We improve input and output features using Fourier analysis to emphasize relevant information and reduce noise. Additionally, we employ a two-stage generation framework to align the different roles of control information at different stages. Furthermore, we introduce an effective and lightweight dataset for training. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both Chinese and English text generation. The code and dataset will be made available.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Colorway creation is the task of generating textile samples in alternate color variations maintaining an underlying pattern. The individuation of a suitable color palette for a colorway is a complex creative task, responding to client and market needs, stylistic and cultural specifications, and mood. We introduce a modification of this task, the "generative colorway" creation, that includes minimal shape modifications, and propose a framework, "ColorwAI", to tackle this task using color disentanglement on StyleGAN and Diffusion. We introduce a variation of the InterfaceGAN method for supervised disentanglement, ShapleyVec. We use Shapley values to subselect a few dimensions of the detected latent direction. Moreover, we introduce a general framework to adopt common disentanglement methods on any architecture with a semantic latent space and test it on Diffusion and GANs. We interpret the color representations within the models' latent space. We find StyleGAN's W space to be the most aligned with human notions of color. Finally, we suggest that disentanglement can solicit a creative system for colorway creation, and evaluate it through expert questionnaires and creativity theory.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The target duration of a synthesized human motion is a critical attribute that requires modeling control over the motion dynamics and style. Speeding up an action performance is not merely fast-forwarding it. However, state-of-the-art techniques for human behavior synthesis have limited control over the target sequence length. We introduce the problem of generating length-aware 3D human motion sequences from textual descriptors, and we propose a novel model to synthesize motions of variable target lengths, which we dub "Length-Aware Latent Diffusion" (LADiff). LADiff consists of two new modules: 1) a length-aware variational auto-encoder to learn motion representations with length-dependent latent codes; 2) a length-conforming latent diffusion model to generate motions with a richness of details that increases with the required target sequence length. LADiff significantly improves over the state-of-the-art across most of the existing motion synthesis metrics on the two established benchmarks of HumanML3D and KIT-ML.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present a novel approach for generating minority samples that live on low-density regions of a data manifold. Our framework is built upon diffusion models, leveraging the principle of guided sampling that incorporates an arbitrary energy-based guidance during inference time. The key defining feature of our sampler lies in its \emph{self-contained} nature, \ie, implementable solely with a pretrained model. This distinguishes our sampler from existing techniques that require expensive additional components (like external classifiers) for minority generation. Specifically, we first estimate the likelihood of features within an intermediate latent sample by evaluating a reconstruction loss w.r.t. its posterior mean. The generation then proceeds with the minimization of the estimated likelihood, thereby encouraging the emergence of minority features in the latent samples of subsequent timesteps. To further improve the performance of our sampler, we provide several time-scheduling techniques that properly manage the influence of guidance over inference steps. Experiments on benchmark real datasets demonstrate that our approach can greatly improve the capability of creating realistic low-likelihood minority instances over the existing techniques without the reliance on costly additional elements.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Digital image manipulation has become increasingly accessible and realistic with the advent of generative AI technologies. Recent developments allow for text-guided inpainting, making sophisticated image edits possible with minimal effort. This poses new challenges for digital media forensics. For example, diffusion model-based approaches could either splice the inpainted region into the original image, or regenerate the entire image. In the latter case, traditional image forgery localization (IFL) methods typically fail. This paper introduces the Text-Guided Inpainting Forgery (TGIF) dataset, a comprehensive collection of images designed to support the training and evaluation of image forgery localization and synthetic image detection (SID) methods. The TGIF dataset includes approximately 80k forged images, originating from popular open-source and commercial methods; SD2, SDXL, and Adobe Firefly. Using this data, we benchmark several state-of-the-art IFL and SID methods. Whereas traditional IFL methods can detect spliced images, they fail to detect regenerated inpainted images. Moreover, traditional SID may detect the regenerated inpainted images to be fake, but cannot localize the inpainted area. Finally, both types of methods fail when exposed to stronger compression, while they are less robust to modern compression algorithms, such as WEBP. As such, this work demonstrates the inefficiency of state-of-the-art detectors on local manipulations performed by modern generative approaches, and aspires to help with the development of more capable IFL and SID methods.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the advent of large pre-trained transformer models, fine-tuning these models for various downstream tasks is a critical problem. Paucity of training data, the existence of data silos, and stringent privacy constraints exacerbate this fine-tuning problem in the medical imaging domain, creating a strong need for algorithms that enable collaborative fine-tuning of pre-trained models. Moreover, the large size of these models necessitates the use of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to reduce the communication burden in federated learning. In this work, we systematically investigate various federated PEFT strategies for adapting a Vision Transformer (ViT) model (pre-trained on a large natural image dataset) for medical image classification. Apart from evaluating known PEFT techniques, we introduce new federated variants of PEFT algorithms such as visual prompt tuning (VPT), low-rank decomposition of visual prompts, stochastic block attention fine-tuning, and hybrid PEFT methods like low-rank adaptation (LoRA)+VPT. Moreover, we perform a thorough empirical analysis to identify the optimal PEFT method for the federated setting and understand the impact of data distribution on federated PEFT, especially for out-of-domain (OOD) and non-IID data. The key insight of this study is that while most federated PEFT methods work well for in-domain transfer, there is a substantial accuracy vs. efficiency trade-off when dealing with OOD and non-IID scenarios, which is commonly the case in medical imaging. Specifically, every order of magnitude reduction in fine-tuned/exchanged parameters can lead to a 4% drop in accuracy. Thus, the initial model choice is crucial for federated PEFT. It is preferable to use medical foundation models learned from in-domain medical image data (if available) rather than general vision models.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This study introduces a novel Remote Sensing (RS) Urban Prediction (UP) task focused on future urban planning, which aims to forecast urban layouts by utilizing information from existing urban layouts and planned change maps. To address the proposed RS UP task, we propose UP-Diff, which leverages a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to capture positionaware embeddings of pre-change urban layouts and planned change maps. In specific, the trainable cross-attention layers within UP-Diff's iterative diffusion modules enable the model to dynamically highlight crucial regions for targeted modifications. By utilizing our UP-Diff, designers can effectively refine and adjust future urban city plans by making modifications to the change maps in a dynamic and adaptive manner. Compared with conventional RS Change Detection (CD) methods, the proposed UP-Diff for the RS UP task avoids the requirement of paired prechange and post-change images, which enhances the practical usage in city development. Experimental results on LEVIRCD and SYSU-CD datasets show UP-Diff's ability to accurately predict future urban layouts with high fidelity, demonstrating its potential for urban planning. Code and model weights will be available upon the acceptance of the work.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recently, video diffusion models (VDMs) have garnered significant attention due to their notable advancements in generating coherent and realistic video content. However, processing multiple frame features concurrently, coupled with the considerable model size, results in high latency and extensive memory consumption, hindering their broader application. Post-training quantization (PTQ) is an effective technique to reduce memory footprint and improve computational efficiency. Unlike image diffusion, we observe that the temporal features, which are integrated into all frame features, exhibit pronounced skewness. Furthermore, we investigate significant inter-channel disparities and asymmetries in the activation of video diffusion models, resulting in low coverage of quantization levels by individual channels and increasing the challenge of quantization. To address these issues, we introduce the first PTQ strategy tailored for video diffusion models, dubbed QVD. Specifically, we propose the High Temporal Discriminability Quantization (HTDQ) method, designed for temporal features, which retains the high discriminability of quantized features, providing precise temporal guidance for all video frames. In addition, we present the Scattered Channel Range Integration (SCRI) method which aims to improve the coverage of quantization levels across individual channels. Experimental validations across various models, datasets, and bit-width settings demonstrate the effectiveness of our QVD in terms of diverse metrics. In particular, we achieve near-lossless performance degradation on W8A8, outperforming the current methods by 205.12 in FVD.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, self-supervised, foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as powerful foundation models for a variety of tasks, with a large focus in synthetic image generation. However, their requirement of large annotated datasets for training limits their applicability in medical imaging, where datasets are typically smaller and sparsely annotated. We introduce DiNO-Diffusion, a self-supervised method for training latent diffusion models (LDMs) that conditions the generation process on image embeddings extracted from DiNO. By eliminating the reliance on annotations, our training leverages over 868k unlabelled images from public chest X-Ray (CXR) datasets. Despite being self-supervised, DiNO-Diffusion shows comprehensive manifold coverage, with FID scores as low as 4.7, and emerging properties when evaluated in downstream tasks. It can be used to generate semantically-diverse synthetic datasets even from small data pools, demonstrating up to 20% AUC increase in classification performance when used for data augmentation. Images were generated with different sampling strategies over the DiNO embedding manifold and using real images as a starting point. Results suggest, DiNO-Diffusion could facilitate the creation of large datasets for flexible training of downstream AI models from limited amount of real data, while also holding potential for privacy preservation. Additionally, DiNO-Diffusion demonstrates zero-shot segmentation performance of up to 84.4% Dice score when evaluating lung lobe segmentation. This evidences good CXR image-anatomy alignment, akin to segmenting using textual descriptors on vanilla DMs. Finally, DiNO-Diffusion can be easily adapted to other medical imaging modalities or state-of-the-art diffusion models, opening the door for large-scale, multi-domain image generation pipelines for medical imaging.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we present DiT-MoE, a sparse version of the diffusion Transformer, that is scalable and competitive with dense networks while exhibiting highly optimized inference. The DiT-MoE includes two simple designs: shared expert routing and expert-level balance loss, thereby capturing common knowledge and reducing redundancy among the different routed experts. When applied to conditional image generation, a deep analysis of experts specialization gains some interesting observations: (i) Expert selection shows preference with spatial position and denoising time step, while insensitive with different class-conditional information; (ii) As the MoE layers go deeper, the selection of experts gradually shifts from specific spacial position to dispersion and balance. (iii) Expert specialization tends to be more concentrated at the early time step and then gradually uniform after half. We attribute it to the diffusion process that first models the low-frequency spatial information and then high-frequency complex information. Based on the above guidance, a series of DiT-MoE experimentally achieves performance on par with dense networks yet requires much less computational load during inference. More encouragingly, we demonstrate the potential of DiT-MoE with synthesized image data, scaling diffusion model at a 16.5B parameter that attains a new SoTA FID-50K score of 1.80 in 512$\times$512 resolution settings.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated Learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving approach to train models on decentralized data. Its potential in healthcare is significant, but challenges arise due to cross-client variations in medical image data, exacerbated by limited annotations. This paper introduces Cross-Client Variations Adaptive Federated Learning (CCVA-FL) to address these issues. CCVA-FL aims to minimize cross-client variations by transforming images into a common feature space. It involves expert annotation of a subset of images from each client, followed by the selection of a client with the least data complexity as the target. Synthetic medical images are then generated using Scalable Diffusion Models with Transformers (DiT) based on the target client's annotated images. These synthetic images, capturing diversity and representing the original data, are shared with other clients. Each client then translates its local images into the target image space using image-to-image translation. The translated images are subsequently used in a federated learning setting to develop a server model. Our results demonstrate that CCVA-FL outperforms Vanilla Federated Averaging by effectively addressing data distribution differences across clients without compromising privacy.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Creating in-silico data with generative AI promises a cost-effective alternative to staining, imaging, and annotating whole slide images in computational pathology. Diffusion models are the state-of-the-art solution for generating in-silico images, offering unparalleled fidelity and realism. Using appearance transfer diffusion models allows for zero-shot image generation, facilitating fast application and making model training unnecessary. However current appearance transfer diffusion models are designed for natural images, where the main task is to transfer the foreground object from an origin to a target domain, while the background is of insignificant importance. In computational pathology, specifically in oncology, it is however not straightforward to define which objects in an image should be classified as foreground and background, as all objects in an image may be of critical importance for the detailed understanding the tumor micro-environment. We contribute to the applicability of appearance transfer diffusion models to immunohistochemistry-stained images by modifying the appearance transfer guidance to alternate between class-specific AdaIN feature statistics matchings using existing segmentation masks. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated on the downstream task of supervised epithelium segmentation, showing that the number of manual annotations required for model training can be reduced by 75%, outperforming the baseline approach. Additionally, we consulted with a certified pathologist to investigate future improvements. We anticipate this work to inspire the application of zero-shot diffusion models in computational pathology, providing an efficient method to generate in-silico images with unmatched fidelity and realism, which prove meaningful for downstream tasks, such as training existing deep learning models or finetuning foundation models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Change captioning aims to succinctly describe the semantic change between a pair of similar images, while being immune to distractors (illumination and viewpoint changes). Under these distractors, unchanged objects often appear pseudo changes about location and scale, and certain objects might overlap others, resulting in perturbational and discrimination-degraded features between two images. However, most existing methods directly capture the difference between them, which risk obtaining error-prone difference features. In this paper, we propose a distractors-immune representation learning network that correlates the corresponding channels of two image representations and decorrelates different ones in a self-supervised manner, thus attaining a pair of stable image representations under distractors. Then, the model can better interact them to capture the reliable difference features for caption generation. To yield words based on the most related difference features, we further design a cross-modal contrastive regularization, which regularizes the cross-modal alignment by maximizing the contrastive alignment between the attended difference features and generated words. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on four public datasets. The code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Global data assimilation enables weather forecasting at all scales and provides valuable data for studying the Earth system. However, the computational demands of physics-based algorithms used in operational systems limits the volume and diversity of observations that are assimilated. Here, we present "EarthNet", a multi-modal foundation model for data assimilation that learns to predict a global gap-filled atmospheric state solely from satellite observations. EarthNet is trained as a masked autoencoder that ingests a 12 hour sequence of observations and learns to fill missing data from other sensors. We show that EarthNet performs a form of data assimilation producing a global 0.16 degree reanalysis dataset of 3D atmospheric temperature and humidity at a fraction of the time compared to operational systems. It is shown that the resulting reanalysis dataset reproduces climatology by evaluating a 1 hour forecast background state against observations. We also show that our 3D humidity predictions outperform MERRA-2 and ERA5 reanalyses by 10% to 60% between the middle troposphere and lower stratosphere (5 to 20 km altitude) and our 3D temperature and humidity are statistically equivalent to the Microwave integrated Retrieval System (MiRS) observations at nearly every level of the atmosphere. Our results indicate significant promise in using EarthNet for high-frequency data assimilation and global weather forecasting.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>To tackle the difficulties in fitting paired real-world data for single image deraining (SID), recent unsupervised methods have achieved notable success. However, these methods often struggle to generate high-quality, rain-free images due to a lack of attention to semantic representation and image content, resulting in ineffective separation of content from the rain layer. In this paper, we propose a novel cycle contrastive generative adversarial network for unsupervised SID, called CCLGAN. This framework combines cycle contrastive learning (CCL) and location contrastive learning (LCL). CCL improves image reconstruction and rain-layer removal by bringing similar features closer and pushing dissimilar features apart in both semantic and discriminative spaces. At the same time, LCL preserves content information by constraining mutual information at the same location across different exemplars. CCLGAN shows superior performance, as extensive experiments demonstrate the benefits of CCLGAN and the effectiveness of its components.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Action-centric sequence descriptions like recipe instructions and do-it-yourself projects include non-linear patterns in which the next step may require to be visually consistent not on the immediate previous step but on earlier steps. Current video synthesis approaches fail to generate consistent multi-scene videos for such task descriptions. We propose a contrastive sequential video diffusion method that selects the most suitable previously generated scene to guide and condition the denoising process of the next scene. The result is a multi-scene video that is grounded in the scene descriptions and coherent w.r.t the scenes that require consistent visualisation. Our experiments with real-world data demonstrate the practicality and improved consistency of our model compared to prior work.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While the use of machine learning for the detection of propaganda techniques in text has garnered considerable attention, most approaches focus on "black-box" solutions with opaque inner workings. Interpretable approaches provide a solution, however, they depend on careful feature engineering and costly expert annotated data. Additionally, language features specific to propagandistic text are generally the focus of rhetoricians or linguists, and there is no data set labeled with such features suitable for machine learning. This study codifies 22 rhetorical and linguistic features identified in literature related to the language of persuasion for the purpose of annotating an existing data set labeled with propaganda techniques. To help human experts annotate natural language sentences with these features, RhetAnn, a web application, was specifically designed to minimize an otherwise considerable mental effort. Finally, a small set of annotated data was used to fine-tune GPT-3.5, a generative large language model (LLM), to annotate the remaining data while optimizing for financial cost and classification accuracy. This study demonstrates how combining a small number of human annotated examples with GPT can be an effective strategy for scaling the annotation process at a fraction of the cost of traditional annotation relying solely on human experts. The results are on par with the best performing model at the time of writing, namely GPT-4, at 10x less the cost. Our contribution is a set of features, their properties, definitions, and examples in a machine-readable format, along with the code for RhetAnn and the GPT prompts and fine-tuning procedures for advancing state-of-the-art interpretable propaganda technique detection.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Machine unlearning methods seek to revise pretrained models such that effects of certain training samples can be removed. In addition to effective erasure, low computational cost and general utility retention are also highly desirable. Existing unlearning methods usually involve iterative updates over the model parameters, which incurs a high computational cost. In this work, we propose an efficient method that only requires a one-time gradient computation, with which we modify only a single layer of model parameters. Specifically, we first identify a small number of model layers that lie on the Pareto front of high forget importance and low retain influence as critical layers. Then we search for a suitable step size and take a step along the gradient direction of a single critical layer while keeping other layers frozen. This method is highly modular and can be used to unlearn multiple concepts simultaneously in a controllable manner. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of this method on various models including CLIP, stable diffusion, and VLMs, surpassing other state-of-the-art methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Cloud workloads have dominated generative AI based on large language models (LLM). Specialized hardware accelerators, such as GPUs, NPUs, and TPUs, play a key role in AI adoption due to their superior performance over general-purpose CPUs. The AI models and the data are often highly sensitive and come from mutually distrusting parties. Existing CPU-based TEEs such as Intel SGX or AMD SEV do not provide sufficient protection. Device-centric TEEs like Nvidia-CC only address tightly coupled CPU-GPU systems with a proprietary solution requiring TEE on the host CPU side. On the other hand, existing academic proposals are tailored toward specific CPU-TEE platforms. To address this gap, we propose Ascend-CC, a confidential computing architecture based on discrete NPU devices that requires no trust in the host system. Ascend-CC provides strong security by ensuring data and model encryption that protects not only the data but also the model parameters and operator binaries. Ascend-CC uses delegation-based memory semantics to ensure isolation from the host software stack, and task attestation provides strong model integrity guarantees. Our Ascend-CC implementation and evaluation with state-of-the-art LLMs such as Llama2 and Llama3 shows that Ascend-CC introduces minimal overhead with no changes in the AI software stack.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Image composition is a complex task which requires a lot of information about the scene for an accurate and realistic composition, such as perspective, lighting, shadows, occlusions, and object interactions. Previous methods have predominantly used 2D information for image composition, neglecting the potentials of 3D spatial information. In this work, we propose DepGAN, a Generative Adversarial Network that utilizes depth maps and alpha channels to rectify inaccurate occlusions and enhance transparency effects in image composition. Central to our network is a novel loss function called Depth Aware Loss which quantifies the pixel wise depth difference to accurately delineate occlusion boundaries while compositing objects at different depth levels. Furthermore, we enhance our network's learning process by utilizing opacity data, enabling it to effectively manage compositions involving transparent and semi-transparent objects. We tested our model against state-of-the-art image composition GANs on benchmark (both real and synthetic) datasets. The results reveal that DepGAN significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy of object placement semantics, transparency and occlusion handling, both visually and quantitatively.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Graph neural networks are typically trained on individual datasets, often requiring highly specialized models and extensive hyperparameter tuning. This dataset-specific approach arises because each graph dataset often has unique node features and diverse connectivity structures, making it difficult to build a generalist model. To address these challenges, we introduce a scalable multi-graph multi-task pretraining approach specifically tailored for node classification tasks across diverse graph datasets from different domains. Our method, Graph Foundation Model (GraphFM), leverages a Perceiver-based encoder that employs learned latent tokens to compress domain-specific features into a common latent space. This approach enhances the model's ability to generalize across different graphs and allows for scaling across diverse data. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by training a model on 152 different graph datasets comprising over 7.4 million nodes and 189 million edges, establishing the first set of scaling laws for multi-graph pretraining on datasets spanning many domains (e.g., molecules, citation and product graphs). Our results show that pretraining on a diverse array of real and synthetic graphs improves the model's adaptability and stability, while performing competitively with state-of-the-art specialist models. This work illustrates that multi-graph pretraining can significantly reduce the burden imposed by the current graph training paradigm, unlocking new capabilities for the field of graph neural networks by creating a single generalist model that performs competitively across a wide range of datasets and tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose a new uncertainty estimator for gradient-free optimisation of black-box simulators using deep generative surrogate models. Optimisation of these simulators is especially challenging for stochastic simulators and higher dimensions. To address these issues, we utilise a deep generative surrogate approach to model the black box response for the entire parameter space. We then leverage this knowledge to estimate the proposed uncertainty based on the Wasserstein distance - the Wasserstein uncertainty. This approach is employed in a posterior agnostic gradient-free optimisation algorithm that minimises regret over the entire parameter space. A series of tests were conducted to demonstrate that our method is more robust to the shape of both the black box function and the stochastic response of the black box than state-of-the-art methods, such as efficient global optimisation with a deep Gaussian process surrogate.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This study explores the recently proposed challenging multi-view Anomaly Detection (AD) task. Single-view tasks would encounter blind spots from other perspectives, resulting in inaccuracies in sample-level prediction. Therefore, we introduce the \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{V}iew \textbf{A}nomaly \textbf{D}etection (\textbf{MVAD}) framework, which learns and integrates features from multi-views. Specifically, we proposed a \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{V}iew \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{S}election (\textbf{MVAS}) algorithm for feature learning and fusion across multiple views. The feature maps are divided into neighbourhood attention windows to calculate a semantic correlation matrix between single-view windows and all other views, which is a conducted attention mechanism for each single-view window and the top-K most correlated multi-view windows. Adjusting the window sizes and top-K can minimise the computational complexity to linear. Extensive experiments on the Real-IAD dataset for cross-setting (multi/single-class) validate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance among sample \textbf{4.1\%}$\uparrow$/ image \textbf{5.6\%}$\uparrow$/pixel \textbf{6.7\%}$\uparrow$ levels with a total of ten metrics with only \textbf{18M} parameters and fewer GPU memory and training time.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Long-term action anticipation has become an important task for many applications such as autonomous driving and human-robot interaction. Unlike short-term anticipation, predicting more actions into the future imposes a real challenge with the increasing uncertainty in longer horizons. While there has been a significant progress in predicting more actions into the future, most of the proposed methods address the task in a deterministic setup and ignore the underlying uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a novel Gated Temporal Diffusion (GTD) network that models the uncertainty of both the observation and the future predictions. As generator, we introduce a Gated Anticipation Network (GTAN) to model both observed and unobserved frames of a video in a mutual representation. On the one hand, using a mutual representation for past and future allows us to jointly model ambiguities in the observation and future, while on the other hand GTAN can by design treat the observed and unobserved parts differently and steer the information flow between them. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results on the Breakfast, Assembly101 and 50Salads datasets in both stochastic and deterministic settings. Code: this https URL .</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Cities, as the most fundamental environment of human life, encompass diverse physical elements such as buildings, roads and vegetation with complex interconnection. Crafting realistic, interactive 3D urban environments plays a crucial role in constructing AI agents capable of perceiving, decision-making, and acting like humans in real-world environments. However, creating high-fidelity 3D urban environments usually entails extensive manual labor from designers, involving intricate detailing and accurate representation of complex urban features. Therefore, how to accomplish this in an automatical way remains a longstanding challenge. Toward this problem, we propose UrbanWorld, the first generative urban world model that can automatically create a customized, realistic and interactive 3D urban world with flexible control conditions. UrbanWorld incorporates four key stages in the automatical crafting pipeline: 3D layout generation from openly accessible OSM data, urban scene planning and designing with a powerful urban multimodal large language model (Urban MLLM), controllable urban asset rendering with advanced 3D diffusion techniques, and finally the MLLM-assisted scene refinement. The crafted high-fidelity 3D urban environments enable realistic feedback and interactions for general AI and machine perceptual systems in simulations. We are working on contributing UrbanWorld as an open-source and versatile platform for evaluating and improving AI abilities in perception, decision-making, and interaction in realistic urban environments.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Good weight initialization serves as an effective measure to reduce the training cost of a deep neural network (DNN) model. The choice of how to initialize parameters is challenging and may require manual tuning, which can be time-consuming and prone to human error. To overcome such limitations, this work takes a novel step towards building a weight generator to synthesize the neural weights for initialization. We use the image-to-image translation task with generative adversarial networks (GANs) as an example due to the ease of collecting model weights spanning a wide range. Specifically, we first collect a dataset with various image editing concepts and their corresponding trained weights, which are later used for the training of the weight generator. To address the different characteristics among layers and the substantial number of weights to be predicted, we divide the weights into equal-sized blocks and assign each block an index. Subsequently, a diffusion model is trained with such a dataset using both text conditions of the concept and the block indexes. By initializing the image translation model with the denoised weights predicted by our diffusion model, the training requires only 43.3 seconds. Compared to training from scratch (i.e., Pix2pix), we achieve a 15x training time acceleration for a new concept while obtaining even better image generation quality.</li>
