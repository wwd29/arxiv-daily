          Self-Consuming Generative Models with Curated Data Provably Optimize Human Preferences(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid progress in generative models has resulted in impressive leaps in generation quality, blurring the lines between synthetic and real data. Web-scale datasets are now prone to the inevitable contamination by synthetic data, directly impacting the training of future generated models. Already, some theoretical results on self-consuming generative models (a.k.a., iterative retraining) have emerged in the literature, showcasing that either model collapse or stability could be possible depending on the fraction of generated data used at each retraining step. However, in practice, synthetic data is often subject to human feedback and curated by users before being used and uploaded online. For instance, many interfaces of popular text-to-image generative models, such as Stable Diffusion or Midjourney, produce several variations of an image for a given query which can eventually be curated by the users. In this paper, we theoretically study the impact of data curation on iterated retraining of generative models and show that it can be seen as an \emph{implicit preference optimization mechanism}. However, unlike standard preference optimization, the generative model does not have access to the reward function or negative samples needed for pairwise comparisons. Moreover, our study doesn't require access to the density function, only to samples. We prove that, if the data is curated according to a reward model, then the expected reward of the iterative retraining procedure is maximized. We further provide theoretical results on the stability of the retraining loop when using a positive fraction of real data at each step. Finally, we conduct illustrative experiments on both synthetic datasets and on CIFAR10 showing that such a procedure amplifies biases of the reward model.</li>

          How Stable is Stable Diffusion under Recursive InPainting (RIP)?(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative Artificial Intelligence image models have achieved outstanding performance in text-to-image generation and other tasks, such as inpainting that completes images with missing fragments. The performance of inpainting can be accurately measured by taking an image, removing some fragments, performing the inpainting to restore them, and comparing the results with the original image. Interestingly, inpainting can also be applied recursively, starting from an image, removing some parts, applying inpainting to reconstruct the image, and then starting the inpainting process again on the reconstructed image, and so forth. This process of recursively applying inpainting can lead to an image that is similar or completely different from the original one, depending on the fragments that are removed and the ability of the model to reconstruct them. Intuitively, stability, understood as the capability to recover an image that is similar to the original one even after many recursive inpainting operations, is a desirable feature and can be used as an additional performance metric for inpainting. The concept of stability is also being studied in the context of recursive training of generative AI models with their own data. Recursive inpainting is an inference-only recursive process whose understanding may complement ongoing efforts to study the behavior of generative AI models under training recursion. In this paper, the impact of recursive inpainting is studied for one of the most widely used image models: Stable Diffusion. The results show that recursive inpainting can lead to image collapse, so ending with a nonmeaningful image, and that the outcome depends on several factors such as the type of image, the size of the inpainting masks, and the number of iterations.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This study addresses gender bias in image generation models using Reinforcement Learning from Artificial Intelligence Feedback (RLAIF) with a novel Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization (DDPO) pipeline. By employing a pretrained stable diffusion model and a highly accurate gender classification Transformer, the research introduces two reward functions: Rshift for shifting gender imbalances, and Rbalance for achieving and maintaining gender balance. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in mitigating bias without compromising image quality or requiring additional data or prompt modifications. While focusing on gender bias, this work establishes a foundation for addressing various forms of bias in AI systems, emphasizing the need for responsible AI development. Future research directions include extending the methodology to other bias types, enhancing the RLAIF pipeline's robustness, and exploring multi-prompt fine-tuning to further advance fairness and inclusivity in AI.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Conventional anomaly detection techniques based on reconstruction via denoising diffusion model are widely used due to their ability to identify anomaly locations and shapes with high performance. However, there is a limitation in determining appropriate noise parameters that can degrade anomalies while preserving normal characteristics. Also, due to the volatility of the diffusion model, normal regions can fluctuate considerably during reconstruction, resulting in false detection. In this paper, we propose a method to detect anomalies by analysis of reconstruction trend depending on the degree of degradation, effectively solving the both problems of existing methods. The proposed method is validated on an open dataset for industrial anomaly detection, improving the performance of existing methods on a number of evaluation criteria. With the ease of combination with existing anomaly detection methods, it provides a tradeoff between computational cost and performance, allowing it high application potential in manufacturing industry.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>3D object part segmentation is essential in computer vision applications. While substantial progress has been made in 2D object part segmentation, the 3D counterpart has received less attention, in part due to the scarcity of annotated 3D datasets, which are expensive to collect. In this work, we propose to leverage a few annotated 3D shapes or richly annotated 2D datasets to perform 3D object part segmentation. We present our novel approach, termed 3-By-2 that achieves SOTA performance on different benchmarks with various granularity levels. By using features from pretrained foundation models and exploiting semantic and geometric correspondences, we are able to overcome the challenges of limited 3D annotations. Our approach leverages available 2D labels, enabling effective 3D object part segmentation. Our method 3-By-2 can accommodate various part taxonomies and granularities, demonstrating interesting part label transfer ability across different object categories.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated learning, while being a promising approach for collaborative model training, is susceptible to poisoning attacks due to its decentralized nature. Backdoor attacks, in particular, have shown remarkable stealthiness, as they selectively compromise predictions for inputs containing triggers. Previous endeavors to detect and mitigate such attacks are based on the Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) data assumption where benign model updates exhibit high-level similarity in multiple feature spaces due to IID data. Thus, outliers are detected as backdoor attacks. Nevertheless, non-IID data presents substantial challenges in backdoor attack detection, as the data variety introduces variance among benign models, making outlier detection-based mechanisms less effective. We propose a novel distribution-aware anomaly detection mechanism, BoBa, to address this problem. In order to differentiate outliers arising from data variety versus backdoor attack, we propose to break down the problem into two steps: clustering clients utilizing their data distribution followed by a voting-based detection. Based on the intuition that clustering and subsequent backdoor detection can drastically benefit from knowing client data distributions, we propose a novel data distribution inference mechanism. To improve detection robustness, we introduce an overlapping clustering method, where each client is associated with multiple clusters, ensuring that the trustworthiness of a model update is assessed collectively by multiple clusters rather than a single cluster. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that BoBa can reduce the attack success rate to lower than 0.001 while maintaining high main task accuracy across various attack strategies and experimental settings.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce the task of mixed-view panorama synthesis, where the goal is to synthesize a novel panorama given a small set of input panoramas and a satellite image of the area. This contrasts with previous work which only uses input panoramas (same-view synthesis), or an input satellite image (cross-view synthesis). We argue that the mixed-view setting is the most natural to support panorama synthesis for arbitrary locations worldwide. A critical challenge is that the spatial coverage of panoramas is uneven, with few panoramas available in many regions of the world. We introduce an approach that utilizes diffusion-based modeling and an attention-based architecture for extracting information from all available input imagery. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. In particular, our model can handle scenarios when the available panoramas are sparse or far from the location of the panorama we are attempting to synthesize.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We delve into the physics-informed neural reconstruction of smoke and obstacles through sparse-view RGB videos, tackling challenges arising from limited observation of complex dynamics. Existing physics-informed neural networks often emphasize short-term physics constraints, leaving the proper preservation of long-term conservation less explored. We introduce Neural Characteristic Trajectory Fields, a novel representation utilizing Eulerian neural fields to implicitly model Lagrangian fluid trajectories. This topology-free, auto-differentiable representation facilitates efficient flow map calculations between arbitrary frames as well as efficient velocity extraction via auto-differentiation. Consequently, it enables end-to-end supervision covering long-term conservation and short-term physics priors. Building on the representation, we propose physics-informed trajectory learning and integration into NeRF-based scene reconstruction. We enable advanced obstacle handling through self-supervised scene decomposition and seamless integrated boundary constraints. Our results showcase the ability to overcome challenges like occlusion uncertainty, density-color ambiguity, and static-dynamic entanglements. Code and sample tests are at \url{this https URL}.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Accurately recovering images from phaseless measurements is a challenging and long-standing problem. In this work, we present "deepECpr," which combines expectation-consistent (EC) approximation with deep denoising networks to surpass state-of-the-art phase-retrieval methods in both speed and accuracy. In addition to applying EC in a non-traditional manner, deepECpr includes a novel stochastic damping scheme that is inspired by recent diffusion methods. Like existing phase-retrieval methods based on plug-and-play priors, regularization by denoising, or diffusion, deepECpr iterates a denoising stage with a measurement-exploitation stage. But unlike existing methods, deepECpr requires far fewer denoiser calls. We compare deepECpr to the state-of-the-art prDeep (Metzler et al., 2018), Deep-ITA (Wang et al., 2020), and Diffusion Posterior Sampling (Chung et al., 2023) methods for noisy phase-retrieval of color, natural, and unnatural grayscale images on oversampled-Fourier and coded-diffraction-pattern measurements and find improvements in both PSNR and SSIM with 5x fewer denoiser calls.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The field of Neural-Symbolic (NeSy) systems is growing rapidly. Proposed approaches show great promise in achieving symbiotic unions of neural and symbolic methods. However, each NeSy system differs in fundamental ways. There is a pressing need for a unifying theory to illuminate the commonalities and differences in approaches and enable further progress. In this paper, we introduce Neural-Symbolic Energy-Based Models (NeSy-EBMs), a unifying mathematical framework for discriminative and generative modeling with probabilistic and non-probabilistic NeSy approaches. We utilize NeSy-EBMs to develop a taxonomy of modeling paradigms focusing on a system's neural-symbolic interface and reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we introduce a suite of learning techniques for NeSy-EBMs. Importantly, NeSy-EBMs allow the derivation of general expressions for gradients of prominent learning losses, and we provide four learning approaches that leverage methods from multiple domains, including bilevel and stochastic policy optimization. Finally, we present Neural Probabilistic Soft Logic (NeuPSL), an open-source NeSy-EBM library designed for scalability and expressivity, facilitating real-world application of NeSy systems. Through extensive empirical analysis across multiple datasets, we demonstrate the practical advantages of NeSy-EBMs in various tasks, including image classification, graph node labeling, autonomous vehicle situation awareness, and question answering.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised, foundation model, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Foundation models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs) or Large Vision Models (LVMs), have emerged as one of the most powerful tools in the respective fields. However, unlike text and image data, graph data do not have a definitive structure, posing great challenges to developing a Graph Foundation Model (GFM). For example, current attempts at designing general graph models either transform graph data into a language format for LLM-based prediction or still train a GNN model with LLM as an assistant. The former can handle unlimited tasks, while the latter captures graph structure much better -- yet, no existing work can achieve both simultaneously. In this paper, we identify three key desirable properties of a GFM: self-supervised pretraining, fluidity in tasks, and graph awareness. To account for these properties, we extend the conventional language modeling to the graph domain and propose a novel generative graph language model GOFA to solve the problem. The model interleaves randomly initialized GNN layers into a frozen pre-trained LLM so that the semantic and structural modeling abilities are organically combined. GOFA is pre-trained on newly proposed graph-level next-word prediction, question-answering, and structural tasks to obtain the above GFM properties. The pre-trained model is further fine-tuned on downstream tasks to obtain task-solving ability. The fine-tuned model is evaluated on various downstream tasks, demonstrating a strong ability to solve structural and contextual problems in zero-shot scenarios.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models have made remarkable progress in solving various inverse problems, attributing to the generative modeling capability of the data manifold. Posterior sampling from the conditional score function enable the precious data consistency certified by the measurement-based likelihood term. However, most prevailing approaches confined to the deterministic deterioration process of the measurement model, regardless of capricious unpredictable disturbance in real-world sceneries. To address this obstacle, we show that the measurement-based likelihood can be renovated with restoration-based likelihood via the opposite probabilistic graphic direction, licencing the patronage of various off-the-shelf restoration models and extending the strictly deterministic deterioration process to adaptable clustered processes with the supposed prototype, in what we call restorer guidance. Particularly, assembled with versatile prototypes optionally, we can resolve inverse problems with bunch of choices for assorted sample quality and realize the proficient deterioration control with assured realistic. We show that our work can be formally analogous to the transition from classifier guidance to classifier-free guidance in the field of inverse problem solver. Experiments on multifarious inverse problems demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, including image dehazing, rain streak removal, and motion deblurring.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In real-world scenarios, scanned point clouds are often incomplete due to occlusion issues. The task of self-supervised point cloud completion involves reconstructing missing regions of these incomplete objects without the supervision of complete ground truth. Current self-supervised methods either rely on multiple views of partial observations for supervision or overlook the intrinsic geometric similarity that can be identified and utilized from the given partial point clouds. In this paper, we propose MAL-SPC, a framework that effectively leverages both object-level and category-specific geometric similarities to complete missing structures. Our MAL-SPC does not require any 3D complete supervision and only necessitates a single partial point cloud for each object. Specifically, we first introduce a Pattern Retrieval Network to retrieve similar position and curvature patterns between the partial input and the predicted shape, then leverage these similarities to densify and refine the reconstructed results. Additionally, we render the reconstructed complete shape into multi-view depth maps and design an adversarial learning module to learn the geometry of the target shape from category-specific single-view depth images. To achieve anisotropic rendering, we design a density-aware radius estimation algorithm to improve the quality of the rendered images. Our MAL-SPC yields the best results compared to current state-of-the-art methods.We will make the source code publicly available at \url{this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generating synthetic samples from the convex space of the minority class is a popular oversampling approach for imbalanced classification problems. Recently, deep-learning approaches have been successfully applied to modeling the convex space of minority samples. Beyond oversampling, learning the convex space of neighborhoods in training data has not been used to generate entire tabular datasets. In this paper, we introduce a deep learning architecture (NextConvGeN) with a generator and discriminator component that can generate synthetic samples by learning to model the convex space of tabular data. The generator takes data neighborhoods as input and creates synthetic samples within the convex space of that neighborhood. Thereafter, the discriminator tries to classify these synthetic samples against a randomly sampled batch of data from the rest of the data space. We compared our proposed model with five state-of-the-art tabular generative models across ten publicly available datasets from the biomedical domain. Our analysis reveals that synthetic samples generated by NextConvGeN can better preserve classification and clustering performance across real and synthetic data than other synthetic data generation models. Synthetic data generation by deep learning of the convex space produces high scores for popular utility measures. We further compared how diverse synthetic data generation strategies perform in the privacy-utility spectrum and produced critical arguments on the necessity of high utility models. Our research on deep learning of the convex space of tabular data opens up opportunities in clinical research, machine learning model development, decision support systems, and clinical data sharing.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models dominate the field of image generation, however they have yet to make major breakthroughs in the field of image compression. Indeed, while pre-trained diffusion models have been successfully adapted to a wide variety of downstream tasks, existing work in diffusion-based image compression require task specific model training, which can be both cumbersome and limiting. This work addresses this gap by harnessing the image prior learned by existing pre-trained diffusion models for solving the task of lossy image compression. This enables the use of the wide variety of publicly-available models, and avoids the need for training or fine-tuning. Our method, PSC (Posterior Sampling-based Compression), utilizes zero-shot diffusion-based posterior samplers. It does so through a novel sequential process inspired by the active acquisition technique "Adasense" to accumulate informative measurements of the image. This strategy minimizes uncertainty in the reconstructed image and allows for construction of an image-adaptive transform coordinated between both the encoder and decoder. PSC offers a progressive compression scheme that is both practical and simple to implement. Despite minimal tuning, and a simple quantization and entropy coding, PSC achieves competitive results compared to established methods, paving the way for further exploration of pre-trained diffusion models and posterior samplers for image compression.</li>

Its zero-shot learning capabilities accelerate AI deployment and enhance the generalizability of clinical applications. However, segmenting pathological images presents a special focus on the flexibility of segmentation targets. For instance, a single click on a Whole Slide Image (WSI) could signify a cell, a functional unit, or layers, adding layers of complexity to the segmentation tasks. Current models primarily predict potential outcomes but lack the flexibility needed for physician input. In this paper, we explore the potential of enhancing segmentation model flexibility by introducing various task prompts through a Large Language Model (LLM) alongside traditional task tokens. Our contribution is in four-fold: (1) we construct a computational-efficient pipeline that uses finetuned language prompts to guide flexible multi-class segmentation; (2) We compare segmentation performance with fixed prompts against free-text; (3) We design a multi-task kidney pathology segmentation dataset and the corresponding various free-text prompts; and (4) We evaluate our approach on the kidney pathology dataset, assessing its capacity to new cases during inference.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent research has shown that Transformers with linear attention are capable of in-context learning (ICL) by implementing a linear estimator through gradient descent steps. However, the existing results on the optimization landscape apply under stylized settings where task and feature vectors are assumed to be IID and the attention weights are fully parameterized. In this work, we develop a stronger characterization of the optimization and generalization landscape of ICL through contributions on architectures, low-rank parameterization, and correlated designs: (1) We study the landscape of 1-layer linear attention and 1-layer H3, a state-space model. Under a suitable correlated design assumption, we prove that both implement 1-step preconditioned gradient descent. We show that thanks to its native convolution filters, H3 also has the advantage of implementing sample weighting and outperforming linear attention in suitable settings. (2) By studying correlated designs, we provide new risk bounds for retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and task-feature alignment which reveal how ICL sample complexity benefits from distributional alignment. (3) We derive the optimal risk for low-rank parameterized attention weights in terms of covariance spectrum. Through this, we also shed light on how LoRA can adapt to a new distribution by capturing the shift between task covariances. Experimental results corroborate our theoretical findings. Overall, this work explores the optimization and risk landscape of ICL in practically meaningful settings and contributes to a more thorough understanding of its mechanics.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models have shown promise in clinical entity and relation extraction tasks because of their precise extraction and contextual understanding capability. In this work, we further leverage the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) knowledge base to accurately identify medical concepts and improve clinical entity and relation extraction at the document level. Our framework selects UMLS concepts relevant to the text and combines them with prompts to guide language models in extracting entities. Our experiments demonstrate that this initial concept mapping and the inclusion of these mapped concepts in the prompts improves extraction results compared to few-shot extraction tasks on generic language models that do not leverage UMLS. Further, our results show that this approach is more effective than the standard Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) technique, where retrieved data is compared with prompt embeddings to generate results. Overall, we find that integrating UMLS concepts with GPT models significantly improves entity and relation identification, outperforming the baseline and RAG models. By combining the precise concept mapping capability of knowledge-based approaches like UMLS with the contextual understanding capability of GPT, our method highlights the potential of these approaches in specialized domains like healthcare.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent studies that incorporate geometric features and transformers into 3D point cloud feature learning have significantly improved the performance of 3D deep-learning models. However, their robustness against adversarial attacks has not been thoroughly explored. Existing attack methods primarily focus on white-box scenarios and struggle to transfer to recently proposed 3D deep-learning models. Even worse, these attacks introduce perturbations to 3D coordinates, generating unrealistic adversarial examples and resulting in poor performance against 3D adversarial defenses. In this paper, we generate high-quality adversarial point clouds using diffusion models. By using partial points as prior knowledge, we generate realistic adversarial examples through shape completion with adversarial guidance. The proposed adversarial shape completion allows for a more reliable generation of adversarial point clouds. To enhance attack transferability, we delve into the characteristics of 3D point clouds and employ model uncertainty for better inference of model classification through random down-sampling of point clouds. We adopt ensemble adversarial guidance for improved transferability across different network architectures. To maintain the generation quality, we limit our adversarial guidance solely to the critical points of the point clouds by calculating saliency scores. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed attacks outperform state-of-the-art adversarial attack methods against both black-box models and defenses. Our black-box attack establishes a new baseline for evaluating the robustness of various 3D point cloud classification models.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce 3DEgo to address a novel problem of directly synthesizing photorealistic 3D scenes from monocular videos guided by textual prompts. Conventional methods construct a text-conditioned 3D scene through a three-stage process, involving pose estimation using Structure-from-Motion (SfM) libraries like COLMAP, initializing the 3D model with unedited images, and iteratively updating the dataset with edited images to achieve a 3D scene with text fidelity. Our framework streamlines the conventional multi-stage 3D editing process into a single-stage workflow by overcoming the reliance on COLMAP and eliminating the cost of model initialization. We apply a diffusion model to edit video frames prior to 3D scene creation by incorporating our designed noise blender module for enhancing multi-view editing consistency, a step that does not require additional training or fine-tuning of T2I diffusion models. 3DEgo utilizes 3D Gaussian Splatting to create 3D scenes from the multi-view consistent edited frames, capitalizing on the inherent temporal continuity and explicit point cloud data. 3DEgo demonstrates remarkable editing precision, speed, and adaptability across a variety of video sources, as validated by extensive evaluations on six datasets, including our own prepared GS25 dataset.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Published research highlights the presence of demographic bias in automated facial attribute classification. The proposed bias mitigation techniques are mostly based on supervised learning, which requires a large amount of labeled training data for generalizability and scalability. However, labeled data is limited, requires laborious annotation, poses privacy risks, and can perpetuate human bias. In contrast, self-supervised learning (SSL) capitalizes on freely available unlabeled data, rendering trained models more scalable and generalizable. However, these label-free SSL models may also introduce biases by sampling false negative pairs, especially at low-data regimes 200K images) under low compute settings. Further, SSL-based models may suffer from performance degradation due to a lack of quality assurance of the unlabeled data sourced from the web. This paper proposes a fully self-supervised pipeline for demographically fair facial attribute classifiers. Leveraging completely unlabeled data pseudolabeled via pre-trained encoders, diverse data curation techniques, and meta-learning-based weighted contrastive learning, our method significantly outperforms existing SSL approaches proposed for downstream image classification tasks. Extensive evaluations on the FairFace and CelebA datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our pipeline in obtaining fair performance over existing baselines. Thus, setting a new benchmark for SSL in the fairness of facial attribute classification.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Segmenting and recognizing diverse object parts is crucial in computer vision and robotics. Despite significant progress in object segmentation, part-level segmentation remains underexplored due to complex boundaries and scarce annotated data. To address this, we propose a novel Weakly-supervised Part Segmentation (WPS) setting and an approach called WPS-SAM, built on the large-scale pre-trained vision foundation model, Segment Anything Model (SAM). WPS-SAM is an end-to-end framework designed to extract prompt tokens directly from images and perform pixel-level segmentation of part regions. During its training phase, it only uses weakly supervised labels in the form of bounding boxes or points. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, through exploiting the rich knowledge embedded in pre-trained foundation models, WPS-SAM outperforms other segmentation models trained with pixel-level strong annotations. Specifically, WPS-SAM achieves 68.93% mIOU and 79.53% mACC on the PartImageNet dataset, surpassing state-of-the-art fully supervised methods by approximately 4% in terms of mIOU.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Score-based methods have demonstrated their effectiveness in discovering causal relationships by scoring different causal structures based on their goodness of fit to the data. Recently, Huang et al. proposed a generalized score function that can handle general data distributions and causal relationships by modeling the relations in reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). The selection of an appropriate kernel within this score function is crucial for accurately characterizing causal relationships and ensuring precise causal discovery. However, the current method involves manual heuristic selection of kernel parameters, making the process tedious and less likely to ensure optimality. In this paper, we propose a kernel selection method within the generalized score function that automatically selects the optimal kernel that best fits the data. Specifically, we model the generative process of the variables involved in each step of the causal graph search procedure as a mixture of independent noise variables. Based on this model, we derive an automatic kernel selection method by maximizing the marginal likelihood of the variables involved in each search step. We conduct experiments on both synthetic data and real-world benchmarks, and the results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms heuristic kernel selection methods.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The emergence of large language models (LLMs) is a milestone in generative artificial intelligence, achieving significant success in text comprehension and generation tasks. Despite the tremendous success of LLMs in many downstream tasks, they suffer from severe hallucination problems, posing significant challenges to the practical applications of LLMs. Most of the works about LLMs' hallucinations focus on data quality. Self-attention is a core module in transformer-based LLMs, while its potential relationship with LLMs' hallucination has been hardly investigated. To fill this gap, we study this problem from a causal perspective. We propose a method to intervene in LLMs' self-attention layers and maintain their structures and sizes intact. Specifically, we disable different self-attention layers in several popular open-source LLMs and then compare their degrees of hallucination with the original ones. We evaluate the intervened LLMs on hallucination assessment benchmarks and conclude that disabling some specific self-attention layers in the front or tail of the LLMs can alleviate hallucination issues. The study paves a new way for understanding and mitigating LLMs' hallucinations.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Transferable targeted adversarial attacks aim to mislead models into outputting adversary-specified predictions in black-box scenarios. Recent studies have introduced \textit{single-target} generative attacks that train a generator for each target class to generate highly transferable perturbations, resulting in substantial computational overhead when handling multiple classes. \textit{Multi-target} attacks address this by training only one class-conditional generator for multiple classes. However, the generator simply uses class labels as conditions, failing to leverage the rich semantic information of the target class. To this end, we design a \textbf{C}LIP-guided \textbf{G}enerative \textbf{N}etwork with \textbf{C}ross-attention modules (CGNC) to enhance multi-target attacks by incorporating textual knowledge of CLIP into the generator. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CGNC yields significant improvements over previous multi-target generative attacks, e.g., a 21.46\% improvement in success rate from ResNet-152 to DenseNet-121. Moreover, we propose a masked fine-tuning mechanism to further strengthen our method in attacking a single class, which surpasses existing single-target methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Current 3D self-supervised learning methods of 3D scenes face a data desert issue, resulting from the time-consuming and expensive collecting process of 3D scene data. Conversely, 3D shape datasets are easier to collect. Despite this, existing pre-training strategies on shape data offer limited potential for 3D scene understanding due to significant disparities in point quantities. To tackle these challenges, we propose Shape2Scene (S2S), a novel method that learns representations of large-scale 3D scenes from 3D shape data. We first design multiscale and high-resolution backbones for shape and scene level 3D tasks, i.e., MH-P (point-based) and MH-V (voxel-based). MH-P/V establishes direct paths to highresolution features that capture deep semantic information across multiple scales. This pivotal nature makes them suitable for a wide range of 3D downstream tasks that tightly rely on high-resolution features. We then employ a Shape-to-Scene strategy (S2SS) to amalgamate points from various shapes, creating a random pseudo scene (comprising multiple objects) for training data, mitigating disparities between shapes and scenes. Finally, a point-point contrastive loss (PPC) is applied for the pre-training of MH-P/V. In PPC, the inherent correspondence (i.e., point pairs) is naturally obtained in S2SS. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the transferability of 3D representations learned by MH-P/V across shape-level and scene-level 3D tasks. MH-P achieves notable performance on well-known point cloud datasets (93.8% OA on ScanObjectNN and 87.6% instance mIoU on ShapeNetPart). MH-V also achieves promising performance in 3D semantic segmentation and 3D object detection.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce a novel approach for 3D whole-body pose estimation, addressing the challenge of scale- and deformability- variance across body parts brought by the challenge of extending the 17 major joints on the human body to fine-grained keypoints on the face and hands. In addition to addressing the challenge of exploiting motion in unevenly sampled data, we combine stable diffusion to a hierarchical part representation which predicts the relative locations of fine-grained keypoints within each part (e.g., face) with respect to the part's local reference frame. On the H3WB dataset, our method greatly outperforms the current state of the art, which fails to exploit the temporal information. We also show considerable improvements compared to other spatiotemporal 3D human-pose estimation approaches that fail to account for the body part specificities.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As a fundamental and extensively studied task in computer vision, image segmentation aims to locate and identify different semantic concepts at the pixel level. Recently, inspired by In-Context Learning (ICL), several generalist segmentation frameworks have been proposed, providing a promising paradigm for segmenting specific objects. However, existing works mostly ignore the value of visual prompts or simply apply similarity sorting to select contextual examples. In this paper, we focus on rethinking and improving the example selection strategy. By comprehensive comparisons, we first demonstrate that ICL-based segmentation models are sensitive to different contexts. Furthermore, empirical evidence indicates that the diversity of contextual prompts plays a crucial role in guiding segmentation. Based on the above insights, we propose a new stepwise context search method. Different from previous works, we construct a small yet rich candidate pool and adaptively search the well-matched contexts. More importantly, this method effectively reduces the annotation cost by compacting the search space. Extensive experiments show that our method is an effective strategy for selecting examples and enhancing segmentation performance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The fabrication of visual misinformation on the web and social media has increased exponentially with the advent of foundational text-to-image diffusion models. Namely, Stable Diffusion inpainters allow the synthesis of maliciously inpainted images of personal and private figures, and copyrighted contents, also known as deepfakes. To combat such generations, a disruption framework, namely Photoguard, has been proposed, where it adds adversarial noise to the context image to disrupt their inpainting synthesis. While their framework suggested a diffusion-friendly approach, the disruption is not sufficiently strong and it requires a significant amount of GPU and time to immunize the context image. In our work, we re-examine both the minimal and favorable conditions for a successful inpainting disruption, proposing DDD, a "Digression guided Diffusion Disruption" framework. First, we identify the most adversarially vulnerable diffusion timestep range with respect to the hidden space. Within this scope of noised manifold, we pose the problem as a semantic digression optimization. We maximize the distance between the inpainting instance's hidden states and a semantic-aware hidden state centroid, calibrated both by Monte Carlo sampling of hidden states and a discretely projected optimization in the token space. Effectively, our approach achieves stronger disruption and a higher success rate than Photoguard while lowering the GPU memory requirement, and speeding the optimization up to three times faster.</li>

To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel formulation that considers both visual quality and consistency of content. Consistency of content is ensured by a proposed loss function that maintains the structure of the input, while visual quality is improved by utilizing the denoising process of pretrained diffusion models. To address the formulated optimization problem, we have developed a plug-and-play noise optimization strategy, referred to as Noise Calibration. By refining the initial random noise through a few iterations, the content of original video can be largely preserved, and the enhancement effect demonstrates a notable improvement. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) is crucial for applications such as security surveillance and autonomous driving. However, existing VAD methods provide little rationale behind detection, hindering public trust in real-world deployments. In this paper, we approach VAD with a reasoning framework. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown revolutionary reasoning ability, we find that their direct use falls short of VAD. Specifically, the implicit knowledge pre-trained in LLMs focuses on general context and thus may not apply to every specific real-world VAD scenario, leading to inflexibility and inaccuracy. To address this, we propose AnomalyRuler, a novel rule-based reasoning framework for VAD with LLMs. AnomalyRuler comprises two main stages: induction and deduction. In the induction stage, the LLM is fed with few-shot normal reference samples and then summarizes these normal patterns to induce a set of rules for detecting anomalies. The deduction stage follows the induced rules to spot anomalous frames in test videos. Additionally, we design rule aggregation, perception smoothing, and robust reasoning strategies to further enhance AnomalyRuler's robustness. AnomalyRuler is the first reasoning approach for the one-class VAD task, which requires only few-normal-shot prompting without the need for full-shot training, thereby enabling fast adaption to various VAD scenarios. Comprehensive experiments across four VAD benchmarks demonstrate AnomalyRuler's state-of-the-art detection performance and reasoning ability.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce Tree D-fusion, featuring the first collection of 600,000 environmentally aware, 3D simulation-ready tree models generated through Diffusion priors. Each reconstructed 3D tree model corresponds to an image from Google's Auto Arborist Dataset, comprising street view images and associated genus labels of trees across North America. Our method distills the scores of two tree-adapted diffusion models by utilizing text prompts to specify a tree genus, thus facilitating shape reconstruction.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Precision in identifying nanometer-scale device-killer defects is crucial in both semiconductor research and development as well as in production processes. The effectiveness of existing ML-based approaches in this context is largely limited by the scarcity of data, as the production of real semiconductor wafer data for training these models involves high financial and time costs. Moreover, the existing simulation methods fall short of replicating images with identical noise characteristics, surface roughness and stochastic variations at advanced nodes. We propose a method for generating synthetic semiconductor SEM images using a diffusion model within a limited data regime. In contrast to images generated through conventional simulation methods, SEM images generated through our proposed DL method closely resemble real SEM images, replicating their noise characteristics and surface roughness adaptively. Our main contributions, which are validated on three different real semiconductor datasets, are: i) proposing a patch-based generative framework utilizing DDPM to create SEM images with intended defect classes, addressing challenges related to class-imbalance and data insufficiency, ii) demonstrating generated synthetic images closely resemble real SEM images acquired from the tool, preserving all imaging conditions and metrology characteristics without any metadata supervision, iii) demonstrating a defect detector trained on generated defect dataset, either independently or combined with a limited real dataset, can achieve similar or improved performance on real wafer SEM images during validation/testing compared to exclusive training on a real defect dataset, iv) demonstrating the ability of the proposed approach to transfer defect types, critical dimensions, and imaging conditions from one specified CD/Pitch and metrology specifications to another, thereby highlighting its versatility.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vision foundation models are renowned for their generalization ability due to massive training data. Nevertheless, they demand tremendous training resources, and the training data is often inaccessible, e.g., CLIP, DINOv2, posing great challenges to developing derivatives that could advance research in this field. In this work, we offer a very simple and general solution, named Proteus, to distill foundation models into smaller equivalents on ImageNet-1K without access to the original training data. Specifically, we remove the designs from conventional knowledge distillation settings that result in dataset bias and present three levels of training objectives, i.e., token, patch, and feature, to maximize the efficacy of knowledge transfer. In this manner, Proteus is trained at ImageNet-level costs with surprising ability, facilitating the accessibility of training foundation models for the broader research community. Leveraging DINOv2-g/14 as the teacher, Proteus-L/14 matches the performance of the Oracle method DINOv2-L/14 (142M training data) across 15 benchmarks and outperforms other vision foundation models including CLIP-L/14 (400M), OpenCLIP-L/14 (400M/2B) and SynCLR-L/14 (600M).</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Full surround monodepth (FSM) methods can learn from multiple camera views simultaneously in a self-supervised manner to predict the scale-aware depth, which is more practical for real-world applications in contrast to scale-ambiguous depth from a standalone monocular camera. In this work, we focus on enhancing the scale-awareness of FSM methods for depth estimation. To this end, we propose to improve FSM from two perspectives: depth network structure optimization and training pipeline optimization. First, we construct a transformer-based depth network with neighbor-enhanced cross-view attention (NCA). The cross-attention modules can better aggregate the cross-view context in both global and neighboring views. Second, we formulate a transformer-based feature matching scheme with progressive training to improve the structure-from-motion (SfM) pipeline. That allows us to learn scale-awareness with sufficient matches and further facilitate network convergence by removing mismatches based on SfM loss. Experiments demonstrate that the resulting Scale-aware full surround monodepth (SA-FSM) method largely improves the scale-aware depth predictions without median-scaling at the test time, and performs favorably against the state-of-the-art FSM methods, e.g., surpassing SurroundDepth by 3.8% in terms of accuracy at delta<1.25 on the DDAD benchmark.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Monitoring and managing the growth and quality of fruits are very important tasks. To effectively train deep learning models like YOLO for real-time fruit detection, high-quality image datasets are essential. However, such datasets are often lacking in agriculture. Generative AI models can help create high-quality images. In this study, we used MidJourney and Firefly tools to generate images of melon greenhouses and post-harvest fruits through text-to-image, pre-harvest image-to-image, and post-harvest image-to-image methods. We evaluated these AIgenerated images using PSNR and SSIM metrics and tested the detection performance of the YOLOv9 model. We also assessed the net quality of real and generated fruits. Our results showed that generative AI could produce images very similar to real ones, especially for post-harvest fruits. The YOLOv9 model detected the generated images well, and the net quality was also measurable. This shows that generative AI can create realistic images useful for fruit detection and quality assessment, indicating its great potential in agriculture. This study highlights the potential of AI-generated images for data augmentation in melon fruit detection and quality assessment and envisions a positive future for generative AI applications in agriculture.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Frequency domain representation of time series feature offers a concise representation for handling real-world time series data with inherent complexity and dynamic nature. However, current frequency-based methods with complex operations still fall short of state-of-the-art time domain methods for general time series analysis. In this work, we present Omni-Dimensional Frequency Learner (ODFL) model based on a in depth analysis among all the three aspects of the spectrum feature: channel redundancy property among the frequency dimension, the sparse and un-salient frequency energy distribution among the frequency dimension, and the semantic diversity among the variable dimension. Technically, our method is composed of a semantic-adaptive global filter with attention to the un-salient frequency bands and partial operation among the channel dimension. Empirical results show that ODFL achieves consistent state-of-the-art in five mainstream time series analysis tasks, including short- and long-term forecasting, imputation, classification, and anomaly detection, offering a promising foundation for time series analysis.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Traditional image steganography focuses on concealing one image within another, aiming to avoid steganalysis by unauthorized entities. Coverless image steganography (CIS) enhances imperceptibility by not using any cover image. Recent works have utilized text prompts as keys in CIS through diffusion models. However, this approach faces three challenges: invalidated when private prompt is guessed, crafting public prompts for semantic diversity, and the risk of prompt leakage during frequent transmission. To address these issues, we propose DiffStega, an innovative training-free diffusion-based CIS strategy for universal application. DiffStega uses a password-dependent reference image as an image prompt alongside the text, ensuring that only authorized parties can retrieve the hidden information. Furthermore, we develop Noise Flip technique to further secure the steganography against unauthorized decryption. To comprehensively assess our method across general CIS tasks, we create a dataset comprising various image steganography instances. Experiments indicate substantial improvements in our method over existing ones, particularly in aspects of versatility, password sensitivity, and recovery quality.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Amid the burgeoning development of generative models like diffusion models, the task of differentiating synthesized audio from its natural counterpart grows more daunting. Deepfake detection offers a viable solution to combat this challenge. Yet, this defensive measure unintentionally fuels the continued refinement of generative models. Watermarking emerges as a proactive and sustainable tactic, preemptively regulating the creation and dissemination of synthesized content. Thus, this paper, as a pioneer, proposes the generative robust audio watermarking method (Groot), presenting a paradigm for proactively supervising the synthesized audio and its source diffusion models. In this paradigm, the processes of watermark generation and audio synthesis occur simultaneously, facilitated by parameter-fixed diffusion models equipped with a dedicated encoder. The watermark embedded within the audio can subsequently be retrieved by a lightweight decoder. The experimental results highlight Groot's outstanding performance, particularly in terms of robustness, surpassing that of the leading state-of-the-art methods. Beyond its impressive resilience against individual post-processing attacks, Groot exhibits exceptional robustness when facing compound attacks, maintaining an average watermark extraction accuracy of around 95%.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper introduces a method for realistic kinetic typography that generates user-preferred animatable 'text content'. We draw on recent advances in guided video diffusion models to achieve visually-pleasing text appearances. To do this, we first construct a kinetic typography dataset, comprising about 600K videos. Our dataset is made from a variety of combinations in 584 templates designed by professional motion graphics designers and involves changing each letter's position, glyph, and size (i.e., flying, glitches, chromatic aberration, reflecting effects, etc.). Next, we propose a video diffusion model for kinetic typography. For this, there are three requirements: aesthetic appearances, motion effects, and readable letters. This paper identifies the requirements. For this, we present static and dynamic captions used as spatial and temporal guidance of a video diffusion model, respectively. The static caption describes the overall appearance of the video, such as colors, texture and glyph which represent a shape of each letter. The dynamic caption accounts for the movements of letters and backgrounds. We add one more guidance with zero convolution to determine which text content should be visible in the video. We apply the zero convolution to the text content, and impose it on the diffusion model. Lastly, our glyph loss, only minimizing a difference between the predicted word and its ground-truth, is proposed to make the prediction letters readable. Experiments show that our model generates kinetic typography videos with legible and artistic letter motions based on text prompts.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Achieving photorealistic 3D view synthesis and relighting of human portraits is pivotal for advancing AR/VR applications. Existing methodologies in portrait relighting demonstrate substantial limitations in terms of generalization and 3D consistency, coupled with inaccuracies in physically realistic lighting and identity preservation. Furthermore, personalization from a single view is difficult to achieve and often requires multiview images during the testing phase or involves slow optimization processes. This paper introduces Lite2Relight, a novel technique that can predict 3D consistent head poses of portraits while performing physically plausible light editing at interactive speed. Our method uniquely extends the generative capabilities and efficient volumetric representation of EG3D, leveraging a lightstage dataset to implicitly disentangle face reflectance and perform relighting under target HDRI environment maps. By utilizing a pre-trained geometry-aware encoder and a feature alignment module, we map input images into a relightable 3D space, enhancing them with a strong face geometry and reflectance prior. Through extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of efficacy, photorealism, and practical application. This includes producing 3D-consistent results of the full head, including hair, eyes, and expressions. Lite2Relight paves the way for large-scale adoption of photorealistic portrait editing in various domains, offering a robust, interactive solution to a previously constrained problem.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text-to-motion generation requires not only grounding local actions in language but also seamlessly blending these individual actions to synthesize diverse and realistic global motions. However, existing motion generation methods primarily focus on the direct synthesis of global motions while neglecting the importance of generating and controlling local actions. In this paper, we propose the local action-guided motion diffusion model, which facilitates global motion generation by utilizing local actions as fine-grained control signals. Specifically, we provide an automated method for reference local action sampling and leverage graph attention networks to assess the guiding weight of each local action in the overall motion synthesis. During the diffusion process for synthesizing global motion, we calculate the local-action gradient to provide conditional guidance. This local-to-global paradigm reduces the complexity associated with direct global motion generation and promotes motion diversity via sampling diverse actions as conditions. Extensive experiments on two human motion datasets, i.e., HumanML3D and KIT, demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Furthermore, our method provides flexibility in seamlessly combining various local actions and continuous guiding weight adjustment, accommodating diverse user preferences, which may hold potential significance for the community.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Face Forgery videos have elicited critical social public concerns and various detectors have been proposed. However, fully-supervised detectors may lead to easily overfitting to specific forgery methods or videos, and existing self-supervised detectors are strict on auxiliary tasks, such as requiring audio or multi-modalities, leading to limited generalization and robustness. In this paper, we examine whether we can address this issue by leveraging visual-only real face videos. To this end, we propose to learn the Natural Consistency representation (NACO) of real face videos in a self-supervised manner, which is inspired by the observation that fake videos struggle to maintain the natural spatiotemporal consistency even under unknown forgery methods and different perturbations. Our NACO first extracts spatial features of each frame by CNNs then integrates them into Transformer to learn the long-range spatiotemporal representation, leveraging the advantages of CNNs and Transformer on local spatial receptive field and long-term memory respectively. Furthermore, a Spatial Predictive Module~(SPM) and a Temporal Contrastive Module~(TCM) are introduced to enhance the natural consistency representation learning. The SPM aims to predict random masked spatial features from spatiotemporal representation, and the TCM regularizes the latent distance of spatiotemporal representation by shuffling the natural order to disturb the consistency, which could both force our NACO more sensitive to the natural spatiotemporal consistency. After the representation learning stage, a MLP head is fine-tuned to perform the usual forgery video classification task. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art competitors with impressive generalization and robustness.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative Artificial Intelligence has grown exponentially as a result of Large Language Models (LLMs). This has been possible because of the impressive performance of deep learning methods created within the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and its subfield Natural Language Generation (NLG), which is the focus of this paper. Within the growing LLM family are the popular GPT-4, Bard and more specifically, tools such as ChatGPT have become a benchmark for other LLMs when solving most of the tasks involved in NLG research. This scenario poses new questions about the next steps for NLG and how the field can adapt and evolve to deal with new challenges in the era of LLMs. To address this, the present paper conducts a review of a representative sample of surveys recently published in NLG. By doing so, we aim to provide the scientific community with a research roadmap to identify which NLG aspects are still not suitably addressed by LLMs, as well as suggest future lines of research that should be addressed going forward.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce ConTEXTure, a generative network designed to create a texture map/atlas for a given 3D mesh using images from multiple viewpoints. The process begins with generating a front-view image from a text prompt, such as 'Napoleon, front view', describing the 3D mesh. Additional images from different viewpoints are derived from this front-view image and camera poses relative to it. ConTEXTure builds upon the TEXTure network, which uses text prompts for six viewpoints (e.g., 'Napoleon, front view', 'Napoleon, left view', etc.). However, TEXTure often generates images for non-front viewpoints that do not accurately represent those this http URL address this issue, we employ Zero123++, which generates multiple view-consistent images for the six specified viewpoints simultaneously, conditioned on the initial front-view image and the depth maps of the mesh for the six viewpoints. By utilizing these view-consistent images, ConTEXTure learns the texture atlas from all viewpoint images concurrently, unlike previous methods that do so sequentially. This approach ensures that the rendered images from various viewpoints, including back, side, bottom, and top, are free from viewpoint irregularities.</li>

          A Survey of Defenses against AI-generated Visual Media: Detection, Disruption, and Authentication(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep generative models have demonstrated impressive performance in various computer vision applications, including image synthesis, video generation, and medical analysis. Despite their significant advancements, these models may be used for malicious purposes, such as misinformation, deception, and copyright violation. In this paper, we provide a systematic and timely review of research efforts on defenses against AI-generated visual media, covering detection, disruption, and authentication. We review existing methods and summarize the mainstream defense-related tasks within a unified passive and proactive framework. Moreover, we survey the derivative tasks concerning the trustworthiness of defenses, such as their robustness and fairness. For each task, we formulate its general pipeline and propose a taxonomy based on methodological strategies that are uniformly applicable to the primary subtasks. Additionally, we summarize the commonly used evaluation datasets, criteria, and metrics. Finally, by analyzing the reviewed studies, we provide insights into current research challenges and suggest possible directions for future research.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advancements in image synthesis are fueled by the advent of large-scale diffusion models. Yet, integrating realistic object visualizations seamlessly into new or existing backgrounds without extensive training remains a challenge. This paper introduces InsertDiffusion, a novel, training-free diffusion architecture that efficiently embeds objects into images while preserving their structural and identity characteristics. Our approach utilizes off-the-shelf generative models and eliminates the need for fine-tuning, making it ideal for rapid and adaptable visualizations in product design and marketing. We demonstrate superior performance over existing methods in terms of image realism and alignment with input conditions. By decomposing the generation task into independent steps, InsertDiffusion offers a scalable solution that extends the capabilities of diffusion models for practical applications, achieving high-quality visualizations that maintain the authenticity of the original objects.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Video virtual try-on aims to generate realistic sequences that maintain garment identity and adapt to a person's pose and body shape in source videos. Traditional image-based methods, relying on warping and blending, struggle with complex human movements and occlusions, limiting their effectiveness in video try-on applications. Moreover, video-based models require extensive, high-quality data and substantial computational resources. To tackle these issues, we reconceptualize video try-on as a process of generating videos conditioned on garment descriptions and human motion. Our solution, WildVidFit, employs image-based controlled diffusion models for a streamlined, one-stage approach. This model, conditioned on specific garments and individuals, is trained on still images rather than videos. It leverages diffusion guidance from pre-trained models including a video masked autoencoder for segment smoothness improvement and a self-supervised model for feature alignment of adjacent frame in the latent space. This integration markedly boosts the model's ability to maintain temporal coherence, enabling more effective video try-on within an image-based framework. Our experiments on the VITON-HD and DressCode datasets, along with tests on the VVT and TikTok datasets, demonstrate WildVidFit's capability to generate fluid and coherent videos.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The ability to properly benchmark model performance in the face of spurious correlations is important to both build better predictors and increase confidence that models are operating as intended. We demonstrate that characterizing (as opposed to simply quantifying) model mistakes across subgroups is pivotal to properly reflect model biases, which are ignored by standard metrics such as worst-group accuracy or accuracy gap. Inspired by the hypothesis testing framework, we introduce SkewSize, a principled and flexible metric that captures bias from mistakes in a model's predictions. It can be used in multi-class settings or generalised to the open vocabulary setting of generative models. SkewSize is an aggregation of the effect size of the interaction between two categorical variables: the spurious variable representing the bias attribute and the model's prediction. We demonstrate the utility of SkewSize in multiple settings including: standard vision models trained on synthetic data, vision models trained on ImageNet, and large scale vision-and-language models from the BLIP-2 family. In each case, the proposed SkewSize is able to highlight biases not captured by other metrics, while also providing insights on the impact of recently proposed techniques, such as instruction tuning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Event-based video reconstruction has garnered increasing attention due to its advantages, such as high dynamic range and rapid motion capture capabilities. However, current methods often prioritize the extraction of temporal information from continuous event flow, leading to an overemphasis on low-frequency texture features in the scene, resulting in over-smoothing and blurry artifacts. Addressing this challenge necessitates the integration of conditional information, encompassing temporal features, low-frequency texture, and high-frequency events, to guide the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) in producing accurate and natural outputs. To tackle this issue, we introduce a novel approach, the Temporal Residual Guided Diffusion Framework, which effectively leverages both temporal and frequency-based event priors. Our framework incorporates three key conditioning modules: a pre-trained low-frequency intensity estimation module, a temporal recurrent encoder module, and an attention-based high-frequency prior enhancement module. In order to capture temporal scene variations from the events at the current moment, we employ a temporal-domain residual image as the target for the diffusion model. Through the combination of these three conditioning paths and the temporal residual framework, our framework excels in reconstructing high-quality videos from event flow, mitigating issues such as artifacts and over-smoothing commonly observed in previous approaches. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets validate the superior performance of our framework compared to prior event-based reconstruction methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent inverse problem solvers that leverage generative diffusion priors have garnered significant attention due to their exceptional quality. However, adaptation of the prior is necessary when there exists a discrepancy between the training and testing distributions. In this work, we propose deep diffusion image prior (DDIP), which generalizes the recent adaptation method of SCD by introducing a formal connection to the deep image prior. Under this framework, we propose an efficient adaptation method dubbed D3IP, specified for 3D measurements, which accelerates DDIP by orders of magnitude while achieving superior performance. D3IP enables seamless integration of 3D inverse solvers and thus leads to coherent 3D reconstruction. Moreover, we show that meta-learning techniques can also be applied to yield even better performance. We show that our method is capable of solving diverse 3D reconstructive tasks from the generative prior trained only with phantom images that are vastly different from the training set, opening up new opportunities of applying diffusion inverse solvers even when training with gold standard data is impossible.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rhythmic pumping motion of the heart stands as a cornerstone in life, as it circulates blood to the entire human body through a series of carefully timed contractions of the individual chambers. Changes in the size, shape and movement of the chambers can be important markers for cardiac disease and modeling this in relation to clinical demography or disease is therefore of interest. Existing methods for spatio-temporal modeling of the human heart require shape correspondence over time or suffer from large memory requirements, making it difficult to use for complex anatomies. We introduce a novel conditional generative model, where the shape and movement is modeled implicitly in the form of a spatio-temporal neural distance field and conditioned on clinical demography. The model is based on an auto-decoder architecture and aims to disentangle the individual variations from that related to the clinical demography. It is tested on the left atrium (including the left atrial appendage), where it outperforms current state-of-the-art methods for anatomical sequence completion and generates synthetic sequences that realistically mimics the shape and motion of the real left atrium. In practice, this means we can infer functional measurements from a static image, generate synthetic populations with specified demography or disease and investigate how non-imaging clinical data effect the shape and motion of cardiac anatomies.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques leverage the in-context learning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to produce more accurate and relevant responses. Originating from the simple 'retrieve-then-read' approach, the RAG framework has evolved into a highly flexible and modular paradigm. A critical component, the Query Rewriter module, enhances knowledge retrieval by generating a search-friendly query. This method aligns input questions more closely with the knowledge base. Our research identifies opportunities to enhance the Query Rewriter module to Query Rewriter+ by generating multiple queries to overcome the Information Plateaus associated with a single query and by rewriting questions to eliminate Ambiguity, thereby clarifying the underlying intent. We also find that current RAG systems exhibit issues with Irrelevant Knowledge; to overcome this, we propose the Knowledge Filter. These two modules are both based on the instruction-tuned Gemma-2B model, which together enhance response quality. The final identified issue is Redundant Retrieval; we introduce the Memory Knowledge Reservoir and the Retriever Trigger to solve this. The former supports the dynamic expansion of the RAG system's knowledge base in a parameter-free manner, while the latter optimizes the cost for accessing external knowledge, thereby improving resource utilization and response efficiency. These four RAG modules synergistically improve the response quality and efficiency of the RAG system. The effectiveness of these modules has been validated through experiments and ablation studies across six common QA datasets. The source code can be accessed at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text-to-image generation has shown remarkable progress with the emergence of diffusion models. However, these models often generate factually inconsistent images, failing to accurately reflect the factual information and common sense conveyed by the input text prompts. We refer to this issue as Image hallucination. Drawing from studies on hallucinations in language models, we classify this problem into three types and propose a methodology that uses factual images retrieved from external sources to generate realistic images. Depending on the nature of the hallucination, we employ off-the-shelf image editing tools, either InstructPix2Pix or IP-Adapter, to leverage factual information from the retrieved image. This approach enables the generation of images that accurately reflect the facts and common sense.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Event cameras with high dynamic range ensure scene capture even in low-light conditions. However, night events exhibit patterns different from those captured during the day. This difference causes performance degradation when applying night events to a model trained solely on day events. This limitation persists due to a lack of annotated night events. To overcome the limitation, we aim to alleviate data imbalance by translating annotated day data into night events. However, generating events from different modalities challenges reproducing their unique properties. Accordingly, we propose an unpaired event-to-event day-to-night translation model that effectively learns to map from one domain to another using Diffusion GAN. The proposed translation model analyzes events in spatio-temporal dimension with wavelet decomposition and disentangled convolution layers. We also propose a new temporal contrastive learning with a novel shuffling and sampling strategy to regularize temporal continuity. To validate the efficacy of the proposed methodology, we redesign metrics for evaluating events translated in an unpaired setting, aligning them with the event modality for the first time. Our framework shows the successful day-to-night event translation while preserving the characteristics of events. In addition, through our translation method, we facilitate event-based modes to learn about night events by translating annotated day events into night events. Our approach effectively mitigates the performance degradation of applying real night events to downstream tasks. The code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this work, we introduce Mask-JEPA, a self-supervised learning framework tailored for mask classification architectures (MCA), to overcome the traditional constraints associated with training segmentation models. Mask-JEPA combines a Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture with MCA to adeptly capture intricate semantics and precise object boundaries. Our approach addresses two critical challenges in self-supervised learning: 1) extracting comprehensive representations for universal image segmentation from a pixel decoder, and 2) effectively training the transformer decoder. The use of the transformer decoder as a predictor within the JEPA framework allows proficient training in universal image segmentation tasks. Through rigorous evaluations on datasets such as ADE20K, Cityscapes and COCO, Mask-JEPA demonstrates not only competitive results but also exceptional adaptability and robustness across various training scenarios. The architecture-agnostic nature of Mask-JEPA further underscores its versatility, allowing seamless adaptation to various mask classification family.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In recent years, methods for producing highly realistic synthetic images have significantly advanced, allowing the creation of high-quality images from text prompts that describe the desired content. Even more impressively, Stable Diffusion (SD) models now provide users with the option of creating synthetic images in an image-to-image translation fashion, modifying images in the latent space of advanced autoencoders. This striking evolution, however, brings an alarming consequence: it is possible to pass an image through SD autoencoders to reproduce a synthetic copy of the image with high realism and almost no visual artifacts. This process, known as SD image laundering, can transform real images into lookalike synthetic ones and risks complicating forensic analysis for content authenticity verification. Our paper investigates the forensic implications of image laundering, revealing a serious potential to obscure traces of real content, including sensitive and harmful materials that could be mistakenly classified as synthetic, thereby undermining the protection of individuals depicted. To address this issue, we propose a two-stage detection pipeline that effectively differentiates between pristine, laundered, and fully synthetic images (those generated from text prompts), showing robustness across various conditions. Finally, we highlight another alarming property of image laundering, which appears to mask the unique artifacts exploited by forensic detectors to solve the camera model identification task, strongly undermining their performance.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Our brains represent the ever-changing environment with neurons in a highly dynamic fashion. The temporal features of visual pixels in dynamic natural scenes are entrapped in the neuronal responses of the retina. It is crucial to establish the intrinsic temporal relationship between visual pixels and neuronal responses. Recent foundation vision models have paved an advanced way of understanding image pixels. Yet, neuronal coding in the brain largely lacks a deep understanding of its alignment with pixels. Most previous studies employ static images or artificial videos derived from static images for emulating more real and complicated stimuli. Despite these simple scenarios effectively help to separate key factors influencing visual coding, complex temporal relationships receive no consideration. To decompose the temporal features of visual coding in natural scenes, here we propose Vi-ST, a spatiotemporal convolutional neural network fed with a self-supervised Vision Transformer (ViT) prior, aimed at unraveling the temporal-based encoding patterns of retinal neuronal populations. The model demonstrates robust predictive performance in generalization tests. Furthermore, through detailed ablation experiments, we demonstrate the significance of each temporal module. Furthermore, we introduce a visual coding evaluation metric designed to integrate temporal considerations and compare the impact of different numbers of neuronal populations on complementary coding. In conclusion, our proposed Vi-ST demonstrates a novel modeling framework for neuronal coding of dynamic visual scenes in the brain, effectively aligning our brain representation of video with neuronal activity.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper attempts to address the object repetition issue in patch-wise higher-resolution image generation. We propose AccDiffusion, an accurate method for patch-wise higher-resolution image generation without training. An in-depth analysis in this paper reveals an identical text prompt for different patches causes repeated object generation, while no prompt compromises the image details. Therefore, our AccDiffusion, for the first time, proposes to decouple the vanilla image-content-aware prompt into a set of patch-content-aware prompts, each of which serves as a more precise description of an image patch. Besides, AccDiffusion also introduces dilated sampling with window interaction for better global consistency in higher-resolution image generation. Experimental comparison with existing methods demonstrates that our AccDiffusion effectively addresses the issue of repeated object generation and leads to better performance in higher-resolution image generation.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Codebooks -- documents that operationalize constructs and outline annotation procedures -- are used almost universally by social scientists when coding unstructured political texts. Recently, to reduce manual annotation costs, political scientists have looked to generative large language models (LLMs) to label and analyze text data. However, previous work using LLMs for classification has implicitly relied on the universal label assumption -- correct classification of documents is possible using only a class label or minimal definition and the information that the LLM inductively learns during its pre-training. In contrast, we argue that political scientists who care about valid measurement should instead make a codebook-construct label assumption -- an LLM should follow the definition and exclusion criteria of a construct/label provided in a codebook. In this work, we collect and curate three political science datasets and their original codebooks and conduct a set of experiments to understand whether LLMs comply with codebook instructions, whether rewriting codebooks improves performance, and whether instruction-tuning LLMs on codebook-document-label tuples improves performance over zero-shot classification. Using Mistral 7B Instruct as our LLM, we find re-structuring the original codebooks gives modest gains in zero-shot performance but the model still struggles to comply with the constraints of the codebooks. Optimistically, instruction-tuning Mistral on one of our datasets gives significant gains over zero-shot inference (0.76 versus 0.53 micro F1). We hope our conceptualization of the codebook-specific task, assumptions, and instruction-tuning pipeline as well our semi-structured LLM codebook format will help political scientists readily adapt to the LLM era.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Swarms of drones offer an increased sensing aperture, and having them mimic behaviors of natural swarms enhances sampling by adapting the aperture to local conditions. We demonstrate that such an approach makes detecting and tracking heavily occluded targets practically feasible. While object classification applied to conventional aerial images generalizes poorly the randomness of occlusion and is therefore inefficient even under lightly occluded conditions, anomaly detection applied to synthetic aperture integral images is robust for dense vegetation, such as forests, and is independent of pre-trained classes. Our autonomous swarm searches the environment for occurrences of the unknown or unexpected, tracking them while continuously adapting its sampling pattern to optimize for local viewing conditions. In our real-life field experiments with a swarm of six drones, we achieved an average positional accuracy of 0.39 m with an average precision of 93.2% and an average recall of 95.9%. Here, adapted particle swarm optimization considers detection confidences and predicted target appearance. We show that sensor noise can effectively be included in the synthetic aperture image integration process, removing the need for a computationally costly optimization of high-dimensional parameter spaces. Finally, we present a complete hard- and software framework that supports low-latency transmission (approx. 80 ms round-trip time) and fast processing (approx. 600 ms per formation step) of extensive (70-120 Mbit/s) video and telemetry data, and swarm control for swarms of up to ten drones.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Current optical flow and point-tracking methods rely heavily on synthetic datasets. Event cameras are novel vision sensors with advantages in challenging visual conditions, but state-of-the-art frame-based methods cannot be easily adapted to event data due to the limitations of current event simulators. We introduce a novel self-supervised loss combining the Contrast Maximization framework with a non-linear motion prior in the form of pixel-level trajectories and propose an efficient solution to solve the high-dimensional assignment problem between non-linear trajectories and events. Their effectiveness is demonstrated in two scenarios: In dense continuous-time motion estimation, our method improves the zero-shot performance of a synthetically trained model on the real-world dataset EVIMO2 by 29%. In optical flow estimation, our method elevates a simple UNet to achieve state-of-the-art performance among self-supervised methods on the DSEC optical flow benchmark.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this article, we focus on the pre-training of visual autonomous driving agents in the context of imitation learning. Current methods often rely on a classification-based pre-training, which we hypothesise to be holding back from extending capabilities of implicit image understanding. We propose pre-training the visual encoder of a driving agent using the self-distillation with no labels (DINO) method, which relies on a self-supervised learning paradigm.% and is trained on an unrelated task. Our experiments in CARLA environment in accordance with the Leaderboard benchmark reveal that the proposed pre-training is more efficient than classification-based pre-training, and is on par with the recently proposed pre-training based on visual place recognition (VPRPre).</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As large language models (LLMs) advance, it becomes more challenging to reliably evaluate their output due to the high costs of human evaluation. To make progress towards better LLM autoraters, we introduce FLAMe, a family of Foundational Large Autorater Models. FLAMe is trained on our large and diverse collection of 100+ quality assessment tasks comprising 5M+ human judgments, curated and standardized using publicly released human evaluations from previous research. FLAMe significantly improves generalization to a wide variety of held-out tasks, outperforming LLMs trained on proprietary data like GPT-4 and Claude-3 on many tasks. We show that FLAMe can also serve as a powerful starting point for further downstream fine-tuning, using reward modeling evaluation as a case study (FLAMe-RM). Notably, on RewardBench, our FLAMe-RM-24B model (with an accuracy of 87.8%) is the top-performing generative model trained exclusively on permissively licensed data, outperforming both GPT-4-0125 (85.9%) and GPT-4o (84.7%). Additionally, we explore a more computationally efficient approach using a novel tail-patch fine-tuning strategy to optimize our FLAMe multitask mixture for reward modeling evaluation (FLAMe-Opt-RM), offering competitive RewardBench performance while requiring approximately 25x less training datapoints. Overall, our FLAMe variants outperform all popular proprietary LLM-as-a-Judge models we consider across 8 out of 12 autorater evaluation benchmarks, encompassing 53 quality assessment tasks, including RewardBench and LLM-AggreFact. Finally, our analysis reveals that FLAMe is significantly less biased than these LLM-as-a-Judge models on the CoBBLEr autorater bias benchmark, while effectively identifying high-quality responses for code generation.</li>

          R3D-AD: Reconstruction via Diffusion for 3D Anomaly Detection(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>3D anomaly detection plays a crucial role in monitoring parts for localized inherent defects in precision manufacturing. Embedding-based and reconstruction-based approaches are among the most popular and successful methods. However, there are two major challenges to the practical application of the current approaches: 1) the embedded models suffer the prohibitive computational and storage due to the memory bank structure; 2) the reconstructive models based on the MAE mechanism fail to detect anomalies in the unmasked regions. In this paper, we propose R3D-AD, reconstructing anomalous point clouds by diffusion model for precise 3D anomaly detection. Our approach capitalizes on the data distribution conversion of the diffusion process to entirely obscure the input's anomalous geometry. It step-wisely learns a strict point-level displacement behavior, which methodically corrects the aberrant points. To increase the generalization of the model, we further present a novel 3D anomaly simulation strategy named Patch-Gen to generate realistic and diverse defect shapes, which narrows the domain gap between training and testing. Our R3D-AD ensures a uniform spatial transformation, which allows straightforwardly generating anomaly results by distance comparison. Extensive experiments show that our R3D-AD outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving 73.4% Image-level AUROC on the Real3D-AD dataset and 74.9% Image-level AUROC on the Anomaly-ShapeNet dataset with an exceptional efficiency.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large vision-language models (LVLMs), such as the Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4-omni (GPT-4o), are emerging multi-modal foundation models which have great potential as powerful artificial-intelligence (AI) assistance tools for a myriad of applications, including healthcare, industrial, and academic sectors. Although such foundation models perform well in a wide range of general tasks, their capability without fine-tuning is often limited in specialized tasks. However, full fine-tuning of large foundation models is challenging due to enormous computation/memory/dataset requirements. We show that GPT-4o can decode hand gestures from forearm ultrasound data even with no fine-tuning, and improves with few-shot, in-context learning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While text-to-image diffusion models have been shown to achieve state-of-the-art results in image synthesis, they have yet to prove their effectiveness in downstream applications. Previous work has proposed to generate data for image classifier training given limited real data access. However, these methods struggle to generate in-distribution images or depict fine-grained features, thereby hindering the generalization of classification models trained on synthetic datasets. We propose DataDream, a framework for synthesizing classification datasets that more faithfully represents the real data distribution when guided by few-shot examples of the target classes. DataDream fine-tunes LoRA weights for the image generation model on the few real images before generating the training data using the adapted model. We then fine-tune LoRA weights for CLIP using the synthetic data to improve downstream image classification over previous approaches on a large variety of datasets. We demonstrate the efficacy of DataDream through extensive experiments, surpassing state-of-the-art classification accuracy with few-shot data across 7 out of 10 datasets, while being competitive on the other 3. Additionally, we provide insights into the impact of various factors, such as the number of real-shot and generated images as well as the fine-tuning compute on model performance.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Foundation models and vision-language pre-training have notably advanced Vision Language Models (VLMs), enabling multimodal processing of visual and linguistic data. However, their performance has been typically assessed on general scene understanding - recognizing objects, attributes, and actions - rather than cultural comprehension. This study introduces CulturalVQA, a visual question-answering benchmark aimed at assessing VLM's geo-diverse cultural understanding. We curate a collection of 2,378 image-question pairs with 1-5 answers per question representing cultures from 11 countries across 5 continents. The questions probe understanding of various facets of culture such as clothing, food, drinks, rituals, and traditions. Benchmarking VLMs on CulturalVQA, including GPT-4V and Gemini, reveals disparity in their level of cultural understanding across regions, with strong cultural understanding capabilities for North America while significantly lower performance for Africa. We observe disparity in their performance across cultural facets too, with clothing, rituals, and traditions seeing higher performances than food and drink. These disparities help us identify areas where VLMs lack cultural understanding and demonstrate the potential of CulturalVQA as a comprehensive evaluation set for gauging VLM progress in understanding diverse cultures.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Self-supervised pretraining methods with masked prediction demonstrate remarkable within-dataset performance in skeleton-based action recognition. However, we show that, unlike contrastive learning approaches, they do not produce well-separated clusters. Additionally, these methods struggle with generalization in few-shot settings. To address these issues, we propose Self-supervised Tuning for 3D Action Recognition in Skeleton sequences (STARS). Specifically, STARS first uses a masked prediction stage using an encoder-decoder architecture. It then employs nearest-neighbor contrastive learning to partially tune the weights of the encoder, enhancing the formation of semantic clusters for different actions. By tuning the encoder for a few epochs, and without using hand-crafted data augmentations, STARS achieves state-of-the-art self-supervised results in various benchmarks, including NTU-60, NTU-120, and PKU-MMD. In addition, STARS exhibits significantly better results than masked prediction models in few-shot settings, where the model has not seen the actions throughout pretraining.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Significant advances have been made in human-centric video generation, yet the joint video-depth generation problem remains underexplored. Most existing monocular depth estimation methods may not generalize well to synthesized images or videos, and multi-view-based methods have difficulty controlling the human appearance and motion. In this work, we present IDOL (unIfied Dual-mOdal Latent diffusion) for high-quality human-centric joint video-depth generation. Our IDOL consists of two novel designs. First, to enable dual-modal generation and maximize the information exchange between video and depth generation, we propose a unified dual-modal U-Net, a parameter-sharing framework for joint video and depth denoising, wherein a modality label guides the denoising target, and cross-modal attention enables the mutual information flow. Second, to ensure a precise video-depth spatial alignment, we propose a motion consistency loss that enforces consistency between the video and depth feature motion fields, leading to harmonized outputs. Additionally, a cross-attention map consistency loss is applied to align the cross-attention map of the video denoising with that of the depth denoising, further facilitating spatial alignment. Extensive experiments on the TikTok and NTU120 datasets show our superior performance, significantly surpassing existing methods in terms of video FVD and depth accuracy.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce InVi, an approach for inserting or replacing objects within videos (referred to as inpainting) using off-the-shelf, text-to-image latent diffusion models. InVi targets controlled manipulation of objects and blending them seamlessly into a background video unlike existing video editing methods that focus on comprehensive re-styling or entire scene alterations. To achieve this goal, we tackle two key challenges. Firstly, for high quality control and blending, we employ a two-step process involving inpainting and matching. This process begins with inserting the object into a single frame using a ControlNet-based inpainting diffusion model, and then generating subsequent frames conditioned on features from an inpainted frame as an anchor to minimize the domain gap between the background and the object. Secondly, to ensure temporal coherence, we replace the diffusion model's self-attention layers with extended-attention layers. The anchor frame features serve as the keys and values for these layers, enhancing consistency across frames. Our approach removes the need for video-specific fine-tuning, presenting an efficient and adaptable solution. Experimental results demonstrate that InVi achieves realistic object insertion with consistent blending and coherence across frames, outperforming existing methods.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper introduces FUNGI, Features from UNsupervised GradIents, a method to enhance the features of vision encoders by leveraging self-supervised gradients. Our method is simple: given any pretrained model, we first compute gradients from various self-supervised objectives for each input. These are projected to a lower dimension and then concatenated with the model's embedding. The resulting features are evaluated on k-nearest neighbor classification over 11 datasets from vision, 5 from natural language processing, and 2 from audio. Across backbones spanning various sizes and pretraining strategies, FUNGI features provide consistent performance improvements over the embeddings. We also show that using FUNGI features can benefit linear classification and image retrieval, and that they significantly improve the retrieval-based in-context scene understanding abilities of pretrained models, for example improving upon DINO by +17% for semantic segmentation - without any training.</li>
