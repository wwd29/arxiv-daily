<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present our work on developing and training scalable graph foundation models (GFM) using HydraGNN, a multi-headed graph convolutional neural network architecture. HydraGNN expands the boundaries of graph neural network (GNN) in both training scale and data diversity. It abstracts over message passing algorithms, allowing both reproduction of and comparison across algorithmic innovations that define convolution in GNNs. This work discusses a series of optimizations that have allowed scaling up the GFM training to tens of thousands of GPUs on datasets that consist of hundreds of millions of graphs. Our GFMs use multi-task learning (MTL) to simultaneously learn graph-level and node-level properties of atomistic structures, such as the total energy and atomic forces. Using over 150 million atomistic structures for training, we illustrate the performance of our approach along with the lessons learned on two United States Department of Energy (US-DOE) supercomputers, namely the Perlmutter petascale system at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center and the Frontier exascale system at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The HydraGNN architecture enables the GFM to achieve near-linear strong scaling performance using more than 2,000 GPUs on Perlmutter and 16,000 GPUs on Frontier. Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) was performed on over 64,000 GPUs on Frontier to select GFM architectures with high accuracy. Early stopping was applied on each GFM architecture for energy awareness in performing such an extreme-scale task. The training of an ensemble of highest-ranked GFM architectures continued until convergence to establish uncertainty quantification (UQ) capabilities with ensemble learning. Our contribution opens the door for rapidly developing, training, and deploying GFMs using large-scale computational resources to enable AI-accelerated materials discovery and design.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Trajectory similarity computation is an essential technique for analyzing moving patterns of spatial data across various applications such as traffic management, wildlife tracking, and location-based services. Modern methods often apply deep learning techniques to approximate heuristic metrics but struggle to learn more robust and generalized representations from the vast amounts of unlabeled trajectory data. Recent approaches focus on self-supervised learning methods such as contrastive learning, which have made significant advancements in trajectory representation learning. However, contrastive learning-based methods heavily depend on manually pre-defined data augmentation schemes, limiting the diversity of generated trajectories and resulting in learning from such variations in 2D Euclidean space, which prevents capturing high-level semantic variations. To address these limitations, we propose T-JEPA, a self-supervised trajectory similarity computation method employing Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) to enhance trajectory representation learning. T-JEPA samples and predicts trajectory information in representation space, enabling the model to infer the missing components of trajectories at high-level semantics without relying on domain knowledge or manual effort. Extensive experiments conducted on three urban trajectory datasets and two Foursquare datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of T-JEPA in trajectory similarity computation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Self-supervised learning (SSL) with vision transformers (ViTs) has proven effective for representation learning as demonstrated by the impressive performance on various downstream tasks. Despite these successes, existing ViT-based SSL architectures do not fully exploit the ViT backbone, particularly the patch tokens of the ViT. In this paper, we introduce a novel Semantic Graph Consistency (SGC) module to regularize ViT-based SSL methods and leverage patch tokens effectively. We reconceptualize images as graphs, with image patches as nodes and infuse relational inductive biases by explicit message passing using Graph Neural Networks into the SSL framework. Our SGC loss acts as a regularizer, leveraging the underexploited patch tokens of ViTs to construct a graph and enforcing consistency between graph features across multiple views of an image. Extensive experiments on various datasets including ImageNet, RESISC and Food-101 show that our approach significantly improves the quality of learned representations, resulting in a 5-10\% increase in performance when limited labeled data is used for linear evaluation. These experiments coupled with a comprehensive set of ablations demonstrate the promise of our approach in various settings.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We investigate the impact of dataset-specific hyperparameter, feature encoding, and architecture tuning on five recent model families for tabular data generation through an extensive benchmark on 16 datasets. This study addresses the practical need for a unified evaluation of models that fully considers hyperparameter optimization. Additionally, we propose a reduced search space for each model that allows for quick optimization, achieving nearly equivalent performance at a significantly lower cost.Our benchmark demonstrates that, for most models, large-scale dataset-specific tuning substantially improves performance compared to the original configurations. Furthermore, we confirm that diffusion-based models generally outperform other models on tabular data. However, this advantage is not significant when the entire tuning and training process is restricted to the same GPU budget for all models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The promise of tabular generative models is to produce realistic synthetic data that can be shared and safely used without dangerous leakage of information from the training set. In evaluating these models, a variety of methods have been proposed to measure the tendency to copy data from the training dataset when generating a sample. However, these methods suffer from either not considering data-copying from a privacy threat perspective, not being motivated by recent results in the data-copying literature or being difficult to make compatible with the high dimensional, mixed type nature of tabular data. This paper proposes a new similarity metric and Membership Inference Attack called Data Plagiarism Index (DPI) for tabular data. We show that DPI evaluates a new intuitive definition of data-copying and characterizes the corresponding privacy risk. We show that the data-copying identified by DPI poses both privacy and fairness threats to common, high performing architectures; underscoring the necessity for more sophisticated generative modeling techniques to mitigate this issue.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Efficient inference in Large Language Models (LLMs) is impeded by the growing memory demands of key-value (KV) caching, especially for longer sequences. Traditional KV cache eviction strategies, which prioritize less critical KV-pairs based on attention scores, often degrade generation quality, leading to issues such as context loss or hallucinations. To address this, we introduce Dynamic Discriminative Operations (D2O), a novel method that utilizes two-level discriminative strategies to optimize KV cache size without fine-tuning, while preserving essential context. Initially, by observing varying densities of attention weights between shallow and deep layers, we use this insight to determine which layers should avoid excessive eviction to minimize information loss. Subsequently, for the eviction strategy in each layer, D2O innovatively incorporates a compensation mechanism that maintains a similarity threshold to re-discriminate the importance of previously discarded tokens, determining whether they should be recalled and merged with similar tokens. Our approach not only achieves significant memory savings and enhances inference throughput by more than 3x but also maintains high-quality long-text generation. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks and LLM architectures have demonstrated that D2O significantly enhances performance with a constrained KV cache budget.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Internal solitary waves (ISWs) are gravity waves that are often observed in the interior ocean rather than the surface. They hold significant importance due to their capacity to carry substantial energy, thus influence pollutant transport, oil platform operations, submarine navigation, etc. Researchers have studied ISWs through optical images, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, and altimeter data from remote sensing instruments. However, cloud cover in optical remote sensing images variably obscures ground information, leading to blurred or missing surface observations. As such, this paper aims at altimeter-based machine learning solutions to automatically locate ISWs. The challenges, however, lie in the following two aspects: 1) the altimeter data has low resolution, which requires a strong machine learner; 2) labeling data is extremely labor-intensive, leading to very limited data for training. In recent years, the grand progress of deep learning demonstrates strong learning capacity given abundant data. Besides, more recent studies on efficient learning and self-supervised learning laid solid foundations to tackle the aforementioned challenges. In this paper, we propose to inject prior knowledge to achieve a strong and efficient learner. Specifically, intrinsic patterns in altimetry data are efficiently captured using a scale-translation equivariant convolutional neural network (ST-ECNN). By considering inherent symmetries in neural network design, ST-ECNN achieves higher efficiency and better performance than baseline models. Furthermore, we also introduce prior knowledge from massive unsupervised data to enhance our solution using the SimCLR framework for pre-training. Our final solution achieves an overall better performance than baselines on our handcrafted altimetry dataset. Data and codes are available at this https URL .</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The improvement of language model robustness, including successful defense against adversarial attacks, remains an open problem. In computer vision settings, the stochastic noising and de-noising process provided by diffusion models has proven useful for purifying input images, thus improving model robustness against adversarial attacks. Similarly, some initial work has explored the use of random noising and de-noising to mitigate adversarial attacks in an NLP setting, but improving the quality and efficiency of these methods is necessary for them to remain competitive. We extend upon methods of input text purification that are inspired by diffusion processes, which randomly mask and refill portions of the input text before classification. Our novel method, MaskPure, exceeds or matches robustness compared to other contemporary defenses, while also requiring no adversarial classifier training and without assuming knowledge of the attack type. In addition, we show that MaskPure is provably certifiably robust. To our knowledge, MaskPure is the first stochastic-purification method with demonstrated success against both character-level and word-level attacks, indicating the generalizable and promising nature of stochastic denoising defenses. In summary: the MaskPure algorithm bridges literature on the current strongest certifiable and empirical adversarial defense methods, showing that both theoretical and practical robustness can be obtained together.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We seek to elevate the planning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs)investigating four main directions. First, we construct a comprehensive benchmark suite encompassing both classical planning domains and natural language scenarios. This suite includes algorithms to generate instances with varying levels of difficulty, allowing for rigorous and systematic evaluation of LLM performance. Second, we investigate the use of in-context learning (ICL) to enhance LLM planning, exploring the direct relationship between increased context length and improved planning performance. Third, we demonstrate the positive impact of fine-tuning LLMs on optimal planning paths, as well as the effectiveness of incorporating model-driven search procedures. Finally, we investigate the performance of the proposed methods in out-of-distribution scenarios, assessing the ability to generalize to novel and unseen planning challenges.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present a latent diffusion model over 3D scenes, that can be trained using only 2D image data. To achieve this, we first design an autoencoder that maps multi-view images to 3D Gaussian splats, and simultaneously builds a compressed latent representation of these splats. Then, we train a multi-view diffusion model over the latent space to learn an efficient generative model. This pipeline does not require object masks nor depths, and is suitable for complex scenes with arbitrary camera positions. We conduct careful experiments on two large-scale datasets of complex real-world scenes -- MVImgNet and RealEstate10K. We show that our approach enables generating 3D scenes in as little as 0.2 seconds, either from scratch, from a single input view, or from sparse input views. It produces diverse and high-quality results while running an order of magnitude faster than non-latent diffusion models and earlier NeRF-based generative models</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Long-context language models (LCLMs) have the potential to revolutionize our approach to tasks traditionally reliant on external tools like retrieval systems or databases. Leveraging LCLMs' ability to natively ingest and process entire corpora of information offers numerous advantages. It enhances user-friendliness by eliminating the need for specialized knowledge of tools, provides robust end-to-end modeling that minimizes cascading errors in complex pipelines, and allows for the application of sophisticated prompting techniques across the entire system. To assess this paradigm shift, we introduce LOFT, a benchmark of real-world tasks requiring context up to millions of tokens designed to evaluate LCLMs' performance on in-context retrieval and reasoning. Our findings reveal LCLMs' surprising ability to rival state-of-the-art retrieval and RAG systems, despite never having been explicitly trained for these tasks. However, LCLMs still face challenges in areas like compositional reasoning that are required in SQL-like tasks. Notably, prompting strategies significantly influence performance, emphasizing the need for continued research as context lengths grow. Overall, LOFT provides a rigorous testing ground for LCLMs, showcasing their potential to supplant existing paradigms and tackle novel tasks as model capabilities scale.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently hallucinate, impeding their reliability in mission-critical situations. One approach to address this issue is to provide citations to relevant sources alongside generated content, enhancing the verifiability of generations. However, citing passages accurately in answers remains a substantial challenge. This paper proposes a weakly-supervised fine-tuning method leveraging factual consistency models (FCMs). Our approach alternates between generating texts with citations and supervised fine-tuning with FCM-filtered citation data. Focused learning is integrated into the objective, directing the fine-tuning process to emphasise the factual unit tokens, as measured by an FCM. Results on the ALCE few-shot citation benchmark with various instruction-tuned LLMs demonstrate superior performance compared to in-context learning, vanilla supervised fine-tuning, and state-of-the-art methods, with an average improvement of $34.1$, $15.5$, and $10.5$ citation F$_1$ points, respectively. Moreover, in a domain transfer setting we show that the obtained citation generation ability robustly transfers to unseen datasets. Notably, our citation improvements contribute to the lowest factual error rate across baselines.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper studies in-context learning (ICL) by decomposing the output of large language models into the individual contributions of attention heads and MLPs (components). We observe curious components: good-performing ones that individually do well on a classification task, even when the model performs poorly; bad-performing ones that do much worse than chance; and label-biased components that always predict the same label. We find that component accuracies are well-correlated across different demonstration sets and perturbations of prompt templates, even when the full-model accuracy varies greatly. Based on our findings, we propose component reweighting, which learns to linearly re-scale the component activations from a few labeled examples. Given 24 labeled examples, our method improves by an average of 6.0% accuracy points over 24-shot ICL across 8 tasks on Llama-2-7B. Overall, this paper both enriches our understanding of ICL and provides a practical method for improvement by examining model internals.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Pathogen identification is pivotal in diagnosing, treating, and preventing diseases, crucial for controlling infections and safeguarding public health. Traditional alignment-based methods, though widely used, are computationally intense and reliant on extensive reference databases, often failing to detect novel pathogens due to their low sensitivity and specificity. Similarly, conventional machine learning techniques, while promising, require large annotated datasets and extensive feature engineering and are prone to overfitting. Addressing these challenges, we introduce PathoLM, a cutting-edge pathogen language model optimized for the identification of pathogenicity in bacterial and viral sequences. Leveraging the strengths of pre-trained DNA models such as the Nucleotide Transformer, PathoLM requires minimal data for fine-tuning, thereby enhancing pathogen detection capabilities. It effectively captures a broader genomic context, significantly improving the identification of novel and divergent pathogens. We developed a comprehensive data set comprising approximately 30 species of viruses and bacteria, including ESKAPEE pathogens, seven notably virulent bacterial strains resistant to antibiotics. Additionally, we curated a species classification dataset centered specifically on the ESKAPEE group. In comparative assessments, PathoLM dramatically outperforms existing models like DciPatho, demonstrating robust zero-shot and few-shot capabilities. Furthermore, we expanded PathoLM-Sp for ESKAPEE species classification, where it showed superior performance compared to other advanced deep learning methods, despite the complexities of the task.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advancements in multimodal foundation models have showcased impressive capabilities in understanding and reasoning with visual and textual information. Adapting these foundation models trained for general usage to specialized domains like biomedicine requires large-scale domain-specific instruction datasets. While existing works have explored curating such datasets automatically, the resultant datasets are not explicitly aligned with domain expertise. In this work, we propose a data-centric framework, Biomedical Visual Instruction Tuning with Clinician Preference Alignment (BioMed-VITAL), that incorporates clinician preferences into both stages of generating and selecting instruction data for tuning biomedical multimodal foundation models. First, during the generation stage, we prompt the GPT-4V generator with a diverse set of clinician-selected demonstrations for preference-aligned data candidate generation. Then, during the selection phase, we train a separate selection model, which explicitly distills clinician and policy-guided model preferences into a rating function to select high-quality data for medical instruction tuning. Results show that the model tuned with the instruction-following data from our method demonstrates a significant improvement in open visual chat (18.5% relatively) and medical VQA (win rate up to 81.73%).

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has gained massive attention in the recent generative AI research. One of the main advantages of LoRA is its ability to be fused with pretrained models adding no overhead during inference. However, from a mobile deployment standpoint, we can either avoid inference overhead in the fused mode but lose the ability to switch adapters rapidly, or suffer significant (up to 30% higher) inference latency while enabling rapid switching in the unfused mode. LoRA also exhibits concept-loss when multiple adapters are used concurrently. In this paper, we propose Sparse High Rank Adapters (SHiRA), a new paradigm which incurs no inference overhead, enables rapid switching, and significantly reduces concept-loss. Specifically, SHiRA can be trained by directly tuning only 1-2% of the base model weights while leaving others unchanged. This results in a highly sparse adapter which can be switched directly in the fused mode. We further provide theoretical and empirical insights on how high sparsity in SHiRA can aid multi-adapter fusion by reducing concept loss. Our extensive experiments on LVMs and LLMs demonstrate that finetuning only a small fraction of the parameters in the base model is sufficient for many tasks while enabling both rapid switching and multi-adapter fusion. Finally, we provide a latency- and memory-efficient SHiRA implementation based on Parameter-Efficient Finetuning (PEFT) Library. This implementation trains at nearly the same speed as LoRA while consuming lower peak GPU memory, thus making SHiRA easy to adopt for practical use cases.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent years have witnessed the prosperous development of Graph Self-supervised Learning (GSSL), which enables to pre-train transferable foundation graph encoders. However, the easy-to-plug-in nature of such encoders makes them vulnerable to copyright infringement. To address this issue, we develop a novel watermarking framework to protect graph encoders in GSSL settings. The key idea is to force the encoder to map a set of specially crafted trigger instances into a unique compact cluster in the outputted embedding space during model pre-training. Consequently, when the encoder is stolen and concatenated with any downstream classifiers, the resulting model inherits the backdoor of the encoder and predicts the trigger instances to be in a single category with high probability regardless of the ground truth. Experimental results have shown that, the embedded watermark can be transferred to various downstream tasks in black-box settings, including node classification, link prediction and community detection, which forms a reliable watermark verification system for GSSL in reality. This approach also shows satisfactory performance in terms of model fidelity, reliability and robustness.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As language models continue to scale, Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited emerging capabilities in In-Context Learning (ICL), enabling them to solve language tasks by prefixing a few in-context demonstrations (ICDs) as context. Inspired by these advancements, researchers have extended these techniques to develop Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) with ICL capabilities. However, applying ICL usually faces two major challenges: 1) using more ICDs will largely increase the inference time and 2) the performance is sensitive to the selection of ICDs. These challenges are further exacerbated in LMMs due to the integration of multiple data types and the combinational complexity of multimodal ICDs. Recently, to address these challenges, some NLP studies introduce non-learnable In-Context Vectors (ICVs) which extract useful task information from ICDs into a single vector and then insert it into the LLM to help solve the corresponding task. However, although useful in simple NLP tasks, these non-learnable methods fail to handle complex multimodal tasks like Visual Question Answering (VQA). In this study, we propose \textbf{Learnable ICV} (L-ICV) to distill essential task information from demonstrations, improving ICL performance in LMMs. Experiments show that L-ICV can significantly reduce computational costs while enhancing accuracy in VQA tasks compared to traditional ICL and other non-learnable ICV methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Surgical triplet recognition is an essential building block to enable next-generation context-aware operating rooms. The goal is to identify the combinations of instruments, verbs, and targets presented in surgical video frames. In this paper, we propose DiffTriplet, a new generative framework for surgical triplet recognition employing the diffusion model, which predicts surgical triplets via iterative denoising. To handle the challenge of triplet association, two unique designs are proposed in our diffusion framework, i.e., association learning and association guidance. During training, we optimize the model in the joint space of triplets and individual components to capture the dependencies among them. At inference, we integrate association constraints into each update of the iterative denoising process, which refines the triplet prediction using the information of individual components. Experiments on the CholecT45 and CholecT50 datasets show the superiority of the proposed method in achieving a new state-of-the-art performance for surgical triplet recognition. Our codes will be released.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The most advanced diffusion models have recently adopted increasingly deep stacked networks (e.g., U-Net or Transformer) to promote the generative emergence capabilities of vision generation models similar to large language models (LLMs). However, progressively deeper stacked networks will intuitively cause numerical propagation errors and reduce noisy prediction capabilities on generative data, which hinders massively deep scalable training of vision generation models. In this paper, we first uncover the nature that neural networks being able to effectively perform generative denoising lies in the fact that the intrinsic residual unit has consistent dynamic property with the input signal's reverse diffusion process, thus supporting excellent generative abilities. Afterwards, we stand on the shoulders of two common types of deep stacked networks to propose a unified and massively scalable Neural Residual Diffusion Models framework (Neural-RDM for short), which is a simple yet meaningful change to the common architecture of deep generative networks by introducing a series of learnable gated residual parameters that conform to the generative dynamics. Experimental results on various generative tasks show that the proposed neural residual models obtain state-of-the-art scores on image's and video's generative benchmarks. Rigorous theoretical proofs and extensive experiments also demonstrate the advantages of this simple gated residual mechanism consistent with dynamic modeling in improving the fidelity and consistency of generated content and supporting large-scale scalable training.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Face reenactment refers to the process of transferring the pose and facial expressions from a reference (driving) video onto a static facial (source) image while maintaining the original identity of the source image. Previous research in this domain has made significant progress by training controllable deep generative models to generate faces based on specific identity, pose and expression conditions. However, the mechanisms used in these methods to control pose and expression often inadvertently introduce identity information from the driving video, while also causing a loss of expression-related details. This paper proposes a new method based on Stable Diffusion, called AniFaceDiff, incorporating a new conditioning module for high-fidelity face reenactment. First, we propose an enhanced 2D facial snapshot conditioning approach by facial shape alignment to prevent the inclusion of identity information from the driving video. Then, we introduce an expression adapter conditioning mechanism to address the potential loss of expression-related information. Our approach effectively preserves pose and expression fidelity from the driving video while retaining the identity and fine details of the source image. Through experiments on the VoxCeleb dataset, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results in face reenactment, showcasing superior image quality, identity preservation, and expression accuracy, especially for cross-identity scenarios. Considering the ethical concerns surrounding potential misuse, we analyze the implications of our method, evaluate current state-of-the-art deepfake detectors, and identify their shortcomings to guide future research.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Few shot in-context learning (ICL) typically assumes access to large annotated training sets. However, in many real world scenarios, such as domain adaptation, there is only a limited budget to annotate a small number of samples, with the goal of maximizing downstream performance. We study various methods for selecting samples to annotate within a predefined budget, specifically focusing on the named entity recognition (NER) task, which has real-world applications, is expensive to annotate, and is relatively less studied in ICL setups. Across different models and datasets, we find that a relatively small pool of annotated samples can achieve results comparable to using the entire training set. Moreover, we discover that random selection of samples for annotation yields surprisingly good performance. Finally, we observe that a diverse annotation pool is correlated with improved performance. We hope that future work adopts our realistic paradigm which takes annotation budget into account.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Sequential decision-making can be formulated as a text-conditioned video generation problem, where a video planner, guided by a text-defined goal, generates future frames visualizing planned actions, from which control actions are subsequently derived. In this work, we introduce Active Region Video Diffusion for Universal Policies (ARDuP), a novel framework for video-based policy learning that emphasizes the generation of active regions, i.e. potential interaction areas, enhancing the conditional policy's focus on interactive areas critical for task execution. This innovative framework integrates active region conditioning with latent diffusion models for video planning and employs latent representations for direct action decoding during inverse dynamic modeling. By utilizing motion cues in videos for automatic active region discovery, our method eliminates the need for manual annotations of active regions. We validate ARDuP's efficacy via extensive experiments on simulator CLIPort and the real-world dataset BridgeData v2, achieving notable improvements in success rates and generating convincingly realistic video plans.</li>

In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method to contextualize a task toward a specific LLM, by (1) observing how a given LLM describes (all or a part of) target datasets, i.e., open-ended zero-shot inference, and (2) aggregating the open-ended inference results by the LLM, and (3) finally incorporate the aggregated meta-information for the actual task. We show the effectiveness of this approach in text clustering tasks, and also highlight the importance of the contextualization through examples of the above procedure.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Depth information serves as a crucial prerequisite for various visual tasks, whether on land or underwater. Recently, self-supervised methods have achieved remarkable performance on several terrestrial benchmarks despite the absence of depth annotations. However, in more challenging underwater scenarios, they encounter numerous brand-new obstacles such as the influence of marine life and degradation of underwater images, which break the assumption of a static scene and bring low-quality images, respectively. Besides, the camera angles of underwater images are more diverse. Fortunately, we have discovered that knowledge distillation presents a promising approach for tackling these challenges. In this paper, we propose WaterMono, a novel framework for depth estimation coupled with image enhancement. It incorporates the following key measures: (1) We present a Teacher-Guided Anomaly Mask to identify dynamic regions within the images; (2) We employ depth information combined with the Underwater Image Formation Model to generate enhanced images, which in turn contribute to the depth estimation task; and (3) We utilize a rotated distillation strategy to enhance the model's rotational robustness. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method for both depth estimation and image enhancement.

In this paper, we utilize the capability of Whisper encoder and pre-trained Yi-6B. Empirical results reveal that modal alignment can be achieved with one layer module and hundred hours of speech-text multitask corpus. We further swap the Yi-6B with human preferences aligned version of Yi-6B-Chat during inference, and discover that the alignment capability is applicable as well. In addition, the alignment subspace revealed by singular value decomposition(SVD) also implies linear alignment subspace is sparse, which leaves the possibility to concatenate other features like voice-print or video to expand modality.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent works have demonstrated the potential of Graph Neural Networks (GNN) for network intrusion detection. Despite their advantages, a significant gap persists between real-world scenarios, where detection speed is critical, and existing proposals, which operate on large graphs representing several hours of traffic. This gap results in unrealistic operational conditions and impractical detection delays. Moreover, existing models do not generalize well across different networks, hampering their deployment in production environments. To address these issues, we introduce PPTGNN, a practical spatio-temporal GNN for intrusion detection. PPTGNN enables near real-time predictions, while better capturing the spatio-temporal dynamics of network attacks. PPTGNN employs self-supervised pre-training for improved performance and reduced dependency on labeled data. We evaluate PPTGNN on three public datasets and show that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models, such as E-ResGAT and E-GraphSAGE, with an average accuracy improvement of 10.38%. Finally, we show that a pre-trained PPTGNN can easily be fine-tuned to unseen networks with minimal labeled examples. This highlights the potential of PPTGNN as a general, large-scale pre-trained model that can effectively operate in diverse network environments.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recently, Depth Anything Model (DAM) - a type of depth foundation model - reveals impressive zero-shot capacity for diverse perspective images. Despite its success, it remains an open question regarding DAM's performance on 360 images that enjoy a large field-of-view (180x360) but suffer from spherical distortions. To this end, we establish, to our knowledge, the first benchmark that aims to 1) evaluate the performance of DAM on 360 images and 2) develop a powerful 360 DAM for the benefit of the community. For this, we conduct a large suite of experiments that consider the key properties of 360 images, e.g., different 360 representations, various spatial transformations, and diverse indoor and outdoor scenes. This way, our benchmark unveils some key findings, e.g., DAM is less effective for diverse 360 scenes and sensitive to spatial transformations. To address these challenges, we first collect a large-scale unlabeled dataset including diverse indoor and outdoor scenes. We then propose a semi-supervised learning (SSL) framework to learn a 360 DAM, dubbed Any360D. Under the umbrella of SSL, Any360D first learns a teacher model by fine-tuning DAM via metric depth supervision. Then, we train the student model by uncovering the potential of large-scale unlabeled data with pseudo labels from the teacher model. Möbius transformation-based spatial augmentation (MTSA) is proposed to impose consistency regularization between the unlabeled data and spatially transformed ones. This subtly improves the student model's robustness to various spatial transformations even under severe distortions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Any360D outperforms DAM and many prior data-specific models, e.g., PanoFormer, across diverse scenes, showing impressive zero-shot capacity for being a 360 depth foundation model.</li>

          Style-NeRF2NeRF: 3D Style Transfer From Style-Aligned Multi-View Images(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose a simple yet effective pipeline for stylizing a 3D scene, harnessing the power of 2D image diffusion models. Given a NeRF model reconstructed from a set of multi-view images, we perform 3D style transfer by refining the source NeRF model using stylized images generated by a style-aligned image-to-image diffusion model. Given a target style prompt, we first generate perceptually similar multi-view images by leveraging a depth-conditioned diffusion model with an attention-sharing mechanism. Next, based on the stylized multi-view images, we propose to guide the style transfer process with the sliced Wasserstein loss based on the feature maps extracted from a pre-trained CNN model. Our pipeline consists of decoupled steps, allowing users to test various prompt ideas and preview the stylized 3D result before proceeding to the NeRF fine-tuning stage. We demonstrate that our method can transfer diverse artistic styles to real-world 3D scenes with competitive quality.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Most existing multi-hop datasets are extractive answer datasets, where the answers to the questions can be extracted directly from the provided context. This often leads models to use heuristics or shortcuts instead of performing true multi-hop reasoning. In this paper, we propose a new multi-hop dataset, MoreHopQA, which shifts from extractive to generative answers. Our dataset is created by utilizing three existing multi-hop datasets: HotpotQA, 2WikiMultihopQA, and MuSiQue. Instead of relying solely on factual reasoning, we enhance the existing multi-hop questions by adding another layer of questioning that involves one, two, or all three of the following types of reasoning: commonsense, arithmetic, and symbolic. Our dataset is created through a semi-automated process, resulting in a dataset with 1,118 samples that have undergone human verification. We then use our dataset to evaluate five different large language models: Mistral 7B, Gemma 7B, Llama 3 (8B and 70B), and GPT-4. We also design various cases to analyze the reasoning steps in the question-answering process. Our results show that models perform well on initial multi-hop questions but struggle with our extended questions, indicating that our dataset is more challenging than previous ones. Our analysis of question decomposition reveals that although models can correctly answer questions, only a portion - 38.7% for GPT-4 and 33.4% for Llama3-70B - achieve perfect reasoning, where all corresponding sub-questions are answered correctly.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recently, there has been increasing interest in multimodal applications that integrate text with other modalities, such as images, audio and video, to facilitate natural language interactions with multimodal AI systems. While applications involving standard modalities have been extensively explored, there is still a lack of investigation into specific data modalities such as remote sensing (RS) data. Despite the numerous potential applications of RS data, including environmental protection, disaster monitoring and land planning, available solutions are predominantly focused on specific tasks like classification, captioning and retrieval. These solutions often overlook the unique characteristics of RS data, such as its capability to systematically provide information on the same geographical areas over time. This ability enables continuous monitoring of changes in the underlying landscape. To address this gap, we propose a novel foundation model for bi-temporal RS image pairs, in the context of change detection analysis, leveraging Contrastive Learning and the LEVIR-CC dataset for both captioning and text-image retrieval. By jointly training a contrastive encoder and captioning decoder, our model add text-image retrieval capabilities, in the context of bi-temporal change detection, while maintaining captioning performances that are comparable to the state of the art.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Neural processes (NPs) are a powerful family of meta-learning models that seek to approximate the posterior predictive map of the ground-truth stochastic process from which each dataset in a meta-dataset is sampled. There are many cases in which practitioners, besides having access to the dataset of interest, may also have access to other datasets that share similarities with it. In this case, integrating these datasets into the NP can improve predictions. We equip NPs with this functionality and describe this paradigm as in-context in-context learning. Standard NP architectures, such as the convolutional conditional NP (ConvCNP) or the family of transformer neural processes (TNPs), are not capable of in-context in-context learning, as they are only able to condition on a single dataset. We address this shortcoming by developing the in-context in-context learning pseudo-token TNP (ICICL-TNP). The ICICL-TNP builds on the family of PT-TNPs, which utilise pseudo-token-based transformer architectures to sidestep the quadratic computational complexity associated with regular transformer architectures. Importantly, the ICICL-TNP is capable of conditioning on both sets of datapoints and sets of datasets, enabling it to perform in-context in-context learning. We demonstrate the importance of in-context in-context learning and the effectiveness of the ICICL-TNP in a number of experiments.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The blooming of virtual reality and augmented reality (VR/AR) technologies has driven an increasing demand for the creation of high-quality, immersive, and dynamic environments. However, existing generative techniques either focus solely on dynamic objects or perform outpainting from a single perspective image, failing to meet the needs of VR/AR applications. In this work, we tackle the challenging task of elevating a single panorama to an immersive 4D experience. For the first time, we demonstrate the capability to generate omnidirectional dynamic scenes with 360-degree views at 4K resolution, thereby providing an immersive user experience. Our method introduces a pipeline that facilitates natural scene animations and optimizes a set of 4D Gaussians using efficient splatting techniques for real-time exploration. To overcome the lack of scene-scale annotated 4D data and models, especially in panoramic formats, we propose a novel Panoramic Denoiser that adapts generic 2D diffusion priors to animate consistently in 360-degree images, transforming them into panoramic videos with dynamic scenes at targeted regions. Subsequently, we elevate the panoramic video into a 4D immersive environment while preserving spatial and temporal consistency. By transferring prior knowledge from 2D models in the perspective domain to the panoramic domain and the 4D lifting with spatial appearance and geometry regularization, we achieve high-quality Panorama-to-4D generation at a resolution of (4096 $\times$ 2048) for the first time.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Histopathology can help clinicians make accurate diagnoses, determine disease prognosis, and plan appropriate treatment strategies. As deep learning techniques prove successful in the medical domain, the primary challenges become limited data availability and concerns about data sharing and privacy. Federated learning has addressed this challenge by training models locally and updating parameters on a server. However, issues, such as domain shift and bias, persist and impact overall performance. Dataset distillation presents an alternative approach to overcoming these challenges. It involves creating a small synthetic dataset that encapsulates essential information, which can be shared without constraints. At present, this paradigm is not practicable as current distillation approaches only generate non human readable representations and exhibit insufficient performance for downstream learning tasks. We train a latent diffusion model and construct a new distilled synthetic dataset with a small number of human readable synthetic images. Selection of maximally informative synthetic images is done via graph community analysis of the representation space. We compare downstream classification models trained on our synthetic distillation data to models trained on real data and reach performances suitable for practical application.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the rising popularity of Transformer-based large language models (LLMs), reducing their high inference costs has become a significant research focus. One effective approach is to compress the long input contexts. Existing methods typically leverage the self-attention mechanism of the LLM itself for context compression. While these methods have achieved notable results, the compression process still involves quadratic time complexity, which limits their applicability. To mitigate this limitation, we propose the In-Context Former (IC-Former). Unlike previous methods, IC-Former does not depend on the target LLMs. Instead, it leverages the cross-attention mechanism and a small number of learnable digest tokens to directly condense information from the contextual word embeddings. This approach significantly reduces inference time, which achieves linear growth in time complexity within the compression range. Experimental results indicate that our method requires only 1/32 of the floating-point operations of the baseline during compression and improves processing speed by 68 to 112 times while achieving over 90% of the baseline performance on evaluation metrics. Overall, our model effectively reduces compression costs and makes real-time compression scenarios feasible.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Downscaling techniques are one of the most prominent applications of Deep Learning (DL) in Earth System Modeling. A robust DL downscaling model can generate high-resolution fields from coarse-scale numerical model simulations, saving the timely and resourceful applications of regional/local models. Additionally, generative DL models have the potential to provide uncertainty information, by generating ensemble-like scenario pools, a task that is computationally prohibitive for traditional numerical simulations. In this study, we apply a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to downscale ERA5 data over Italy up to a resolution of 2 km. The high-resolution target data consists of results from a high-resolution dynamical downscaling performed with COSMO-CLM. Our goal is to demonstrate that recent advancements in generative modeling enable DL-based models to deliver results comparable to those of numerical dynamical downscaling models, given the same input data (i.e., ERA5 data), preserving the realism of fine-scale features and flow characteristics. The training and testing database consists of hourly data from 2000 to 2020. The target variables of this study are 2-m temperature and 10-m horizontal wind components. A selection of predictors from ERA5 is used as input to the LDM, and a residual approach against a reference UNET is leveraged in applying the LDM. The performance of the generative LDM is compared with reference baselines of increasing complexity: quadratic interpolation of ERA5, a UNET, and a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) built on the same reference UNET. Results highlight the improvements introduced by the LDM architecture and the residual approach over these baselines. The models are evaluated on a yearly test dataset, assessing the models' performance through deterministic metrics, spatial distribution of errors, and reconstruction of frequency and power spectra distributions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has shown promising potential to enhance the accuracy and factuality of language models (LMs). However, imperfect retrievers or noisy corpora can introduce misleading or even erroneous information to the retrieved contents, posing a significant challenge to the generation quality. Existing RAG methods typically address this challenge by directly predicting final answers despite potentially noisy inputs, resulting in an implicit denoising process that is difficult to interpret and verify. On the other hand, the acquisition of explicit denoising supervision is often costly, involving significant human efforts. In this work, we propose InstructRAG, where LMs explicitly learn the denoising process through self-synthesized rationales -- First, we instruct the LM to explain how the ground-truth answer is derived from retrieved documents. Then, these rationales can be used either as demonstrations for in-context learning of explicit denoising or as supervised fine-tuning data to train the model. Compared to standard RAG approaches, InstructRAG requires no additional supervision, allows for easier verification of the predicted answers, and effectively improves generation accuracy. Experiments show InstructRAG consistently outperforms existing RAG methods in both training-free and trainable scenarios, achieving a relative improvement of 8.3% over the best baseline method on average across five knowledge-intensive benchmarks. Extensive analysis indicates that InstructRAG scales well with increased numbers of retrieved documents and consistently exhibits robust denoising ability even in out-of-domain datasets, demonstrating strong generalizability.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Despite recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), their performance on tasks involving long contexts remains sub-optimal. In-Context Learning (ICL) with few-shot examples may be an appealing solution to enhance LLM performance in this scenario; However, naively adding ICL examples with long context introduces challenges, including substantial token overhead added for each few-shot example and context mismatch between the demonstrations and the target query. In this work, we propose to automatically generate few-shot examples for long context QA tasks by recycling contexts. Specifically, given a long input context (1-3k tokens) and a query, we generate additional query-output pairs from the given context as few-shot examples, while introducing the context only once. This ensures that the demonstrations are leveraging the same context as the target query while only adding a small number of tokens to the prompt. We further enhance each demonstration by instructing the model to explicitly identify the relevant paragraphs before the answer, which improves performance while providing fine-grained attribution to the answer source. We apply our method on multiple LLMs and obtain substantial improvements on various QA datasets with long context, especially when the answer lies within the middle of the context. Surprisingly, despite introducing only single-hop ICL examples, LLMs also successfully generalize to multi-hop long-context QA using our approach.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) treat sampling from distributions over compositional discrete spaces as a sequential decision-making problem, training a stochastic policy to construct objects step by step. Recent studies have revealed strong connections between GFlowNets and entropy-regularized reinforcement learning. Building on these insights, we propose to enhance planning capabilities of GFlowNets by applying Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Specifically, we show how the MENTS algorithm (Xiao et al., 2019) can be adapted for GFlowNets and used during both training and inference. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach improves the sample efficiency of GFlowNet training and the generation fidelity of pre-trained GFlowNet models.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative models of language exhibit impressive capabilities but still place non-negligible probability mass over undesirable outputs. In this work, we address the task of updating a model to avoid unwanted outputs while minimally changing model behavior otherwise, a challenge we refer to as a minimal targeted update. We first formalize the notion of a minimal targeted update and propose a method to achieve such updates using negative examples from a model's generations. Our proposed Targeted Negative Training (TNT) results in updates that keep the new distribution close to the original, unlike existing losses for negative signal which push down probability but do not control what the updated distribution will be. In experiments, we demonstrate that TNT yields a better trade-off between reducing unwanted behavior and maintaining model generation behavior than baselines, paving the way towards a modeling paradigm based on iterative training updates that constrain models from generating undesirable outputs while preserving their impressive capabilities.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Journalists are among the many users of large language models (LLMs). To better understand the journalist-AI interactions, we conduct a study of LLM usage by two news agencies through browsing the WildChat dataset, identifying candidate interactions, and verifying them by matching to online published articles. Our analysis uncovers instances where journalists provide sensitive material such as confidential correspondence with sources or articles from other agencies to the LLM as stimuli and prompt it to generate articles, and publish these machine-generated articles with limited intervention (median output-publication ROUGE-L of 0.62). Based on our findings, we call for further research into what constitutes responsible use of AI, and the establishment of clear guidelines and best practices on using LLMs in a journalistic context.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have been observed to perform well on a wide range of downstream tasks when fine-tuned on domain-specific data. However, such data may not be readily available in many applications, motivating zero-shot or few-shot approaches using domain-adjacent models. While several fine-tuned models for various tasks are available, finding an appropriate domain-adjacent model for a given task is often not straight forward. In this paper, we study DAFT-E, a framework that utilizes an Ensemble of Domain-Adjacent Fine-Tuned Foundation Models for few-shot problems. We show that for zero-shot problems, this ensembling method provides an accuracy performance close to that of the single best model. With few-shot problems, this performance improves further, at which point DEFT-E can outperform any single domain-adjacent model while requiring much less data for domain-specific fine-tuning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Sliced Wasserstein (SW) distance in Optimal Transport (OT) is widely used in various applications thanks to its statistical effectiveness and computational efficiency. On the other hand, Tree Wassenstein (TW) and Tree-sliced Wassenstein (TSW) are instances of OT for probability measures where its ground cost is a tree metric. TSW also has a low computational complexity, i.e. linear to the number of edges in the tree. Especially, TSW is identical to SW when the tree is a chain. While SW is prone to loss of topological information of input measures due to relying on one-dimensional projection, TSW is more flexible and has a higher degree of freedom by choosing a tree rather than a line to alleviate the curse of dimensionality in SW. However, for practical applications, popular tree metric sampling methods are heavily built upon given supports, which limits their capacity to adapt to new supports. In this paper, we propose the Tree-Sliced Wasserstein distance on a System of Lines (TSW-SL), which brings a connection between SW and TSW. Compared to SW and TSW, our TSW-SL benefits from the higher degree of freedom of TSW while being suitable to dynamic settings as SW. In TSW-SL, we use a variant of the Radon Transform to project measures onto a system of lines, resulting in measures on a space with a tree metric, then leverage TW to efficiently compute distances between them. We empirically verify the advantages of TSW-SL over the traditional SW by conducting a variety of experiments on gradient flows, image style transfer, and generative models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Understanding the semantics of visual scenes is a fundamental challenge in Computer Vision. A key aspect of this challenge is that objects sharing similar semantic meanings or functions can exhibit striking visual differences, making accurate identification and categorization difficult. Recent advancements in text-to-image frameworks have led to models that implicitly capture natural scene statistics. These frameworks account for the visual variability of objects, as well as complex object co-occurrences and sources of noise such as diverse lighting conditions. By leveraging large-scale datasets and cross-attention conditioning, these models generate detailed and contextually rich scene representations. This capability opens new avenues for improving object recognition and scene understanding in varied and challenging environments. Our work presents StableSemantics, a dataset comprising 224 thousand human-curated prompts, processed natural language captions, over 2 million synthetic images, and 10 million attention maps corresponding to individual noun chunks. We explicitly leverage human-generated prompts that correspond to visually interesting stable diffusion generations, provide 10 generations per phrase, and extract cross-attention maps for each image. We explore the semantic distribution of generated images, examine the distribution of objects within images, and benchmark captioning and open vocabulary segmentation methods on our data. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to release a diffusion dataset with semantic attributions. We expect our proposed dataset to catalyze advances in visual semantic understanding and provide a foundation for developing more sophisticated and effective visual models.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While text-to-visual models now produce photo-realistic images and videos, they struggle with compositional text prompts involving attributes, relationships, and higher-order reasoning such as logic and comparison. In this work, we conduct an extensive human study on GenAI-Bench to evaluate the performance of leading image and video generation models in various aspects of compositional text-to-visual generation. We also compare automated evaluation metrics against our collected human ratings and find that VQAScore -- a metric measuring the likelihood that a VQA model views an image as accurately depicting the prompt -- significantly outperforms previous metrics such as CLIPScore. In addition, VQAScore can improve generation in a black-box manner (without finetuning) via simply ranking a few (3 to 9) candidate images. Ranking by VQAScore is 2x to 3x more effective than other scoring methods like PickScore, HPSv2, and ImageReward at improving human alignment ratings for DALL-E 3 and Stable Diffusion, especially on compositional prompts that require advanced visio-linguistic reasoning. We will release a new GenAI-Rank benchmark with over 40,000 human ratings to evaluate scoring metrics on ranking images generated from the same prompt. Lastly, we discuss promising areas for improvement in VQAScore, such as addressing fine-grained visual details. We will release all human ratings (over 80,000) to facilitate scientific benchmarking of both generative models and automated metrics.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>AI personal assistants deployed via robots or wearables require embodied understanding to collaborate with humans effectively. However, current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) primarily focus on third-person view videos, neglecting the richness of egocentric perceptual experience. To address this gap, we propose three key contributions. First, we introduce the Egocentric Video Understanding Dataset (EVUD) for training VLMs on video captioning and question answering tasks specific to egocentric videos. Second, we present AlanaVLM, a 7B parameter VLM trained using parameter-efficient methods on EVUD. Finally, we evaluate AlanaVLM's capabilities on OpenEQA, a challenging benchmark for embodied video question answering. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming open-source models including strong Socratic models using GPT-4 as a planner by 3.6%. Additionally, we outperform Claude 3 and Gemini Pro Vision 1.0 and showcase competitive results compared to Gemini Pro 1.5 and GPT-4V, even surpassing the latter in spatial reasoning. This research paves the way for building efficient VLMs that can be deployed in robots or wearables, leveraging embodied video understanding to collaborate seamlessly with humans in everyday tasks, contributing to the next generation of Embodied AI</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Face recognition systems are increasingly used in biometric security for convenience and effectiveness. However, they remain vulnerable to spoofing attacks, where attackers use photos, videos, or masks to impersonate legitimate users. This research addresses these vulnerabilities by exploring the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, fine-tuned with the DINO framework. The DINO framework facilitates self-supervised learning, enabling the model to learn distinguishing features from unlabeled data. We compared the performance of the proposed fine-tuned ViT model using the DINO framework against a traditional CNN model, EfficientNet b2, on the face anti-spoofing task. Numerous tests on standard datasets show that the ViT model performs better than the CNN model in terms of accuracy and resistance to different spoofing methods. Additionally, we collected our own dataset from a biometric application to validate our findings further. This study highlights the superior performance of transformer-based architecture in identifying complex spoofing cues, leading to significant advancements in biometric security.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Video representation is a long-standing problem that is crucial for various down-stream tasks, such as tracking,depth prediction,segmentation,view synthesis,and editing. However, current methods either struggle to model complex motions due to the absence of 3D structure or rely on implicit 3D representations that are ill-suited for manipulation tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel explicit 3D representation-video Gaussian representation -- that embeds a video into 3D Gaussians. Our proposed representation models video appearance in a 3D canonical space using explicit Gaussians as proxies and associates each Gaussian with 3D motions for video motion. This approach offers a more intrinsic and explicit representation than layered atlas or volumetric pixel matrices. To obtain such a representation, we distill 2D priors, such as optical flow and depth, from foundation models to regularize learning in this ill-posed setting. Extensive applications demonstrate the versatility of our new video representation. It has been proven effective in numerous video processing tasks, including tracking, consistent video depth and feature refinement, motion and appearance editing, and stereoscopic video generation.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Knowledge tagging for questions plays a crucial role in contemporary intelligent educational applications, including learning progress diagnosis, practice question recommendations, and course content organization. Traditionally, these annotations are always conducted by pedagogical experts, as the task requires not only a strong semantic understanding of both question stems and knowledge definitions but also deep insights into connecting question-solving logic with corresponding knowledge concepts. With the recent emergence of advanced text encoding algorithms, such as pre-trained language models, many researchers have developed automatic knowledge tagging systems based on calculating the semantic similarity between the knowledge and question embeddings. In this paper, we explore automating the task using Large Language Models (LLMs), in response to the inability of prior encoding-based methods to deal with the hard cases which involve strong domain knowledge and complicated concept definitions. By showing the strong performance of zero- and few-shot results over math questions knowledge tagging tasks, we demonstrate LLMs' great potential in conquering the challenges faced by prior methods. Furthermore, by proposing a reinforcement learning-based demonstration retriever, we successfully exploit the great potential of different-sized LLMs in achieving better performance results while keeping the in-context demonstration usage efficiency high.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing. Yet, their predominantly English-centric training has led to biases and performance disparities across languages. This imbalance marginalizes minoritized languages, making equitable access to NLP technologies more difficult for languages with lower resources, such as Galician. We present the first two generative LLMs focused on Galician to bridge this gap. These models, freely available as open-source resources, were trained using a GPT architecture with 1.3B parameters on a corpus of 2.1B words. Leveraging continual pretraining, we adapt to Galician two existing LLMs trained on larger corpora, thus mitigating the data constraints that would arise if the training were performed from scratch. The models were evaluated using human judgments and task-based datasets from standardized benchmarks. These evaluations reveal a promising performance, underscoring the importance of linguistic diversity in generative models.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the realm of digital creativity, our potential to craft intricate 3D worlds from imagination is often hampered by the limitations of existing digital tools, which demand extensive expertise and efforts. To narrow this disparity, we introduce CLAY, a 3D geometry and material generator designed to effortlessly transform human imagination into intricate 3D digital structures. CLAY supports classic text or image inputs as well as 3D-aware controls from diverse primitives (multi-view images, voxels, bounding boxes, point clouds, implicit representations, etc). At its core is a large-scale generative model composed of a multi-resolution Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and a minimalistic latent Diffusion Transformer (DiT), to extract rich 3D priors directly from a diverse range of 3D geometries. Specifically, it adopts neural fields to represent continuous and complete surfaces and uses a geometry generative module with pure transformer blocks in latent space. We present a progressive training scheme to train CLAY on an ultra large 3D model dataset obtained through a carefully designed processing pipeline, resulting in a 3D native geometry generator with 1.5 billion parameters. For appearance generation, CLAY sets out to produce physically-based rendering (PBR) textures by employing a multi-view material diffusion model that can generate 2K resolution textures with diffuse, roughness, and metallic modalities. We demonstrate using CLAY for a range of controllable 3D asset creations, from sketchy conceptual designs to production ready assets with intricate details. Even first time users can easily use CLAY to bring their vivid 3D imaginations to life, unleashing unlimited creativity.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) have enhanced the capacity of vision-language models to caption visual text. This generative approach to image caption enrichment further makes textual captions more descriptive, improving alignment with the visual context. However, while many studies focus on benefits of generative caption enrichment (GCE), are there any negative side effects? We compare standard-format captions and recent GCE processes from the perspectives of "gender bias" and "hallucination", showing that enriched captions suffer from increased gender bias and hallucination. Furthermore, models trained on these enriched captions amplify gender bias by an average of 30.9% and increase hallucination by 59.5%. This study serves as a caution against the trend of making captions more descriptive.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Operator learning problems arise in many key areas of scientific computing where Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are used to model physical systems. In such scenarios, the operators map between Banach or Hilbert spaces. In this work, we tackle the problem of learning operators between Banach spaces, in contrast to the vast majority of past works considering only Hilbert spaces. We focus on learning holomorphic operators - an important class of problems with many applications. We combine arbitrary approximate encoders and decoders with standard feedforward Deep Neural Network (DNN) architectures - specifically, those with constant width exceeding the depth - under standard $\ell^2$-loss minimization. We first identify a family of DNNs such that the resulting Deep Learning (DL) procedure achieves optimal generalization bounds for such operators. For standard fully-connected architectures, we then show that there are uncountably many minimizers of the training problem that yield equivalent optimal performance. The DNN architectures we consider are `problem agnostic', with width and depth only depending on the amount of training data $m$ and not on regularity assumptions of the target operator. Next, we show that DL is optimal for this problem: no recovery procedure can surpass these generalization bounds up to log terms. Finally, we present numerical results demonstrating the practical performance on challenging problems including the parametric diffusion, Navier-Stokes-Brinkman and Boussinesq PDEs.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative models, especially text-to-image diffusion models, have significantly advanced in their ability to generate images, benefiting from enhanced architectures, increased computational power, and large-scale datasets. While the datasets play an important role, their protection has remained as an unsolved issue. Current protection strategies, such as watermarks and membership inference, are either in high poison rate which is detrimental to image quality or suffer from low accuracy and robustness. In this work, we introduce a novel approach, EnTruth, which Enhances Traceability of unauthorized dataset usage utilizing template memorization. By strategically incorporating the template memorization, EnTruth can trigger the specific behavior in unauthorized models as the evidence of infringement. Our method is the first to investigate the positive application of memorization and use it for copyright protection, which turns a curse into a blessing and offers a pioneering perspective for unauthorized usage detection in generative models. Comprehensive experiments are provided to demonstrate its effectiveness in terms of data-alteration rate, accuracy, robustness and generation quality.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Synthesizing electronic health records (EHR) data has become a preferred strategy to address data scarcity, improve data quality, and model fairness in healthcare. However, existing approaches for EHR data generation predominantly rely on state-of-the-art generative techniques like generative adversarial networks, variational autoencoders, and language models. These methods typically replicate input visits, resulting in inadequate modeling of temporal dependencies between visits and overlooking the generation of time information, a crucial element in EHR data. Moreover, their ability to learn visit representations is limited due to simple linear mapping functions, thus compromising generation quality. To address these limitations, we propose a novel EHR data generation model called EHRPD. It is a diffusion-based model designed to predict the next visit based on the current one while also incorporating time interval estimation. To enhance generation quality and diversity, we introduce a novel time-aware visit embedding module and a pioneering predictive denoising diffusion probabilistic model (PDDPM). Additionally, we devise a predictive U-Net (PU-Net) to optimize P-DDPM.We conduct experiments on two public datasets and evaluate EHRPD from fidelity, privacy, and utility perspectives. The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy and utility of the proposed EHRPD in addressing the aforementioned limitations and advancing EHR data generation.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Panoramic X-ray is a simple and effective tool for diagnosing dental diseases in clinical practice. When deep learning models are developed to assist dentist in interpreting panoramic X-rays, most of their performance suffers from the limited annotated data, which requires dentist's expertise and a lot of time cost. Although self-supervised learning (SSL) has been proposed to address this challenge, the two-stage process of pretraining and fine-tuning requires even more training time and computational resources. In this paper, we present a self-supervised auxiliary detection (SSAD) framework, which is plug-and-play and compatible with any detectors. It consists of a reconstruction branch and a detection branch. Both branches are trained simultaneously, sharing the same encoder, without the need for finetuning. The reconstruction branch learns to restore the tooth texture of healthy or diseased teeth, while the detection branch utilizes these learned features for diagnosis. To enhance the encoder's ability to capture fine-grained features, we incorporate the image encoder of SAM to construct a texture consistency (TC) loss, which extracts image embedding from the input and output of reconstruction branch, and then enforces both embedding into the same feature space. Extensive experiments on the public DENTEX dataset through three detection tasks demonstrate that the proposed SSAD framework achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to mainstream object detection methods and SSL methods.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Synthetic data created by differentially private (DP) generative models is increasingly used in real-world settings. In this context, PATE-GAN has emerged as a popular algorithm, combining Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with the private training approach of PATE (Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles). In this paper, we analyze and benchmark six open-source PATE-GAN implementations, including three by (a subset of) the original authors. First, we shed light on architecture deviations and empirically demonstrate that none replicate the utility performance reported in the original paper. Then, we present an in-depth privacy evaluation, including DP auditing, showing that all implementations leak more privacy than intended and uncovering 17 privacy violations and 5 other bugs.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Image anomaly detection is a popular research direction, with many methods emerging in recent years due to rapid advancements in computing. The use of artificial intelligence for image anomaly detection has been widely studied. By analyzing images of athlete posture and movement, it is possible to predict injury status and suggest necessary adjustments. Most existing methods rely on convolutional networks to extract information from irrelevant pixel data, limiting model accuracy. This paper introduces a network combining Residual Network (ResNet) and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU), which can predict potential injury types and provide early warnings by analyzing changes in muscle and bone poses from video images. To address the high complexity of this network, the Sparrow search algorithm was used for optimization. Experiments conducted on four datasets demonstrated that our model has the smallest error in image anomaly detection compared to other models, showing strong adaptability. This provides a new approach for anomaly detection and predictive analysis in images, contributing to the sustainable development of human health and performance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In $1998,$ Daemen {\it{ et al.}} introduced a circulant Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) matrix in the diffusion layer of the Rijndael block cipher, drawing significant attention to circulant MDS matrices. This block cipher is now universally acclaimed as the AES block cipher. In $2016,$ Liu and Sim introduced cyclic matrices by modifying the permutation of circulant matrices and established the existence of MDS property for orthogonal left-circulant matrices, a notable subclass within cyclic matrices. While circulant matrices have been well-studied in the literature, the properties of cyclic matrices are not. Back in $1961$, Friedman introduced $g$-circulant matrices which form a subclass of cyclic matrices. In this article, we first establish a permutation equivalence between a cyclic matrix and a circulant matrix. We explore properties of cyclic matrices similar to $g$-circulant matrices. Additionally, we determine the determinant of $g$-circulant matrices of order $2^d \times 2^d$ and prove that they cannot be simultaneously orthogonal and MDS over a finite field of characteristic $2$. Furthermore, we prove that this result holds for any cyclic matrix.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The emergence of in-context learning (ICL) is potentially attributed to two major abilities: task recognition (TR) for recognizing the task from demonstrations and utilizing pre-trained priors, and task learning (TL) for learning from demonstrations. However, relationships between the two abilities and how such relationships affect the emergence of ICL is unclear. In this paper, we take the first step by examining the pre-training dynamics of the emergence of ICL. With carefully designed metrics, we find that these two abilities are, in fact, competitive during pre-training. Moreover, we observe a strong negative correlation between the competition and ICL performance. Further analysis of common pre-training factors (i.e., model size, dataset size, and data curriculum) demonstrates possible ways to manage the competition. Based on these insights, we propose a simple yet effective method to better integrate these two abilities for ICL at inference time. Through adaptive ensemble learning, the performance of ICL can be significantly boosted, enabling two small models to outperform a larger one with more than twice the parameters.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Enhancing diverse human decision-making processes in an urban environment is a critical issue across various applications, including ride-sharing vehicle dispatching, public transportation management, and autonomous driving. Offline reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising approach to learn and optimize human urban strategies (or policies) from pre-collected human-generated spatial-temporal urban data. However, standard offline RL faces two significant challenges: (1) data scarcity and data heterogeneity, and (2) distributional shift. In this paper, we introduce MODA -- a Multi-Task Offline Reinforcement Learning with Contrastive Data Sharing approach. MODA addresses the challenges of data scarcity and heterogeneity in a multi-task urban setting through Contrastive Data Sharing among tasks. This technique involves extracting latent representations of human behaviors by contrasting positive and negative data pairs. It then shares data presenting similar representations with the target task, facilitating data augmentation for each task. Moreover, MODA develops a novel model-based multi-task offline RL algorithm. This algorithm constructs a robust Markov Decision Process (MDP) by integrating a dynamics model with a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). Once the robust MDP is established, any online RL or planning algorithm can be applied. Extensive experiments conducted in a real-world multi-task urban setting validate the effectiveness of MODA. The results demonstrate that MODA exhibits significant improvements compared to state-of-the-art baselines, showcasing its capability in advancing urban decision-making processes. We also made our code available to the research community.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Self-supervised (SSL) models have shown great performance in various downstream tasks. However, they are typically developed for limited languages, and may encounter new languages in real-world. Developing a SSL model for each new language is costly. Thus, it is vital to figure out how to efficiently adapt existed SSL models to a new language without impairing its original abilities. We propose adaptation methods which integrate LoRA to existed SSL models to extend new language. We also develop preservation strategies which include data combination and re-clustering to retain abilities on existed languages. Applied to mHuBERT, we investigate their effectiveness on speech re-synthesis task. Experiments show that our adaptation methods enable mHuBERT to be applied to a new language (Mandarin) with MOS value increased about 1.6 and the relative value of WER reduced up to 61.72%. Also, our preservation strategies ensure that the performance on both existed and new languages remains intact.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Echocardiography (ECHO) video is widely used for cardiac examination. In clinical, this procedure heavily relies on operator experience, which needs years of training and maybe the assistance of deep learning-based systems for enhanced accuracy and efficiency. However, it is challenging since acquiring sufficient customized data (e.g., abnormal cases) for novice training and deep model development is clinically unrealistic. Hence, controllable ECHO video synthesis is highly desirable. In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion-based framework named HeartBeat towards controllable and high-fidelity ECHO video synthesis. Our highlight is three-fold. First, HeartBeat serves as a unified framework that enables perceiving multimodal conditions simultaneously to guide controllable generation. Second, we factorize the multimodal conditions into local and global ones, with two insertion strategies separately provided fine- and coarse-grained controls in a composable and flexible manner. In this way, users can synthesize ECHO videos that conform to their mental imagery by combining multimodal control signals. Third, we propose to decouple the visual concepts and temporal dynamics learning using a two-stage training scheme for simplifying the model training. One more interesting thing is that HeartBeat can easily generalize to mask-guided cardiac MRI synthesis in a few shots, showcasing its scalability to broader applications. Extensive experiments on two public datasets show the efficacy of the proposed HeartBeat.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is versatile for various applications, but security and privacy concerns with third-party AI vendors hinder its broader adoption in sensitive scenarios. Hence, it is essential for users to validate the AI trustworthiness and ensure the security of data boundaries. In this paper, we present a dye testing system named Dye4AI, which injects crafted trigger data into human-AI dialogue and observes AI responses towards specific prompts to diagnose data flow in AI model evolution. Our dye testing procedure contains 3 stages: trigger generation, trigger insertion, and trigger retrieval. First, to retain both uniqueness and stealthiness, we design a new trigger that transforms a pseudo-random number to a intelligible format. Second, with a custom-designed three-step conversation strategy, we insert each trigger item into dialogue and confirm the model memorizes the new trigger knowledge in the current session. Finally, we routinely try to recover triggers with specific prompts in new sessions, as triggers can present in new sessions only if AI vendors leverage user data for model fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on six LLMs demonstrate our dye testing scheme is effective in ensuring the data boundary, even for models with various architectures and parameter sizes. Also, larger and premier models tend to be more suitable for Dye4AI, e.g., trigger can be retrieved in OpenLLaMa-13B even with only 2 insertions per trigger item. Moreover, we analyze the prompt selection in dye testing, providing insights for future testing systems on generative AI services.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recently, advancements in video synthesis have attracted significant attention. Video synthesis models such as AnimateDiff and Stable Video Diffusion have demonstrated the practical applicability of diffusion models in creating dynamic visual content. The emergence of SORA has further spotlighted the potential of video generation technologies. Nonetheless, the extension of video lengths has been constrained by the limitations in computational resources. Most existing video synthesis models can only generate short video clips. In this paper, we propose a novel post-tuning methodology for video synthesis models, called ExVideo. This approach is designed to enhance the capability of current video synthesis models, allowing them to produce content over extended temporal durations while incurring lower training expenditures. In particular, we design extension strategies across common temporal model architectures respectively, including 3D convolution, temporal attention, and positional embedding. To evaluate the efficacy of our proposed post-tuning approach, we conduct extension training on the Stable Video Diffusion model. Our approach augments the model's capacity to generate up to $5\times$ its original number of frames, requiring only 1.5k GPU hours of training on a dataset comprising 40k videos. Importantly, the substantial increase in video length doesn't compromise the model's innate generalization capabilities, and the model showcases its advantages in generating videos of diverse styles and resolutions. We will release the source code and the enhanced model publicly.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Biological sequences encode fundamental instructions for the building blocks of life, in the form of DNA, RNA, and proteins. Modeling these sequences is key to understand disease mechanisms and is an active research area in computational biology. Recently, Large Language Models have shown great promise in solving certain biological tasks but current approaches are limited to a single sequence modality (DNA, RNA, or protein). Key problems in genomics intrinsically involve multiple modalities, but it remains unclear how to adapt general-purpose sequence models to those cases. In this work we propose a multi-modal model that connects DNA, RNA, and proteins by leveraging information from different pre-trained modality-specific encoders. We demonstrate its capabilities by applying it to the largely unsolved problem of predicting how multiple RNA transcript isoforms originate from the same gene (i.e. same DNA sequence) and map to different transcription expression levels across various human tissues. We show that our model, dubbed IsoFormer, is able to accurately predict differential transcript expression, outperforming existing methods and leveraging the use of multiple modalities. Our framework also achieves efficient transfer knowledge from the encoders pre-training as well as in between modalities. We open-source our model, paving the way for new multi-modal gene expression approaches.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative models reliant on sequential autoregression have been at the forefront of language generation for an extensive period, particularly following the introduction of widely acclaimed transformers. Despite its excellent performance, there are always some issues that we face today. For example, problems such as hallucinations and getting trapped in a logic loop may occur. To enhance the performance of existing systems, this paper introduces a new method for generating sequences in natural language, which involves generating the targeted sentence in a tree-traversing order. The paper includes an illustration of the theoretical basis and validity of the approach, as well as a comparison of its fundamentals with the diffusion model in graphic generation. Finally, a module called SenTree is introduced for generating an approximating binary tree. It is already available at this https URL. Additionally, a joint training framework based on this approach is proposed, incorporating the intrinsics of generative adversarial networks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The emergence of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) marks significant strides towards achieving general artificial intelligence. However, these advancements are tempered by the outputs that often reflect biases, a concern not yet extensively investigated. Existing benchmarks are not sufficiently comprehensive in evaluating biases due to their limited data scale, single questioning format and narrow sources of bias. To address this problem, we introduce VLBiasBench, a benchmark aimed at evaluating biases in LVLMs comprehensively. In VLBiasBench, we construct a dataset encompassing nine distinct categories of social biases, including age, disability status, gender, nationality, physical appearance, race, religion, profession, social economic status and two intersectional bias categories (race x gender, and race x social economic status). To create a large-scale dataset, we use Stable Diffusion XL model to generate 46,848 high-quality images, which are combined with different questions to form 128,342 samples. These questions are categorized into open and close ended types, fully considering the sources of bias and comprehensively evaluating the biases of LVLM from multiple perspectives. We subsequently conduct extensive evaluations on 15 open-source models as well as one advanced closed-source model, providing some new insights into the biases revealing from these models. Our benchmark is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Single-view depth estimation refers to the ability to derive three-dimensional information per pixel from a single two-dimensional image. Single-view depth estimation is an ill-posed problem because there are multiple depth solutions that explain 3D geometry from a single view. While deep neural networks have been shown to be effective at capturing depth from a single view, the majority of current methodologies are deterministic in nature. Accounting for uncertainty in the predictions can avoid disastrous consequences when applied to fields such as autonomous driving or medical robotics. We have addressed this problem by quantifying the uncertainty of supervised single-view depth for Bayesian deep neural networks. There are scenarios, especially in medicine in the case of endoscopic images, where such annotated data is not available. To alleviate the lack of data, we present a method that improves the transition from synthetic to real domain methods. We introduce an uncertainty-aware teacher-student architecture that is trained in a self-supervised manner, taking into account the teacher uncertainty. Given the vast amount of unannotated data and the challenges associated with capturing annotated depth in medical minimally invasive procedures, we advocate a fully self-supervised approach that only requires RGB images and the geometric and photometric calibration of the endoscope. In endoscopic imaging, the camera and light sources are co-located at a small distance from the target surfaces. This setup indicates that brighter areas of the image are nearer to the camera, while darker areas are further away. Building on this observation, we exploit the fact that for any given albedo and surface orientation, pixel brightness is inversely proportional to the square of the distance. We propose the use of illumination as a strong single-view self-supervisory signal for deep neural networks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Warning: this paper contains model outputs exhibiting unethical information. Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant breakthroughs, but their generated unethical content poses potential risks. Measuring value alignment of LLMs becomes crucial for their regulation and responsible deployment. Numerous datasets have been constructed to assess social bias, toxicity, and ethics in LLMs, but they suffer from evaluation chronoeffect, that is, as models rapidly evolve, existing data becomes leaked or undemanding, overestimating ever-developing LLMs. To tackle this problem, we propose GETA, a novel generative evolving testing approach that dynamically probes the underlying moral baselines of LLMs. Distinct from previous adaptive testing methods that rely on static datasets with limited difficulty, GETA incorporates an iteratively-updated item generator which infers each LLM's moral boundaries and generates difficulty-tailored testing items, accurately reflecting the true alignment extent. This process theoretically learns a joint distribution of item and model response, with item difficulty and value conformity as latent variables, where the generator co-evolves with the LLM, addressing chronoeffect. We evaluate various popular LLMs with diverse capabilities and demonstrate that GETA can create difficulty-matching testing items and more accurately assess LLMs' values, better consistent with their performance on unseen OOD and i.i.d. items, laying the groundwork for future evaluation paradigms.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With rich temporal-spatial information, video-based person re-identification methods have shown broad prospects. Although tracklets can be easily obtained with ready-made tracking models, annotating identities is still expensive and impractical. Therefore, some video-based methods propose using only a few identity annotations or camera labels to facilitate feature learning. They also simply average the frame features of each tracklet, overlooking unexpected variations and inherent identity consistency within tracklets. In this paper, we propose the Self-Supervised Refined Clustering (SSR-C) framework without relying on any annotation or auxiliary information to promote unsupervised video person re-identification. Specifically, we first propose the Noise-Filtered Tracklet Partition (NFTP) module to reduce the feature bias of tracklets caused by noisy tracking results, and sequentially partition the noise-filtered tracklets into "sub-tracklets". Then, we cluster and further merge sub-tracklets using the self-supervised signal from tracklet partition, which is enhanced through a progressive strategy to generate reliable pseudo labels, facilitating intra-class cross-tracklet aggregation. Moreover, we propose the Class Smoothing Classification (CSC) loss to efficiently promote model learning. Extensive experiments on the MARS and DukeMTMC-VideoReID datasets demonstrate that our proposed SSR-C for unsupervised video person re-identification achieves state-of-the-art results and is comparable to advanced supervised methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present FairX, an open-source Python-based benchmarking tool designed for the comprehensive analysis of models under the umbrella of fairness, utility, and eXplainability (XAI). FairX enables users to train benchmarking bias-removal models and evaluate their fairness using a wide array of fairness metrics, data utility metrics, and generate explanations for model predictions, all within a unified framework. Existing benchmarking tools do not have the way to evaluate synthetic data generated from fair generative models, also they do not have the support for training fair generative models either. In FairX, we add fair generative models in the collection of our fair-model library (pre-processing, in-processing, post-processing) and evaluation metrics for evaluating the quality of synthetic fair data. This version of FairX supports both tabular and image datasets. It also allows users to provide their own custom datasets. The open-source FairX benchmarking package is publicly available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Despite their success, Large-Language Models (LLMs) still face criticism as their lack of interpretability limits their controllability and reliability. Traditional post-hoc interpretation methods, based on attention and gradient-based analysis, offer limited insight into the model's decision-making processes. In the image field, Concept-based models have emerged as explainable-by-design architectures, employing human-interpretable features as intermediate representations. However, these methods have not been yet adapted to textual data, mainly because they require expensive concept annotations, which are impractical for real-world text data. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a self-supervised Interpretable Concept Embedding Models (ICEMs). We leverage the generalization abilities of LLMs to predict the concepts labels in a self-supervised way, while we deliver the final predictions with an interpretable function. The results of our experiments show that ICEMs can be trained in a self-supervised way achieving similar performance to fully supervised concept-based models and end-to-end black-box ones. Additionally, we show that our models are (i) interpretable, offering meaningful logical explanations for their predictions; (ii) interactable, allowing humans to modify intermediate predictions through concept interventions; and (iii) controllable, guiding the LLMs' decoding process to follow a required decision-making path.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Navigating historical narratives poses a challenge in unveiling the spatial intricacies of past landscapes. The proposed work addresses this challenge within the context of the English Lake District, employing the Corpus of the Lake District Writing. The method utilizes a generative pre-trained transformer model to extract spatial relations from the textual descriptions in the corpus. The study applies this large language model to understand the spatial dimensions inherent in historical narratives comprehensively. The outcomes are presented as semantic triples, capturing the nuanced connections between entities and locations, and visualized as a network, offering a graphical representation of the spatial narrative. The study contributes to a deeper comprehension of the English Lake District's spatial tapestry and provides an approach to uncovering spatial relations within diverse historical contexts.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Subsampling is commonly used to mitigate costs associated with data acquisition, such as time or energy requirements, motivating the development of algorithms for estimating the fully-sampled signal of interest $x$ from partially observed measurements $y$. In maximum-entropy sampling, one selects measurement locations that are expected to have the highest entropy, so as to minimize uncertainty about $x$. This approach relies on an accurate model of the posterior distribution over future measurements, given the measurements observed so far. Recently, diffusion models have been shown to produce high-quality posterior samples of high-dimensional signals using guided diffusion. In this work, we propose Active Diffusion Subsampling (ADS), a method for performing active subsampling using guided diffusion in which the model tracks a distribution of beliefs over the true state of $x$ throughout the reverse diffusion process, progressively decreasing its uncertainty by choosing to acquire measurements with maximum expected entropy, and ultimately generating the posterior distribution $p(x | y)$. ADS can be applied using pre-trained diffusion models for any subsampling rate, and does not require task-specific retraining - just the specification of a measurement model. Furthermore, the maximum entropy sampling policy employed by ADS is interpretable, enhancing transparency relative to existing methods using black-box policies. Experimentally, we show that ADS outperforms fixed sampling strategies, and study an application of ADS in Magnetic Resonance Imaging acceleration using the fastMRI dataset, finding that ADS performs competitively with supervised methods.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The application of deep learning in visual anomaly detection has gained widespread popularity due to its potential use in quality control and manufacturing. Current standard methods are Unsupervised, where a clean dataset is utilised to detect deviations and flag anomalies during testing. However, incorporating a few samples when the type of anomalies is known beforehand can significantly enhance performance. Thus, we propose ATAC-Net, a framework that trains to detect anomalies from a minimal set of known prior anomalies. Furthermore, we introduce attention-guided cropping, which provides a closer view of suspect regions during the training phase. Our framework is a reliable and easy-to-understand system for detecting anomalies, and we substantiate its superiority to some of the current state-of-the-art techniques in a comparable setting.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the landscape of generative artificial intelligence, diffusion-based models have emerged as a promising method for generating synthetic images. However, the application of diffusion models poses numerous challenges, particularly concerning data availability, computational requirements, and privacy. Traditional approaches to address these shortcomings, like federated learning, often impose significant computational burdens on individual clients, especially those with constrained resources. In response to these challenges, we introduce a novel approach for distributed collaborative diffusion models inspired by split learning. Our approach facilitates collaborative training of diffusion models while alleviating client computational burdens during image synthesis. This reduced computational burden is achieved by retaining data and computationally inexpensive processes locally at each client while outsourcing the computationally expensive processes to shared, more efficient server resources. Through experiments on the common CelebA dataset, our approach demonstrates enhanced privacy by reducing the necessity for sharing raw data. These capabilities hold significant potential across various application areas, including the design of edge computing solutions. Thus, our work advances distributed machine learning by contributing to the evolution of collaborative diffusion models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Stochastic video generation is particularly challenging when the camera is mounted on a moving platform, as camera motion interacts with observed image pixels, creating complex spatio-temporal dynamics and making the problem partially observable. Existing methods typically address this by focusing on raw pixel-level image reconstruction without explicitly modelling camera motion dynamics. We propose a solution by considering camera motion or action as part of the observed image state, modelling both image and action within a multi-modal learning framework. We introduce three models: Video Generation with Learning Action Prior (VG-LeAP) treats the image-action pair as an augmented state generated from a single latent stochastic process and uses variational inference to learn the image-action latent prior; Causal-LeAP, which establishes a causal relationship between action and the observed image frame at time $t$, learning an action prior conditioned on the observed image states; and RAFI, which integrates the augmented image-action state concept into flow matching with diffusion generative processes, demonstrating that this action-conditioned image generation concept can be extended to other diffusion-based models. We emphasize the importance of multi-modal training in partially observable video generation problems through detailed empirical studies on our new video action dataset, RoAM.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This work addresses the problem of Social Activity Recognition (SAR), a critical component in real-world tasks like surveillance and assistive robotics. Unlike traditional event understanding approaches, SAR necessitates modeling individual actors' appearance and motions and contextualizing them within their social interactions. Traditional action localization methods fall short due to their single-actor, single-action assumption. Previous SAR research has relied heavily on densely annotated data, but privacy concerns limit their applicability in real-world settings. In this work, we propose a self-supervised approach based on multi-actor predictive learning for SAR in streaming videos. Using a visual-semantic graph structure, we model social interactions, enabling relational reasoning for robust performance with minimal labeled data. The proposed framework achieves competitive performance on standard group activity recognition benchmarks. Evaluation on three publicly available action localization benchmarks demonstrates its generalizability to arbitrary action localization.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This position paper proposes a data-centric viewpoint of AI research, focusing on large language models (LLMs). We start by making the key observation that data is instrumental in the developmental (e.g., pretraining and fine-tuning) and inferential stages (e.g., in-context learning) of LLMs, and yet it receives disproportionally low attention from the research community. We identify four specific scenarios centered around data, covering data-centric benchmarks and data curation, data attribution, knowledge transfer, and inference contextualization. In each scenario, we underscore the importance of data, highlight promising research directions, and articulate the potential impacts on the research community and, where applicable, the society as a whole. For instance, we advocate for a suite of data-centric benchmarks tailored to the scale and complexity of data for LLMs. These benchmarks can be used to develop new data curation methods and document research efforts and results, which can help promote openness and transparency in AI and LLM research.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>To mitigate the risk of harmful outputs from large vision models (LVMs), we introduce the SafeSora dataset to promote research on aligning text-to-video generation with human values. This dataset encompasses human preferences in text-to-video generation tasks along two primary dimensions: helpfulness and harmlessness. To capture in-depth human preferences and facilitate structured reasoning by crowdworkers, we subdivide helpfulness into 4 sub-dimensions and harmlessness into 12 sub-categories, serving as the basis for pilot annotations. The SafeSora dataset includes 14,711 unique prompts, 57,333 unique videos generated by 4 distinct LVMs, and 51,691 pairs of preference annotations labeled by humans. We further demonstrate the utility of the SafeSora dataset through several applications, including training the text-video moderation model and aligning LVMs with human preference by fine-tuning a prompt augmentation module or the diffusion model. These applications highlight its potential as the foundation for text-to-video alignment research, such as human preference modeling and the development and validation of alignment algorithms.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Radiology report summarization (RRS) is crucial for patient care, requiring concise "Impressions" from detailed "Findings." This paper introduces a novel prompting strategy to enhance RRS by first generating a layperson summary. This approach normalizes key observations and simplifies complex information using non-expert communication techniques inspired by doctor-patient interactions. Combined with few-shot in-context learning, this method improves the model's ability to link general terms to specific findings. We evaluate this approach on the MIMIC-CXR, CheXpert, and MIMIC-III datasets, benchmarking it against 7B/8B parameter state-of-the-art open-source large language models (LLMs) like Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct. Our results demonstrate improvements in summarization accuracy and accessibility, particularly in out-of-domain tests, with improvements as high as 5% for some metrics.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion-based generative models have recently shown remarkable image and video editing capabilities. However, local video editing, particularly removal of small attributes like glasses, remains a challenge. Existing methods either alter the videos excessively, generate unrealistic artifacts, or fail to perform the requested edit consistently throughout the video. In this work, we focus on consistent and identity-preserving removal of glasses in videos, using it as a case study for consistent local attribute removal in videos. Due to the lack of paired data, we adopt a weakly supervised approach and generate synthetic imperfect data, using an adjusted pretrained diffusion model. We show that despite data imperfection, by learning from our generated data and leveraging the prior of pretrained diffusion models, our model is able to perform the desired edit consistently while preserving the original video content. Furthermore, we exemplify the generalization ability of our method to other local video editing tasks by applying it successfully to facial sticker-removal. Our approach demonstrates significant improvement over existing methods, showcasing the potential of leveraging synthetic data and strong video priors for local video editing tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion distillation represents a highly promising direction for achieving faithful text-to-image generation in a few sampling steps. However, despite recent successes, existing distilled models still do not provide the full spectrum of diffusion abilities, such as real image inversion, which enables many precise image manipulation methods. This work aims to enrich distilled text-to-image diffusion models with the ability to effectively encode real images into their latent space. To this end, we introduce invertible Consistency Distillation (iCD), a generalized consistency distillation framework that facilitates both high-quality image synthesis and accurate image encoding in only 3-4 inference steps. Though the inversion problem for text-to-image diffusion models gets exacerbated by high classifier-free guidance scales, we notice that dynamic guidance significantly reduces reconstruction errors without noticeable degradation in generation performance. As a result, we demonstrate that iCD equipped with dynamic guidance may serve as a highly effective tool for zero-shot text-guided image editing, competing with more expensive state-of-the-art alternatives.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Relational databases are integral to modern information systems, serving as the foundation for storing, querying, and managing data efficiently and effectively. Advancements in large language modeling have led to the emergence of text-to-SQL technologies, significantly enhancing the querying and extracting of information from these databases and raising concerns about privacy and security. Our research extracts the database schema elements underlying a text-to-SQL model. Knowledge of the schema can make attacks such as SQL injection easier. By asking specially crafted questions, we have developed a zero-knowledge framework designed to probe various database schema elements without knowledge of the database itself. The text-to-SQL models then process these questions to produce an output that we use to uncover the structure of the database schema. We apply it to specialized text-to-SQL models fine-tuned on text-SQL pairs and generative language models used for SQL generation. Overall, we can reconstruct the table names with an F1 of nearly .75 for fine-tuned models and .96 for generative.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>One way to address safety risks from large language models (LLMs) is to censor dangerous knowledge from their training data. While this removes the explicit information, implicit information can remain scattered across various training documents. Could an LLM infer the censored knowledge by piecing together these implicit hints? As a step towards answering this question, we study inductive out-of-context reasoning (OOCR), a type of generalization in which LLMs infer latent information from evidence distributed across training documents and apply it to downstream tasks without in-context learning. Using a suite of five tasks, we demonstrate that frontier LLMs can perform inductive OOCR. In one experiment we finetune an LLM on a corpus consisting only of distances between an unknown city and other known cities. Remarkably, without in-context examples or Chain of Thought, the LLM can verbalize that the unknown city is Paris and use this fact to answer downstream questions. Further experiments show that LLMs trained only on individual coin flip outcomes can verbalize whether the coin is biased, and those trained only on pairs $(x,f(x))$ can articulate a definition of $f$ and compute inverses. While OOCR succeeds in a range of cases, we also show that it is unreliable, particularly for smaller LLMs learning complex structures. Overall, the ability of LLMs to "connect the dots" without explicit in-context learning poses a potential obstacle to monitoring and controlling the knowledge acquired by LLMs.</li>

          Consistency Models Made Easy(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Consistency models (CMs) are an emerging class of generative models that offer faster sampling than traditional diffusion models. CMs enforce that all points along a sampling trajectory are mapped to the same initial point. But this target leads to resource-intensive training: for example, as of 2024, training a SoTA CM on CIFAR-10 takes one week on 8 GPUs. In this work, we propose an alternative scheme for training CMs, vastly improving the efficiency of building such models. Specifically, by expressing CM trajectories via a particular differential equation, we argue that diffusion models can be viewed as a special case of CMs with a specific discretization. We can thus fine-tune a consistency model starting from a pre-trained diffusion model and progressively approximate the full consistency condition to stronger degrees over the training process. Our resulting method, which we term Easy Consistency Tuning (ECT), achieves vastly improved training times while indeed improving upon the quality of previous methods: for example, ECT achieves a 2-step FID of 2.73 on CIFAR10 within 1 hour on a single A100 GPU, matching Consistency Distillation trained of hundreds of GPU hours. Owing to this computational efficiency, we investigate the scaling law of CMs under ECT, showing that they seem to obey classic power law scaling, hinting at their ability to improve efficiency and performance at larger scales.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) involves classifying closely related sub-classes. This task is difficult due to the subtle differences between classes and the high intra-class variance. Moreover, FGVC datasets are typically small and challenging to gather, thus highlighting a significant need for effective data augmentation. Recent advancements in text-to-image diffusion models offer new possibilities for augmenting classification datasets. While these models have been used to generate training data for classification tasks, their effectiveness in full-dataset training of FGVC models remains under-explored. Recent techniques that rely on Text2Image generation or Img2Img methods, often struggle to generate images that accurately represent the class while modifying them to a degree that significantly increases the dataset's diversity. To address these challenges, we present SaSPA: Structure and Subject Preserving Augmentation. Contrary to recent methods, our method does not use real images as guidance, thereby increasing generation flexibility and promoting greater diversity. To ensure accurate class representation, we employ conditioning mechanisms, specifically by conditioning on image edges and subject representation. We conduct extensive experiments and benchmark SaSPA against both traditional and recent generative data augmentation methods. SaSPA consistently outperforms all established baselines across multiple settings, including full dataset training, contextual bias, and few-shot classification. Additionally, our results reveal interesting patterns in using synthetic data for FGVC models; for instance, we find a relationship between the amount of real data used and the optimal proportion of synthetic data.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Image editing aims to edit the given synthetic or real image to meet the specific requirements from users. It is widely studied in recent years as a promising and challenging field of Artificial Intelligence Generative Content (AIGC). Recent significant advancement in this field is based on the development of text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, which generate images according to text prompts. These models demonstrate remarkable generative capabilities and have become widely used tools for image editing. T2I-based image editing methods significantly enhance editing performance and offer a user-friendly interface for modifying content guided by multimodal inputs. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of multimodal-guided image editing techniques that leverage T2I diffusion models. First, we define the scope of image editing from a holistic perspective and detail various control signals and editing scenarios. We then propose a unified framework to formalize the editing process, categorizing it into two primary algorithm families. This framework offers a design space for users to achieve specific goals. Subsequently, we present an in-depth analysis of each component within this framework, examining the characteristics and applicable scenarios of different combinations. Given that training-based methods learn to directly map the source image to target one under user guidance, we discuss them separately, and introduce injection schemes of source image in different scenarios. Additionally, we review the application of 2D techniques to video editing, highlighting solutions for inter-frame inconsistency. Finally, we discuss open challenges in the field and suggest potential future research directions. We keep tracing related works at this https URL.</li>
