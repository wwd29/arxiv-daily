<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed the geoscience community with deep learning models (DLMs) that are trained to complete specific tasks within workflows. This success has led to the development of geoscience foundation models (FMs), which promise to accomplish multiple tasks within a workflow or replace the workflow altogether. However, lack of robust evaluation frameworks, even for traditional DLMs, leaves the geoscience community ill prepared for the inevitable adoption of FMs. We address this gap by designing an evaluation framework that jointly incorporates three crucial aspects to current DLMs and future FMs: performance uncertainty, learning efficiency, and overlapping training-test data splits. To target the three aspects, we meticulously construct the training, validation, and test splits using clustering methods tailored to geoscience data and enact an expansive training design to segregate performance uncertainty arising from stochastic training processes and random data sampling. The framework's ability to guard against misleading declarations of model superiority is demonstrated through evaluation of PhaseNet, a popular seismic phase picking DLM, under 3 training approaches. Furthermore, we show how the performance gains due to overlapping training-test data can lead to biased FM evaluation. Our framework helps practitioners choose the best model for their problem and set performance expectations by explicitly analyzing model performance at varying budgets of training data.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Detecting biases in the outputs produced by generative models is essential to reduce the potential risks associated with their application in critical settings. However, the majority of existing methodologies for identifying biases in generated text consider the models in isolation and neglect their contextual applications. Specifically, the biases that may arise in multi-agent systems involving generative models remain under-researched. To address this gap, we present a framework designed to quantify biases within multi-agent systems of conversational Large Language Models (LLMs). Our approach involves simulating small echo chambers, where pairs of LLMs, initialized with aligned perspectives on a polarizing topic, engage in discussions. Contrary to expectations, we observe significant shifts in the stance expressed in the generated messages, particularly within echo chambers where all agents initially express conservative viewpoints, in line with the well-documented political bias of many LLMs toward liberal positions. Crucially, the bias observed in the echo-chamber experiment remains undetected by current state-of-the-art bias detection methods that rely on questionnaires. This highlights a critical need for the development of a more sophisticated toolkit for bias detection and mitigation for AI multi-agent systems.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Establishing correspondences across images is a fundamental challenge in computer vision, underpinning tasks like Structure-from-Motion, image editing, and point tracking. Traditional methods are often specialized for specific correspondence types, geometric, semantic, or temporal, whereas humans naturally identify alignments across these domains. Inspired by this flexibility, we propose MATCHA, a unified feature model designed to ``rule them all'', establishing robust correspondences across diverse matching tasks. Building on insights that diffusion model features can encode multiple correspondence types, MATCHA augments this capacity by dynamically fusing high-level semantic and low-level geometric features through an attention-based module, creating expressive, versatile, and robust features. Additionally, MATCHA integrates object-level features from DINOv2 to further boost generalization, enabling a single feature capable of matching anything. Extensive experiments validate that MATCHA consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods across geometric, semantic, and temporal matching tasks, setting a new foundation for a unified approach for the fundamental correspondence problem in computer vision. To the best of our knowledge, MATCHA is the first approach that is able to effectively tackle diverse matching tasks with a single unified feature.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent work indicates that video recognition models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, posing a serious security risk to downstream applications. However, current research has primarily focused on adversarial attacks, with limited work exploring defense mechanisms. Furthermore, due to the spatial-temporal complexity of videos, existing video defense methods face issues of high cost, overfitting, and limited defense performance. Recently, diffusion-based adversarial purification methods have achieved robust defense performance in the image domain. However, due to the additional temporal dimension in videos, directly applying these diffusion-based adversarial purification methods to the video domain suffers performance and efficiency degradation. To achieve an efficient and effective video adversarial defense method, we propose the first diffusion-based video purification framework to improve video recognition models' adversarial robustness: VideoPure. Given an adversarial example, we first employ temporal DDIM inversion to transform the input distribution into a temporally consistent and trajectory-defined distribution, covering adversarial noise while preserving more video structure. Then, during DDIM denoising, we leverage intermediate results at each denoising step and conduct guided spatial-temporal optimization, removing adversarial noise while maintaining temporal consistency. Finally, we input the list of optimized intermediate results into the video recognition model for multi-step voting to obtain the predicted class. We investigate the defense performance of our method against black-box, gray-box, and adaptive attacks on benchmark datasets and models. Compared with other adversarial purification methods, our method overall demonstrates better defense performance against different attacks. Our code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present HuGDiffusion, a generalizable 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) learning pipeline to achieve novel view synthesis (NVS) of human characters from single-view input images. Existing approaches typically require monocular videos or calibrated multi-view images as inputs, whose applicability could be weakened in real-world scenarios with arbitrary and/or unknown camera poses. In this paper, we aim to generate the set of 3DGS attributes via a diffusion-based framework conditioned on human priors extracted from a single image. Specifically, we begin with carefully integrated human-centric feature extraction procedures to deduce informative conditioning signals. Based on our empirical observations that jointly learning the whole 3DGS attributes is challenging to optimize, we design a multi-stage generation strategy to obtain different types of 3DGS attributes. To facilitate the training process, we investigate constructing proxy ground-truth 3D Gaussian attributes as high-quality attribute-level supervision signals. Through extensive experiments, our HuGDiffusion shows significant performance improvements over the state-of-the-art methods. Our code will be made publicly available.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Developers using LLMs in their applications and agents have provided plenty of anecdotal evidence that in-context-learning (ICL) is fragile. In addition to the quantity and quality of examples, we show that the order in which the in-context examples are listed in the prompt affects the output of the LLM and, consequently, their performance. In this paper, we present OptiSeq, which introduces a score based on log probabilities of LLM outputs to prune the universe of possible example orderings in few-shot ICL and recommend the best order(s) by distinguishing between correct and incorrect outputs resulting from different order permutations. Through a detailed empirical evaluation on multiple LLMs, datasets and prompts, we demonstrate that OptiSeq improves accuracy by 6 - 10.5 percentage points across multiple tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Semi-supervised graph anomaly detection (GAD) has recently received increasing attention, which aims to distinguish anomalous patterns from graphs under the guidance of a moderate amount of labeled data and a large volume of unlabeled data. Although these proposed semi-supervised GAD methods have achieved great success, their superior performance will be seriously degraded when the provided labels are extremely limited due to some unpredictable factors. Besides, the existing methods primarily focus on anomaly detection in static graphs, and little effort was paid to consider the continuous evolution characteristic of graphs over time (dynamic graphs). To address these challenges, we propose a novel GAD framework (EL$^{2}$-DGAD) to tackle anomaly detection problem in dynamic graphs with extremely limited labels. Specifically, a transformer-based graph encoder model is designed to more effectively preserve evolving graph structures beyond the local neighborhood. Then, we incorporate an ego-context hypersphere classification loss to classify temporal interactions according to their structure and temporal neighborhoods while ensuring the normal samples are mapped compactly against anomalous data. Finally, the above loss is further augmented with an ego-context contrasting module which utilizes unlabeled data to enhance model generalization. Extensive experiments on four datasets and three label rates demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison to the existing GAD methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated Learning (FL) has become a widely used approach for training machine learning models on decentralized data, addressing the significant privacy concerns associated with traditional centralized methods. However, the efficiency of FL relies on effective client selection and robust privacy preservation mechanisms. Ineffective client selection can result in suboptimal model performance, while inadequate privacy measures risk exposing sensitive data. This paper introduces a client selection framework for FL that incorporates differential privacy and fault tolerance. The proposed adaptive approach dynamically adjusts the number of selected clients based on model performance and system constraints, ensuring privacy through the addition of calibrated noise. The method is evaluated on a network anomaly detection use case using the UNSW-NB15 and ROAD datasets. Results demonstrate up to a 7% improvement in accuracy and a 25% reduction in training time compared to the FedL2P approach. Additionally, the study highlights trade-offs between privacy budgets and model performance, with higher privacy budgets leading to reduced noise and improved accuracy. While the fault tolerance mechanism introduces a slight performance decrease, it enhances robustness against client failures. Statistical validation using the Mann-Whitney U test confirms the significance of these improvements, with results achieving a p-value of less than 0.05.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vision language model (VLM) has been designed for large scale image-text alignment as a pretrained foundation model. For downstream few shot classification tasks, parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) VLM has gained much popularity in the computer vision community. PEFT methods like prompt tuning and linear adapter have been studied for fine-tuning VLM while low rank adaptation (LoRA) algorithm has rarely been considered for few shot fine-tuning VLM. The main obstacle to use LoRA for few shot fine-tuning is the catastrophic forgetting problem. Because the visual language alignment knowledge is important for the generality in few shot learning, whereas low rank adaptation interferes with the most informative direction of the pretrained weight matrix. We propose the complementary subspace low rank adaptation (Comp-LoRA) method to regularize the catastrophic forgetting problem in few shot VLM finetuning. In detail, we optimize the low rank matrix in the complementary subspace, thus preserving the general vision language alignment ability of VLM when learning the novel few shot information. We conduct comparison experiments of the proposed Comp-LoRA method and other PEFT methods on fine-tuning VLM for few shot classification. And we also present the suppression on the catastrophic forgetting problem of our proposed method against directly applying LoRA to VLM. The results show that the proposed method surpasses the baseline method by about +1.0\% Top-1 accuracy and preserves the VLM zero-shot performance over the baseline method by about +1.3\% Top-1 accuracy.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The exponential growth in the usage of Internet of Things in daily life has caused immense increase in the generation of time series data. Smart homes is one such domain where bulk of data is being generated and anomaly detection is one of the many challenges addressed by researchers in recent years. Contextual anomaly is a kind of anomaly that may show deviation from the normal pattern like point or sequence anomalies, but it also requires prior knowledge about the data domain and the actions that caused the deviation. Recent studies based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) have demonstrated strong performance in anomaly detection. This study explores the impact of automatically tuned hyperparamteres on Unsupervised Online Contextual Anomaly Detection (UoCAD) approach by proposing UoCAD with Optimised Hyperparamnters (UoCAD-OH). UoCAD-OH conducts hyperparameter optimisation on Bi-LSTM model in an offline phase and uses the fine-tuned hyperparameters to detect anomalies during the online phase. The experiments involve evaluating the proposed framework on two smart home air quality datasets containing contextual anomalies. The evaluation metrics used are Precision, Recall, and F1 score.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Motion synthesis plays a vital role in various fields of artificial intelligence. Among the various conditions of motion generation, text can describe motion details elaborately and is easy to acquire, making text-to-motion(T2M) generation important. State-of-the-art T2M techniques mainly leverage diffusion models to generate motions with text prompts as guidance, tackling the many-to-many nature of T2M tasks. However, existing T2M approaches face challenges, given the gap between the natural language domain and the physical domain, making it difficult to generate motions fully consistent with the texts. We leverage kinematic phrases(KP), an intermediate representation that bridges these two modalities, to solve this. Our proposed method, KETA, decomposes the given text into several decomposed texts via a language model. It trains an aligner to align decomposed texts with the KP segments extracted from the generated motions. Thus, it's possible to restrict the behaviors for diffusion-based T2M models. During the training stage, we deploy the text-KP alignment loss as an auxiliary goal to supervise the models. During the inference stage, we refine our generated motions for multiple rounds in our decoder structure, where we compute the text-KP distance as the guidance signal in each new round. Experiments demonstrate that KETA achieves up to 1.19x, 2.34x better R precision and FID value on both backbones of the base model, motion diffusion model. Compared to a wide range of T2M generation models. KETA achieves either the best or the second-best performance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The increasing sophistication of encryption-based ransomware has demanded innovative approaches to detection and mitigation, prompting the development of a hierarchical framework grounded in probabilistic cryptographic analysis. By focusing on the statistical characteristics of encryption patterns, the proposed methodology introduces a layered approach that combines advanced clustering algorithms with machine learning to isolate ransomware-induced anomalies. Through comprehensive testing across diverse ransomware families, the framework demonstrated exceptional accuracy, effectively distinguishing malicious encryption operations from benign activities while maintaining low false positive rates. The system's design integrates dynamic feedback mechanisms, enabling adaptability to varying cryptographic complexities and operational environments. Detailed entropy-based evaluations revealed its sensitivity to subtle deviations in encryption workflows, offering a robust alternative to traditional detection methods reliant on static signatures or heuristics. Computational benchmarks confirmed its scalability and efficiency, achieving consistent performance even under high data loads and complex cryptographic scenarios. The inclusion of real-time clustering and anomaly evaluation ensures rapid response capabilities, addressing critical latency challenges in ransomware detection. Performance comparisons with established methods highlighted its improvements in detection efficacy, particularly against advanced ransomware employing extended key lengths and unique cryptographic protocols.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their remarkable capabilities across various language tasks. Inspired by the success of text-to-text translation refinement, this paper investigates how LLMs can improve the performance of speech translation by introducing a joint refinement process. Through the joint refinement of speech translation (ST) and automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcription via LLMs, the performance of the ST model is significantly improved in both training-free in-context learning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning scenarios. Additionally, we explore the effect of document-level context on refinement under the context-aware fine-tuning scenario. Experimental results on the MuST-C and CoVoST 2 datasets, which include seven translation tasks, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach using several popular LLMs including GPT-3.5-turbo, LLaMA3-8B, and Mistral-12B. Further analysis further suggests that jointly refining both transcription and translation yields better performance compared to refining translation alone. Meanwhile, incorporating document-level context significantly enhances refinement performance. We release our code and datasets on GitHub.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Although retrieval-augmented generation(RAG) significantly improves generation quality by retrieving external knowledge bases and integrating generated content, it faces computational efficiency bottlenecks, particularly in knowledge retrieval tasks involving hierarchical structures for Tree-RAG. This paper proposes a Tree-RAG acceleration method based on the improved Cuckoo Filter, which optimizes entity localization during the retrieval process to achieve significant performance improvements. Tree-RAG effectively organizes entities through the introduction of a hierarchical tree structure, while the Cuckoo Filter serves as an efficient data structure that supports rapid membership queries and dynamic updates. The experiment results demonstrate that our method is much faster than naive Tree-RAG while maintaining high levels of generative quality. When the number of trees is large, our method is hundreds of times faster than naive Tree-RAG. Our work is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Modern image generation systems can produce high-quality visuals, yet user prompts often contain ambiguities, requiring multiple revisions. Existing methods struggle to address the nuanced needs of non-expert users. We propose Visual Co-Adaptation (VCA), a novel framework that iteratively refines prompts and aligns generated images with user preferences. VCA employs a fine-tuned language model with reinforcement learning and multi-turn dialogues for prompt disambiguation. Key components include the Incremental Context-Enhanced Dialogue Block for interactive clarification, the Semantic Exploration and Disambiguation Module (SESD) leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and CLIP scoring, and the Pixel Precision and Consistency Optimization Module (PPCO) for refining image details using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). A human-in-the-loop feedback mechanism further improves performance. Experiments show that VCA surpasses models like DALL-E 3 and Stable Diffusion, reducing dialogue rounds to 4.3, achieving a CLIP score of 0.92, and enhancing user satisfaction to 4.73/5. Additionally, we introduce a novel multi-round dialogue dataset with prompt-image pairs and user intent annotations.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Sign language pre-training has gained increasing attention for its ability to enhance performance across various sign language understanding (SLU) tasks. However, existing methods often suffer from a gap between pre-training and fine-tuning, leading to suboptimal results. To address this, we propose \modelname, a unified pre-training framework that eliminates the gap between pre-training and downstream SLU tasks through a large-scale generative pre-training strategy and a novel fine-tuning paradigm. First, we introduce CSL-News, a large-scale Chinese Sign Language (CSL) dataset containing 1,985 hours of video paired with textual annotations, which enables effective large-scale pre-training. Second, \modelname unifies SLU tasks by treating downstream tasks as a single sign language translation (SLT) task during fine-tuning, ensuring seamless knowledge transfer between pre-training and fine-tuning. Furthermore, we incorporate a prior-guided fusion (PGF) module and a score-aware sampling strategy to efficiently fuse pose and RGB information, addressing keypoint inaccuracies and improving computational efficiency. Extensive experiments across multiple SLU benchmarks demonstrate that \modelname achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple downstream SLU tasks.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Industrial image anomaly detection (IAD) is a pivotal topic with huge value. Due to anomaly's nature, real anomalies in a specific modern industrial domain (i.e. domain-specific anomalies) are usually too rare to collect, which severely hinders IAD. Thus, zero-shot anomaly synthesis (ZSAS), which synthesizes pseudo anomaly images without any domain-specific anomaly, emerges as a vital technique for IAD. However, existing solutions are either unable to synthesize authentic pseudo anomalies, or require cumbersome training. Thus, we focus on ZSAS and propose a brand-new paradigm that can realize both authentic and training-free ZSAS. It is based on a chronically-ignored fact: Although domain-specific anomalies are rare, real anomalies from other domains (i.e. cross-domain anomalies) are actually abundant and directly applicable to ZSAS. Specifically, our new ZSAS paradigm makes three-fold contributions: First, we propose a novel method named Cross-domain Anomaly Injection (CAI), which directly exploits cross-domain anomalies to enable highly authentic ZSAS in a training-free manner. Second, to supply CAI with sufficient cross-domain anomalies, we build the first domain-agnostic anomaly dataset within our best knowledge, which provides ZSAS with abundant real anomaly patterns. Third, we propose a CAI-guided Diffusion Mechanism, which further breaks the quantity limit of real anomalies and enable unlimited anomaly synthesis. Our head-to-head comparison with existing ZSAS solutions justifies our paradigm's superior performance for IAD and demonstrates it as an effective and pragmatic ZSAS solution.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The use of chatbots in language learning has evolved significantly since the 1960s, becoming more sophisticated platforms as generative AI emerged. These tools now simulate natural conversations, adapting to individual learners' needs, including those studying Chinese. Our study explores how learners can use specific prompts to engage Large Language Models (LLM) as personalized chatbots, aiming to target their language level based on the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) and the European Benchmarking Chinese Language (EBCL) project. Focusing on A1, A1+ and A2 levels, we examine the teaching of Chinese, which presents unique challenges due to its logographic writing system. Our goal is to develop prompts that integrate oral and written skills, using high-frequency character lists and controlling oral lexical productions. These tools, powered by generative AI, aim to enhance language practice by crossing lexical and sinographic recurrence. While generative AI shows potential as a personalized tutor, further evaluation is needed to assess its effectiveness. We conducted a systematic series of experiments using ChatGPT models to evaluate their adherence to constraints specified in the prompts. The results indicate that incorporating level A1 and A1+ characters, along with the associated reference list, significantly enhances compliance with the EBCL character set. Properly prompted, LLMs can increase exposure to the target language and offer interactive exchanges to develop language skills.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Ultrasound imaging is widely used in medical diagnosis, especially for fetal health assessment. However, the availability of high-quality annotated ultrasound images is limited, which restricts the training of machine learning models. In this paper, we investigate the use of diffusion models to generate synthetic ultrasound images to improve the performance on fetal plane classification. We train different classifiers first on synthetic images and then fine-tune them with real images. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that incorporating generated images into training pipelines leads to better classification accuracy than training with real images alone. The findings suggest that generating synthetic data using diffusion models can be a valuable tool in overcoming the challenges of data scarcity in ultrasound medical imaging.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid advancement of GANs and diffusion models has led to the generation of increasingly realistic fake images, posing significant hidden dangers and threats to society. Consequently, deepfake detection has become a pressing issue in today's world. While some existing methods focus on forgery features from either a local or global perspective, they often overlook the complementary nature of these features. Other approaches attempt to incorporate both local and global features but rely on simplistic strategies, such as cropping, which fail to capture the intricate relationships between local features. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method that effectively combines local spatial-frequency domain features with global frequency domain information, capturing detailed and holistic forgery traces. Specifically, our method uses Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and sliding windows to tile forged features and leverages attention mechanisms to extract local spatial-frequency domain information. Simultaneously, the phase component of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is integrated with attention mechanisms to extract global frequency domain information, complementing the local features and ensuring the integrity of forgery detection. Comprehensive evaluations on open-world datasets generated by 34 distinct generative models demonstrate a significant improvement of 2.9% over existing state-of-the-art methods.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present a novel approach to anomaly detection by integrating Generalized Hyperbolic (GH) processes into kernel-based methods. The GH distribution, known for its flexibility in modeling skewness, heavy tails, and kurtosis, helps to capture complex patterns in data that deviate from Gaussian assumptions. We propose a GH-based kernel function and utilize it within Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) and One-Class Support Vector Machines (OCSVM) to develop anomaly detection frameworks. Theoretical results confirmed the positive semi-definiteness and consistency of the GH-based kernel, ensuring its suitability for machine learning applications. Empirical evaluation on synthetic and real-world datasets showed that our method improves detection performance in scenarios involving heavy-tailed and asymmetric or imbalanced distributions. this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Lexical Simplification (LS) methods use a three-step pipeline: complex word identification, substitute generation, and substitute ranking, each with separate evaluation datasets. We found large language models (LLMs) can simplify sentences directly with a single prompt, bypassing the traditional pipeline. However, existing LS datasets are not suitable for evaluating these LLM-generated simplified sentences, as they focus on providing substitutes for single complex words without identifying all complex words in a sentence. To address this gap, we propose a new annotation method for constructing an all-in-one LS dataset through human-machine collaboration. Automated methods generate a pool of potential substitutes, which human annotators then assess, suggesting additional alternatives as needed. Additionally, we explore LLM-based methods with single prompts, in-context learning, and chain-of-thought techniques. We introduce a multi-LLMs collaboration approach to simulate each step of the LS task. Experimental results demonstrate that LS based on multi-LLMs approaches significantly outperforms existing baselines.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Due to the scarcity of data in low-resourced languages, the development of language models for these languages has been very slow. Currently, pre-trained language models have gained popularity in natural language processing, especially, in developing domain-specific models for low-resourced languages. In this study, we experiment with the impact of using occlusion-based techniques when training a language model for a text generation task. We curate 2 new datasets, the Sepedi monolingual (SepMono) dataset from several South African resources and the Sepedi radio news (SepNews) dataset from the radio news domain. We use the SepMono dataset to pre-train transformer-based models using the occlusion and non-occlusion pre-training techniques and compare performance. The SepNews dataset is specifically used for fine-tuning. Our results show that the non-occlusion models perform better compared to the occlusion-based models when measuring validation loss and perplexity. However, analysis of the generated text using the BLEU score metric, which measures the quality of the generated text, shows a slightly higher BLEU score for the occlusion-based models compared to the non-occlusion models.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As Large Language Models (LLMs) advance in their capabilities, researchers have increasingly employed them for social simulation. In this paper, we investigate whether interactions among LLM agents resemble those of humans. Specifically, we focus on the pronoun usage difference between leaders and non-leaders, examining whether the simulation would lead to human-like pronoun usage patterns during the LLMs' interactions. Our evaluation reveals the significant discrepancies between LLM-based simulations and human pronoun usage, with prompt-based or specialized agents failing to demonstrate human-like pronoun usage patterns. In addition, we reveal that even if LLMs understand the human pronoun usage patterns, they fail to demonstrate them in the actual interaction process. Our study highlights the limitations of social simulations based on LLM agents, urging caution in using such social simulation in practitioners' decision-making process.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models are a powerful framework for tackling ill-posed problems, with recent advancements extending their use to point cloud upsampling. Despite their potential, existing diffusion models struggle with inefficiencies as they map Gaussian noise to real point clouds, overlooking the geometric information inherent in sparse point clouds. To address these inefficiencies, we propose PUFM, a flow matching approach to directly map sparse point clouds to their high-fidelity dense counterparts. Our method first employs midpoint interpolation to sparse point clouds, resolving the density mismatch between sparse and dense point clouds. Since point clouds are unordered representations, we introduce a pre-alignment method based on Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) optimization to ensure coherent interpolation between sparse and dense point clouds, which enables a more stable learning path in flow matching. Experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method delivers superior upsampling quality but with fewer sampling steps. Further experiments on ScanNet and KITTI also show that our approach generalizes well on RGB-D point clouds and LiDAR point clouds, making it more practical for real-world applications.</li>

RASO leverages a novel weakly-supervised learning framework that generates tag-image-text pairs automatically from large-scale unannotated surgical lecture videos, significantly reducing the need for manual annotations. Our scalable data generation pipeline gatherers to 2,200 surgical procedures and produces 3.6 million tag annotations across 2,066 unique surgical tags. Our experiments show that RASO achieves improvements of 2.9 mAP, 4.5 mAP, 10.6 mAP, and 7.2 mAP on four standard surgical benchmarks respectively in zero-shot settings, and surpasses state-of-the-art models in supervised surgical action recognition tasks.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Fire Influence on Regional to Global Environments and Air Quality (FIREX-AQ) was a field campaign aimed at better understanding the impact of wildfires and agricultural fires on air quality and climate. The FIREX-AQ campaign took place in August 2019 and involved two aircraft and multiple coordinated satellite observations. This study applied and evaluated a self-supervised machine learning (ML) method for the active fire and smoke plume identification and tracking in the satellite and sub-orbital remote sensing datasets collected during the campaign. Our unique methodology combines remote sensing observations with different spatial and spectral resolutions. The demonstrated approach successfully differentiates fire pixels and smoke plumes from background imagery, enabling the generation of a per-instrument smoke and fire mask product, as well as smoke and fire masks created from the fusion of selected data from independent instruments. This ML approach has a potential to enhance operational wildfire monitoring systems and improve decision-making in air quality management through fast smoke plume identification12 and tracking and could improve climate impact studies through fusion data from independent instruments.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent studies have increasingly demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) possess significant theory of mind (ToM) capabilities, showing the potential for simulating the tracking of mental states in generative agents. In this study, we propose a novel paradigm called ToM-agent, designed to empower LLMs-based generative agents to simulate ToM in open-domain conversational interactions. ToM-agent disentangles the confidence from mental states, facilitating the emulation of an agent's perception of its counterpart's mental states, such as beliefs, desires, and intentions (BDIs). Using past conversation history and verbal reflections, ToM-Agent can dynamically adjust counterparts' inferred BDIs, along with related confidence levels. We further put forth a counterfactual intervention method that reflects on the gap between the predicted responses of counterparts and their real utterances, thereby enhancing the efficiency of reflection. Leveraging empathetic and persuasion dialogue datasets, we assess the advantages of implementing the ToM-agent with downstream tasks, as well as its performance in both the first-order and the \textit{second-order} ToM. Our findings indicate that the ToM-agent can grasp the underlying reasons for their counterpart's behaviors beyond mere semantic-emotional supporting or decision-making based on common sense, providing new insights for studying large-scale LLMs-based simulation of human social behaviors.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In recent years, rapid technological advancements and expanded Internet access have led to a significant rise in anomalies within network traffic and time-series data. Prompt detection of these irregularities is crucial for ensuring service quality, preventing financial losses, and maintaining robust security standards. While machine learning algorithms have shown promise in achieving high accuracy for anomaly detection, their performance is often constrained by the specific conditions of their training data. A persistent challenge in this domain is the scarcity of labeled data for anomaly detection in time-series datasets. This limitation hampers the training efficacy of both traditional machine learning and advanced deep learning models. To address this, unsupervised transfer learning emerges as a viable solution, leveraging unlabeled data from a source domain to identify anomalies in an unlabeled target domain. However, many existing approaches still depend on a small amount of labeled data from the target domain. To overcome these constraints, we propose a transfer learning-based model for anomaly detection in multivariate time-series datasets. Unlike conventional methods, our approach does not require labeled data in either the source or target domains. Empirical evaluations on novel intrusion detection datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms existing techniques in accurately identifying anomalies within an entirely unlabeled target domain.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The Semantic Layered Embedding Diffusion (SLED) mechanism redefines the representation of hierarchical semantics within transformer-based architectures, enabling enhanced contextual consistency across a wide array of linguistic tasks. By introducing a multi-layered diffusion process grounded in spectral analysis, it achieves a complex balance between global and local semantic coherence. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in perplexity and BLEU scores, emphasizing the mechanism's ability to adapt effectively across diverse domains, including multilingual and cross-domain text generation. A rigorous mathematical framework underpins the embedding diffusion process, incorporating weighted adjacency matrices, kernel-based refinements, and dynamic layer-wise normalization. Error distribution analysis reveals that SLED addresses challenges in semantic alignment and coherence, outperforming baseline approaches across varied benchmarks. Scalability studies illustrate that its performance gains are maintained consistently across different model sizes, reflecting a practical balance between computational efficiency and linguistic precision. The implementation also achieves energy efficiency, reducing resource consumption during training and inference phases without compromising accuracy. Qualitative case studies further validate its adaptability to extended narratives and context-intensive scenarios, highlighting the mechanism's potential for real-world applications. SLED offers a different perspective on embedding design and its implications for advancing language modeling.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) has been a default technique in various visual generative models, yet it requires inference from both conditional and unconditional models during sampling. We propose to build visual models that are free from guided sampling. The resulting algorithm, Guidance-Free Training (GFT), matches the performance of CFG while reducing sampling to a single model, halving the computational cost. Unlike previous distillation-based approaches that rely on pretrained CFG networks, GFT enables training directly from scratch. GFT is simple to implement. It retains the same maximum likelihood objective as CFG and differs mainly in the parameterization of conditional models. Implementing GFT requires only minimal modifications to existing codebases, as most design choices and hyperparameters are directly inherited from CFG. Our extensive experiments across five distinct visual models demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of GFT. Across domains of diffusion, autoregressive, and masked-prediction modeling, GFT consistently achieves comparable or even lower FID scores, with similar diversity-fidelity trade-offs compared with CFG baselines, all while being guidance-free.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Machine learning (ML) research strongly relies on benchmarks in order to determine the relative effectiveness of newly proposed models. Recently, a number of prominent research effort argued that a number of models that improve the state-of-the-art by a small margin tend to do so by winning what they call a "benchmark lottery". An important benchmark in the field of machine learning and computer vision is the ImageNet where newly proposed models are often showcased based on their performance on this dataset. Given the large number of self-supervised learning (SSL) frameworks that has been proposed in the past couple of years each coming with marginal improvements on the ImageNet dataset, in this work, we evaluate whether those marginal improvements on ImageNet translate to improvements on similar datasets or not. To do so, we investigate twelve popular SSL frameworks on five ImageNet variants and discover that models that seem to perform well on ImageNet may experience significant performance declines on similar datasets. Specifically, state-of-the-art frameworks such as DINO and Swav, which are praised for their performance, exhibit substantial drops in performance while MoCo and Barlow Twins displays comparatively good results. As a result, we argue that otherwise good and desirable properties of models remain hidden when benchmarking is only performed on the ImageNet validation set, making us call for more adequate benchmarking. To avoid the "benchmark lottery" on ImageNet and to ensure a fair benchmarking process, we investigate the usage of a unified metric that takes into account the performance of models on other ImageNet variant datasets.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Despite significant progress in Anomaly Detection (AD), the robustness of existing detection methods against adversarial attacks remains a challenge, compromising their reliability in critical real-world applications such as autonomous driving. This issue primarily arises from the AD setup, which assumes that training data is limited to a group of unlabeled normal samples, making the detectors vulnerable to adversarial anomaly samples during testing. Additionally, implementing adversarial training as a safeguard encounters difficulties, such as formulating an effective objective function without access to labels. An ideal objective function for adversarial training in AD should promote strong perturbations both within and between the normal and anomaly groups to maximize margin between normal and anomaly distribution. To address these issues, we first propose crafting a pseudo-anomaly group derived from normal group samples. Then, we demonstrate that adversarial training with contrastive loss could serve as an ideal objective function, as it creates both inter- and intra-group perturbations. However, we notice that spurious negative pairs compromise the conventional contrastive loss to achieve robust AD. Spurious negative pairs are those that should be closely mapped but are erroneously separated. These pairs introduce noise and misguide the direction of inter-group adversarial perturbations. To overcome the effect of spurious negative pairs, we define opposite pairs and adversarially pull them apart to strengthen inter-group perturbations. Experimental results demonstrate our superior performance in both clean and adversarial scenarios, with a 26.1% improvement in robust detection across various challenging benchmark datasets.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Digital Surface Models (DSMs) are essential for accurately representing Earth's topography in geospatial analyses. DSMs capture detailed elevations of natural and manmade features, crucial for applications like urban planning, vegetation studies, and 3D reconstruction. However, DSMs derived from stereo satellite imagery often contain voids or missing data due to occlusions, shadows, and lowsignal areas. Previous studies have primarily focused on void filling for digital elevation models (DEMs) and Digital Terrain Models (DTMs), employing methods such as inverse distance weighting (IDW), kriging, and spline interpolation. While effective for simpler terrains, these approaches often fail to handle the intricate structures present in DSMs. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Dfilled, a guided DSM void filling method that leverages optical remote sensing images through edge-enhancing diffusion. Dfilled repurposes deep anisotropic diffusion models, which originally designed for super-resolution tasks, to inpaint DSMs. Additionally, we utilize Perlin noise to create inpainting masks that mimic natural void patterns in DSMs. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that Dfilled surpasses traditional interpolation methods and deep learning approaches in DSM void filling tasks. Both quantitative and qualitative assessments highlight the method's ability to manage complex features and deliver accurate, visually coherent results.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Blind face restoration (BFR) is a highly challenging problem due to the uncertainty of data degradation patterns. Current BFR methods have realized certain restored productions but with inherent neural degradations that limit real-world generalization in complicated scenarios. In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play framework InfoBFR to tackle neural degradations, e.g., prior bias, topological distortion, textural distortion, and artifact residues, which achieves high-generalization face restoration in diverse wild and heterogeneous scenes. Specifically, based on the results from pre-trained BFR models, InfoBFR considers information compression using manifold information bottleneck (MIB) and information compensation with efficient diffusion LoRA to conduct information optimization. InfoBFR effectively synthesizes high-fidelity faces without attribute and identity distortions. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of InfoBFR over state-of-the-art GAN-based and diffusion-based BFR methods, with around 70ms consumption, 16M trainable parameters, and nearly 85% BFR-boosting. It is promising that InfoBFR will be the first plug-and-play restorer universally employed by diverse BFR models to conquer neural degradations.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose a zero-shot method for generating images in arbitrary spaces (e.g., a sphere for 360¬∞ panoramas and a mesh surface for texture) using a pretrained image diffusion model. The zero-shot generation of various visual content using a pretrained image diffusion model has been explored mainly in two directions. First, Diffusion Synchronization-performing reverse diffusion processes jointly across different projected spaces while synchronizing them in the target space-generates high-quality outputs when enough conditioning is provided, but it struggles in its absence. Second, Score Distillation Sampling-gradually updating the target space data through gradient descent-results in better coherence but often lacks detail. In this paper, we reveal for the first time the interconnection between these two methods while highlighting their differences. To this end, we propose StochSync, a novel approach that combines the strengths of both, enabling effective performance with weak conditioning. Our experiments demonstrate that StochSync provides the best performance in 360¬∞ panorama generation (where image conditioning is not given), outperforming previous finetuning-based methods, and also delivers comparable results in 3D mesh texturing (where depth conditioning is provided) with previous methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models have gained significant popularity in image generation tasks. However, generating high-quality content remains notably slow because it requires running model inference over many time steps. To accelerate these models, we propose to aggressively quantize both weights and activations, while simultaneously promoting significant activation sparsity. We further observe that the stated sparsity pattern varies among different channels and evolves across time steps. To support this quantization and sparsity scheme, we present a novel diffusion model accelerator featuring a heterogeneous mixed-precision dense-sparse architecture, channel-last address mapping, and a time-step-aware sparsity detector for efficient handling of the sparsity pattern. Our 4-bit quantization technique demonstrates superior generation quality compared to existing 4-bit methods. Our custom accelerator achieves 6.91x speed-up and 51.5% energy reduction compared to traditional dense accelerators.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the advancements in self-supervised learning (SSL), transformer-based computer vision models have recently demonstrated superior results compared to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and are poised to dominate the field of artificial intelligence (AI)-based medical imaging in the upcoming years. Nevertheless, similar to CNNs, unveiling the decision-making process of transformer-based models remains a challenge. In this work, we take a step towards demystifying the decision-making process of transformer-based medical imaging models and propose Token Insight, a novel method that identifies the critical tokens that contribute to the prediction made by the model. Our method relies on the principled approach of token discarding native to transformer-based models, requires no additional module, and can be applied to any transformer model. Using the proposed approach, we quantify the importance of each token based on its contribution to the prediction and enable a more nuanced understanding of the model's decisions. Our experimental results which are showcased on the problem of colonic polyp identification using both supervised and self-supervised pretrained vision transformers indicate that Token Insight contributes to a more transparent and interpretable transformer-based medical imaging model, fostering trust and facilitating broader adoption in clinical settings.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites can be used to assist maritime wireless communications for data transmission across wide-ranging areas. However, extensive coverage of LEO satellites, combined with openness of channels, can cause the communication process to suffer from security risks. This paper presents a low-altitude friendly-jamming LEO satellite-maritime communication system enabled by a unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to ensure data security at the physical layer. Since such a system requires trade-off policies that balance the secrecy rate and energy consumption of the UAV to meet evolving scenario demands, we formulate a secure satellite-maritime communication multi-objective optimization problem (SSMCMOP). In order to solve the dynamic and long-term optimization problem, we reformulate it into a Markov decision process. We then propose a transformer-enhanced soft actor critic (TransSAC) algorithm, which is a generative artificial intelligence-enable deep reinforcement learning approach to solve the reformulated problem, so that capturing global dependencies and diversely exploring weights. Simulation results demonstrate that the TransSAC outperforms various baselines, and achieves an optimal secrecy rate while effectively minimizing the energy consumption of the UAV. Moreover, the results find more suitable constraint values for the system.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) has achieved remarkable success in the parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large models. The trained LoRA matrix can be integrated with the base model through addition or negation operation to improve performance on downstream tasks. However, the unauthorized use of LoRAs to generate harmful content highlights the need for effective mechanisms to trace their usage. A natural solution is to embed watermarks into LoRAs to detect unauthorized misuse. However, existing methods struggle when multiple LoRAs are combined or negation operation is applied, as these can significantly degrade watermark performance. In this paper, we introduce LoRAGuard, a novel black-box watermarking technique for detecting unauthorized misuse of LoRAs. To support both addition and negation operations, we propose the Yin-Yang watermark technique, where the Yin watermark is verified during negation operation and the Yang watermark during addition operation. Additionally, we propose a shadow-model-based watermark training approach that significantly improves effectiveness in scenarios involving multiple integrated LoRAs. Extensive experiments on both language and diffusion models show that LoRAGuard achieves nearly 100% watermark verification success and demonstrates strong effectiveness.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Protein-based therapeutics play a pivotal role in modern medicine targeting various diseases. Despite their therapeutic importance, these products can aggregate and form subvisible particles (SvPs), which can compromise their efficacy and trigger immunological responses, emphasizing the critical need for robust monitoring techniques. Flow Imaging Microscopy (FIM) has been a significant advancement in detecting SvPs, evolving from monochrome to more recently incorporating color imaging. Complementing SvP images obtained via FIM, deep learning techniques have recently been employed successfully for stress source identification of monochrome SvPs. In this study, we explore the potential of color FIM to enhance the characterization of stress sources in SvPs. To achieve this, we curate a new dataset comprising 16,000 SvPs from eight commercial monoclonal antibodies subjected to heat and mechanical stress. Using both supervised and self-supervised convolutional neural networks, as well as vision transformers in large-scale experiments, we demonstrate that deep learning with color FIM images consistently outperforms monochrome images, thus highlighting the potential of color FIM in stress source classification compared to its monochrome counterparts.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The classification and recognition of maritime objects are crucial for enhancing maritime safety, monitoring, and intelligent sea environment prediction. However, existing unsupervised methods for maritime object classification often struggle with the long-tail data distributions in both object categories and weather conditions. In this paper, we construct a dataset named AIMO produced by large-scale generative models with diverse weather conditions and balanced object categories, and collect a dataset named RMO with real-world images where long-tail issue exists. We propose a novel domain adaptation approach that leverages AIMO (source domain) to address the problem of limited labeled data, unbalanced distribution and domain shift in RMO (target domain), and enhance the generalization of source features with the Vision-Language Models such as CLIP. Experimental results shows that the proposed method significantly improves the classification accuracy, particularly for samples within rare object categories and weather conditions.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper proposes the Degradation Classification Pre-Training (DCPT), which enables models to learn how to classify the degradation type of input images for universal image restoration pre-training. Unlike the existing self-supervised pre-training methods, DCPT utilizes the degradation type of the input image as an extremely weak supervision, which can be effortlessly obtained, even intrinsic in all image restoration datasets. DCPT comprises two primary stages. Initially, image features are extracted from the encoder. Subsequently, a lightweight decoder, such as ResNet18, is leveraged to classify the degradation type of the input image solely based on the features extracted in the first stage, without utilizing the input image. The encoder is pre-trained with a straightforward yet potent DCPT, which is used to address universal image restoration and achieve outstanding performance. Following DCPT, both convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers demonstrate performance improvements, with gains of up to 2.55 dB in the 10D all-in-one restoration task and 6.53 dB in the mixed degradation scenarios. Moreover, previous self-supervised pretraining methods, such as masked image modeling, discard the decoder after pre-training, while our DCPT utilizes the pre-trained parameters more effectively. This superiority arises from the degradation classifier acquired during DCPT, which facilitates transfer learning between models of identical architecture trained on diverse degradation types.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Prostate cancer grading using the ISUP system (International Society of Urological Pathology) for treatment decisions is highly subjective and requires considerable expertise. Despite advances in computer-aided diagnosis systems, few have handled efficient ISUP grading on Whole Slide Images (WSIs) of prostate biopsies based only on slide-level labels. Some of the general challenges include managing gigapixel WSIs, obtaining patch-level annotations, and dealing with stain variability across centers. One of the main task-specific challenges faced by deep learning in ISUP grading, is the learning of patch-level features of Gleason patterns (GPs) based only on their slide labels. In this scenario, an efficient framework for ISUP grading is developed. The proposed TSOR is based on a novel Task-specific Self-supervised learning (SSL) model, which is fine-tuned using Ordinal Regression. Since the diversity of training samples plays a crucial role in SSL, a patch-level dataset is created to be relatively balanced w.r.t. the Gleason grades (GGs). This balanced dataset is used for pre-training, so that the model can effectively learn stain-agnostic features of the GP for better generalization. In medical image grading, it is desirable that misclassifications be as close as possible to the actual grade. From this perspective, the model is then fine-tuned for the task of ISUP grading using an ordinal regression-based approach. Experimental results on the most extensive multicenter prostate biopsies dataset (PANDA challenge), as well as the SICAP dataset, demonstrate the effectiveness of this novel framework compared to state-of-the-art methods.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative artificial intelligence, particularly through large language models (LLMs), is poised to transform energy optimization and demand side management (DSM) within microgrids. This paper explores the integration of LLMs into energy management, emphasizing their roles in automating the optimization of DSM strategies with electric vehicles. We investigate challenges and solutions associated with DSM and explore the new opportunities presented by leveraging LLMs. Then, We propose an innovative solution that enhances LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation for automatic problem formulation, code generation, and customizing optimization. We present a case study to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed solution in charging scheduling and optimization for electric vehicles, highlighting our solution's significant advancements in energy efficiency and user adaptability.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The distributionally robust optimization (DRO)-based graph neural network methods improve recommendation systems' out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization by optimizing the model's worst-case performance. However, these studies fail to consider the impact of noisy samples in the training data, which results in diminished generalization capabilities and lower accuracy. Through experimental and theoretical analysis, this paper reveals that current DRO-based graph recommendation methods assign greater weight to noise distribution, leading to model parameter learning being dominated by it. When the model overly focuses on fitting noise samples in the training data, it may learn irrelevant or meaningless features that cannot be generalized to OOD data. To address this challenge, we design a Distributionally Robust Graph model for OOD recommendation (DRGO). Specifically, our method first employs a simple and effective diffusion paradigm to alleviate the noisy effect in the latent space. Additionally, an entropy regularization term is introduced in the DRO objective function to avoid extreme sample weights in the worst-case distribution. Finally, we provide a theoretical proof of the generalization error bound of DRGO as well as a theoretical analysis of how our approach mitigates noisy sample effects, which helps to better understand the proposed framework from a theoretical perspective. We conduct extensive experiments on four datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of our framework against three typical distribution shifts, and the results demonstrate its superiority in both independently and identically distributed distributions (IID) and OOD.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large-scale text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved remarkable generative performance about various concepts. With the limitation of privacy and safety in practice, the generative capability concerning NSFW (Not Safe For Work) concepts is undesirable, e.g., producing sexually explicit photos, and licensed images. The concept erasure task for T2I diffusion models has attracted considerable attention and requires an effective and efficient method. To achieve this goal, we propose a CE-SDWV framework, which removes the target concepts (e.g., NSFW concepts) of T2I diffusion models in the text semantic space by only adjusting the text condition tokens and does not need to re-train the original T2I diffusion model's weights. Specifically, our framework first builds a target concept-related word vocabulary to enhance the representation of the target concepts within the text semantic space, and then utilizes an adaptive semantic component suppression strategy to ablate the target concept-related semantic information in the text condition tokens. To further adapt the above text condition tokens to the original image semantic space, we propose an end-to-end gradient-orthogonal token optimization strategy. Extensive experiments on I2P and UnlearnCanvas benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As is known, hybrid quadratic and subquadratic attention models in multi-head architectures have surpassed both Transformer and Linear RNN models , with these works primarily focusing on reducing KV complexity and improving efficiency. For further research on expressiveness, we introduce our series of models distilled from Qwen 2.5, based on pure native RWKV-7 attention, which aims to make RNN more expressive and demonstrates state tracking ability beyond transformers. We work with QRWK 32B based on RWKV-6 architecture, another approach that reduces the entire knowledge processing time to just 8 hours using 16 AMD MI300X GPUs while maintaining Qwen 2.5's performance. In fact, the distillation process can utilize any LLM, not just Qwen, and enables knowledge transfer from larger LLMs to smaller ones with more fewer tokens. We will explain the detailed process and share our insights on building more powerful foundation models. Please note that this is an ongoing work that will be updated continuously.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Fashion content generation is an emerging area at the intersection of artificial intelligence and creative design, with applications ranging from virtual try-on to culturally diverse design prototyping. Existing methods often struggle with cultural bias, limited scalability, and alignment between textual prompts and generated visuals, particularly under weak supervision. In this work, we propose a novel framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) to address these challenges. Our method leverages LLMs for semantic refinement of textual prompts and introduces a weak supervision filtering module to effectively utilize noisy or weakly labeled data. By fine-tuning the LDM on an enhanced DeepFashion+ dataset enriched with global fashion styles, the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baselines, achieving lower Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and higher Inception Scores (IS), while human evaluations confirm its ability to generate culturally diverse and semantically relevant fashion content. These results highlight the potential of LLM-guided diffusion models in driving scalable and inclusive AI-driven fashion innovation.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Story understanding and generation have long been a challenging task in natural language processing (NLP), especially when dealing with various levels of instruction specificity. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called "Weak to Strong Instruction Tuning" for improving story generation by tuning models with instructions of varying clarity. We explore the potential of large language models (LLMs) to adapt to different types of instructions, weak and strong, and show that our method significantly enhances performance in story comprehension and generation. By leveraging the strength of instruction tuning, we train models to understand the nuances of story plots, characters, and themes while generating coherent and engaging narratives. Through extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets and comparison with state-of-the-art baselines, we demonstrate that our method outperforms existing techniques, yielding substantial improvements in both automatic evaluation metrics and human evaluations. Our work shows that adaptive instruction tuning can be a powerful tool in refining generative models for complex narrative tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Given a pair of images depicting a person and a garment separately, image-based 3D virtual try-on methods aim to reconstruct a 3D human model that realistically portrays the person wearing the desired garment. In this paper, we present IPVTON, a novel image-based 3D virtual try-on framework. IPVTON employs score distillation sampling with image prompts to optimize a hybrid 3D human representation, integrating target garment features into diffusion priors through an image prompt adapter. To avoid interference with non-target areas, we leverage mask-guided image prompt embeddings to focus the image features on the try-on regions. Moreover, we impose geometric constraints on the 3D model with a pseudo silhouette generated by ControlNet, ensuring that the clothed 3D human model retains the shape of the source identity while accurately wearing the target garments. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that IPVTON outperforms previous methods in image-based 3D virtual try-on tasks, excelling in both geometry and texture.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The stories and characters that captivate us as we grow up shape unique fantasy worlds, with images serving as the primary medium for visually experiencing these realms. Personalizing generative models through fine-tuning with theme-specific data has become a prevalent approach in text-to-image generation. However, unlike object customization, which focuses on learning specific objects, theme-specific generation encompasses diverse elements such as characters, scenes, and objects. Such diversity also introduces a key challenge: how to adaptively generate multi-character, multi-concept, and continuous theme-specific images (TSI). Moreover, fine-tuning approaches often come with significant computational overhead, time costs, and risks of overfitting. This paper explores a fundamental question: Can image generation models directly leverage images as contextual input, similarly to how large language models use text as context? To address this, we present T-Prompter, a novel training-free TSI method for generation. T-Prompter introduces visual prompting, a mechanism that integrates reference images into generative models, allowing users to seamlessly specify the target theme without requiring additional training. To further enhance this process, we propose a Dynamic Visual Prompting (DVP) mechanism, which iteratively optimizes visual prompts to improve the accuracy and quality of generated images. Our approach enables diverse applications, including consistent story generation, character design, realistic character generation, and style-guided image generation. Comparative evaluations against state-of-the-art personalization methods demonstrate that T-Prompter achieves significantly better results and excels in maintaining character identity preserving, style consistency and text alignment, offering a robust and flexible solution for theme-specific image generation.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent pose-transfer methods aim to generate temporally consistent and fully controllable videos of human action where the motion from a reference video is reenacted by a new identity. We evaluate three state-of-the-art pose-transfer methods -- AnimateAnyone, MagicAnimate, and ExAvatar -- by generating videos with actions and identities outside the training distribution and conducting a participant study about the quality of these videos. In a controlled environment of 20 distinct human actions, we find that participants, presented with the pose-transferred videos, correctly identify the desired action only 42.92% of the time. Moreover, the participants find the actions in the generated videos consistent with the reference (source) videos only 36.46% of the time. These results vary by method: participants find the splatting-based ExAvatar more consistent and photorealistic than the diffusion-based AnimateAnyone and MagicAnimate.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep latent variable models (DLVMs) are designed to learn meaningful representations in an unsupervised manner, such that the hidden explanatory factors are interpretable by independent latent variables (aka disentanglement). The variational autoencoder (VAE) is a popular DLVM widely studied in disentanglement analysis due to the modeling of the posterior distribution using a factorized Gaussian distribution that encourages the alignment of the latent factors with the latent axes. Several metrics have been proposed recently, assuming that the latent variables explaining the variation in data are aligned with the latent axes (cardinal directions). However, there are other DLVMs, such as the AAE and WAE-MMD (matching the aggregate posterior to the prior), where the latent variables might not be aligned with the latent axes. In this work, we propose a statistical method to evaluate disentanglement for any DLVMs in general. The proposed technique discovers the latent vectors representing the generative factors of a dataset that can be different from the cardinal latent axes. We empirically demonstrate the advantage of the method on two datasets.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Classification tasks are widely investigated in the In-Context Learning (ICL) paradigm. However, current efforts are evaluated on disjoint benchmarks and settings, while their performances are significantly influenced by some trivial variables, such as prompt templates, data sampling, instructions, etc., which leads to significant inconsistencies in the results reported across various literature, preventing fair comparison or meta-analysis across different papers. Therefore, this paper proposes a standardized and easy-to-use evaluation toolkit (StaICC) for in-context classification. Including, for the normal classification task, we provide StaICC-Normal, selecting 10 widely used datasets, and generating prompts with a fixed form, to mitigate the variance among the experiment implementations. To enrich the usage of our benchmark, we also provide a sub-benchmark StaICC-Diag for diagnosing ICL from several aspects, aiming for a more robust inference processing.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Computational pathology foundation models (CPathFMs) have emerged as a powerful approach for analyzing histopathological data, leveraging self-supervised learning to extract robust feature representations from unlabeled whole-slide images. These models, categorized into uni-modal and multi-modal frameworks, have demonstrated promise in automating complex pathology tasks such as segmentation, classification, and biomarker discovery. However, the development of CPathFMs presents significant challenges, such as limited data accessibility, high variability across datasets, the necessity for domain-specific adaptation, and the lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks. This survey provides a comprehensive review of CPathFMs in computational pathology, focusing on datasets, adaptation strategies, and evaluation tasks. We analyze key techniques, such as contrastive learning and multi-modal integration, and highlight existing gaps in current research. Finally, we explore future directions from four perspectives for advancing CPathFMs. This survey serves as a valuable resource for researchers, clinicians, and AI practitioners, guiding the advancement of CPathFMs toward robust and clinically applicable AI-driven pathology solutions.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The growing importance of textual and relational systems has driven interest in enhancing large language models (LLMs) for graph-structured data, particularly Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs), where samples are represented by textual descriptions interconnected by edges. While research has largely focused on developing specialized graph LLMs through task-specific instruction tuning, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs solely through prompt design remains surprisingly absent. Without such a carefully crafted evaluation benchmark, most if not all, tailored graph LLMs are compared against general LLMs using simplistic queries (e.g., zero-shot reasoning with LLaMA), which can potentially camouflage many advantages as well as unexpected predicaments of them. To achieve more general evaluations and unveil the true potential of LLMs for graph tasks, we introduce Graph In-context Learning (GraphICL) Benchmark, a comprehensive benchmark comprising novel prompt templates designed to capture graph structure and handle limited label knowledge. Our systematic evaluation shows that general-purpose LLMs equipped with our GraphICL outperform state-of-the-art specialized graph LLMs and graph neural network models in resource-constrained settings and out-of-domain tasks. These findings highlight the significant potential of prompt engineering to enhance LLM performance on graph learning tasks without training and offer a strong baseline for advancing research in graph LLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text-to-Image (T2I) models have recently gained significant attention due to their ability to generate high-quality images and are consequently used in a wide range of applications. However, there are concerns about the gender bias of these models. Previous studies have shown that T2I models can perpetuate or even amplify gender stereotypes when provided with neutral text prompts. Researchers have proposed automated gender bias uncovering detectors for T2I models, but a crucial gap exists: no existing work comprehensively compares the various detectors and understands how the gender bias detected by them deviates from the actual situation. This study addresses this gap by validating previous gender bias detectors using a manually labeled dataset and comparing how the bias identified by various detectors deviates from the actual bias in T2I models, as verified by manual confirmation. We create a dataset consisting of 6,000 images generated from three cutting-edge T2I models: Stable Diffusion XL, Stable Diffusion 3, and Dreamlike Photoreal 2.0. During the human-labeling process, we find that all three T2I models generate a portion (12.48% on average) of low-quality images (e.g., generate images with no face present), where human annotators cannot determine the gender of the person. Our analysis reveals that all three T2I models show a preference for generating male images, with SDXL being the most biased. Additionally, images generated using prompts containing professional descriptions (e.g., lawyer or doctor) show the most bias. We evaluate seven gender bias detectors and find that none fully capture the actual level of bias in T2I models, with some detectors overestimating bias by up to 26.95%. We further investigate the causes of inaccurate estimations, highlighting the limitations of detectors in dealing with low-quality images. Based on our findings, we propose an enhanced detector...</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose a new finetuning method to provide pre-trained large language models (LMs) the ability to scale test-time compute through the diffusion framework. By increasing the number of diffusion steps, we show our finetuned models achieve monotonically increasing accuracy, directly translating to improved performance across downstream tasks. Furthermore, our finetuned models can expertly answer questions on specific topics by integrating powerful guidance techniques, and autonomously determine the compute required for a given problem by leveraging adaptive ODE solvers. Our method is universally applicable to any foundation model pre-trained with a cross-entropy loss and does not modify any of its original weights, fully preserving its strong single-step generation capabilities. We show our method is more effective and fully compatible with traditional finetuning approaches, introducing an orthogonal new direction to unify the strengths of the autoregressive and diffusion frameworks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful framework for generative modeling. At the heart of the methodology is score matching: learning gradients of families of log-densities for noisy versions of the data distribution at different scales. When the loss function adopted in score matching is evaluated using empirical data, rather than the population loss, the minimizer corresponds to the score of a time-dependent Gaussian mixture. However, use of this analytically tractable minimizer leads to data memorization: in both unconditioned and conditioned settings, the generative model returns the training samples. This paper contains an analysis of the dynamical mechanism underlying memorization. The analysis highlights the need for regularization to avoid reproducing the analytically tractable minimizer; and, in so doing, lays the foundations for a principled understanding of how to regularize. Numerical experiments investigate the properties of: (i) Tikhonov regularization; (ii) regularization designed to promote asymptotic consistency; and (iii) regularizations induced by under-parameterization of a neural network or by early stopping when training a neural network. These experiments are evaluated in the context of memorization, and directions for future development of regularization are highlighted.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In industrial settings, the accurate detection of anomalies is essential for maintaining product quality and ensuring operational safety. Traditional industrial anomaly detection (IAD) models often struggle with flexibility and adaptability, especially in dynamic production environments where new defect types and operational changes frequently arise. Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold promise for overcoming these limitations by combining visual and textual information processing capabilities. MLLMs excel in general visual understanding due to their training on large, diverse datasets, but they lack domain-specific knowledge, such as industry-specific defect tolerance levels, which limits their effectiveness in IAD tasks. To address these challenges, we propose Echo, a novel multi-expert framework designed to enhance MLLM performance for IAD. Echo integrates four expert modules: Reference Extractor which provides a contextual baseline by retrieving similar normal images, Knowledge Guide which supplies domain-specific insights, Reasoning Expert which enables structured, stepwise reasoning for complex queries, and Decision Maker which synthesizes information from all modules to deliver precise, context-aware responses. Evaluated on the MMAD benchmark, Echo demonstrates significant improvements in adaptability, precision, and robustness, moving closer to meeting the demands of real-world industrial anomaly detection.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vision-language pretraining (VLP) has been investigated to generalize across diverse downstream tasks for fundus image analysis. Although recent methods showcase promising achievements, they significantly rely on large-scale private image-text data but pay less attention to the pretraining manner, which limits their further advancements. In this work, we introduce MM-Retinal V2, a high-quality image-text paired dataset comprising CFP, FFA, and OCT image modalities. Then, we propose a novel fundus vision-language pretraining model, namely KeepFIT V2, which is pretrained by integrating knowledge from the elite data spark into categorical public datasets. Specifically, a preliminary textual pretraining is adopted to equip the text encoder with primarily ophthalmic textual knowledge. Moreover, a hybrid image-text knowledge injection module is designed for knowledge transfer, which is essentially based on a combination of global semantic concepts from contrastive learning and local appearance details from generative learning. Extensive experiments across zero-shot, few-shot, and linear probing settings highlight the generalization and transferability of KeepFIT V2, delivering performance competitive to state-of-the-art fundus VLP models trained on large-scale private image-text datasets.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Controllable affordance Hand-Object Interaction (HOI) generation has become an increasingly important area of research in computer vision. In HOI generation, the hand grasp generation is a crucial step for effectively controlling the geometry of the hand. Current hand grasp generation methods rely on 3D information for both the hand and the object. In addition, these methods lack controllability concerning the hand's location and orientation. We treat the hand pose as the discrete graph structure and exploit the geometric priors. It is well established that higher order contextual dependency among the points improves the quality of the results in general. We propose a framework of higher order geometric representations (HOR's) inspired by spectral graph theory and vector algebra to improve the quality of generated hand poses. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed HOR's in devising a controllable novel diffusion method (based on 2D information) for hand grasp generation that outperforms the state of the art (SOTA). Overcoming the limitations of existing methods: like lacking of controllability and dependency on 3D information. Once we have the generated pose, it is very natural to evaluate them using a metric. Popular metrics like FID and MMD are biased and inefficient for evaluating the generated hand poses. Using our proposed HOR's, we introduce an efficient and stable framework of evaluation metrics for grasp generation methods, addressing inefficiencies and biases in FID and MMD.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Publicly available satellite imagery, such as Sentinel- 2, often lacks the spatial resolution required for accurate analysis of remote sensing tasks including urban planning and disaster response. Current super-resolution techniques are typically trained on limited datasets, leading to poor generalization across diverse geographic regions. In this work, we propose a novel super-resolution framework that enhances generalization by incorporating geographic context through location embeddings. Our framework employs Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and incorporates techniques from diffusion models to enhance image quality. Furthermore, we address tiling artifacts by integrating information from neighboring images, enabling the generation of seamless, high-resolution outputs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on the building segmentation task, showing significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods and highlighting its potential for real-world applications.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present SlotAdapt, an object-centric learning method that combines slot attention with pretrained diffusion models by introducing adapters for slot-based conditioning. Our method preserves the generative power of pretrained diffusion models, while avoiding their text-centric conditioning bias. We also incorporate an additional guidance loss into our architecture to align cross-attention from adapter layers with slot attention. This enhances the alignment of our model with the objects in the input image without using external supervision. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in object discovery and image generation tasks across multiple datasets, including those with real images. Furthermore, we demonstrate through experiments that our method performs remarkably well on complex real-world images for compositional generation, in contrast to other slot-based generative methods in the literature.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>For almost 70 years, researchers have mostly relied on hyper-parameter tuning to pick the width of neural networks' layers out of many possible choices. This paper challenges the status quo by introducing an easy-to-use technique to learn an unbounded width of a neural network's layer during training. The technique does not rely on alternate optimization nor hand-crafted gradient heuristics; rather, it jointly optimizes the width and the parameters of each layer via simple backpropagation. We apply the technique to a broad range of data domains such as tables, images, texts, and graphs, showing how the width adapts to the task's difficulty. By imposing a soft ordering of importance among neurons, it is possible to truncate the trained network at virtually zero cost, achieving a smooth trade-off between performance and compute resources in a structured way. Alternatively, one can dynamically compress the network with no performance degradation. In light of recent foundation models trained on large datasets, believed to require billions of parameters and where hyper-parameter tuning is unfeasible due to huge training costs, our approach stands as a viable alternative for width learning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In recent years, foundation models have significantly advanced data-driven systems across various domains. Yet, their underlying properties, especially when functioning as feature extractors, remain under-explored. In this paper, we investigate the sensitivity to audio effects of audio embeddings extracted from widely-used foundation models, including OpenL3, PANNs, and CLAP. We focus on audio effects as the source of sensitivity due to their prevalent presence in large audio datasets. By applying parameterized audio effects (gain, low-pass filtering, reverberation, and bitcrushing), we analyze the correlation between the deformation trajectories and the effect strength in the embedding space. We propose to quantify the dimensionality and linearizability of the deformation trajectories induced by audio effects using canonical correlation analysis. We find that there exists a direction along which the embeddings move monotonically as the audio effect strength increases, but that the subspace containing the displacements is generally high-dimensional. This shows that pre-trained audio embeddings do not globally linearize the effects. Our empirical results on instrument classification downstream tasks confirm that projecting out the estimated deformation directions cannot generally improve the robustness of pre-trained embeddings to audio effects.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques have emerged as a promising solution to enhance the reliability of large language models (LLMs) by addressing issues like hallucinations, outdated knowledge, and domain adaptation. In particular, existing RAG methods append relevant documents retrieved from external corpus or databases to the input of LLMs to guide their generation process, which we refer to as the in-context knowledge injection method. While this approach is simple and often effective, it has inherent limitations. Firstly, increasing the context length and number of relevant documents can lead to higher computational overhead and degraded performance, especially in complex reasoning tasks. More importantly, in-context knowledge injection operates primarily at the input level, but LLMs store their internal knowledge in their parameters. This gap fundamentally limits the capacity of in-context methods. To this end, we introduce Parametric retrieval-augmented generation (Parametric RAG), a new RAG paradigm that integrates external knowledge directly into the parameters of feed-forward networks (FFN) of an LLM through document parameterization. This approach not only saves online computational costs by eliminating the need to inject multiple documents into the LLMs' input context, but also deepens the integration of external knowledge into the parametric knowledge space of the LLM. Experimental results demonstrate that Parametric RAG substantially enhances both the effectiveness and efficiency of knowledge augmentation in LLMs. Also, it can be combined with in-context RAG methods to achieve even better performance.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Long-tailed learning has garnered increasing attention due to its practical significance. Among the various approaches, the fine-tuning paradigm has gained considerable interest with the advent of foundation models. However, most existing methods primarily focus on leveraging knowledge from these models, overlooking the inherent biases introduced by the imbalanced training data they rely on. In this paper, we examine how such imbalances from pre-training affect long-tailed downstream tasks. Specifically, we find the imbalance biases inherited in foundation models on downstream task as parameter imbalance and data imbalance. During fine-tuning, we observe that parameter imbalance plays a more critical role, while data imbalance can be mitigated using existing re-balancing strategies. Moreover, we find that parameter imbalance cannot be effectively addressed by current re-balancing techniques, such as adjusting the logits, during training, unlike data imbalance. To tackle both imbalances simultaneously, we build our method on causal learning and view the incomplete semantic factor as the confounder, which brings spurious correlations between input samples and labels. To resolve the negative effects of this, we propose a novel backdoor adjustment method that learns the true causal effect between input samples and labels, rather than merely fitting the correlations in the data. Notably, we achieve an average performance increase of about $1.67\%$ on each dataset.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Assigning realistic materials to 3D models remains a significant challenge in computer graphics. We propose MatCLIP, a novel method that extracts shape- and lighting-insensitive descriptors of Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials to assign plausible textures to 3D objects based on images, such as the output of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) or photographs. Matching PBR materials to static images is challenging because the PBR representation captures the dynamic appearance of materials under varying viewing angles, shapes, and lighting conditions. By extending an Alpha-CLIP-based model on material renderings across diverse shapes and lighting, and encoding multiple viewing conditions for PBR materials, our approach generates descriptors that bridge the domains of PBR representations with photographs or renderings, including LDM outputs. This enables consistent material assignments without requiring explicit knowledge of material relationships between different parts of an object. MatCLIP achieves a top-1 classification accuracy of 76.6%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods such as PhotoShape and MatAtlas by over 15 percentage points on publicly available datasets. Our method can be used to construct material assignments for 3D shape datasets such as ShapeNet, 3DCoMPaT++, and Objaverse. All code and data will be released.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Tropical cyclone (TC) forecasting is crucial for disaster preparedness and mitigation. While recent deep learning approaches have shown promise, existing methods often treat TC evolution as a series of independent frame-to-frame predictions, limiting their ability to capture long-term dynamics. We present a novel application of video diffusion models for TC forecasting that explicitly models temporal dependencies through additional temporal layers. Our approach enables the model to generate multiple frames simultaneously, better capturing cyclone evolution patterns. We introduce a two-stage training strategy that significantly improves individual-frame quality and performance in low-data regimes. Experimental results show our method outperforms the previous approach of Nath et al. by 19.3% in MAE, 16.2% in PSNR, and 36.1% in SSIM. Most notably, we extend the reliable forecasting horizon from 36 to 50 hours. Through comprehensive evaluation using both traditional metrics and Fr√©chet Video Distance (FVD), we demonstrate that our approach produces more temporally coherent forecasts while maintaining competitive single-frame quality.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper presents a novel approach for hazard analysis in dashcam footage, addressing the detection of driver reactions to hazards, the identification of hazardous objects, and the generation of descriptive captions. We first introduce a method for detecting driver reactions through speed and sound anomaly detection, leveraging unsupervised learning techniques. For hazard detection, we employ a set of heuristic rules as weak classifiers, which are combined using an ensemble method. This ensemble approach is further refined with differential privacy to mitigate overconfidence, ensuring robustness despite the lack of labeled data. Lastly, we use state-of-the-art vision-language models for hazard captioning, generating descriptive labels for the detected hazards. Our method achieved the highest scores in the Challenge on Out-of-Label in Autonomous Driving, demonstrating its effectiveness across all three tasks.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Using agent-based social simulations can enhance our understanding of urban planning, public health, and economic forecasting. Realistic synthetic populations with numerous attributes strengthen these simulations. The Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network, trained on census data like EU-SILC, can create robust synthetic populations. These methods, aided by external statistics or EU-SILC weights, generate spatial synthetic populations for agent-based models. The increased access to high-quality micro-data has sparked interest in synthetic populations, which preserve demographic profiles and analytical strength while ensuring privacy and preventing discrimination. This study uses national data from Finland and Greece for Helsinki and Thessaloniki to explore balanced spatial synthetic population generation. Results show challenges related to balancing data with or without aggregated statistics for the target population and the general under-representation of fringe profiles by deep generative methods. The latter can lead to discrimination in agent-based simulations.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Learning effective deep portrait matting models requires training data of both high quality and large quantity. Neither quality nor quantity can be easily met for portrait matting, however. Since the most accurate ground-truth portrait mattes are acquired in front of the green screen, it is almost impossible to harvest a large-scale portrait matting dataset in reality. This work shows that one can leverage text prompts and the recent Layer Diffusion model to generate high-quality portrait foregrounds and extract latent portrait mattes. However, the portrait mattes cannot be readily in use due to significant generation artifacts. Inspired by the connectivity priors observed in portrait images, that is, the border of portrait foregrounds always appears connected, a connectivity-aware approach is introduced to refine portrait mattes. Building on this, a large-scale portrait matting dataset is created, termed LD-Portrait-20K, with $20,051$ portrait foregrounds and high-quality alpha mattes. Extensive experiments demonstrated the value of the LD-Portrait-20K dataset, with models trained on it significantly outperforming those trained on other datasets. In addition, comparisons with the chroma keying algorithm and an ablation study on dataset capacity further confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed matte creation approach. Further, the dataset also contributes to state-of-the-art video portrait matting, implemented by simple video segmentation and a trimap-based image matting model trained on this dataset.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a powerful deep learning method capable of providing solutions and parameter estimations of physical systems. Given the complexity of their neural network structure, the convergence speed is still limited compared to numerical methods, mainly when used in applications that model realistic systems. The network initialization follows a random distribution of the initial weights, as in the case of traditional neural networks, which could lead to severe model convergence bottlenecks. To overcome this problem, we follow current studies that deal with optimal initial weights in traditional neural networks. In this paper, we use a convex optimization model to improve the initialization of the weights in PINNs and accelerate convergence. We investigate two optimization models as a first training step, defined as pre-training, one involving only the boundaries and one including physics. The optimization is focused on the first layer of the neural network part of the PINN model, while the other weights are randomly initialized. We test the methods using a practical application of the heat diffusion equation to model the temperature distribution of power transformers. The PINN model with boundary pre-training is the fastest converging method at the current stage.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While recent advancements have shown remarkable progress in general 3D shape generation models, the challenge of leveraging these approaches to automatically generate wearable 3D assets remains unexplored. To this end, we present BAG, a Body-aligned Asset Generation method to output 3D wearable asset that can be automatically dressed on given 3D human bodies. This is achived by controlling the 3D generation process using human body shape and pose information. Specifically, we first build a general single-image to consistent multiview image diffusion model, and train it on the large Objaverse dataset to achieve diversity and generalizability. Then we train a Controlnet to guide the multiview generator to produce body-aligned multiview images. The control signal utilizes the multiview 2D projections of the target human body, where pixel values represent the XYZ coordinates of the body surface in a canonical space. The body-conditioned multiview diffusion generates body-aligned multiview images, which are then fed into a native 3D diffusion model to produce the 3D shape of the asset. Finally, by recovering the similarity transformation using multiview silhouette supervision and addressing asset-body penetration with physics simulators, the 3D asset can be accurately fitted onto the target human body. Experimental results demonstrate significant advantages over existing methods in terms of image prompt-following capability, shape diversity, and shape quality.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Activities in underwater environments are paramount in several scenarios, which drives the continuous development of underwater image enhancement techniques. A major challenge in this domain is the depth at which images are captured, with increasing depth resulting in a darker environment. Most existing methods for underwater image enhancement focus on noise removal and color adjustment, with few works dedicated to brightness enhancement. This work introduces a novel unsupervised learning approach to underwater image enhancement using a diffusion model. Our method, called UDBE, is based on conditional diffusion to maintain the brightness details of the unpaired input images. The input image is combined with a color map and a Signal-Noise Relation map (SNR) to ensure stable training and prevent color distortion in the output images. The results demonstrate that our approach achieves an impressive accuracy rate in the datasets UIEB, SUIM and RUIE, well-established underwater image benchmarks. Additionally, the experiments validate the robustness of our approach, regarding the image quality metrics PSNR, SSIM, UIQM, and UISM, indicating the good performance of the brightness enhancement process.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In recent years, the advent of foundation models (FM) for digital pathology has relied heavily on scaling the pre-training datasets and the model size, yielding large and powerful models. While it resulted in improving the performance on diverse downstream tasks, it also introduced increased computational cost and inference time. In this work, we explore the distillation of a large foundation model into a smaller one, reducing the number of parameters by several orders of magnitude. Leveraging distillation techniques, our distilled model, H0-mini, achieves nearly comparable performance to large FMs at a significantly reduced inference cost. It is evaluated on several public benchmarks, achieving 3rd place on the HEST benchmark and 5th place on the EVA benchmark. Additionally, a robustness analysis conducted on the PLISM dataset demonstrates that our distilled model reaches excellent robustness to variations in staining and scanning conditions, significantly outperforming other state-of-the art models. This opens new perspectives to design lightweight and robust models for digital pathology, without compromising on performance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Brain tumor segmentation is important for diagnosis of the tumor, and current deep-learning methods rely on a large set of annotated images for training, with high annotation costs. Unsupervised segmentation is promising to avoid human annotations while the performance is often limited. In this study, we present a novel unsupervised segmentation approach that leverages the capabilities of foundation models, and it consists of three main steps: (1) A vision-language model (i.e., CLIP) is employed to obtain image-level pseudo-labels for training a classification network. Class Activation Mapping (CAM) is then employed to extract Regions of Interest (ROIs), where an adaptive masking-based data augmentation is used to enhance ROI identification.(2) The ROIs are used to generate bounding box and point prompts for the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to obtain segmentation pseudo-labels. (3) A 3D segmentation network is trained with the SAM-derived pseudo-labels, where low-quality pseudo-labels are filtered out in a self-learning process based on the similarity between the SAM's output and the network's prediction. Evaluation on the BraTS2020 dataset demonstrates that our approach obtained an average Dice Similarity Score (DSC) of 85.60%, outperforming five state-of-the-art unsupervised segmentation methods by more than 10 percentage points. Besides, our approach outperforms directly using SAM for zero-shot inference, and its performance is close to fully supervised learning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Systematic literature review is essential for evidence-based medicine, requiring comprehensive analysis of clinical trial publications. However, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) models for medical literature mining has been limited by insufficient training and evaluation across broad therapeutic areas and diverse tasks. Here, we present LEADS, an AI foundation model for study search, screening, and data extraction from medical literature. The model is trained on 633,759 instruction data points in LEADSInstruct, curated from 21,335 systematic reviews, 453,625 clinical trial publications, and 27,015 clinical trial registries. We showed that LEADS demonstrates consistent improvements over four cutting-edge generic large language models (LLMs) on six tasks. Furthermore, LEADS enhances expert workflows by providing supportive references following expert requests, streamlining processes while maintaining high-quality results. A study with 16 clinicians and medical researchers from 14 different institutions revealed that experts collaborating with LEADS achieved a recall of 0.81 compared to 0.77 experts working alone in study selection, with a time savings of 22.6%. In data extraction tasks, experts using LEADS achieved an accuracy of 0.85 versus 0.80 without using LEADS, alongside a 26.9% time savings. These findings highlight the potential of specialized medical literature foundation models to outperform generic models, delivering significant quality and efficiency benefits when integrated into expert workflows for medical literature mining.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While attention-based models have demonstrated the remarkable ability of in-context learning, the theoretical understanding of how these models acquired this ability through gradient descent training is still preliminary. Towards answering this question, we study the gradient descent dynamics of multi-head linear self-attention trained for in-context linear regression. We examine two parametrizations of linear self-attention: one with the key and query weights merged as a single matrix (common in theoretical studies), and one with separate key and query matrices (closer to practical settings). For the merged parametrization, we show the training dynamics has two fixed points and the loss trajectory exhibits a single, abrupt drop. We derive an analytical time-course solution for a certain class of datasets and initialization. For the separate parametrization, we show the training dynamics has exponentially many fixed points and the loss exhibits saddle-to-saddle dynamics, which we reduce to scalar ordinary differential equations. During training, the model implements principal component regression in context with the number of principal components increasing over training time. Overall, we characterize how in-context learning abilities evolve during gradient descent training of linear attention, revealing dynamics of abrupt acquisition versus progressive improvements in models with different parametrizations.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as efficient alternatives to Transformers for sequential modeling, but their inability to leverage modality-specific features limits their performance in multi-modal pretraining. Here, we propose Mixture-of-Mamba, a novel SSM architecture that introduces modality-aware sparsity through modality-specific parameterization of the Mamba block. Building on Mixture-of-Transformers (W. Liang et al. arXiv:2411.04996; 2024), we extend the benefits of modality-aware sparsity to SSMs while preserving their computational efficiency. We evaluate Mixture-of-Mamba across three multi-modal pretraining settings: Transfusion (interleaved text and continuous image tokens with diffusion loss), Chameleon (interleaved text and discrete image tokens), and an extended three-modality framework incorporating speech. Mixture-of-Mamba consistently reaches the same loss values at earlier training steps with significantly reduced computational costs. In the Transfusion setting, Mixture-of-Mamba achieves equivalent image loss using only 34.76% of the training FLOPs at the 1.4B scale. In the Chameleon setting, Mixture-of-Mamba reaches similar image loss with just 42.50% of the FLOPs at the 1.4B scale, and similar text loss with just 65.40% of the FLOPs. In the three-modality setting, MoM matches speech loss at 24.80% of the FLOPs at the 1.4B scale. Our ablation study highlights the synergistic effects of decoupling projection components, where joint decoupling yields greater gains than individual modifications. These results establish modality-aware sparsity as a versatile and effective design principle, extending its impact from Transformers to SSMs and setting new benchmarks in multi-modal pretraining.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Autonomous aerial monitoring is an important task aimed at gathering information from areas that may not be easily accessible by humans. At the same time, this task often requires recognizing anomalies from a significant distance or not previously encountered in the past. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages the advanced capabilities provided by Large Language Models (LLMs) to actively collect information and perform anomaly detection in novel scenes. To this end, we propose an LLM based model dialogue approach, in which two deep learning models engage in a dialogue to actively control a drone to increase perception and anomaly detection accuracy. We conduct our experiments in a high fidelity simulation environment where an LLM is provided with a predetermined set of natural language movement commands mapped into executable code functions. Additionally, we deploy a multimodal Visual Question Answering (VQA) model charged with the task of visual question answering and captioning. By engaging the two models in conversation, the LLM asks exploratory questions while simultaneously flying a drone into different parts of the scene, providing a novel way to implement active perception. By leveraging LLMs reasoning ability, we output an improved detailed description of the scene going beyond existing static perception approaches. In addition to information gathering, our approach is utilized for anomaly detection and our results demonstrate the proposed methods effectiveness in informing and alerting about potential hazards.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in image generation and editing, with recent advancements enabling albedo-preserving image relighting. However, applying these models to video relighting remains challenging due to the lack of paired video relighting datasets and the high demands for output fidelity and temporal consistency, further complicated by the inherent randomness of diffusion models. To address these challenges, we introduce RelightVid, a flexible framework for video relighting that can accept background video, text prompts, or environment maps as relighting conditions. Trained on in-the-wild videos with carefully designed illumination augmentations and rendered videos under extreme dynamic lighting, RelightVid achieves arbitrary video relighting with high temporal consistency without intrinsic decomposition while preserving the illumination priors of its image backbone.</li>
