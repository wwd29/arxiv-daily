<li>Summary: <p>Recent years have witnessed the remarkable performance of diffusion models in
various vision tasks. However, for image restoration that aims to recover clear
images with sharper details from given degraded observations, diffusion-based
methods may fail to recover promising results due to inaccurate noise
estimation. Moreover, simple constraining noises cannot effectively learn
complex degradation information, which subsequently hinders the model capacity.
To solve the above problems, we propose a coarse-to-fine diffusion Transformer
(C2F-DFT) for image restoration. Specifically, our C2F-DFT contains diffusion
self-attention (DFSA) and diffusion feed-forward network (DFN) within a new
coarse-to-fine training scheme. The DFSA and DFN respectively capture the
long-range diffusion dependencies and learn hierarchy diffusion representation
to facilitate better restoration. In the coarse training stage, our C2F-DFT
estimates noises and then generates the final clean image by a sampling
algorithm. To further improve the restoration quality, we propose a simple yet
effective fine training scheme. It first exploits the coarse-trained diffusion
model with fixed steps to generate restoration results, which then would be
constrained with corresponding ground-truth ones to optimize the models to
remedy the unsatisfactory results affected by inaccurate noise estimation.
Extensive experiments show that C2F-DFT significantly outperforms
diffusion-based restoration method IR-SDE and achieves competitive performance
compared with Transformer-based state-of-the-art methods on $3$ tasks,
including deraining, deblurring, and real denoising.

<li>Summary: <p>Denoising diffusion models have enabled high-quality image generation and
editing. We present a method to localize the desired edit region implicit in a
text instruction. We leverage InstructPix2Pix (IP2P) and identify the
discrepancy between IP2P predictions with and without the instruction. This
discrepancy is referred to as the relevance map. The relevance map conveys the
importance of changing each pixel to achieve the edits, and is used to to guide
the modifications. This guidance ensures that the irrelevant pixels remain
unchanged. Relevance maps are further used to enhance the quality of
text-guided editing of 3D scenes in the form of neural radiance fields. A field
is trained on relevance maps of training views, denoted as the relevance field,
defining the 3D region within which modifications should be made. We perform
iterative updates on the training views guided by rendered relevance maps from
the relevance field. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
image and NeRF editing tasks. Project page:

<li>Summary: <p>Keyphrase extraction (KPE) is an important task in Natural Language
Processing for many scenarios, which aims to extract keyphrases that are
present in a given document. Many existing supervised methods treat KPE as
sequential labeling, span-level classification, or generative tasks. However,
these methods lack the ability to utilize keyphrase information, which may
result in biased results. In this study, we propose Diff-KPE, which leverages
the supervised Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) to guide the text
diffusion process for generating enhanced keyphrase representations. Diff-KPE
first generates the desired keyphrase embeddings conditioned on the entire
document and then injects the generated keyphrase embeddings into each phrase
representation. A ranking network and VIB are then optimized together with rank
loss and classification loss, respectively. This design of Diff-KPE allows us
to rank each candidate phrase by utilizing both the information of keyphrases
and the document. Experiments show that Diff-KPE outperforms existing KPE
methods on a large open domain keyphrase extraction benchmark, OpenKP, and a
scientific domain dataset, KP20K.

<li>Summary: <p>Body language (BL) refers to the non-verbal communication expressed through
physical movements, gestures, facial expressions, and postures. It is a form of
communication that conveys information, emotions, attitudes, and intentions
without the use of spoken or written words. It plays a crucial role in
interpersonal interactions and can complement or even override verbal
communication. Deep multi-modal learning techniques have shown promise in
understanding and analyzing these diverse aspects of BL. The survey emphasizes
their applications to BL generation and recognition. Several common BLs are
considered i.e., Sign Language (SL), Cued Speech (CS), Co-speech (CoS), and
Talking Head (TH), and we have conducted an analysis and established the
connections among these four BL for the first time. Their generation and
recognition often involve multi-modal approaches. Benchmark datasets for BL
research are well collected and organized, along with the evaluation of SOTA
methods on these datasets. The survey highlights challenges such as limited
labeled data, multi-modal learning, and the need for domain adaptation to
generalize models to unseen speakers or languages. Future research directions
are presented, including exploring self-supervised learning techniques,
integrating contextual information from other modalities, and exploiting
large-scale pre-trained multi-modal models. In summary, this survey paper
provides a comprehensive understanding of deep multi-modal learning for various
BL generations and recognitions for the first time. By analyzing advancements,
challenges, and future directions, it serves as a valuable resource for
researchers and practitioners in advancing this field. n addition, we maintain
a continuously updated paper list for deep multi-modal learning for BL
recognition and generation: https://github.com/wentaoL86/awesome-body-language.

<li>Summary: <p>Due to the prevalence of scale variance in nature images, we propose to use
image scale as a self-supervised signal for Masked Image Modeling (MIM). Our
method involves selecting random patches from the input image and downsampling
them to a low-resolution format. Our framework utilizes the latest advances in
super-resolution (SR) to design the prediction head, which reconstructs the
input from low-resolution clues and other patches. After 400 epochs of
pre-training, our Super Resolution Masked Autoencoders (SRMAE) get an accuracy
of 82.1% on the ImageNet-1K task. Image scale signal also allows our SRMAE to
capture scale invariance representation. For the very low resolution (VLR)
recognition task, our model achieves the best performance, surpassing DeriveNet
by 1.3%. Our method also achieves an accuracy of 74.84% on the task of
recognizing low-resolution facial expressions, surpassing the current
state-of-the-art FMD by 9.48%.

<li>Summary: <p>This paper aims to learn a domain-generalizable (DG) person re-identification
(ReID) representation from large-scale videos \textbf{without any annotation}.
Prior DG ReID methods employ limited labeled data for training due to the high
cost of annotation, which restricts further advances. To overcome the barriers
of data and annotation, we propose to utilize large-scale unsupervised data for
training. The key issue lies in how to mine identity information. To this end,
we propose an Identity-seeking Self-supervised Representation learning (ISR)
method. ISR constructs positive pairs from inter-frame images by modeling the
instance association as a maximum-weight bipartite matching problem. A
reliability-guided contrastive loss is further presented to suppress the
adverse impact of noisy positive pairs, ensuring that reliable positive pairs
dominate the learning process. The training cost of ISR scales approximately
linearly with the data size, making it feasible to utilize large-scale data for
training. The learned representation exhibits superior generalization ability.
\textbf{Without human annotation and fine-tuning, ISR achieves 87.0\% Rank-1 on
Market-1501 and 56.4\% Rank-1 on MSMT17}, outperforming the best supervised
domain-generalizable method by 5.0\% and 19.5\%, respectively. In the
pre-training$\rightarrow$fine-tuning scenario, ISR achieves state-of-the-art
performance, with 88.4\% Rank-1 on MSMT17. The code is at

<li>Summary: <p>Using language models (LMs) pre-trained in a self-supervised setting on large
corpora and then fine-tuning for a downstream task has helped to deal with the
problem of limited label data for supervised learning tasks such as Named
Entity Recognition (NER). Recent research in biomedical language processing has
offered a number of biomedical LMs pre-trained using different methods and
techniques that advance results on many BioNLP tasks, including NER. However,
there is still a lack of a comprehensive comparison of pre-training approaches
that would work more optimally in the biomedical domain. This paper aims to
investigate different pre-training methods, such as pre-training the biomedical
LM from scratch and pre-training it in a continued fashion. We compare existing
methods with our proposed pre-training method of initializing weights for new
tokens by distilling existing weights from the BERT model inside the context
where the tokens were found. The method helps to speed up the pre-training
stage and improve performance on NER. In addition, we compare how masking rate,
corruption strategy, and masking strategies impact the performance of the
biomedical LM. Finally, using the insights from our experiments, we introduce a
new biomedical LM (BIOptimus), which is pre-trained using Curriculum Learning
(CL) and contextualized weight distillation method. Our model sets new states
of the art on several biomedical Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks. We
release our code and all pre-trained models

<li>Summary: <p>The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a powerful foundation model that has
revolutionised image segmentation. To apply SAM to surgical instrument
segmentation, a common approach is to locate precise points or boxes of
instruments and then use them as prompts for SAM in a zero-shot manner.
However, we observe two problems with this naive pipeline: (1) the domain gap
between natural objects and surgical instruments leads to poor generalisation
of SAM; and (2) SAM relies on precise point or box locations for accurate
segmentation, requiring either extensive manual guidance or a well-performing
specialist detector for prompt preparation, which leads to a complex
multi-stage pipeline. To address these problems, we introduce SurgicalSAM, a
novel end-to-end efficient-tuning approach for SAM to effectively integrate
surgical-specific information with SAM's pre-trained knowledge for improved
generalisation. Specifically, we propose a lightweight prototype-based class
prompt encoder for tuning, which directly generates prompt embeddings from
class prototypes and eliminates the use of explicit prompts for improved
robustness and a simpler pipeline. In addition, to address the low inter-class
variance among surgical instrument categories, we propose contrastive prototype
learning, further enhancing the discrimination of the class prototypes for more
accurate class prompting. The results of extensive experiments on both
EndoVis2018 and EndoVis2017 datasets demonstrate that SurgicalSAM achieves
state-of-the-art performance while only requiring a small number of tunable
parameters. The source code will be released at

<li>Summary: <p>Deep generative models require large amounts of training data. This often
poses a problem as the collection of datasets can be expensive and difficult,
in particular datasets that are representative of the appropriate underlying
distribution (e.g. demographic). This introduces biases in datasets which are
further propagated in the models. We present an approach to mitigate biases in
an existing generative adversarial network by rebalancing the model
distribution. We do so by generating balanced data from an existing unbalanced
deep generative model using latent space exploration and using this data to
train a balanced generative model. Further, we propose a bias mitigation loss
function that shows improvements in the fairness metric even when trained with
unbalanced datasets. We show results for the Stylegan2 models while training on
the FFHQ dataset for racial fairness and see that the proposed approach
improves on the fairness metric by almost 5 times, whilst maintaining image
quality. We further validate our approach by applying it to an imbalanced
Cifar-10 dataset. Lastly, we argue that the traditionally used image quality
metrics such as Frechet inception distance (FID) are unsuitable for bias
mitigation problems.

<li>Summary: <p>Safety-critical applications such as autonomous vehicles and social robots
require fast computation and accurate probability density estimation on
trajectory prediction. To address both requirements, this paper presents a new
normalizing flow-based trajectory prediction model named FlowChain. FlowChain
is a stack of conditional continuously-indexed flows (CIFs) that are expressive
and allow analytical probability density computation. This analytical
computation is faster than the generative models that need additional
approximations such as kernel density estimation. Moreover, FlowChain is more
accurate than the Gaussian mixture-based models due to fewer assumptions on the
estimated density. FlowChain also allows a rapid update of estimated
probability densities. This update is achieved by adopting the \textit{newest
observed position} and reusing the flow transformations and its
log-det-jacobians that represent the \textit{motion trend}. This update is
completed in less than one millisecond because this reuse greatly omits the
computational cost. Experimental results showed our FlowChain achieved
state-of-the-art trajectory prediction accuracy compared to previous methods.
Furthermore, our FlowChain demonstrated superiority in the accuracy and speed
of density estimation. Our code is available at

<li>Summary: <p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) can improve the quality of
large language model's (LLM) outputs by aligning them with human preferences.
We propose a simple algorithm for aligning LLMs with human preferences inspired
by growing batch reinforcement learning (RL), which we call Reinforced
Self-Training (ReST). Given an initial LLM policy, ReST produces a dataset by
generating samples from the policy, which are then used to improve the LLM
policy using offline RL algorithms. ReST is more efficient than typical online
RLHF methods because the training dataset is produced offline, which allows
data reuse. While ReST is a general approach applicable to all generative
learning settings, we focus on its application to machine translation. Our
results show that ReST can substantially improve translation quality, as
measured by automated metrics and human evaluation on machine translation
benchmarks in a compute and sample-efficient manner.

<li>Summary: <p>In the past few years, cybersecurity is becoming very important due to the
rise in internet users. The internet attacks such as Denial of service (DoS)
and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks severely harm a website or
server and make them unavailable to other users. Network Monitoring and control
systems have found it challenging to identify the many classes of DoS and DDoS
attacks since each operates uniquely. Hence a powerful technique is required
for attack detection. Traditional machine learning techniques are inefficient
in handling extensive network data and cannot extract high-level features for
attack detection. Therefore, an effective deep learning-based intrusion
detection system is developed in this paper for DoS and DDoS attack
classification. This model includes various phases and starts with the Deep
Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN) based technique to
address the class imbalance issue in the dataset. Then a deep learning
algorithm based on ResNet-50 extracts the critical features for each class in
the dataset. After that, an optimized AlexNet-based classifier is implemented
for detecting the attacks separately, and the essential parameters of the
classifier are optimized using the Atom search optimization algorithm. The
proposed approach was evaluated on benchmark datasets, CCIDS2019 and UNSW-NB15,
using key classification metrics and achieved 99.37% accuracy for the UNSW-NB15
dataset and 99.33% for the CICIDS2019 dataset. The investigational results
demonstrate that the suggested approach performs superior to other competitive
techniques in identifying DoS and DDoS attacks.

<li>Summary: <p>Anomaly segmentation plays a crucial role in identifying anomalous objects
within images, which facilitates the detection of road anomalies for autonomous
driving. Although existing methods have shown impressive results in anomaly
segmentation using synthetic training data, the domain discrepancies between
synthetic training data and real test data are often neglected. To address this
issue, the Multi-Granularity Cross-Domain Alignment (MGCDA) framework is
proposed for anomaly segmentation in complex driving environments. It uniquely
combines a new Multi-source Domain Adversarial Training (MDAT) module and a
novel Cross-domain Anomaly-aware Contrastive Learning (CACL) method to boost
the generality of the model, seamlessly integrating multi-domain data at both
scene and sample levels. Multi-source domain adversarial loss and a dynamic
label smoothing strategy are integrated into the MDAT module to facilitate the
acquisition of domain-invariant features at the scene level, through
adversarial training across multiple stages. CACL aligns sample-level
representations with contrastive loss on cross-domain data, which utilizes an
anomaly-aware sampling strategy to efficiently sample hard samples and anchors.
The proposed framework has decent properties of parameter-free during the
inference stage and is compatible with other anomaly segmentation networks.
Experimental conducted on Fishyscapes and RoadAnomaly datasets demonstrate that
the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance.

<li>Summary: <p>Massive key performance indicators (KPIs) are monitored as multivariate time
series data (MTS) to ensure the reliability of the software applications and
service system. Accurately detecting the abnormality of MTS is very critical
for subsequent fault elimination. The scarcity of anomalies and manual labeling
has led to the development of various self-supervised MTS anomaly detection
(AD) methods, which optimize an overall objective/loss encompassing all
metrics' regression objectives/losses. However, our empirical study uncovers
the prevalence of conflicts among metrics' regression objectives, causing MTS
models to grapple with different losses. This critical aspect significantly
impacts detection performance but has been overlooked in existing approaches.
To address this problem, by mimicking the design of multi-gate
mixture-of-experts (MMoE), we introduce CAD, a Conflict-aware multivariate KPI
Anomaly Detection algorithm. CAD offers an exclusive structure for each metric
to mitigate potential conflicts while fostering inter-metric promotions. Upon
thorough investigation, we find that the poor performance of vanilla MMoE
mainly comes from the input-output misalignment settings of MTS formulation and
convergence issues arising from expansive tasks. To address these challenges,
we propose a straightforward yet effective task-oriented metric selection and
p&amp;s (personalized and shared) gating mechanism, which establishes CAD as the
first practicable multi-task learning (MTL) based MTS AD model. Evaluations on
multiple public datasets reveal that CAD obtains an average F1-score of 0.943
across three public datasets, notably outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

<li>Summary: <p>In-context learning (ICL) operates by showing language models (LMs) examples
of input-output pairs for a given task, i.e., demonstrations. The standard
approach for ICL is to prompt the LM with concatenated demonstrations followed
by the test input. This approach suffers from some issues. First, concatenation
offers almost no control over the contribution of each demo to the model
prediction. This can be sub-optimal when some demonstrations are irrelevant to
the test example. Second, due to the input length limit of some transformer
models, it might be infeasible to fit many examples into the context,
especially when dealing with long-input tasks. In this work, we explore
Demonstration Ensembling (DENSE) as an alternative to simple concatenation.
\model predicts outputs using subsets (i.e., buckets) of the demonstrations and
then combines the output probabilities resulting from each subset to produce
the final prediction. We study different ensembling methods using GPT-j and
experiment on 12 language tasks. Our experiments show weighted max ensembling
to outperform vanilla concatenation by as large as 2.4 average points. Code
