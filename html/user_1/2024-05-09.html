<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This study explores the generation of synthesized fingerprint images using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs). The significant obstacles in collecting real biometric data, such as privacy concerns and the demand for diverse datasets, underscore the imperative for synthetic biometric alternatives that are both realistic and varied. Despite the strides made with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in producing realistic fingerprint images, their limitations prompt us to propose DDPMs as a promising alternative. DDPMs are capable of generating images with increasing clarity and realism while maintaining diversity. Our results reveal that DiffFinger not only competes with authentic training set data in quality but also provides a richer set of biometric data, reflecting true-to-life variability. These findings mark a promising stride in biometric synthesis, showcasing the potential of DDPMs to advance the landscape of fingerprint identification and authentication systems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recognition of individual components and keypoint detection supported by instance segmentation is crucial to analyze the behavior of agents on the scene. Such systems could be used for surveillance, self-driving cars, and also for medical research, where behavior analysis of laboratory animals is used to confirm the aftereffects of a given medicine. A method capable of solving the aforementioned tasks usually requires a large amount of high-quality hand-annotated data, which takes time and money to produce. In this paper, we propose a method that alleviates the need for manual labeling of laboratory rats. To do so, first, we generate initial annotations with a computer vision-based approach, then through extensive augmentation, we train a deep neural network on the generated data. The final system is capable of instance segmentation, keypoint detection, and body part segmentation even when the objects are heavily occluded.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a valuable tool in drug design, offering the potential to propose and optimize molecules with desired properties. However, striking a balance between capability, flexibility, and reliability remains challenging due to the complexity of advanced RL algorithms and the significant reliance on specialized code. In this work, we introduce ACEGEN, a comprehensive and streamlined toolkit tailored for generative drug design, built using TorchRL, a modern decision-making library that offers efficient and thoroughly tested reusable components.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep learning-based sketch-to-clothing image generation provides the initial designs and inspiration in the fashion design processes. However, clothing generation from freehand drawing is challenging due to the sparse and ambiguous information from the drawn sketches. The current generation models may have difficulty generating detailed texture information. In this work, we propose TexControl, a sketch-based fashion generation framework that uses a two-stage pipeline to generate the fashion image corresponding to the sketch input. First, we adopt ControlNet to generate the fashion image from sketch and keep the image outline stable. Then, we use an image-to-image method to optimize the detailed textures of the generated images and obtain the final results. The evaluation results show that TexControl can generate fashion images with high-quality texture as fine-grained image generation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in diffusion-based generative modeling have led to the development of text-to-video (T2V) models that can generate high-quality videos conditioned on a text prompt. Most of these T2V models often produce single-scene video clips that depict an entity performing a particular action (e.g., `a red panda climbing a tree'). However, it is pertinent to generate multi-scene videos since they are ubiquitous in the real-world (e.g., `a red panda climbing a tree' followed by `the red panda sleeps on the top of the tree'). To generate multi-scene videos from the pretrained T2V model, we introduce Time-Aligned Captions (TALC) framework. Specifically, we enhance the text-conditioning mechanism in the T2V architecture to recognize the temporal alignment between the video scenes and scene descriptions. For instance, we condition the visual features of the earlier and later scenes of the generated video with the representations of the first scene description (e.g., `a red panda climbing a tree') and second scene description (e.g., `the red panda sleeps on the top of the tree'), respectively. As a result, we show that the T2V model can generate multi-scene videos that adhere to the multi-scene text descriptions and be visually consistent (e.g., entity and background). Further, we finetune the pretrained T2V model with multi-scene video-text data using the TALC framework. We show that the TALC-finetuned model outperforms the baseline methods by 15.5 points in the overall score, which averages visual consistency and text adherence using human evaluation.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>I explored adapting Stable Diffusion v1.5 for generating domain-specific satellite and aerial images in remote sensing. Recognizing the limitations of existing models like Midjourney and Stable Diffusion, trained primarily on natural RGB images and lacking context for remote sensing, I used the RSICD dataset to train a Stable Diffusion model with a loss of 0.2. I incorporated descriptive captions from the dataset for text-conditioning. Additionally, I created a synthetic dataset for a Land Use Land Classification (LULC) task, employing prompting techniques with RAG and ChatGPT and fine-tuning a specialized remote sensing LLM. However, I faced challenges with prompt quality and model performance. I trained a classification model (ResNet18) on the synthetic dataset achieving 49.48% test accuracy in TorchGeo to create a baseline. Quantitative evaluation through FID scores and qualitative feedback from domain experts assessed the realism and quality of the generated images and dataset. Despite extensive fine-tuning and dataset iterations, results indicated subpar image quality and realism, as indicated by high FID scores and domain-expert evaluation. These findings call attention to the potential of diffusion models in remote sensing while highlighting significant challenges related to insufficient pretraining data and computational resources.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In Re-identification (ReID), recent advancements yield noteworthy progress in both unimodal and cross-modal retrieval tasks. However, the challenge persists in developing a unified framework that could effectively handle varying multimodal data, including RGB, infrared, sketches, and textual information. Additionally, the emergence of large-scale models shows promising performance in various vision tasks but the foundation model in ReID is still blank. In response to these challenges, a novel multimodal learning paradigm for ReID is introduced, referred to as All-in-One (AIO), which harnesses a frozen pre-trained big model as an encoder, enabling effective multimodal retrieval without additional fine-tuning. The diverse multimodal data in AIO are seamlessly tokenized into a unified space, allowing the modality-shared frozen encoder to extract identity-consistent features comprehensively across all modalities. Furthermore, a meticulously crafted ensemble of cross-modality heads is designed to guide the learning trajectory. AIO is the \textbf{first} framework to perform all-in-one ReID, encompassing four commonly used modalities. Experiments on cross-modal and multimodal ReID reveal that AIO not only adeptly handles various modal data but also excels in challenging contexts, showcasing exceptional performance in zero-shot and domain generalization scenarios.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Attack knowledge graph construction seeks to convert textual cyber threat intelligence (CTI) reports into structured representations, portraying the evolutionary traces of cyber attacks. Even though previous research has proposed various methods to construct attack knowledge graphs, they generally suffer from limited generalization capability to diverse knowledge types as well as requirement of expertise in model design and tuning. Addressing these limitations, we seek to utilize Large Language Models (LLMs), which have achieved enormous success in a broad range of tasks given exceptional capabilities in both language understanding and zero-shot task fulfillment. Thus, we propose a fully automatic LLM-based framework to construct attack knowledge graphs named: AttacKG+. Our framework consists of four consecutive modules: rewriter, parser, identifier, and summarizer, each of which is implemented by instruction prompting and in-context learning empowered by LLMs. Furthermore, we upgrade the existing attack knowledge schema and propose a comprehensive version. We represent a cyber attack as a temporally unfolding event, each temporal step of which encapsulates three layers of representation, including behavior graph, MITRE TTP labels, and state summary. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that: 1) our formulation seamlessly satisfies the information needs in threat event analysis, 2) our construction framework is effective in faithfully and accurately extracting the information defined by AttacKG+, and 3) our attack graph directly benefits downstream security practices such as attack reconstruction. All the code and datasets will be released upon acceptance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Agents represent one of the most emerging applications of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI, with their effectiveness hinging on multimodal capabilities to navigate complex user environments. Conversational Health Agents (CHAs), a prime example of this, are redefining healthcare by offering nuanced support that transcends textual analysis to incorporate emotional intelligence. This paper introduces an LLM-based CHA engineered for rich, multimodal dialogue-especially in the realm of mental health support. It adeptly interprets and responds to users' emotional states by analyzing multimodal cues, thus delivering contextually aware and empathetically resonant verbal responses. Our implementation leverages the versatile openCHA framework, and our comprehensive evaluation involves neutral prompts expressed in diverse emotional tones: sadness, anger, and joy. We evaluate the consistency and repeatability of the planning capability of the proposed CHA. Furthermore, human evaluators critique the CHA's empathic delivery, with findings revealing a striking concordance between the CHA's outputs and evaluators' assessments. These results affirm the indispensable role of vocal (soon multimodal) emotion recognition in strengthening the empathetic connection built by CHAs, cementing their place at the forefront of interactive, compassionate digital health solutions.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Image Anomaly Detection has been a challenging task in Computer Vision field. The advent of Vision-Language models, particularly the rise of CLIP-based frameworks, has opened new avenues for zero-shot anomaly detection. Recent studies have explored the use of CLIP by aligning images with normal and prompt descriptions. However, the exclusive dependence on textual guidance often falls short, highlighting the critical importance of additional visual references. In this work, we introduce a Dual-Image Enhanced CLIP approach, leveraging a joint vision-language scoring system. Our methods process pairs of images, utilizing each as a visual reference for the other, thereby enriching the inference process with visual context. This dual-image strategy markedly enhanced both anomaly classification and localization performances. Furthermore, we have strengthened our model with a test-time adaptation module that incorporates synthesized anomalies to refine localization capabilities. Our approach significantly exploits the potential of vision-language joint anomaly detection and demonstrates comparable performance with current SOTA methods across various datasets.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Schrödinger bridge (SB) has emerged as the go-to method for optimizing transportation plans in diffusion models. However, SB requires estimating the intractable forward score functions, inevitably resulting in the costly implicit training loss based on simulated trajectories. To improve the scalability while preserving efficient transportation plans, we leverage variational inference to linearize the forward score functions (variational scores) of SB and restore simulation-free properties in training backward scores. We propose the variational Schrödinger diffusion model (VSDM), where the forward process is a multivariate diffusion and the variational scores are adaptively optimized for efficient transport. Theoretically, we use stochastic approximation to prove the convergence of the variational scores and show the convergence of the adaptively generated samples based on the optimal variational scores. Empirically, we test the algorithm in simulated examples and observe that VSDM is efficient in generations of anisotropic shapes and yields straighter sample trajectories compared to the single-variate diffusion. We also verify the scalability of the algorithm in real-world data and achieve competitive unconditional generation performance in CIFAR10 and conditional generation in time series modeling. Notably, VSDM no longer depends on warm-up initializations and has become tuning-friendly in training large-scale experiments.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Controllable text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models generate images conditioned on both text prompts and semantic inputs of other modalities like edge maps. Nevertheless, current controllable T2I methods commonly face challenges related to efficiency and faithfulness, especially when conditioning on multiple inputs from either the same or diverse modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel Flexible and Efficient method, FlexEControl, for controllable T2I generation. At the core of FlexEControl is a unique weight decomposition strategy, which allows for streamlined integration of various input types. This approach not only enhances the faithfulness of the generated image to the control, but also significantly reduces the computational overhead typically associated with multimodal conditioning. Our approach achieves a reduction of 41% in trainable parameters and 30% in memory usage compared with Uni-ControlNet. Moreover, it doubles data efficiency and can flexibly generate images under the guidance of multiple input conditions of various modalities.</li>

We analyse the significance of trust, privacy, and resilience for Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP), examining the diverse standards and regulations to manage these domains. We also scrutinise the co-analysis of safety and security, offering innovative approaches for their integration and emphasising the interdependence between these fields. Furthermore, we introduce a comprehensive method for CIP leveraging Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs), giving a tailored lifecycle and discussing specific applications across different critical infrastructure sectors. Lastly, we discuss potential future directions that promise to enhance the security and resilience of critical infrastructures.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The search for refining 3D LiDAR data has attracted growing interest motivated by recent techniques such as supervised learning or generative model-based methods. Existing approaches have shown the possibilities for using diffusion models to generate refined LiDAR data with high fidelity, although the performance and speed of such methods have been limited. These limitations make it difficult to execute in real-time, causing the approaches to struggle in real-world tasks such as autonomous navigation and human-robot interaction. In this work, we introduce a novel approach based on conditional diffusion models for fast and high-quality sparse-to-dense upsampling of 3D scene point clouds through an image representation. Our method employs denoising diffusion probabilistic models trained with conditional inpainting masks, which have been shown to give high performance on image completion tasks. We introduce a series of experiments, including multiple datasets, sampling steps, and conditional masks, to determine the ideal configuration, striking a balance between performance and inference speed. This paper illustrates that our method outperforms the baselines in sampling speed and quality on upsampling tasks using the KITTI-360 dataset. Furthermore, we illustrate the generalization ability of our approach by simultaneously training on real-world and synthetic datasets, introducing variance in quality and environments.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Emotion recognition is an important part of affective computing. Extracting emotional cues from human gaits yields benefits such as natural interaction, a nonintrusive nature, and remote detection. Recently, the introduction of self-supervised learning techniques offers a practical solution to the issues arising from the scarcity of labeled data in the field of gait-based emotion recognition. However, due to the limited diversity of gaits and the incompleteness of feature representations for skeletons, the existing contrastive learning methods are usually inefficient for the acquisition of gait emotions. In this paper, we propose a contrastive learning framework utilizing selective strong augmentation (SSA) for self-supervised gait-based emotion representation, which aims to derive effective representations from limited labeled gait data. First, we propose an SSA method for the gait emotion recognition task, which includes upper body jitter and random spatiotemporal mask. The goal of SSA is to generate more diverse and targeted positive samples and prompt the model to learn more distinctive and robust feature representations. Then, we design a complementary feature fusion network (CFFN) that facilitates the integration of cross-domain information to acquire topological structural and global adaptive features. Finally, we implement the distributional divergence minimization loss to supervise the representation learning of the generally and strongly augmented queries. Our approach is validated on the Emotion-Gait (E-Gait) and Emilya datasets and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods under different evaluation protocols.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Automating visual inspection in industrial production lines is essential for increasing product quality across various industries. Anomaly detection (AD) methods serve as robust tools for this purpose. However, existing public datasets primarily consist of images without anomalies, limiting the practical application of AD methods in production settings. To address this challenge, we present (1) the Valeo Anomaly Dataset (VAD), a novel real-world industrial dataset comprising 5000 images, including 2000 instances of challenging real defects across more than 20 subclasses. Acknowledging that traditional AD methods struggle with this dataset, we introduce (2) Segmentation-based Anomaly Detector (SegAD). First, SegAD leverages anomaly maps as well as segmentation maps to compute local statistics. Next, SegAD uses these statistics and an optional supervised classifier score as input features for a Boosted Random Forest (BRF) classifier, yielding the final anomaly score. Our SegAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on both VAD (+2.1% AUROC) and the VisA dataset (+0.4% AUROC). The code and the models are publicly available.</li>

          P-ICL: Point In-Context Learning for Named Entity Recognition with Large Language Models(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In recent years, the rise of large language models (LLMs) has made it possible to directly achieve named entity recognition (NER) without any demonstration samples or only using a few samples through in-context learning (ICL). However, standard ICL only helps LLMs understand task instructions, format and input-label mapping, but neglects the particularity of the NER task itself. In this paper, we propose a new prompting framework P-ICL to better achieve NER with LLMs, in which some point entities are leveraged as the auxiliary information to recognize each entity type. With such significant information, the LLM can achieve entity classification more precisely. To obtain optimal point entities for prompting LLMs, we also proposed a point entity selection method based on K-Means clustering. Our extensive experiments on some representative NER benchmarks verify the effectiveness of our proposed strategies in P-ICL and point entity selection.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the field of computer vision, self-supervised learning has emerged as a method to extract robust features from unlabeled data, where models derive labels autonomously from the data itself, without the need for manual annotation. This paper provides a comprehensive review of discriminative approaches of self-supervised learning within the domain of computer vision, examining their evolution and current status. Through an exploration of various methods including contrastive, self-distillation, knowledge distillation, feature decorrelation, and clustering techniques, we investigate how these approaches leverage the abundance of unlabeled data. Finally, we have comparison of self-supervised learning methods on the standard ImageNet classification benchmark.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have exhibited significant effectiveness in computer vision tasks, particularly in image generation. However, their notable performance heavily relies on labelled datasets, which limits their application in medical images due to the associated high-cost annotations. Current DPM-related methods for lesion detection in medical imaging, which can be categorized into two distinct approaches, primarily rely on image-level annotations. The first approach, based on anomaly detection, involves learning reference healthy brain representations and identifying anomalies based on the difference in inference results. In contrast, the second approach, resembling a segmentation task, employs only the original brain multi-modalities as prior information for generating pixel-level annotations. In this paper, our proposed model - discrepancy distribution medical diffusion (DDMD) - for lesion detection in brain MRI introduces a novel framework by incorporating distinctive discrepancy features, deviating from the conventional direct reliance on image-level annotations or the original brain modalities. In our method, the inconsistency in image-level annotations is translated into distribution discrepancies among heterogeneous samples while preserving information within homogeneous samples. This property retains pixel-wise uncertainty and facilitates an implicit ensemble of segmentation, ultimately enhancing the overall detection performance. Thorough experiments conducted on the BRATS2020 benchmark dataset containing multimodal MRI scans for brain tumour detection demonstrate the great performance of our approach in comparison to state-of-the-art methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Entropy minimization (EM) is frequently used to increase the accuracy of classification models when they're faced with new data at test time. EM is a self-supervised learning method that optimizes classifiers to assign even higher probabilities to their top predicted classes. In this paper, we analyze why EM works when adapting a model for a few steps and why it eventually fails after adapting for many steps. We show that, at first, EM causes the model to embed test images close to training images, thereby increasing model accuracy. After many steps of optimization, EM makes the model embed test images far away from the embeddings of training images, which results in a degradation of accuracy. Building upon our insights, we present a method for solving a practical problem: estimating a model's accuracy on a given arbitrary dataset without having access to its labels. Our method estimates accuracy by looking at how the embeddings of input images change as the model is optimized to minimize entropy. Experiments on 23 challenging datasets show that our method sets the SoTA with a mean absolute error of $5.75\%$, an improvement of $29.62\%$ over the previous SoTA on this task.

          Adversarial Threats to Automatic Modulation Open Set Recognition in Wireless Networks(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Automatic Modulation Open Set Recognition (AMOSR) is a crucial technological approach for cognitive radio communications, wireless spectrum management, and interference monitoring within wireless networks. Numerous studies have shown that AMR is highly susceptible to minimal perturbations carefully designed by malicious attackers, leading to misclassification of signals. However, the adversarial security issue of AMOSR has not yet been explored. This paper adopts the perspective of attackers and proposes an Open Set Adversarial Attack (OSAttack), aiming at investigating the adversarial vulnerabilities of various AMOSR methods. Initially, an adversarial threat model for AMOSR scenarios is established. Subsequently, by analyzing the decision criteria of both discriminative and generative open set recognition, OSFGSM and OSPGD are proposed to reduce the performance of AMOSR. Finally, the influence of OSAttack on AMOSR is evaluated utilizing a range of qualitative and quantitative indicators. The results indicate that despite the increased resistance of AMOSR models to conventional interference signals, they remain vulnerable to attacks by adversarial examples.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper offers a comprehensive review of artificial intelligence (AI) research in the context of real camera content acquisition for entertainment purposes and is aimed at both researchers and cinematographers. Considering the breadth of computer vision research and the lack of review papers tied to intelligent cinematography (IC), this review introduces a holistic view of the IC landscape while providing the technical insight for experts across across disciplines. We preface the main discussion with technical background on generative AI, object detection, automated camera calibration and 3-D content acquisition, and link explanatory articles to assist non-technical readers. The main discussion categorizes work by four production types: General Production, Virtual Production, Live Production and Aerial Production. Note that for Virtual Production we do not discuss research relating to virtual content acquisition, including work on automated video generation, like Stable Diffusion. Within each section, we (1) sub-classify work by the technical field of research - reflected by the subsections, and (2) evaluate the trends and challenge w.r.t to each type of production. In the final chapter, we present our concluding remarks on the greater scope of IC research and outline work that we believe has significant potential to influence the whole industry. We find that work relating to virtual production has the greatest potential to impact other mediums of production, driven by the growing interest in LED volumes/stages for in-camera virtual effects (ICVFX) and automated 3-D capture for a virtual modelling of real world scenes and actors. This is the first piece of literature to offer a structured and comprehensive examination of IC research. Consequently, we address ethical and legal concerns regarding the use of creative AI involving artists, actors and the general public, in the...</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent studies have shown that leveraging off-the-shelf or fine-tuned retrievers, capable of retrieving high-quality in-context examples, significantly improves in-context learning of English. However, adapting these methods to other languages, especially low-resource ones, presents challenges due to the scarcity of available cross-lingual retrievers and annotated data. In this paper, we introduce XAMPLER: Cross-Lingual Example Retrieval, a method tailored to tackle the challenge of cross-lingual in-context learning using only annotated English data. XAMPLER first trains a retriever with positive/negative English samples, which are constructed based on the predictions of the multilingual large language model for in-context learning. Then, the trained retriever is directly employed to retrieve English examples as few-shot examples for in-context learning of target languages. Experiments on the massively multilingual text classification benchmark of SIB200 with 176 languages demonstrate that XAMPLER substantially improves the in-context learning performance across languages.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The 3D Human Pose Estimation (3D HPE) task uses 2D images or videos to predict human joint coordinates in 3D space. Despite recent advancements in deep learning-based methods, they mostly ignore the capability of coupling accessible texts and naturally feasible knowledge of humans, missing out on valuable implicit supervision to guide the 3D HPE task. Moreover, previous efforts often study this task from the perspective of the whole human body, neglecting fine-grained guidance hidden in different body parts. To this end, we present a new Fine-Grained Prompt-Driven Denoiser based on a diffusion model for 3D HPE, named \textbf{FinePOSE}. It consists of three core blocks enhancing the reverse process of the diffusion model: (1) Fine-grained Part-aware Prompt learning (FPP) block constructs fine-grained part-aware prompts via coupling accessible texts and naturally feasible knowledge of body parts with learnable prompts to model implicit guidance. (2) Fine-grained Prompt-pose Communication (FPC) block establishes fine-grained communications between learned part-aware prompts and poses to improve the denoising quality. (3) Prompt-driven Timestamp Stylization (PTS) block integrates learned prompt embedding and temporal information related to the noise level to enable adaptive adjustment at each denoising step. Extensive experiments on public single-human pose estimation datasets show that FinePOSE outperforms state-of-the-art methods. We further extend FinePOSE to multi-human pose estimation. Achieving 34.3mm average MPJPE on the EgoHumans dataset demonstrates the potential of FinePOSE to deal with complex multi-human scenarios. Code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models are a powerful generative framework, but come with expensive inference. Existing acceleration methods often compromise image quality or fail under complex conditioning when operating in an extremely low-step regime. In this work, we propose a novel distillation framework tailored to enable high-fidelity, diverse sample generation using just one to three steps. Our approach comprises three key components: (i) Backward Distillation, which mitigates training-inference discrepancies by calibrating the student on its own backward trajectory; (ii) Shifted Reconstruction Loss that dynamically adapts knowledge transfer based on the current time step; and (iii) Noise Correction, an inference-time technique that enhances sample quality by addressing singularities in noise prediction. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method outperforms existing competitors in quantitative metrics and human evaluations. Remarkably, it achieves performance comparable to the teacher model using only three denoising steps, enabling efficient high-quality generation.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The diagnosis and treatment of chest diseases play a crucial role in maintaining human health. X-ray examination has become the most common clinical examination means due to its efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Artificial intelligence analysis methods for chest X-ray images are limited by insufficient annotation data and varying levels of annotation, resulting in weak generalization ability and difficulty in clinical dissemination. Here we present EVA-X, an innovative foundational model based on X-ray images with broad applicability to various chest disease detection tasks. EVA-X is the first X-ray image based self-supervised learning method capable of capturing both semantic and geometric information from unlabeled images for universal X-ray image representation. Through extensive experimentation, EVA-X has demonstrated exceptional performance in chest disease analysis and localization, becoming the first model capable of spanning over 20 different chest diseases and achieving leading results in over 11 different detection tasks in the medical field. Additionally, EVA-X significantly reduces the burden of data annotation in the medical AI field, showcasing strong potential in the domain of few-shot learning. The emergence of EVA-X will greatly propel the development and application of foundational medical models, bringing about revolutionary changes in future medical research and clinical practice.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion Models (DMs) have exhibited superior performance in generating high-quality and diverse images. However, this exceptional performance comes at the cost of expensive architectural design, particularly due to the attention module heavily used in leading models. Existing works mainly adopt a retraining process to enhance DM efficiency. This is computationally expensive and not very scalable. To this end, we introduce the Attention-driven Training-free Efficient Diffusion Model (AT-EDM) framework that leverages attention maps to perform run-time pruning of redundant tokens, without the need for any retraining. Specifically, for single-denoising-step pruning, we develop a novel ranking algorithm, Generalized Weighted Page Rank (G-WPR), to identify redundant tokens, and a similarity-based recovery method to restore tokens for the convolution operation. In addition, we propose a Denoising-Steps-Aware Pruning (DSAP) approach to adjust the pruning budget across different denoising timesteps for better generation quality. Extensive evaluations show that AT-EDM performs favorably against prior art in terms of efficiency (e.g., 38.8% FLOPs saving and up to 1.53x speed-up over Stable Diffusion XL) while maintaining nearly the same FID and CLIP scores as the full model.
