<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the domain of emotion recognition using body motion, the primary challenge lies in the scarcity of diverse and generalizable datasets. Automatic emotion recognition uses machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques to recognize a person's emotional state from various data types, such as text, images, sound, and body motion. Body motion poses unique challenges as many factors, such as age, gender, ethnicity, personality, and illness, affect its appearance, leading to a lack of diverse and robust datasets specifically for emotion recognition. To address this, employing Synthetic Data Generation (SDG) methods, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Auto Encoders (VAEs), offers potential solutions, though these methods are often complex. This research introduces a novel application of the Neural Gas Network (NGN) algorithm for synthesizing body motion data and optimizing diversity and generation speed. By learning skeletal structure topology, the NGN fits the neurons or gas particles on body joints. Generated gas particles, which form the skeletal structure later on, will be used to synthesize the new body posture. By attaching body postures over frames, the final synthetic body motion appears. We compared our generated dataset against others generated by GANs, VAEs, and another benchmark algorithm, using benchmark metrics such as Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID), Diversity, and a few more. Furthermore, we continued evaluation using classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and a few others. Joint-related features or kinematic parameters were extracted, and the system assessed model performance against unseen data. Our findings demonstrate that the NGN algorithm produces more realistic and emotionally distinct body motion data and does so with more synthesizing speed than existing methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Speech-driven 3D talking face method should offer both accurate lip synchronization and controllable expressions. Previous methods solely adopt discrete emotion labels to globally control expressions throughout sequences while limiting flexible fine-grained facial control within the spatiotemporal domain. We propose a diffusion-transformer-based 3D talking face generation model, Cafe-Talk, which simultaneously incorporates coarse- and fine-grained multimodal control conditions. Nevertheless, the entanglement of multiple conditions challenges achieving satisfying performance. To disentangle speech audio and fine-grained conditions, we employ a two-stage training pipeline. Specifically, Cafe-Talk is initially trained using only speech audio and coarse-grained conditions. Then, a proposed fine-grained control adapter gradually adds fine-grained instructions represented by action units (AUs), preventing unfavorable speech-lip synchronization. To disentangle coarse- and fine-grained conditions, we design a swap-label training mechanism, which enables the dominance of the fine-grained conditions. We also devise a mask-based CFG technique to regulate the occurrence and intensity of fine-grained control. In addition, a text-based detector is introduced with text-AU alignment to enable natural language user input and further support multimodal control. Extensive experimental results prove that Cafe-Talk achieves state-of-the-art lip synchronization and expressiveness performance and receives wide acceptance in fine-grained control in user studies.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present PANDORA, a novel diffusion-based policy learning framework designed specifically for dexterous robotic piano performance. Our approach employs a conditional U-Net architecture enhanced with FiLM-based global conditioning, which iteratively denoises noisy action sequences into smooth, high-dimensional trajectories. To achieve precise key execution coupled with expressive musical performance, we design a composite reward function that integrates task-specific accuracy, audio fidelity, and high-level semantic feedback from a large language model (LLM) oracle. The LLM oracle assesses musical expressiveness and stylistic nuances, enabling dynamic, hand-specific reward adjustments. Further augmented by a residual inverse-kinematics refinement policy, PANDORA achieves state-of-the-art performance in the ROBOPIANIST environment, significantly outperforming baselines in both precision and expressiveness. Ablation studies validate the critical contributions of diffusion-based denoising and LLM-driven semantic feedback in enhancing robotic musicianship. Videos available at: this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In human activity recognition (HAR), activity labels have typically been encoded in one-hot format, which has a recent shift towards using textual representations to provide contextual knowledge. Here, we argue that HAR should be anchored to physical motion data, as motion forms the basis of activity and applies effectively across sensing systems, whereas text is inherently limited. We propose SKELAR, a novel HAR framework that pretrains activity representations from skeleton data and matches them with heterogeneous HAR signals. Our method addresses two major challenges: (1) capturing core motion knowledge without context-specific details. We achieve this through a self-supervised coarse angle reconstruction task that recovers joint rotation angles, invariant to both users and deployments; (2) adapting the representations to downstream tasks with varying modalities and focuses. To address this, we introduce a self-attention matching module that dynamically prioritizes relevant body parts in a data-driven manner. Given the lack of corresponding labels in existing skeleton data, we establish MASD, a new HAR dataset with IMU, WiFi, and skeleton, collected from 20 subjects performing 27 activities. This is the first broadly applicable HAR dataset with time-synchronized data across three modalities. Experiments show that SKELAR achieves the state-of-the-art performance in both full-shot and few-shot settings. We also demonstrate that SKELAR can effectively leverage synthetic skeleton data to extend its use in scenarios without skeleton collections.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this manuscript we introduce a novel Decision Flow (DF) framework for sampling from a target distribution while incorporating additional guidance from a prior sampler. DF can be viewed as an AI driven algorithmic reincarnation of the Markov Decision Process (MDP) approach in Stochastic Optimal Control. It extends the continuous space, continuous time path Integral Diffusion sampling technique to discrete time and space, while also generalizing the Generative Flow Network framework. In its most basic form, an explicit, Neural Network (NN) free formulation, DF leverages the linear solvability of the the underlying MDP to adjust the transition probabilities of the prior sampler. The resulting Markov Process is expressed as a convolution of the reverse time Green's function of the prior sampling with the target distribution. We illustrate the DF framework through an example of sampling from the Ising model, discuss potential NN based extensions, and outline how DF can enhance guided sampling across various applications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Point cloud (PC) processing tasks-such as completion, upsampling, denoising, and colorization-are crucial in applications like autonomous driving and 3D reconstruction. Despite substantial advancements, prior approaches often address each of these tasks independently, with separate models focused on individual issues. However, this isolated approach fails to account for the fact that defects like incompleteness, low resolution, noise, and lack of color frequently coexist, with each defect influencing and correlating with the others. Simply applying these models sequentially can lead to error accumulation from each model, along with increased computational costs. To address these challenges, we introduce SuperPC, the first unified diffusion model capable of concurrently handling all four tasks. Our approach employs a three-level-conditioned diffusion framework, enhanced by a novel spatial-mix-fusion strategy, to leverage the correlations among these four defects for simultaneous, efficient processing. We show that SuperPC outperforms the state-of-the-art specialized models as well as their combination on all four individual tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The ensemble average of physical properties of molecules is closely related to the distribution of molecular conformations, and sampling such distributions is a fundamental challenge in physics and chemistry. Traditional methods like molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling are commonly used but can be time-consuming and costly. Recently, diffusion models have emerged as efficient alternatives by learning the distribution of training data. Obtaining an unbiased target distribution is still an expensive task, primarily because it requires satisfying ergodicity. To tackle these challenges, we propose Potential Score Matching (PSM), an approach that utilizes the potential energy gradient to guide generative models. PSM does not require exact energy functions and can debias sample distributions even when trained on limited and biased data. Our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on the Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential, a commonly used toy model. Furthermore, we extend the evaluation of PSM to high-dimensional problems using the MD17 and MD22 datasets. The results demonstrate that molecular distributions generated by PSM more closely approximate the Boltzmann distribution compared to traditional diffusion models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The capacity of a foundation model allows for adaptation to new downstream tasks. Weight imprinting is a universal and efficient method to fulfill this purpose. It has been reinvented several times, but it has not been systematically studied. In this paper, we propose a framework for imprinting, identifying three main components: generation, normalization, and aggregation. This allows us to conduct an in-depth analysis of imprinting and a comparison of the existing work. We reveal the benefits of representing novel data with multiple proxies in the generation step and show the importance of proper normalization. We determine those proxies through clustering and propose a novel variant of imprinting that outperforms previous work. We motivate this by the neural collapse phenomenon -- an important connection that we can draw for the first time. Our results show an increase of up to 4% in challenging scenarios with complex data distributions for new classes.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative, anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks remain a critical threat to Internet services, causing costly disruptions. While machine learning (ML) has shown promise in DDoS detection, current solutions struggle with multi-domain environments where attacks must be detected across heterogeneous networks and organizational boundaries. This limitation severely impacts the practical deployment of ML-based defenses in real-world settings. This paper introduces Anomaly-Flow, a novel framework that addresses this critical gap by combining Federated Learning (FL) with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for privacy-preserving, multi-domain DDoS detection. Our proposal enables collaborative learning across diverse network domains while preserving data privacy through synthetic flow generation. Through extensive evaluation across three distinct network datasets, Anomaly-Flow achieves an average F1-score of $0.747$, outperforming baseline models. Importantly, our framework enables organizations to share attack detection capabilities without exposing sensitive network data, making it particularly valuable for critical infrastructure and privacy-sensitive sectors. Beyond immediate technical contributions, this work provides insights into the challenges and opportunities in multi-domain DDoS detection, establishing a foundation for future research in collaborative network defense systems. Our findings have important implications for academic research and industry practitioners working to deploy practical ML-based security solutions.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the 2023 edition of the White Paper on Information and Communications, it is estimated that the population of social networking services in Japan will exceed 100 million by 2022, and the influence of social networking services in Japan is growing significantly. In addition, marketing using SNS and research on the propagation of emotions and information on SNS are being actively conducted, creating the need for a system for predicting trends in SNS interactions. We have already created a system that simulates the behavior of various communities on SNS by building a virtual SNS environment in which agents post and reply to each other in a chat community created by agents using a LLMs. In this paper, we evaluate the impact of the search extension generation mechanism used to create posts and replies in a virtual SNS environment using a simulation system on the ability to generate posts and replies. As a result of the evaluation, we confirmed that the proposed search extension generation mechanism, which mimics human search behavior, generates the most natural exchange.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Various Vision Transformer (ViT) models have been widely used for image recognition tasks. However, existing visual explanation methods can not display the attention flow hidden inside the inner structure of ViT models, which explains how the final attention regions are formed inside a ViT for its decision-making. In this paper, a novel visual explanation approach, Dynamic Accumulated Attention Map (DAAM), is proposed to provide a tool that can visualize, for the first time, the attention flow from the top to the bottom through ViT networks. To this end, a novel decomposition module is proposed to construct and store the spatial feature information by unlocking the [class] token generated by the self-attention module of each ViT block. The module can also obtain the channel importance coefficients by decomposing the classification score for supervised ViT models. Because of the lack of classification score in self-supervised ViT models, we propose dimension-wise importance weights to compute the channel importance coefficients. Such spatial features are linearly combined with the corresponding channel importance coefficients, forming the attention map for each block. The dynamic attention flow is revealed by block-wisely accumulating each attention map. The contribution of this work focuses on visualizing the evolution dynamic of the decision-making attention for any intermediate block inside a ViT model by proposing a novel decomposition module and dimension-wise importance weights. The quantitative and qualitative analysis consistently validate the effectiveness and superior capacity of the proposed DAAM for not only interpreting ViT models with the fully-connected layers as the classifier but also self-supervised ViT models.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models have garnered considerable interest in computer vision, owing both to their capacity to synthesize photorealistic images and to their proven effectiveness in image reconstruction tasks. However, existing approaches fail to efficiently balance the high visual quality of diffusion models with the low distortion achieved by previous image reconstruction methods. Specifically, for the fundamental task of additive Gaussian noise removal, we first illustrate an intuitive method for leveraging pretrained diffusion models. Further, we introduce our proposed Linear Combination Diffusion Denoiser (LCDD), which unifies two complementary inference procedures - one that leverages the model's generative potential and another that ensures faithful signal recovery. By exploiting the inherent structure of the denoising samples, LCDD achieves state-of-the-art performance and offers controlled, well-behaved trade-offs through a simple scalar hyperparameter adjustment.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While diffusion-based models excel at generating photorealistic images from text, a more nuanced challenge emerges when constrained to using only a fixed set of rigid shapes, akin to solving tangram puzzles or arranging real-world objects to match semantic descriptions. We formalize this problem as shape-based image generation, a new text-guided image-to-image translation task that requires rearranging the input set of rigid shapes into non-overlapping configurations and visually communicating the target concept. Unlike pixel-manipulation approaches, our method, ShapeShift, explicitly parameterizes each shape within a differentiable vector graphics pipeline, iteratively optimizing placement and orientation through score distillation sampling from pretrained diffusion models. To preserve arrangement clarity, we introduce a content-aware collision resolution mechanism that applies minimal semantically coherent adjustments when overlaps occur, ensuring smooth convergence toward physically valid configurations. By bridging diffusion-based semantic guidance with explicit geometric constraints, our approach yields interpretable compositions where spatial relationships clearly embody the textual prompt. Extensive experiments demonstrate compelling results across diverse scenarios, with quantitative and qualitative advantages over alternative techniques.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Street scene datasets, collected from Street View or dashboard cameras, offer a promising means of detecting urban objects and incidents like street flooding. However, a major challenge in using these datasets is their lack of reliable labels: there are myriad types of incidents, many types occur rarely, and ground-truth measures of where incidents occur are lacking. Here, we propose BayFlood, a two-stage approach which circumvents this difficulty. First, we perform zero-shot classification of where incidents occur using a pretrained vision-language model (VLM). Second, we fit a spatial Bayesian model on the VLM classifications. The zero-shot approach avoids the need to annotate large training sets, and the Bayesian model provides frequent desiderata in urban settings - principled measures of uncertainty, smoothing across locations, and incorporation of external data like stormwater accumulation zones. We comprehensively validate this two-stage approach, showing that VLMs provide strong zero-shot signal for floods across multiple cities and time periods, the Bayesian model improves out-of-sample prediction relative to baseline methods, and our inferred flood risk correlates with known external predictors of risk. Having validated our approach, we show it can be used to improve urban flood detection: our analysis reveals 113,738 people who are at high risk of flooding overlooked by current methods, identifies demographic biases in existing methods, and suggests locations for new flood sensors. More broadly, our results showcase how Bayesian modeling of zero-shot LM annotations represents a promising paradigm because it avoids the need to collect large labeled datasets and leverages the power of foundation models while providing the expressiveness and uncertainty quantification of Bayesian models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the growing need for real-time processing on IoT devices, optimizing machine learning (ML) models' size, latency, and computational efficiency is essential. This paper investigates a pruning method for anomaly detection in resource-constrained environments, specifically targeting Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure (EVCI). Using the CICEVSE2024 dataset, we trained and optimized three models-Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and XGBoost-through hyperparameter tuning with Optuna, further refining them using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)-based feature selection (FS) and unstructured pruning techniques. The optimized models achieved significant reductions in model size and inference times, with only a marginal impact on their performance. Notably, our findings indicate that, in the context of EVCI, pruning and FS can enhance computational efficiency while retaining critical anomaly detection capabilities.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multimodal foundation models (MMFMs) play a crucial role in various applications, including autonomous driving, healthcare, and virtual assistants. However, several studies have revealed vulnerabilities in these models, such as generating unsafe content by text-to-image models. Existing benchmarks on multimodal models either predominantly assess the helpfulness of these models, or only focus on limited perspectives such as fairness and privacy. In this paper, we present the first unified platform, MMDT (Multimodal DecodingTrust), designed to provide a comprehensive safety and trustworthiness evaluation for MMFMs. Our platform assesses models from multiple perspectives, including safety, hallucination, fairness/bias, privacy, adversarial robustness, and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. We have designed various evaluation scenarios and red teaming algorithms under different tasks for each perspective to generate challenging data, forming a high-quality benchmark. We evaluate a range of multimodal models using MMDT, and our findings reveal a series of vulnerabilities and areas for improvement across these perspectives. This work introduces the first comprehensive and unique safety and trustworthiness evaluation platform for MMFMs, paving the way for developing safer and more reliable MMFMs and systems.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Decompositional reconstruction of 3D scenes, with complete shapes and detailed texture of all objects within, is intriguing for downstream applications but remains challenging, particularly with sparse views as input. Recent approaches incorporate semantic or geometric regularization to address this issue, but they suffer significant degradation in underconstrained areas and fail to recover occluded regions. We argue that the key to solving this problem lies in supplementing missing information for these areas. To this end, we propose DP-Recon, which employs diffusion priors in the form of Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) to optimize the neural representation of each individual object under novel views. This provides additional information for the underconstrained areas, but directly incorporating diffusion prior raises potential conflicts between the reconstruction and generative guidance. Therefore, we further introduce a visibility-guided approach to dynamically adjust the per-pixel SDS loss weights. Together these components enhance both geometry and appearance recovery while remaining faithful to input images. Extensive experiments across Replica and ScanNet++ demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms SOTA methods. Notably, it achieves better object reconstruction under 10 views than the baselines under 100 views. Our method enables seamless text-based editing for geometry and appearance through SDS optimization and produces decomposed object meshes with detailed UV maps that support photorealistic Visual effects (VFX) editing.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Accurate perception of dynamic traffic scenes is crucial for high-level autonomous driving systems, requiring robust object motion estimation and instance segmentation. However, traditional methods often treat them as separate tasks, leading to suboptimal performance, spatio-temporal inconsistencies, and inefficiency in complex scenarios due to the absence of information sharing. This paper proposes a multi-task SemanticFlow framework to simultaneously predict scene flow and instance segmentation of full-resolution point clouds. The novelty of this work is threefold: 1) developing a coarse-to-fine prediction based multi-task scheme, where an initial coarse segmentation of static backgrounds and dynamic objects is used to provide contextual information for refining motion and semantic information through a shared feature processing module; 2) developing a set of loss functions to enhance the performance of scene flow estimation and instance segmentation, while can help ensure spatial and temporal consistency of both static and dynamic objects within traffic scenes; 3) developing a self-supervised learning scheme, which utilizes coarse segmentation to detect rigid objects and compute their transformation matrices between sequential frames, enabling the generation of self-supervised labels. The proposed framework is validated on the Argoverse and Waymo datasets, demonstrating superior performance in instance segmentation accuracy, scene flow estimation, and computational efficiency, establishing a new benchmark for self-supervised methods in dynamic scene understanding.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Log anomaly detection refers to the task that distinguishes the anomalous log messages from normal log messages. Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) are becoming popular for log anomaly detection because of their superb ability to understand complex and long language patterns. In this paper, we propose LogLLaMA, a novel framework that leverages LLaMA2. LogLLaMA is first finetuned on normal log messages from three large-scale datasets to learn their patterns. After finetuning, the model is capable of generating successive log messages given previous log messages. Our generative model is further trained to identify anomalous log messages using reinforcement learning (RL). The experimental results show that LogLLaMA outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches for anomaly detection on BGL, Thunderbird, and HDFS datasets.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Scaling up self-supervised learning has driven breakthroughs in language and vision, yet comparable progress has remained elusive in reinforcement learning (RL). In this paper, we study building blocks for self-supervised RL that unlock substantial improvements in scalability, with network depth serving as a critical factor. Whereas most RL papers in recent years have relied on shallow architectures (around 2 - 5 layers), we demonstrate that increasing the depth up to 1024 layers can significantly boost performance. Our experiments are conducted in an unsupervised goal-conditioned setting, where no demonstrations or rewards are provided, so an agent must explore (from scratch) and learn how to maximize the likelihood of reaching commanded goals. Evaluated on simulated locomotion and manipulation tasks, our approach increases performance by $2\times$ - $50\times$. Increasing the model depth not only increases success rates but also qualitatively changes the behaviors learned.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Video restoration (VR) aims to recover high-quality videos from degraded ones. Although recent zero-shot VR methods using pre-trained diffusion models (DMs) show good promise, they suffer from approximation errors during reverse diffusion and insufficient temporal consistency. Moreover, dealing with 3D video data, VR is inherently computationally intensive. In this paper, we advocate viewing the reverse process in DMs as a function and present a novel Maximum a Posterior (MAP) framework that directly parameterizes video frames in the seed space of DMs, eliminating approximation errors. We also introduce strategies to promote bilevel temporal consistency: semantic consistency by leveraging clustering structures in the seed space, and pixel-level consistency by progressive warping with optical flow refinements. Extensive experiments on multiple virtual reality tasks demonstrate superior visual quality and temporal consistency achieved by our method compared to the state-of-the-art.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models have shown remarkable performance in image synthesis, but they demand extensive computational and memory resources for training, fine-tuning and inference. Although advanced quantization techniques have successfully minimized memory usage for inference, training and fine-tuning these quantized models still require large memory possibly due to dequantization for accurate computation of gradients and/or backpropagation for gradient-based algorithms. However, memory-efficient fine-tuning is particularly desirable for applications such as personalization that often must be run on edge devices like mobile phones with private data. In this work, we address this challenge by quantizing a diffusion model with personalization via Textual Inversion and by leveraging a zeroth-order optimization on personalization tokens without dequantization so that it does not require gradient and activation storage for backpropagation that consumes considerable memory. Since a gradient estimation using zeroth-order optimization is quite noisy for a single or a few images in personalization, we propose to denoise the estimated gradient by projecting it onto a subspace that is constructed with the past history of the tokens, dubbed Subspace Gradient. In addition, we investigated the influence of text embedding in image generation, leading to our proposed time steps sampling, dubbed Partial Uniform Timestep Sampling for sampling with effective diffusion timesteps. Our method achieves comparable performance to prior methods in image and text alignment scores for personalizing Stable Diffusion with only forward passes while reducing training memory demand up to $8.2\times$.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generalized Class Discovery (GCD) clusters base and novel classes in a target domain using supervision from a source domain with only base classes. Current methods often falter with distribution shifts and typically require access to target data during training, which can sometimes be impractical. To address this issue, we introduce the novel paradigm of Domain Generalization in GCD (DG-GCD), where only source data is available for training, while the target domain, with a distinct data distribution, remains unseen until inference. To this end, our solution, DG2CD-Net, aims to construct a domain-independent, discriminative embedding space for GCD. The core innovation is an episodic training strategy that enhances cross-domain generalization by adapting a base model on tasks derived from source and synthetic domains generated by a foundation model. Each episode focuses on a cross-domain GCD task, diversifying task setups over episodes and combining open-set domain adaptation with a novel margin loss and representation learning for optimizing the feature space progressively. To capture the effects of fine-tuning on the base model, we extend task arithmetic by adaptively weighting the local task vectors concerning the fine-tuned models based on their GCD performance on a validation distribution. This episodic update mechanism boosts the adaptability of the base model to unseen targets. Experiments across three datasets confirm that DG2CD-Net outperforms existing GCD methods customized for DG-GCD.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Anomaly detection plays a crucial role in quality control for industrial applications. However, ensuring robustness under unseen domain shifts such as lighting variations or sensor drift remains a significant challenge. Existing methods attempt to address domain shifts by training generalizable models but often rely on prior knowledge of target distributions and can hardly generalise to backbones designed for other data modalities. To overcome these limitations, we build upon memory-bank-based anomaly detection methods, optimizing a robust Sinkhorn distance on limited target training data to enhance generalization to unseen target domains. We evaluate the effectiveness on both 2D and 3D anomaly detection benchmarks with simulated distribution shifts. Our proposed method demonstrates superior results compared with state-of-the-art anomaly detection and domain adaptation methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The emergence of vision-language models has transformed medical AI, enabling unprecedented advances in diagnostic capability and clinical applications. However, progress in dermatology has lagged behind other medical domains due to the lack of standard image-text pairs. Existing dermatological datasets are limited in both scale and depth, offering only single-label annotations across a narrow range of diseases instead of rich textual descriptions, and lacking the crucial clinical context needed for real-world applications. To address these limitations, we present Derm1M, the first large-scale vision-language dataset for dermatology, comprising 1,029,761 image-text pairs. Built from diverse educational resources and structured around a standard ontology collaboratively developed by experts, Derm1M provides comprehensive coverage for over 390 skin conditions across four hierarchical levels and 130 clinical concepts with rich contextual information such as medical history, symptoms, and skin tone. To demonstrate Derm1M potential in advancing both AI research and clinical application, we pretrained a series of CLIP-like models, collectively called DermLIP, on this dataset. The DermLIP family significantly outperforms state-of-the-art foundation models on eight diverse datasets across multiple tasks, including zero-shot skin disease classification, clinical and artifacts concept identification, few-shot/full-shot learning, and cross-modal retrieval. Our dataset and code will be public.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Scaling up motion datasets is crucial to enhance motion generation capabilities. However, training on large-scale multi-source datasets introduces data heterogeneity challenges due to variations in motion content. To address this, we propose Generative Pretrained Multi-path Motion Model (GenM$^3$), a comprehensive framework designed to learn unified motion representations. GenM$^3$ comprises two components: 1) a Multi-Expert VQ-VAE (MEVQ-VAE) that adapts to different dataset distributions to learn a unified discrete motion representation, and 2) a Multi-path Motion Transformer (MMT) that improves intra-modal representations by using separate modality-specific pathways, each with densely activated experts to accommodate variations within that modality, and improves inter-modal alignment by the text-motion shared pathway. To enable large-scale training, we integrate and unify 11 high-quality motion datasets (approximately 220 hours of motion data) and augment it with textual annotations (nearly 10,000 motion sequences labeled by a large language model and 300+ by human experts). After training on our integrated dataset, GenM$^3$ achieves a state-of-the-art FID of 0.035 on the HumanML3D benchmark, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. It also demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization on IDEA400 dataset, highlighting its effectiveness and adaptability across diverse motion scenarios.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vision-guided speech generation aims to produce authentic speech from facial appearance or lip motions without relying on auditory signals, offering significant potential for applications such as dubbing in filmmaking and assisting individuals with aphonia. Despite recent progress, existing methods struggle to achieve unified cross-modal alignment across semantics, timbre, and emotional prosody from visual cues, prompting us to propose Consistent Video-to-Speech (CV2S) as an extended task to enhance cross-modal consistency. To tackle emerging challenges, we introduce ImaginTalk, a novel cross-modal diffusion framework that generates faithful speech using only visual input, operating within a discrete space. Specifically, we propose a discrete lip aligner that predicts discrete speech tokens from lip videos to capture semantic information, while an error detector identifies misaligned tokens, which are subsequently refined through masked language modeling with BERT. To further enhance the expressiveness of the generated speech, we develop a style diffusion transformer equipped with a face-style adapter that adaptively customizes identity and prosody dynamics across both the channel and temporal dimensions while ensuring synchronization with lip-aware semantic features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ImaginTalk can generate high-fidelity speech with more accurate semantic details and greater expressiveness in timbre and emotion compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Image fusion, a fundamental low-level vision task, aims to integrate multiple image sequences into a single output while preserving as much information as possible from the input. However, existing methods face several significant limitations: 1) requiring task- or dataset-specific models; 2) neglecting real-world image degradations (\textit{e.g.}, noise), which causes failure when processing degraded inputs; 3) operating in pixel space, where attention mechanisms are computationally expensive; and 4) lacking user interaction capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose a unified framework for multi-task, multi-degradation, and language-guided image fusion. Our framework includes two key components: 1) a practical degradation pipeline that simulates real-world image degradations and generates interactive prompts to guide the model; 2) an all-in-one Diffusion Transformer (DiT) operating in latent space, which fuses a clean image conditioned on both the degraded inputs and the generated prompts. Furthermore, we introduce principled modifications to the original DiT architecture to better suit the fusion task. Based on this framework, we develop two versions of the model: Regression-based and Flow Matching-based variants. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively addresses the aforementioned limitations and outperforms previous restoration+fusion and all-in-one pipelines.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative models in Autonomous Driving (AD) enable diverse scene creation, yet existing methods fall short by only capturing a limited range of modalities, restricting the capability of generating controllable scenes for comprehensive evaluation of AD systems. In this paper, we introduce a multimodal generation framework that incorporates four major data modalities, including a novel addition of map modality. With tokenized modalities, our scene sequence generation framework autoregressively predicts each scene while managing computational demands through a two-stage approach. The Temporal AutoRegressive (TAR) component captures inter-frame dynamics for each modality while the Ordered AutoRegressive (OAR) component aligns modalities within each scene by sequentially predicting tokens in a fixed order. To maintain coherence between map and ego-action modalities, we introduce the Action-aware Map Alignment (AMA) module, which applies a transformation based on the ego-action to maintain coherence between these modalities. Our framework effectively generates complex, realistic driving scenes over extended sequences, ensuring multimodal consistency and offering fine-grained control over scene elements.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Ultrasound video classification enables automated diagnosis and has emerged as an important research area. However, publicly available ultrasound video datasets remain scarce, hindering progress in developing effective video classification models. We propose addressing this shortage by synthesizing plausible ultrasound videos from readily available, abundant ultrasound images. To this end, we introduce a latent dynamic diffusion model (LDDM) to efficiently translate static images to dynamic sequences with realistic video characteristics. We demonstrate strong quantitative results and visually appealing synthesized videos on the BUSV benchmark. Notably, training video classification models on combinations of real and LDDM-synthesized videos substantially improves performance over using real data alone, indicating our method successfully emulates dynamics critical for discrimination. Our image-to-video approach provides an effective data augmentation solution to advance ultrasound video analysis. Code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Image colorization aims to bring colors back to grayscale images. Automatic image colorization methods, which requires no additional guidance, struggle to generate high-quality images due to color ambiguity, and provides limited user controllability. Thanks to the emergency of cross-modality datasets and models, language-based colorization methods are proposed to fully utilize the efficiency and flexibly of text descriptions to guide colorization. In view of the lack of a comprehensive review of language-based colorization literature, we conduct a thorough analysis and benchmarking. We first briefly summarize existing automatic colorization methods. Then, we focus on language-based methods and point out their core challenge on cross-modal alignment. We further divide these methods into two categories: one attempts to train a cross-modality network from scratch, while the other utilizes the pre-trained cross-modality model to establish the textual-visual correspondence. Based on the analyzed limitations of existing language-based methods, we propose a simple yet effective method based on distilled diffusion model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our simple baseline can produces better results than previous complex methods with 14 times speed up. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive review and benchmark on language-based image colorization field, providing meaningful insights for the community.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Pansharpening, a pivotal task in remote sensing for fusing high-resolution panchromatic and multispectral imagery, has garnered significant research interest. Recent advancements employing diffusion models based on stochastic differential equations (SDEs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance. However, the inherent multi-step sampling process of SDEs imposes substantial computational overhead, hindering practical deployment. While existing methods adopt efficient samplers, knowledge distillation, or retraining to reduce sampling steps (e.g., from 1,000 to fewer steps), such approaches often compromise fusion quality. In this work, we propose the Optimal Transport Flow Matching (OTFM) framework, which integrates the dual formulation of unbalanced optimal transport (UOT) to achieve one-step, high-quality pansharpening. Unlike conventional OT formulations that enforce rigid distribution alignment, UOT relaxes marginal constraints to enhance modeling flexibility, accommodating the intrinsic spectral and spatial disparities in remote sensing data. Furthermore, we incorporate task-specific regularization into the UOT objective, enhancing the robustness of the flow model. The OTFM framework enables simulation-free training and single-step inference while maintaining strict adherence to pansharpening constraints. Experimental evaluations across multiple datasets demonstrate that OTFM matches or exceeds the performance of previous regression-based models and leading diffusion-based methods while only needing one sampling step.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Unpaired training has been verified as one of the most effective paradigms for real scene dehazing by learning from unpaired real-world hazy and clear images. Although numerous studies have been proposed, current methods demonstrate limited generalization for various real scenes due to limited feature representation and insufficient use of real-world prior. Inspired by the strong generative capabilities of diffusion models in producing both hazy and clear images, we exploit diffusion prior for real-world image dehazing, and propose an unpaired framework named Diff-Dehazer. Specifically, we leverage diffusion prior as bijective mapping learners within the CycleGAN, a classic unpaired learning framework. Considering that physical priors contain pivotal statistics information of real-world data, we further excavate real-world knowledge by integrating physical priors into our framework. Furthermore, we introduce a new perspective for adequately leveraging the representation ability of diffusion models by removing degradation in image and text modalities, so as to improve the dehazing effect. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method. Our code this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>An important aspect of text mining involves information retrieval in form of discovery of semantic themes (topics) from documents using topic modelling. While generative topic models like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) elegantly model topics as probability distributions and are useful in identifying latent topics from large document corpora with minimal supervision, they suffer from difficulty in topic interpretability and reduced performance in shorter texts. Here we propose a novel Multivariate Gaussian Topic modelling (MGD) approach. In this approach topics are presented as Multivariate Gaussian Distributions and documents as Gaussian Mixture Models. Using EM algorithm, the various constituent Multivariate Gaussian Distributions and their corresponding parameters are identified. Analysis of the parameters helps identify the keywords having the highest variance and mean contributions to the topic, and from these key-words topic annotations are carried out. This approach is first applied on a synthetic dataset to demonstrate the interpretability benefits vis-√†-vis LDA. A real-world application of this topic model is demonstrated in analysis of risks and hazards at a petrochemical plant by applying the model on safety incident reports to identify the major latent hazards plaguing the plant. This model achieves a higher mean topic coherence of 0.436 vis-√†-vis 0.294 for LDA.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Unpaired image-to-image translation has seen significant progress since the introduction of CycleGAN. However, methods based on diffusion models or Schr√∂dinger bridges have yet to be widely adopted in real-world applications due to their iterative sampling nature. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework, Implicit Bridge Consistency Distillation (IBCD), which enables single-step bidirectional unpaired translation without using adversarial loss. IBCD extends consistency distillation by using a diffusion implicit bridge model that connects PF-ODE trajectories between distributions. Additionally, we introduce two key improvements: 1) distribution matching for consistency distillation and 2) adaptive weighting method based on distillation difficulty. Experimental results demonstrate that IBCD achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets in a single generation step. Project page available at this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While representation learning and generative modeling seek to understand visual data, unifying both domains remains unexplored. Recent Unified Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods have started to bridge the gap between both paradigms. However, they rely solely on semantic token reconstruction, which requires an external tokenizer during training -- introducing a significant overhead. In this work, we introduce Sorcen, a novel unified SSL framework, incorporating a synergic Contrastive-Reconstruction objective. Our Contrastive objective, "Echo Contrast", leverages the generative capabilities of Sorcen, eliminating the need for additional image crops or augmentations during training. Sorcen "generates" an echo sample in the semantic token space, forming the contrastive positive pair. Sorcen operates exclusively on precomputed tokens, eliminating the need for an online token transformation during training, thereby significantly reducing computational overhead. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1k demonstrate that Sorcen outperforms the previous Unified SSL SoTA by 0.4%, 1.48 FID, 1.76%, and 1.53% on linear probing, unconditional image generation, few-shot learning, and transfer learning, respectively, while being 60.8% more efficient. Additionally, Sorcen surpasses previous single-crop MIM SoTA in linear probing and achieves SoTA performance in unconditional image generation, highlighting significant improvements and breakthroughs in Unified SSL models.</li>

Our evaluation encompasses DeepSeek's latest generation of large language models, multimodal large language models, and text-to-image models, systematically examining their performance regarding unsafe content generation. Notably, we developed a bilingual (Chinese-English) safety evaluation dataset tailored to Chinese sociocultural contexts, enabling a more thorough evaluation of the safety capabilities of Chinese-developed models. Experimental results indicate that despite their strong general capabilities, DeepSeek models exhibit significant safety vulnerabilities across multiple risk dimensions, including algorithmic discrimination and sexual content.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose Diffusion-Informed Model Predictive Control (D-I MPC), a generic framework for uncertainty-aware prediction and decision-making in partially observable stochastic systems by integrating diffusion-based time series forecasting models in Model Predictive Control algorithms. In our approach, a diffusion-based time series forecasting model is used to probabilistically estimate the evolution of the system's stochastic components. These forecasts are then incorporated into MPC algorithms to estimate future trajectories and optimize action selection under the uncertainty of the future. We evaluate the framework on the task of energy arbitrage, where a Battery Energy Storage System participates in the day-ahead electricity market of the New York state. Experimental results indicate that our model-based approach with a diffusion-based forecaster significantly outperforms both implementations with classical forecasting methods and model-free reinforcement learning baselines.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The past decade has witnessed notable achievements in self-supervised learning for video tasks. Recent efforts typically adopt the Masked Video Modeling (MVM) paradigm, leading to significant progress on multiple video tasks. However, two critical challenges remain: 1) Without human annotations, the random temporal sampling introduces uncertainty, increasing the difficulty of model training. 2) Previous MVM methods primarily recover the masked patches in the pixel space, leading to insufficient information compression for downstream tasks. To address these challenges jointly, we propose a self-supervised framework that leverages Temporal Correspondence for video Representation learning (T-CoRe). For challenge 1), we propose a sandwich sampling strategy that selects two auxiliary frames to reduce reconstruction uncertainty in a two-side-squeezing manner. Addressing challenge 2), we introduce an auxiliary branch into a self-distillation architecture to restore representations in the latent space, generating high-level semantic representations enriched with temporal information. Experiments of T-CoRe consistently present superior performance across several downstream tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness for video representation learning.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Causal generative models (CGMs) have recently emerged as capable approaches to simulate the causal mechanisms generating our observations, enabling causal inference. Unfortunately, existing approaches either are overly restrictive, assuming the absence of hidden confounders, or lack generality, being tailored to a particular query and graph. In this work, we introduce DeCaFlow, a CGM that accounts for hidden confounders in a single amortized training process using only observational data and the causal graph. Importantly, DeCaFlow can provably identify all causal queries with a valid adjustment set or sufficiently informative proxy variables. Remarkably, for the first time to our knowledge, we show that a confounded counterfactual query is identifiable, and thus solvable by DeCaFlow, as long as its interventional counterpart is as well. Our empirical results on diverse settings (including the Ecoli70 dataset, with 3 independent hidden confounders, tens of observed variables and hundreds of causal queries) show that DeCaFlow outperforms existing approaches, while demonstrating its out-of-the-box flexibility.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Object-centric representation learning has recently been successfully applied to real-world datasets. This success can be attributed to pretrained non-object-centric foundation models, whose features serve as reconstruction targets for slot attention. However, targets must remain frozen throughout the training, which sets an upper bound on the performance object-centric models can attain. Attempts to update the target encoder by bootstrapping result in large performance drops, which can be attributed to its lack of object-centric inductive biases, causing the object-centric model's encoder to drift away from representations useful as reconstruction targets. To address these limitations, we propose Object-CEntric Pretraining by Target Encoder BOotstrapping, a self-distillation setup for training object-centric models from scratch, on real-world data, for the first time ever. In OCEBO, the target encoder is updated as an exponential moving average of the object-centric model, thus explicitly being enriched with object-centric inductive biases introduced by slot attention while removing the upper bound on performance present in other models. We mitigate the slot collapse caused by random initialization of the target encoder by introducing a novel cross-view patch filtering approach that limits the supervision to sufficiently informative patches. When pretrained on 241k images from COCO, OCEBO achieves unsupervised object discovery performance comparable to that of object-centric models with frozen non-object-centric target encoders pretrained on hundreds of millions of images.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Conventional methods for point cloud completion, typically trained on synthetic datasets, face significant challenges when applied to out-of-distribution real-world scans. In this paper, we propose an effective yet simple source-free domain adaptation framework for point cloud completion, termed \textbf{PointSFDA}. Unlike unsupervised domain adaptation that reduces the domain gap by directly leveraging labeled source data, PointSFDA uses only a pretrained source model and unlabeled target data for adaptation, avoiding the need for inaccessible source data in practical scenarios. Being the first source-free domain adaptation architecture for point cloud completion, our method offers two core contributions. First, we introduce a coarse-to-fine distillation solution to explicitly transfer the global geometry knowledge learned from the source dataset. Second, as noise may be introduced due to domain gaps, we propose a self-supervised partial-mask consistency training strategy to learn local geometry information in the target domain. Extensive experiments have validated that our method significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art networks in cross-domain shape completion.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art results in synthesis tasks; however, there is a growing concern about their potential misuse in creating harmful content. To mitigate these risks, post-hoc model intervention techniques, such as concept unlearning and safety guidance, have been developed. However, fine-tuning model weights or adapting the hidden states of the diffusion model operates in an uninterpretable way, making it unclear which part of the intermediate variables is responsible for unsafe generation. These interventions severely affect the sampling trajectory when erasing harmful concepts from complex, multi-concept prompts, thus hindering their practical use in real-world settings. In this work, we propose the safe generation framework Detect-and-Guide (DAG), leveraging the internal knowledge of diffusion models to perform self-diagnosis and fine-grained self-regulation during the sampling process. DAG first detects harmful concepts from noisy latents using refined cross-attention maps of optimized tokens, then applies safety guidance with adaptive strength and editing regions to negate unsafe generation. The optimization only requires a small annotated dataset and can provide precise detection maps with generalizability and concept specificity. Moreover, DAG does not require fine-tuning of diffusion models, and therefore introduces no loss to their generation diversity. Experiments on erasing sexual content show that DAG achieves state-of-the-art safe generation performance, balancing harmfulness mitigation and text-following performance on multi-concept real-world prompts.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Current generative models struggle to synthesize dynamic 4D driving scenes that simultaneously support temporal extrapolation and spatial novel view synthesis (NVS) without per-scene optimization. A key challenge lies in finding an efficient and generalizable geometric representation that seamlessly connects temporal and spatial synthesis. To address this, we propose DiST-4D, the first disentangled spatiotemporal diffusion framework for 4D driving scene generation, which leverages metric depth as the core geometric representation. DiST-4D decomposes the problem into two diffusion processes: DiST-T, which predicts future metric depth and multi-view RGB sequences directly from past observations, and DiST-S, which enables spatial NVS by training only on existing viewpoints while enforcing cycle consistency. This cycle consistency mechanism introduces a forward-backward rendering constraint, reducing the generalization gap between observed and unseen viewpoints. Metric depth is essential for both accurate reliable forecasting and accurate spatial NVS, as it provides a view-consistent geometric representation that generalizes well to unseen perspectives. Experiments demonstrate that DiST-4D achieves state-of-the-art performance in both temporal prediction and NVS tasks, while also delivering competitive performance in planning-related evaluations.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Foundation models (FMs) have achieved remarkable success across various domains, yet their adoption in healthcare remains limited. While significant advances have been made in medical imaging, genetic biomarkers, and time series from electronic health records, the potential of FMs for patient behavior monitoring through wearable devices remains underexplored. These datasets are inherently heterogeneous, multisource, and often exhibit high rates of missing data, posing unique challenges. This paper introduces a novel FM based on a modified vector quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE), specifically designed to process real-world data from wearable devices. We demonstrate that our pretrained FM, trained on a broad cohort of psychiatric patients, performs downstream tasks via its latent representation without fine-tuning on a held-out cohort of suicidal patients. To illustrate this, we develop a probabilistic change-point detection algorithm for suicide detection and demonstrate the FM's effectiveness in predicting emotional states. Our results show that the discrete latent structure of the VQ-VAE outperforms a state-of-the-art Informer architecture in unsupervised suicide detection, while matching its performance in supervised emotion prediction when the latent dimensionality is increased, though at the cost of reduced unsupervised accuracy. This trade-off highlights the need for future FMs to integrate hybrid discrete-continuous structures for balanced performance across tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce BigO(Bench), a novel coding benchmark designed to evaluate the capabilities of generative language models in understanding and generating code with specified time and space complexities. This benchmark addresses the gap in current evaluations that often overlook the ability of models to comprehend and produce code constrained by computational complexity. BigO(Bench) includes tooling to infer the algorithmic complexity of any Python function from profiling measurements, including human- or LLM-generated solutions. BigO(Bench) also includes of set of 3,105 coding problems and 1,190,250 solutions from Code Contests annotated with inferred (synthetic) time and space complexity labels from the complexity framework, as well as corresponding runtime and memory footprint values for a large set of input sizes. We present results from evaluating multiple state-of-the-art language models on this benchmark, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses in handling complexity requirements. In particular, token-space reasoning models are unrivaled in code generation but not in complexity understanding, hinting that they may not generalize well to tasks for which no reward was given at training time.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid advancements in generative technology have emerged as a double-edged sword. While offering powerful tools that enhance convenience, they also pose significant social concerns. As defenders, current synthetic image detection methods often lack artifact-level textual interpretability and are overly focused on image manipulation detection, and current datasets usually suffer from outdated generators and a lack of fine-grained annotations. In this paper, we introduce SynthScars, a high-quality and diverse dataset consisting of 12,236 fully synthetic images with human-expert annotations. It features 4 distinct image content types, 3 categories of artifacts, and fine-grained annotations covering pixel-level segmentation, detailed textual explanations, and artifact category labels. Furthermore, we propose LEGION (LEarning to Ground and explain for Synthetic Image detectiON), a multimodal large language model (MLLM)-based image forgery analysis framework that integrates artifact detection, segmentation, and explanation. Building upon this capability, we further explore LEGION as a controller, integrating it into image refinement pipelines to guide the generation of higher-quality and more realistic images. Extensive experiments show that LEGION outperforms existing methods across multiple benchmarks, particularly surpassing the second-best traditional expert on SynthScars by 3.31% in mIoU and 7.75% in F1 score. Moreover, the refined images generated under its guidance exhibit stronger alignment with human preferences. The code, model, and dataset will be released.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce Visual Persona, a foundation model for text-to-image full-body human customization that, given a single in-the-wild human image, generates diverse images of the individual guided by text descriptions. Unlike prior methods that focus solely on preserving facial identity, our approach captures detailed full-body appearance, aligning with text descriptions for body structure and scene variations. Training this model requires large-scale paired human data, consisting of multiple images per individual with consistent full-body identities, which is notoriously difficult to obtain. To address this, we propose a data curation pipeline leveraging vision-language models to evaluate full-body appearance consistency, resulting in Visual Persona-500K, a dataset of 580k paired human images across 100k unique identities. For precise appearance transfer, we introduce a transformer encoder-decoder architecture adapted to a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model, which augments the input image into distinct body regions, encodes these regions as local appearance features, and projects them into dense identity embeddings independently to condition the diffusion model for synthesizing customized images. Visual Persona consistently surpasses existing approaches, generating high-quality, customized images from in-the-wild inputs. Extensive ablation studies validate design choices, and we demonstrate the versatility of Visual Persona across various downstream tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Conventional depth-free multi-view datasets are captured using a moving monocular camera without metric calibration. The scales of camera positions in this monocular setting are ambiguous. Previous methods have acknowledged scale ambiguity in multi-view data via various ad-hoc normalization pre-processing steps, but have not directly analyzed the effect of incorrect scene scales on their application. In this paper, we seek to understand and address the effect of scale ambiguity when used to train generative novel view synthesis methods (GNVS). In GNVS, new views of a scene or object can be minimally synthesized given a single image and are, thus, unconstrained, necessitating the use of generative methods. The generative nature of these models captures all aspects of uncertainty, including any uncertainty of scene scales, which act as nuisance variables for the task. We study the effect of scene scale ambiguity in GNVS when sampled from a single image by isolating its effect on the resulting models and, based on these intuitions, define new metrics that measure the scale inconsistency of generated views. We then propose a framework to estimate scene scales jointly with the GNVS model in an end-to-end fashion. Empirically, we show that our method reduces the scale inconsistency of generated views without the complexity or downsides of previous scale normalization methods. Further, we show that removing this ambiguity improves generated image quality of the resulting GNVS model.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep Learning (DL) models processing images to recognize the health state of large infrastructure components can exhibit biases and rely on non-causal shortcuts. eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) can address these issues but manually analyzing explanations generated by XAI techniques is time-consuming and prone to errors. This work proposes a novel framework that combines post-hoc explanations with semi-supervised learning to automatically identify anomalous explanations that deviate from those of correctly classified images and may therefore indicate model abnormal behaviors. This significantly reduces the workload for maintenance decision-makers, who only need to manually reclassify images flagged as having anomalous explanations. The proposed framework is applied to drone-collected images of insulator shells for power grid infrastructure monitoring, considering two different Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), GradCAM explanations and Deep Semi-Supervised Anomaly Detection. The average classification accuracy on two faulty classes is improved by 8% and maintenance operators are required to manually reclassify only 15% of the images. We compare the proposed framework with a state-of-the-art approach based on the faithfulness metric: the experimental results obtained demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently achieves F_1 scores larger than those of the faithfulness-based approach. Additionally, the proposed framework successfully identifies correct classifications that result from non-causal shortcuts, such as the presence of ID tags printed on insulator shells.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) are proving to be a powerful paradigm in unifying task modeling across diverse data domains, offering key advantages such as memory efficiency and resolution independence. Conventional deep learning models are typically modality-dependent, often requiring custom architectures and objectives for different types of signals. However, existing INR frameworks frequently rely on global latent vectors or exhibit computational inefficiencies that limit their broader applicability. We introduce LIFT, a novel, high-performance framework that addresses these challenges by capturing multiscale information through meta-learning. LIFT leverages multiple parallel localized implicit functions alongside a hierarchical latent generator to produce unified latent representations that span local, intermediate, and global features. This architecture facilitates smooth transitions across local regions, enhancing expressivity while maintaining inference efficiency. Additionally, we introduce ReLIFT, an enhanced variant of LIFT that incorporates residual connections and expressive frequency encodings. With this straightforward approach, ReLIFT effectively addresses the convergence-capacity gap found in comparable methods, providing an efficient yet powerful solution to improve capacity and speed up convergence. Empirical results show that LIFT achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in generative modeling and classification tasks, with notable reductions in computational costs. Moreover, in single-task settings, the streamlined ReLIFT architecture proves effective in signal representations and inverse problem tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper addresses the challenge of text-conditioned streaming motion generation, which requires us to predict the next-step human pose based on variable-length historical motions and incoming texts. Existing methods struggle to achieve streaming motion generation, e.g., diffusion models are constrained by pre-defined motion lengths, while GPT-based methods suffer from delayed response and error accumulation problem due to discretized non-causal tokenization. To solve these problems, we propose MotionStreamer, a novel framework that incorporates a continuous causal latent space into a probabilistic autoregressive model. The continuous latents mitigate information loss caused by discretization and effectively reduce error accumulation during long-term autoregressive generation. In addition, by establishing temporal causal dependencies between current and historical motion latents, our model fully utilizes the available information to achieve accurate online motion decoding. Experiments show that our method outperforms existing approaches while offering more applications, including multi-round generation, long-term generation, and dynamic motion composition.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) have emerged as a powerful generative modeling technique. Despite their remarkable results, they typically suffer from slow inference with several steps. In this paper, we propose Di$\mathtt{[M]}$O, a novel approach that distills masked diffusion models into a one-step generator. Di$\mathtt{[M]}$O addresses two key challenges: (1) the intractability of using intermediate-step information for one-step generation, which we solve through token-level distribution matching that optimizes model output logits by an 'on-policy framework' with the help of an auxiliary model; and (2) the lack of entropy in the initial distribution, which we address through a token initialization strategy that injects randomness while maintaining similarity to teacher training distribution. We show Di$\mathtt{[M]}$O's effectiveness on both class-conditional and text-conditional image generation, impressively achieving performance competitive to multi-step teacher outputs while drastically reducing inference time. To our knowledge, we are the first to successfully achieve one-step distillation of masked diffusion models and the first to apply discrete distillation to text-to-image generation, opening new paths for efficient generative modeling.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) have traditionally been aligned through one-size-fits-all approaches that assume uniform human preferences, fundamentally overlooking the diversity in user values and needs. This paper introduces a comprehensive framework for scalable personalized alignment of LLMs. We establish a systematic preference space characterizing psychological and behavioral dimensions, alongside diverse persona representations for robust preference inference in real-world scenarios. Building upon this foundation, we introduce \textsc{AlignX}, a large-scale dataset of over 1.3 million personalized preference examples, and develop two complementary alignment approaches: \textit{in-context alignment} directly conditioning on persona representations and \textit{preference-bridged alignment} modeling intermediate preference distributions. Extensive experiments demonstrate substantial improvements over existing methods, with an average 17.06\% accuracy gain across four benchmarks while exhibiting a strong adaptation capability to novel preferences, robustness to limited user data, and precise preference controllability. These results validate our framework's effectiveness, advancing toward truly user-adaptive AI systems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion Models (DM) have revolutionized the text-to-image visual generation process. However, the large computational cost and model footprint of DMs hinders practical deployment, especially on edge devices. Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a lightweight method to alleviate these burdens without the need for training or fine-tuning. While recent DM PTQ methods achieve W4A8 on integer-based PTQ, two key limitations remain: First, while most existing DM PTQ methods evaluate on classical DMs like Stable Diffusion XL, 1.5 or earlier, which use convolutional U-Nets, newer Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models like the PixArt series, Hunyuan and others adopt fundamentally different transformer backbones to achieve superior image synthesis. Second, integer (INT) quantization is prevailing in DM PTQ but doesn't align well with the network weight and activation distribution, while Floating-Point Quantization (FPQ) is still under-investigated, yet it holds the potential to better align the weight and activation distributions in low-bit settings for DiT. In response, we introduce FP4DiT, a PTQ method that leverages FPQ to achieve W4A6 quantization. Specifically, we extend and generalize the Adaptive Rounding PTQ technique to adequately calibrate weight quantization for FPQ and demonstrate that DiT activations depend on input patch data, necessitating robust online activation quantization techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that FP4DiT outperforms integer-based PTQ at W4A6 and W4A8 precision and generates convincing visual content on PixArt-$\alpha$, PixArt-$\Sigma$ and Hunyuan in terms of several T2I metrics such as HPSv2 and CLIP.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Egocentric video-language pretraining has significantly advanced video representation learning. Humans perceive and interact with a fully 3D world, developing spatial awareness that extends beyond text-based understanding. However, most previous works learn from 1D text or 2D visual cues, such as bounding boxes, which inherently lack 3D understanding. To bridge this gap, we introduce EgoDTM, an Egocentric Depth- and Text-aware Model, jointly trained through large-scale 3D-aware video pretraining and video-text contrastive learning. EgoDTM incorporates a lightweight 3D-aware decoder to efficiently learn 3D-awareness from pseudo depth maps generated by depth estimation models. To further facilitate 3D-aware video pretraining, we enrich the original brief captions with hand-object visual cues by organically combining several foundation models. Extensive experiments demonstrate EgoDTM's superior performance across diverse downstream tasks, highlighting its superior 3D-aware visual understanding.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Foundation models trained on vast amounts of data have demonstrated remarkable reasoning and generation capabilities in the domains of text, images, audio and video. Our goal at Roblox is to build such a foundation model for 3D intelligence, a model that can support developers in producing all aspects of a Roblox experience, from generating 3D objects and scenes to rigging characters for animation to producing programmatic scripts describing object behaviors. We discuss three key design requirements for such a 3D foundation model and then present our first step towards building such a model. We expect that 3D geometric shapes will be a core data type and describe our solution for 3D shape tokenizer. We show how our tokenization scheme can be used in applications for text-to-shape generation, shape-to-text generation and text-to-scene generation. We demonstrate how these applications can collaborate with existing large language models (LLMs) to perform scene analysis and reasoning. We conclude with a discussion outlining our path to building a fully unified foundation model for 3D intelligence.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Modelling human variation in rating tasks is crucial for enabling AI systems for personalization, pluralistic model alignment, and computational social science. We propose representing individuals using value profiles -- natural language descriptions of underlying values compressed from in-context demonstrations -- along with a steerable decoder model to estimate ratings conditioned on a value profile or other rater information. To measure the predictive information in rater representations, we introduce an information-theoretic methodology. We find that demonstrations contain the most information, followed by value profiles and then demographics. However, value profiles offer advantages in terms of scrutability, interpretability, and steerability due to their compressed natural language format. Value profiles effectively compress the useful information from demonstrations (>70% information preservation). Furthermore, clustering value profiles to identify similarly behaving individuals better explains rater variation than the most predictive demographic groupings. Going beyond test set performance, we show that the decoder models interpretably change ratings according to semantic profile differences, are well-calibrated, and can help explain instance-level disagreement by simulating an annotator population. These results demonstrate that value profiles offer novel, predictive ways to describe individual variation beyond demographics or group information.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Despite the recent success of image-text contrastive models like CLIP and SigLIP, these models often struggle with vision-centric tasks that demand high-fidelity image understanding, such as counting, depth estimation, and fine-grained object recognition. These models, by performing language alignment, tend to prioritize high-level semantics over visual understanding, weakening their image understanding. On the other hand, vision-focused models are great at processing visual information but struggle to understand language, limiting their flexibility for language-driven tasks. In this work, we introduce TULIP, an open-source, drop-in replacement for existing CLIP-like models. Our method leverages generative data augmentation, enhanced image-image and text-text contrastive learning, and image/text reconstruction regularization to learn fine-grained visual features while preserving global semantic alignment. Our approach, scaling to over 1B parameters, outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models across multiple benchmarks, establishing a new SOTA zero-shot performance on ImageNet-1K, delivering up to a $2\times$ enhancement over SigLIP on RxRx1 in linear probing for few-shot classification, and improving vision-language models, achieving over $3\times$ higher scores than SigLIP on MMVP.
