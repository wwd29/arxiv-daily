<li>Summary: <p>Gland instance segmentation is an essential but challenging task in the
diagnosis and treatment of adenocarcinoma. The existing models usually achieve
gland instance segmentation through multi-task learning and boundary loss
constraint. However, how to deal with the problems of gland adhesion and
inaccurate boundary in segmenting the complex samples remains a challenge. In
this work, we propose a displacement-field assisted graph energy transmitter
(DFGET) framework to solve these problems. Specifically, a novel message
passing manner based on anisotropic diffusion is developed to update the node
features, which can distinguish the isomorphic graphs and improve the
expressivity of graph nodes for complex samples. Using such graph framework,
the gland semantic segmentation map and the displacement field (DF) of the
graph nodes are estimated with two graph network branches. With the constraint
of DF, a graph cluster module based on diffusion theory is presented to improve
the intra-class feature consistency and inter-class feature discrepancy, as
well as to separate the adherent glands from the semantic segmentation maps.
Extensive comparison and ablation experiments on the GlaS dataset demonstrate
the superiority of DFGET and effectiveness of the proposed anisotropic message
passing manner and clustering method. Compared to the best comparative model,
DFGET increases the object-Dice and object-F1 score by 2.5% and 3.4%
respectively, while decreases the object-HD by 32.4%, achieving
state-of-the-art performance.

<li>Summary: <p>Popular guidance for denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) linearly
combines distinct conditional models together to provide enhanced control over
samples. However, this approach overlooks nonlinear effects that become
significant when guidance scale is large. To address this issue, we propose
characteristic guidance, a novel method that provides non-linear correction for
classifier-free guided DDPMs. Such correction forces the guided DDPMs to
respect the Fokker-Planck equation of their underlying diffusion process, in a
way that is first-principle, training-free, derivative-free, and compatible
with existing sampling methods. Experiments show that characteristic guidance
is robust to various applications, offers enhanced control over sample
generation, suppresses color and exposure issues even for latent space
sampling, and can handle physics problems such as the phase transitions.

<li>Summary: <p>In ill-posed inverse problems, it is commonly desirable to obtain insight
into the full spectrum of plausible solutions, rather than extracting only a
single reconstruction. Information about the plausible solutions and their
likelihoods is encoded in the posterior distribution. However, for
high-dimensional data, this distribution is challenging to visualize. In this
work, we introduce a new approach for estimating and visualizing posteriors by
employing energy-based models (EBMs) over low-dimensional subspaces.
Specifically, we train a conditional EBM that receives an input measurement and
a set of directions that span some low-dimensional subspace of solutions, and
outputs the probability density function of the posterior within that space. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across a diverse range of datasets
and image restoration problems, showcasing its strength in uncertainty
quantification and visualization. As we show, our method outperforms a baseline
that projects samples from a diffusion-based posterior sampler, while being
orders of magnitude faster. Furthermore, it is more accurate than a baseline
that assumes a Gaussian posterior.

<li>Summary: <p>The application of 2D markerless gait analysis has garnered increasing
interest and application within clinical settings. However, its effectiveness
in the realm of lower-limb amputees has remained less than optimal. In
response, this study introduces an innovative zero-shot method employing image
generation diffusion models to achieve markerless pose estimation for
lower-limb prosthetics, presenting a promising solution to gait analysis for
this specific population. Our approach demonstrates an enhancement in detecting
key points on prosthetic limbs over existing methods, and enables clinicians to
gain invaluable insights into the kinematics of lower-limb amputees across the
gait cycle. The outcomes obtained not only serve as a proof-of-concept for the
feasibility of this zero-shot approach but also underscore its potential in
advancing rehabilitation through gait analysis for this unique population.

<li>Summary: <p>Despite the success of diffusion-based customization methods on visual
content creation, increasing concerns have been raised about such techniques
from both privacy and political perspectives. To tackle this issue, several
anti-customization methods have been proposed in very recent months,
predominantly grounded in adversarial attacks. Unfortunately, most of these
methods adopt straightforward designs, such as end-to-end optimization with a
focus on adversarially maximizing the original training loss, thereby
neglecting nuanced internal properties intrinsic to the diffusion model, and
even leading to ineffective optimization in some diffusion time steps. In this
paper, we strive to bridge this gap by undertaking a comprehensive exploration
of these inherent properties, to boost the performance of current
anti-customization approaches. Two aspects of properties are investigated: 1)
We examine the relationship between time step selection and the model's
perception in the frequency domain of images and find that lower time steps can
give much more contributions to adversarial noises. This inspires us to propose
an adaptive greedy search for optimal time steps that seamlessly integrates
with existing anti-customization methods. 2) We scrutinize the roles of
features at different layers during denoising and devise a sophisticated
feature-based optimization framework for anti-customization. Experiments on
facial benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly increases
identity disruption, thereby enhancing user privacy and security.

<li>Summary: <p>The recently emerging text-to-motion advances have spired numerous attempts
for convenient and interactive human motion generation. Yet, existing methods
are largely limited to generating body motions only without considering the
rich two-hand motions, let alone handling various conditions like body dynamics
or texts. To break the data bottleneck, we propose BOTH57M, a novel multi-modal
dataset for two-hand motion generation. Our dataset includes accurate motion
tracking for the human body and hands and provides pair-wised finger-level hand
annotations and body descriptions. We further provide a strong baseline method,
BOTH2Hands, for the novel task: generating vivid two-hand motions from both
implicit body dynamics and explicit text prompts. We first warm up two parallel
body-to-hand and text-to-hand diffusion models and then utilize the
cross-attention transformer for motion blending. Extensive experiments and
cross-validations demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and dataset for
generating convincing two-hand motions from the hybrid body-and-textual
conditions. Our dataset and code will be disseminated to the community for
future research.

<li>Summary: <p>Data augmentation has been recently leveraged as an effective regularizer in
various vision-language deep neural networks. However, in text-to-image
synthesis (T2Isyn), current augmentation wisdom still suffers from the semantic
mismatch between augmented paired data. Even worse, semantic collapse may occur
when generated images are less semantically constrained. In this paper, we
develop a novel Semantic-aware Data Augmentation (SADA) framework dedicated to
T2Isyn. In particular, we propose to augment texts in the semantic space via an
Implicit Textual Semantic Preserving Augmentation ($ITA$), in conjunction with
a specifically designed Image Semantic Regularization Loss ($L_r$) as Generated
Image Semantic Conservation, to cope well with semantic mismatch and collapse.
As one major contribution, we theoretically show that $ITA$ can certify better
text-image consistency while $L_r$ regularizing the semantics of generated
images would avoid semantic collapse and enhance image quality. Extensive
experiments validate that SADA enhances text-image consistency and improves
image quality significantly in T2Isyn models across various backbones.
Especially, incorporating SADA during the tuning process of Stable Diffusion
models also yields performance improvements.

<li>Summary: <p>As a class of fruitful approaches, diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have
shown excellent advantages in high-resolution image reconstruction. On the
other hand, masked autoencoders (MAEs), as popular self-supervised vision
learners, have demonstrated simpler and more effective image reconstruction and
transfer capabilities on downstream tasks. However, they all require extremely
high training costs, either due to inherent high temporal-dependence (i.e.,
excessively long diffusion steps) or due to artificially low spatial-dependence
(i.e., human-formulated high mask ratio, such as 0.75). To the end, this paper
presents LMD, a faster image reconstruction framework with latent masking
diffusion. First, we propose to project and reconstruct images in latent space
through a pre-trained variational autoencoder, which is theoretically more
efficient than in the pixel-based space. Then, we combine the advantages of
MAEs and DPMs to design a progressive masking diffusion model, which gradually
increases the masking proportion by three different schedulers and reconstructs
the latent features from simple to difficult, without sequentially performing
denoising diffusion as in DPMs or using fixed high masking ratio as in MAEs, so
as to alleviate the high training time-consumption predicament. Our approach
allows for learning high-capacity models and accelerate their training (by 3x
or more) and barely reduces the original accuracy. Inference speed in
downstream tasks also significantly outperforms the previous approaches.

<li>Summary: <p>With the great success of text-conditioned diffusion models in creative
text-to-image generation, various text-driven image editing approaches have
attracted the attentions of many researchers. However, previous works mainly
focus on discreteness-sensitive instructions such as adding, removing or
replacing specific objects, background elements or global styles (i.e., hard
editing), while generally ignoring subject-binding but semantically
fine-changing continuity-sensitive instructions such as actions, poses or
adjectives, and so on (i.e., soft editing), which hampers generative AI from
generating user-customized visual contents. To mitigate this predicament, we
propose a spatio-temporal guided adaptive editing algorithm AdapEdit, which
realizes adaptive image editing by introducing a soft-attention strategy to
dynamically vary the guiding degree from the editing conditions to visual
pixels from both temporal and spatial perspectives. Note our approach has a
significant advantage in preserving model priors and does not require model
training, fine-tuning, extra data, or optimization. We present our results over
a wide variety of raw images and editing instructions, demonstrating
competitive performance and showing it significantly outperforms the previous
approaches.

<li>Summary: <p>Variational autoencoder (VAE) and generative adversarial networks (GAN) have
found widespread applications in clustering and have achieved significant
success. However, the potential of these approaches may be limited due to VAE's
mediocre generation capability or GAN's well-known instability during
adversarial training. In contrast, denoising diffusion probabilistic models
(DDPMs) represent a new and promising class of generative models that may
unlock fresh dimensions in clustering. In this study, we introduce an
innovative expectation-maximization (EM) framework for clustering using DDPMs.
In the E-step, we aim to derive a mixture of Gaussian priors for the subsequent
M-step. In the M-step, our focus lies in learning clustering-friendly latent
representations for the data by employing the conditional DDPM and matching the
distribution of latent representations to the mixture of Gaussian priors. We
present a rigorous theoretical analysis of the optimization process in the
M-step, proving that the optimizations are equivalent to maximizing the lower
bound of the Q function within the vanilla EM framework under certain
constraints. Comprehensive experiments validate the advantages of the proposed
framework, showcasing superior performance in clustering, unsupervised
conditional generation and latent representation learning.

<li>Summary: <p>Inversion methods, such as Textual Inversion, generate personalized images by
incorporating concepts of interest provided by user images. However, existing
methods often suffer from overfitting issues, where the dominant presence of
inverted concepts leads to the absence of other desired concepts. It stems from
the fact that during inversion, the irrelevant semantics in the user images are
also encoded, forcing the inverted concepts to occupy locations far from the
core distribution in the embedding space. To address this issue, we propose a
method that guides the inversion process towards the core distribution for
compositional embeddings. Additionally, we introduce a spatial regularization
approach to balance the attention on the concepts being composed. Our method is
designed as a post-training approach and can be seamlessly integrated with
other inversion methods. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposed approach in mitigating the overfitting problem and generating more
diverse and balanced compositions of concepts in the synthesized images. The

<li>Summary: <p>Ancient artifacts are an important medium for cultural preservation and
restoration. However, many physical copies of artifacts are either damaged or
lost, leaving a blank space in archaeological and historical studies that calls
for artifact image generation techniques. Despite the significant advancements
in open-domain text-to-image synthesis, existing approaches fail to capture the
important domain knowledge presented in the textual description, resulting in
errors in recreated images such as incorrect shapes and patterns. In this
paper, we propose a novel knowledge-aware artifact image synthesis approach
that brings lost historical objects accurately into their visual forms. We use
a pretrained diffusion model as backbone and introduce three key techniques to
enhance the text-to-image generation framework: 1) we construct prompts with
explicit archaeological knowledge elicited from large language models (LLMs);
2) we incorporate additional textual guidance to correlated historical
expertise in a contrastive manner; 3) we introduce further visual-semantic
constraints on edge and perceptual features that enable our model to learn more
intricate visual details of the artifacts. Compared to existing approaches, our
proposed model produces higher-quality artifact images that align better with
the implicit details and historical knowledge contained within written
documents, thus achieving significant improvements across automatic metrics and
in human evaluation. Our code and data are available at

<li>Summary: <p>This work aims to improve the efficiency of text-to-image diffusion models.
While diffusion models use computationally expensive UNet-based denoising
operations in every generation step, we identify that not all operations are
equally relevant for the final output quality. In particular, we observe that
UNet layers operating on high-res feature maps are relatively sensitive to
small perturbations. In contrast, low-res feature maps influence the semantic
layout of the final image and can often be perturbed with no noticeable change
in the output. Based on this observation, we propose Clockwork Diffusion, a
method that periodically reuses computation from preceding denoising steps to
approximate low-res feature maps at one or more subsequent steps. For multiple
baselines, and for both text-to-image generation and image editing, we
demonstrate that Clockwork leads to comparable or improved perceptual scores
with drastically reduced computational complexity. As an example, for Stable
Diffusion v1.5 with 8 DPM++ steps we save 32% of FLOPs with negligible FID and
CLIP change.

<li>Summary: <p>Despite large-scale diffusion models being highly capable of generating
diverse open-world content, they still struggle to match the photorealism and
fidelity of concept-specific generators. In this work, we present the task of
customizing large-scale diffusion priors for specific concepts as
concept-centric personalization. Our goal is to generate high-quality
concept-centric images while maintaining the versatile controllability inherent
to open-world models, enabling applications in diverse tasks such as
concept-centric stylization and image translation. To tackle these challenges,
we identify catastrophic forgetting of guidance prediction from diffusion
priors as the fundamental issue. Consequently, we develop a guidance-decoupled
personalization framework specifically designed to address this task. We
propose Generalized Classifier-free Guidance (GCFG) as the foundational theory
for our framework. This approach extends Classifier-free Guidance (CFG) to
accommodate an arbitrary number of guidances, sourced from a variety of
conditions and models. Employing GCFG enables us to separate conditional
guidance into two distinct components: concept guidance for fidelity and
control guidance for controllability. This division makes it feasible to train
a specialized model for concept guidance, while ensuring both control and
unconditional guidance remain intact. We then present a null-text
Concept-centric Diffusion Model as a concept-specific generator to learn
concept guidance without the need for text annotations. Code will be available

<li>Summary: <p>Precise boundary segmentation of volumetric images is a critical task for
image-guided diagnosis and computer-assisted intervention, especially for
boundary confusion in clinical practice. However, U-shape networks cannot
effectively resolve this challenge due to the lack of boundary shape
constraints. Besides, existing methods of refining boundaries overemphasize the
slender structure, which results in the overfitting phenomenon due to networks'
limited abilities to model tiny objects. In this paper, we reconceptualize the
mechanism of boundary generation by encompassing the interaction dynamics with
adjacent regions. Moreover, we propose a unified network termed PnPNet to model
shape characteristics of the confused boundary region. Core ingredients of
PnPNet contain the pushing and pulling branches. Specifically, based on
diffusion theory, we devise the semantic difference module (SDM) from the
pushing branch to squeeze the boundary region. Explicit and implicit
differential information inside SDM significantly boost representation
abilities for inter-class boundaries. Additionally, motivated by the K-means
algorithm, the class clustering module (CCM) from the pulling branch is
introduced to stretch the intersected boundary region. Thus, pushing and
pulling branches will shrink and enlarge the boundary uncertainty respectively.
They furnish two adversarial forces to promote models to output a more precise
delineation of boundaries. We carry out experiments on three challenging public
datasets and one in-house dataset, containing three types of boundary confusion
in model predictions. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of
PnPNet over other segmentation networks, especially on evaluation metrics of HD
and ASSD. Besides, pushing and pulling branches can serve as plug-and-play
modules to enhance classic U-shape baseline models. Codes are available.

<li>Summary: <p>With the rapid advancement of diffusion-based image-generative models, the
quality of generated images has become increasingly photorealistic. Moreover,
with the release of high-quality pre-trained image-generative models, a growing
number of users are downloading these pre-trained models to fine-tune them with
downstream datasets for various image-generation tasks. However, employing such
powerful pre-trained models in downstream tasks presents significant privacy
leakage risks. In this paper, we propose the first reconstruction-based
membership inference attack framework, tailored for recent diffusion models,
and in the more stringent black-box access setting. Considering four distinct
attack scenarios and three types of attacks, this framework is capable of

<li>Summary: <p>In Score based Generative Modeling (SGMs), the state-of-the-art in generative
modeling, stochastic reverse processes are known to perform better than their
deterministic counterparts. This paper delves into the heart of this
phenomenon, comparing neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and neural
stochastic differential equations (SDEs) as reverse processes. We use a control
theoretic perspective by posing the approximation of the reverse process as a
trajectory tracking problem. We analyze the ability of neural SDEs to
approximate trajectories of the Fokker-Planck equation, revealing the
advantages of stochasticity. First, neural SDEs exhibit a powerful regularizing
effect, enabling $L^2$ norm trajectory approximation surpassing the Wasserstein
metric approximation achieved by neural ODEs under similar conditions, even
when the reference vector field or score function is not Lipschitz. Applying
this result, we establish the class of distributions that can be sampled using
score matching in SGMs, relaxing the Lipschitz requirement on the gradient of
the data distribution in existing literature. Second, we show that this
approximation property is preserved when network width is limited to the input
dimension of the network. In this limited width case, the weights act as
control inputs, framing our analysis as a controllability problem for neural
SDEs in probability density space. This sheds light on how noise helps to steer
the system towards the desired solution and illuminates the empirical success
of stochasticity in generative modeling.

<li>Summary: <p>Diffusion models have demonstrated robust data generation capabilities in
various research fields. In this paper, a Time Series Diffusion Method (TSDM)
is proposed for vibration signal generation, leveraging the foundational
principles of diffusion models. The TSDM uses an improved U-net architecture
with attention block to effectively segment and extract features from
one-dimensional time series data. It operates based on forward diffusion and
reverse denoising processes for time-series generation. Experimental validation
is conducted using single-frequency, multi-frequency datasets, and bearing
fault datasets. The results show that TSDM can accurately generate the
single-frequency and multi-frequency features in the time series and retain the
basic frequency features for the diffusion generation results of the bearing
fault series. Finally, TSDM is applied to the small sample fault diagnosis of
three public bearing fault datasets, and the results show that the accuracy of
small sample fault diagnosis of the three datasets is improved by 32.380%,
18.355% and 9.298% at most, respectively

<li>Summary: <p>Symmetric positive definite~(SPD) matrices have shown important value and
applications in statistics and machine learning, such as FMRI analysis and
traffic prediction. Previous works on SPD matrices mostly focus on
discriminative models, where predictions are made directly on $E(X|y)$, where
$y$ is a vector and $X$ is an SPD matrix. However, these methods are
challenging to handle for large-scale data, as they need to access and process
the whole data. In this paper, inspired by denoising diffusion probabilistic
model~(DDPM), we propose a novel generative model, termed SPD-DDPM, by
introducing Gaussian distribution in the SPD space to estimate $E(X|y)$.
Moreover, our model is able to estimate $p(X)$ unconditionally and flexibly
without giving $y$. On the one hand, the model conditionally learns $p(X|y)$
and utilizes the mean of samples to obtain $E(X|y)$ as a prediction. On the
other hand, the model unconditionally learns the probability distribution of
the data $p(X)$ and generates samples that conform to this distribution.
Furthermore, we propose a new SPD net which is much deeper than the previous
networks and allows for the inclusion of conditional factors. Experiment
results on toy data and real taxi data demonstrate that our models effectively
fit the data distribution both unconditionally and unconditionally and provide
accurate predictions.

<li>Summary: <p>Self-supervised learning has emerged as a viable method to leverage the
abundance of unlabeled medical imaging data, addressing the challenge of
labeled data scarcity in medical image analysis. In particular, masked image
modeling (MIM) with visual token reconstruction has shown promising results in
the general computer vision (CV) domain and serves as a candidate for medical
image analysis. However, the presence of heterogeneous 2D and 3D medical images
often limits the volume and diversity of training data that can be effectively
used for a single model structure. In this work, we propose a spatially
adaptive convolution (SAC) module, which adaptively adjusts convolution
parameters based on the voxel spacing of the input images. Employing this SAC
module, we build a universal visual tokenizer and a universal Vision
Transformer (ViT) capable of effectively processing a wide range of medical
images with various imaging modalities and spatial properties. Moreover, in
order to enhance the robustness of the visual tokenizer's reconstruction
objective for MIM, we suggest to generalize the discrete token output of the
visual tokenizer to a probabilistic soft token. We show that the generalized
soft token representation can be effectively integrated with the prior
distribution regularization through a constructive interpretation. As a result,
we pre-train a universal visual tokenizer followed by a universal ViT via
visual token reconstruction on 55 public medical image datasets, comprising
over 9 million 2D slices (including over 48,000 3D images). This represents the
largest, most comprehensive, and diverse dataset for pre-training 3D medical
image models to our knowledge. Experimental results on downstream medical image
classification and segmentation tasks demonstrate the superior performance of
our model and improved label efficiency.

<li>Summary: <p>Previous endeavors in self-supervised learning have enlightened the research
of deep clustering from an instance discrimination perspective. Built upon this
foundation, recent studies further highlight the importance of grouping
semantically similar instances. One effective method to achieve this is by
promoting the semantic structure preserved by neighborhood consistency.
However, the samples in the local neighborhood may be limited due to their
close proximity to each other, which may not provide substantial and diverse
supervision signals. Inspired by the versatile re-ranking methods in the
context of image retrieval, we propose to employ an efficient online re-ranking
process to mine more informative neighbors in a Contextually Affinitive
(ConAff) Neighborhood, and then encourage the cross-view neighborhood
consistency. To further mitigate the intrinsic neighborhood noises near cluster
boundaries, we propose a progressively relaxed boundary filtering strategy to
circumvent the issues brought by noisy neighbors. Our method can be easily
integrated into the generic self-supervised frameworks and outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods on several popular benchmarks.

<li>Summary: <p>The field of computational pathology has witnessed remarkable progress in the
development of both task-specific predictive models and task-agnostic
self-supervised vision encoders. However, despite the explosive growth of
generative artificial intelligence (AI), there has been limited study on
building general purpose, multimodal AI assistants tailored to pathology. Here
we present PathChat, a vision-language generalist AI assistant for human
pathology using an in-house developed foundational vision encoder pretrained on
100 million histology images from over 100,000 patient cases and 1.18 million
pathology image-caption pairs. The vision encoder is then combined with a
pretrained large language model and the whole system is finetuned on over
250,000 diverse disease agnostic visual language instructions. We compare
PathChat against several multimodal vision language AI assistants as well as
GPT4V, which powers the commercially available multimodal general purpose AI
assistant ChatGPT-4. When relevant clinical context is provided with the
histology image, PathChat achieved a diagnostic accuracy of 87% on
multiple-choice questions based on publicly available cases of diverse tissue
origins and disease models. Additionally, using open-ended questions and human
expert evaluation, we found that overall PathChat produced more accurate and
pathologist-preferable responses to diverse queries related to pathology. As an
interactive and general vision language AI assistant that can flexibly handle
both visual and natural language inputs, PathChat can potentially find
impactful applications in pathology education, research, and human-in-the-loop

<li>Summary: <p>Researchers have recently found that Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) is
vulnerable to backdoor attacks. The attacker can embed hidden SSL backdoors via
a few poisoned examples in the training dataset and maliciously manipulate the
behavior of downstream models. To defend against SSL backdoor attacks, a
feasible route is to detect and remove the poisonous samples in the training
set. However, the existing SSL backdoor defense method fails to detect the
poisonous samples precisely. In this paper, we propose to erase the SSL
backdoor by cluster activation masking and propose a novel PoisonCAM method.
After obtaining the threat model trained on the poisoned dataset, our method
can precisely detect poisonous samples based on the assumption that masking the
backdoor trigger can effectively change the activation of a downstream
clustering model. In experiments, our PoisonCAM achieves 96% accuracy for
backdoor trigger detection compared to 3% of the state-of-the-art method on
poisoned ImageNet-100. Moreover, our proposed PoisonCAM significantly improves
the performance of the trained SSL model under backdoor attacks compared to the
state-of-the-art method. Our code will be available at

<li>Summary: <p>Class-agnostic motion prediction methods aim to comprehend motion within
open-world scenarios, holding significance for autonomous driving systems.
However, training a high-performance model in a fully-supervised manner always
requires substantial amounts of manually annotated data, which can be both
expensive and time-consuming to obtain. To address this challenge, our study
explores the potential of semi-supervised learning (SSL) for class-agnostic
motion prediction. Our SSL framework adopts a consistency-based self-training
paradigm, enabling the model to learn from unlabeled data by generating pseudo
labels through test-time inference. To improve the quality of pseudo labels, we
propose a novel motion selection and re-generation module. This module
effectively selects reliable pseudo labels and re-generates unreliable ones.
Furthermore, we propose two data augmentation strategies: temporal sampling and
BEVMix. These strategies facilitate consistency regularization in SSL.
Experiments conducted on nuScenes demonstrate that our SSL method can surpass
the self-supervised approach by a large margin by utilizing only a tiny
fraction of labeled data. Furthermore, our method exhibits comparable
performance to weakly and some fully supervised methods. These results
highlight the ability of our method to strike a favorable balance between
annotation costs and performance. Code will be available at

<li>Summary: <p>In this paper, we firstly consider view-dependent effects into single
image-based novel view synthesis (NVS) problems. For this, we propose to
exploit the camera motion priors in NVS to model view-dependent appearance or
effects (VDE) as the negative disparity in the scene. By recognizing
specularities "follow" the camera motion, we infuse VDEs into the input images
by aggregating input pixel colors along the negative depth region of the
epipolar lines. Also, we propose a `relaxed volumetric rendering' approximation
that allows computing the densities in a single pass, improving efficiency for
NVS from single images. Our method can learn single-image NVS from image
sequences only, which is a completely self-supervised learning method, for the
first time requiring neither depth nor camera pose annotations. We present
extensive experiment results and show that our proposed method can learn NVS
with VDEs, outperforming the SOTA single-view NVS methods on the RealEstate10k
and MannequinChallenge datasets.

<li>Summary: <p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) for RGB images has achieved significant
success, yet there is still limited research on SSL for infrared images,
primarily due to three prominent challenges: 1) the lack of a suitable
large-scale infrared pre-training dataset, 2) the distinctiveness of non-iconic
infrared images rendering common pre-training tasks like masked image modeling
(MIM) less effective, and 3) the scarcity of fine-grained textures making it
particularly challenging to learn general image features. To address these
issues, we construct a Multi-Scene Infrared Pre-training (MSIP) dataset
comprising 178,756 images, and introduce object-sensitive random RoI cropping,
an image preprocessing method, to tackle the challenge posed by non-iconic
images. To alleviate the impact of weak textures on feature learning, we
propose a pre-training paradigm called Pre-training with ADapter (PAD), which
uses adapters to learn domain-specific features while freezing parameters
pre-trained on ImageNet to retain the general feature extraction capability.
This new paradigm is applicable to any transformer-based SSL method.
Furthermore, to achieve more flexible coordination between pre-trained and
newly-learned features in different layers and patches, a patchwise-scale
adapter with dynamically learnable scale factors is introduced. Extensive
experiments on three downstream tasks show that PAD, with only 1.23M
pre-trainable parameters, outperforms other baseline paradigms including
continual full pre-training on MSIP. Our code and dataset are available at

<li>Summary: <p>Symmetry detection, especially partial and extrinsic symmetry, is essential
for various downstream tasks, like 3D geometry completion, segmentation,
compression and structure-aware shape encoding or generation. In order to
detect partial extrinsic symmetries, we propose to learn rotation, reflection,
translation and scale invariant local shape features for geodesic point cloud
patches via contrastive learning, which are robust across multiple classes and
generalize over different datasets. We show that our approach is able to
extract multiple valid solutions for this ambiguous problem. Furthermore, we
introduce a novel benchmark test for partial extrinsic symmetry detection to
evaluate our method. Lastly, we incorporate the detected symmetries together
with a region growing algorithm to demonstrate a downstream task with the goal
of computing symmetry-aware partitions of 3D shapes. To our knowledge, we are
the first to propose a self-supervised data-driven method for partial extrinsic
symmetry detection.

<li>Summary: <p>Data annotated by humans is a source of knowledge by describing the
peculiarities of the problem and therefore fueling the decision process of the
trained model. Unfortunately, the annotation process for subjective natural
language processing (NLP) problems like offensiveness or emotion detection is
often very expensive and time-consuming. One of the inevitable risks is to
spend some of the funds and annotator effort on annotations that do not provide
any additional knowledge about the specific task. To minimize these costs, we
propose a new model-based approach that allows the selection of tasks annotated
individually for each text in a multi-task scenario. The experiments carried
out on three datasets, dozens of NLP tasks, and thousands of annotations show
that our method allows up to 40% reduction in the number of annotations with
negligible loss of knowledge. The results also emphasize the need to collect a
diverse amount of data required to efficiently train a model, depending on the
subjectivity of the annotation task. We also focused on measuring the relation
between subjective tasks by evaluating the model in single-task and multi-task
scenarios. Moreover, for some datasets, training only on the labels predicted
by our model improved the efficiency of task selection as a self-supervised
learning regularization technique.

<li>Summary: <p>Likelihood-free inference is quickly emerging as a powerful tool to perform
fast/effective parameter estimation. We demonstrate a technique of optimizing
likelihood-free inference to make it even faster by marginalizing symmetries in
a physical problem. In this approach, physical symmetries, for example,
time-translation are learned using joint-embedding via self-supervised learning
with symmetry data augmentations. Subsequently, parameter inference is
performed using a normalizing flow where the embedding network is used to
summarize the data before conditioning the parameters. We present this approach
on two simple physical problems and we show faster convergence in a smaller
number of parameters compared to a normalizing flow that does not use a
pre-trained symmetry-informed representation.

training, aided by a large language model (LLM), a novel transformer-based

our unified approach outperforms existing methods specialized for each task by

<li>Summary: <p>Multimodal machine learning, especially text-to-image models like Stable
Diffusion and DALL-E 3, has gained significance for transforming text into
detailed images.
</p>
<p>Despite their growing use and remarkable generative capabilities, there is a
pressing need for a detailed examination of these models' behavior,
particularly with respect to memorization. Historically, memorization in
machine learning has been context-dependent, with diverse definitions emerging
from classification tasks to complex models like Large Language Models (LLMs)
and Diffusion models. Yet, a definitive concept of memorization that aligns
with the intricacies of text-to-image synthesis remains elusive. This
understanding is vital as memorization poses privacy risks yet is essential for
meeting user expectations, especially when generating representations of
underrepresented entities. In this paper, we introduce a specialized definition
of memorization tailored to text-to-image models, categorizing it into three
distinct types according to user expectations. We closely examine the subtle
distinctions between intended and unintended memorization, emphasizing the
importance of balancing user privacy with the generative quality of the model
outputs. Using the Stable Diffusion model, we offer examples to validate our
memorization definitions and clarify their application.

<li>Summary: <p>Text-to-image (TTI) generative models can be used to generate photorealistic
images from a given text-string input. These models offer great potential to
mitigate challenges to the uptake of machine learning in the earth sciences.
However, the rapid increase in their use has raised questions about fairness
and biases, with most research to-date focusing on social and cultural areas
rather than domain-specific considerations. We conducted a case study for the
earth sciences, focusing on the field of fluvial geomorphology, where we
evaluated subject-area specific biases in the training data and downstream
model performance of Stable Diffusion (v1.5). In addition to perpetuating
Western biases, we found that the training data over-represented scenic
locations, such as famous rivers and waterfalls, and showed serious under- and
over-representation of many morphological and environmental terms. Despite
biased training data, we found that with careful prompting, the Stable
Diffusion model was able to generate photorealistic synthetic river images
reproducing many important environmental and morphological characteristics.
Furthermore, conditional control techniques, such as the use of condition maps
with ControlNet were effective for providing additional constraints on output
images. Despite great potential for the use of TTI models in the earth sciences
field, we advocate for caution in sensitive applications, and advocate for
domain-specific reviews of training data and image generation biases to
mitigate perpetuation of existing biases.

<li>Summary: <p>Recent advances in the field of generative models and in particular
generative adversarial networks (GANs) have lead to substantial progress for
controlled image editing, especially compared with the pre-deep learning era.
Despite their powerful ability to apply realistic modifications to an image,
these methods often lack properties like disentanglement (the capacity to edit
attributes independently). In this paper, we propose an auto-encoder which
re-organizes the latent space of StyleGAN, so that each attribute which we wish
to edit corresponds to an axis of the new latent space, and furthermore that
the latent axes are decorrelated, encouraging disentanglement. We work in a
compressed version of the latent space, using Principal Component Analysis,
meaning that the parameter complexity of our autoencoder is reduced, leading to
short training times ($\sim$ 45 mins). Qualitative and quantitative results
demonstrate the editing capabilities of our approach, with greater
disentanglement than competing methods, while maintaining fidelity to the
original image with respect to identity. Our autoencoder architecture simple
and straightforward, facilitating implementation.

<li>Summary: <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) generalize well across language tasks, but
suffer from hallucinations and uninterpretability, making it difficult to
assess their accuracy without ground-truth. Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) models have been proposed to reduce hallucinations and provide provenance
for how an answer was generated. Applying such models to the scientific
literature may enable large-scale, systematic processing of scientific
knowledge. We present PaperQA, a RAG agent for answering questions over the
scientific literature. PaperQA is an agent that performs information retrieval
across full-text scientific articles, assesses the relevance of sources and
passages, and uses RAG to provide answers. Viewing this agent as a question
answering model, we find it exceeds performance of existing LLMs and LLM agents
on current science QA benchmarks. To push the field closer to how humans
perform research on scientific literature, we also introduce LitQA, a more
complex benchmark that requires retrieval and synthesis of information from
full-text scientific papers across the literature. Finally, we demonstrate
PaperQA's matches expert human researchers on LitQA.

<li>Summary: <p>In the current era, a multitude of language models has emerged to cater to
user inquiries. Notably, the GPT-3.5 Turbo language model has gained
substantial attention as the underlying technology for ChatGPT. Leveraging
extensive parameters, this model adeptly responds to a wide range of questions.
However, due to its reliance on internal knowledge, the accuracy of responses
may not be absolute. This article scrutinizes ChatGPT as a Question Answering
System (QAS), comparing its performance to other existing QASs. The primary
focus is on evaluating ChatGPT's proficiency in extracting responses from
provided paragraphs, a core QAS capability. Additionally, performance
comparisons are made in scenarios without a surrounding passage. Multiple
experiments, exploring response hallucination and considering question
complexity, were conducted on ChatGPT. Evaluation employed well-known Question
Answering (QA) datasets, including SQuAD, NewsQA, and PersianQuAD, across
English and Persian languages. Metrics such as F-score, exact match, and
accuracy were employed in the assessment. The study reveals that, while ChatGPT
demonstrates competence as a generative model, it is less effective in question
answering compared to task-specific models. Providing context improves its
performance, and prompt engineering enhances precision, particularly for
questions lacking explicit answers in provided paragraphs. ChatGPT excels at
simpler factual questions compared to "how" and "why" question types. The
evaluation highlights occurrences of hallucinations, where ChatGPT provides
responses to questions without available answers in the provided context.

<li>Summary: <p>In recent years, significant advancements have been made in the text
generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), demonstrating
exceptional performance in downstream tasks such as abstract summarization,
dialogue generation, and data-to-text conversion. However, their generative
abilities also pose risks such as the rapid spread of fake news, infringement
of datasets/LLM copyrights, and challenges to academic integrity. Text
watermarking technology emerges as a potential solution. By embedding invisible
yet detectable patterns in generated texts, it helps in tracking and verifying
text origins, thus preventing misuse and piracy.
</p>
<p>This survey aims to comprehensively summarize current text watermarking
technologies, covering three main aspects: (1) an overview and comparison of
different text watermarking techniques; (2) evaluation methods for text
watermarking algorithms, including their success rate, impact on text quality,
robustness, and unforgeability; (3) potential applications of text watermarking
technologys. This survey aims to help researchers thoroughly understanding the
text watermarking technologies, thereby fostering further development.

<li>Summary: <p>In settings requiring synthetic data generation based on a clinical cohort,
e.g., due to data protection regulations, heterogeneity across individuals
might be a nuisance that we need to control or faithfully preserve. The sources
of such heterogeneity might be known, e.g., as indicated by sub-groups labels,
or might be unknown and thus reflected only in properties of distributions,
such as bimodality or skewness. We investigate how such heterogeneity can be
preserved and controlled when obtaining synthetic data from variational
autoencoders (VAEs), i.e., a generative deep learning technique that utilizes a
low-dimensional latent representation. To faithfully reproduce unknown
heterogeneity reflected in marginal distributions, we propose to combine VAEs
with pre-transformations. For dealing with known heterogeneity due to
sub-groups, we complement VAEs with models for group membership, specifically
from propensity score regression. The evaluation is performed with a realistic
simulation design that features sub-groups and challenging marginal
distributions. The proposed approach faithfully recovers the latter, compared
to synthetic data approaches that focus purely on marginal distributions.
Propensity scores add complementary information, e.g., when visualized in the
latent space, and enable sampling of synthetic data with or without sub-group
specific characteristics. We also illustrate the proposed approach with real
data from an international stroke trial that exhibits considerable distribution
differences between study sites, in addition to bimodality. These results
indicate that describing heterogeneity by statistical approaches, such as
propensity score regression, might be more generally useful for complementing
generative deep learning for obtaining synthetic data that faithfully reflects
structure from clinical cohorts.

<li>Summary: <p>The increasing interest in data sharing makes synthetic data appealing.
However, the analysis of synthetic data raises a unique set of methodological
challenges. In this work, we highlight the importance of inferential utility
and provide empirical evidence against naive inference from synthetic data
(that handles these as if they were really observed). We argue that the rate of
false-positive findings (type 1 error) will be unacceptably high, even when the
estimates are unbiased. One of the reasons is the underestimation of the true
standard error, which may even progressively increase with larger sample sizes
due to slower convergence. This is especially problematic for deep generative
models. Before publishing synthetic data, it is essential to develop
statistical inference tools for such data.

<li>Summary: <p>The representations of the activation space of deep neural networks (DNNs)
are widely utilized for tasks like natural language processing, anomaly
detection and speech recognition. Due to the diverse nature of these tasks and
the large size of DNNs, an efficient and task-independent representation of
activations becomes crucial. Empirical p-values have been used to quantify the
relative strength of an observed node activation compared to activations
created by already-known inputs. Nonetheless, keeping raw data for these
calculations increases memory resource consumption and raises privacy concerns.
To this end, we propose a model-agnostic framework for creating representations
of activations in DNNs using node-specific histograms to compute p-values of
observed activations without retaining already-known inputs. Our proposed
approach demonstrates promising potential when validated with multiple network
architectures across various downstream tasks and compared with the kernel
density estimates and brute-force empirical baselines. In addition, the
framework reduces memory usage by 30% with up to 4 times faster p-value
computing time while maintaining state of-the-art detection power in downstream
tasks such as the detection of adversarial attacks and synthesized content.
Moreover, as we do not persist raw data at inference time, we could potentially
reduce susceptibility to attacks and privacy issues.

<li>Summary: <p>The meaning of complex phrases in natural language is composed of their
individual components. The task of compositional generalization evaluates a
model's ability to understand new combinations of components. Previous studies
trained smaller, task-specific models, which exhibited poor generalization.
While large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive generalization abilities
on many tasks through in-context learning (ICL), their potential for
compositional generalization remains unexplored. In this paper, we first
empirically investigate prevailing ICL methods in compositional generalization.
We find that they struggle with complex compositional questions due to
cumulative errors in long reasoning steps and intricate logic required for
tool-making. Consequently, we propose a human-guided tool manipulation
framework (HTM) that generates tools for sub-questions and integrates multiple
tools. Our method enhances the effectiveness of tool creation and usage with
minimal human effort. Experiments show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on two compositional generalization benchmarks and
outperforms existing methods on the most challenging test split by 70%.

<li>Summary: <p>Toxic content detection is crucial for online services to remove
inappropriate content that violates community standards. To automate the
detection process, prior works have proposed varieties of machine learning (ML)
approaches to train Language Models (LMs) for toxic content detection. However,
both their accuracy and transferability across datasets are limited. Recently,
Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in toxic content detection due
to their superior zero-shot and few-shot in-context learning ability as well as
broad transferability on ML tasks. However, efficiently designing prompts for
LLMs remains challenging. Moreover, the high run-time cost of LLMs may hinder
their deployments in production. To address these challenges, in this work, we
propose BD-LLM, a novel and efficient approach to Bootstrapping and Distilling
LLMs for toxic content detection. Specifically, we design a novel prompting
method named Decision-Tree-of-Thought (DToT) to bootstrap LLMs' detection
performance and extract high-quality rationales. DToT can automatically select
more fine-grained context to re-prompt LLMs when their responses lack
confidence. Additionally, we use the rationales extracted via DToT to fine-tune
student LMs. Our experimental results on various datasets demonstrate that DToT
can improve the accuracy of LLMs by up to 4.6%. Furthermore, student LMs
fine-tuned with rationales extracted via DToT outperform baselines on all
datasets with up to 16.9\% accuracy improvement, while being more than 60x
smaller than conventional LLMs. Finally, we observe that student LMs fine-tuned
with rationales exhibit better cross-dataset transferability.
