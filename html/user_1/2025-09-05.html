<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Over half of US adults with Alzheimer disease and related dementias remain undiagnosed, and speech-based screening offers a scalable detection approach. We compared large language model adaptation strategies for dementia detection using the DementiaBank speech corpus, evaluating nine text-only models and three multimodal audio-text models on recordings from DementiaBank speech corpus. Adaptations included in-context learning with different demonstration selection policies, reasoning-augmented prompting, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and multimodal integration. Results showed that class-centroid demonstrations achieved the highest in-context learning performance, reasoning improved smaller models, and token-level fine-tuning generally produced the best scores. Adding a classification head substantially improved underperforming models. Among multimodal models, fine-tuned audio-text systems performed well but did not surpass the top text-only models. These findings highlight that model adaptation strategies, including demonstration selection, reasoning design, and tuning method, critically influence speech-based dementia detection, and that properly adapted open-weight models can match or exceed commercial systems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in the masked autoencoder (MAE) paradigm have significantly propelled self-supervised skeleton-based action recognition. However, most existing approaches limit reconstruction targets to raw joint coordinates or their simple variants, resulting in computational redundancy and limited semantic representation. To address this, we propose a novel General Feature Prediction framework (GFP) for efficient mask skeleton modeling. Our key innovation is replacing conventional low-level reconstruction with high-level feature prediction that spans from local motion patterns to global semantic representations. Specifically, we introduce a collaborative learning framework where a lightweight target generation network dynamically produces diversified supervision signals across spatial-temporal hierarchies, avoiding reliance on pre-computed offline features. The framework incorporates constrained optimization to ensure feature diversity while preventing model collapse. Experiments on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120 and PKU-MMD demonstrate the benefits of our approach: Computational efficiency (with 6.2$\times$ faster training than standard masked skeleton modeling methods) and superior representation quality, achieving state-of-the-art performance in various downstream tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Electronic Health Records (EHRs) provide a rich, longitudinal view of patient health and hold significant potential for advancing clinical decision support, risk prediction, and data-driven healthcare research. However, most artificial intelligence (AI) models for EHRs are designed for narrow, single-purpose tasks, limiting their generalizability and utility in real-world settings. Here, we present CEHR-GPT, a general-purpose foundation model for EHR data that unifies three essential capabilities - feature representation, zero-shot prediction, and synthetic data generation - within a single architecture. To support temporal reasoning over clinical sequences, \cehrgpt{} incorporates a novel time-token-based learning framework that explicitly encodes patients' dynamic timelines into the model structure. CEHR-GPT demonstrates strong performance across all three tasks and generalizes effectively to external datasets through vocabulary expansion and fine-tuning. Its versatility enables rapid model development, cohort discovery, and patient outcome forecasting without the need for task-specific retraining.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rise of foundation models (FMs) has reshaped the landscape of machine learning. As these models continued to grow, leveraging geo-distributed data from wireless devices has become increasingly critical, giving rise to federated foundation models (FFMs). More recently, FMs have evolved into multi-modal multi-task (M3T) FMs (e.g., GPT-4) capable of processing diverse modalities across multiple tasks, which motivates a new underexplored paradigm: M3T FFMs. In this paper, we unveil an unexplored variation of M3T FFMs by proposing hierarchical federated foundation models (HF-FMs), which in turn expose two overlooked heterogeneity dimensions to fog/edge networks that have a direct impact on these emerging models: (i) heterogeneity in collected modalities and (ii) heterogeneity in executed tasks across fog/edge nodes. HF-FMs strategically align the modular structure of M3T FMs, comprising modality encoders, prompts, mixture-of-experts (MoEs), adapters, and task heads, with the hierarchical nature of fog/edge infrastructures. Moreover, HF-FMs enable the optional usage of device-to-device (D2D) communications, enabling horizontal module relaying and localized cooperative training among nodes when feasible. Through delving into the architectural design of HF-FMs, we highlight their unique capabilities along with a series of tailored future research directions. Finally, to demonstrate their potential, we prototype HF-FMs in a wireless network setting and release the open-source code for the development of HF-FMs with the goal of fostering exploration in this untapped field (GitHub: this https URL).</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) has significantly increased the attack surface of such systems, making them vulnerable to a wide range of cyber threats. Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) often fail to meet the stringent requirements of resource-constrained IoT environments due to their high computational cost and reliance on large labeled datasets. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel hybrid Intrusion Detection System that integrates a Quantum Genetic Algorithm (QGA) with Self-Supervised Learning (SSL). The QGA leverages quantum-inspired evolutionary operators to optimize feature selection and fine-tune model parameters, ensuring lightweight yet efficient detection in resource-limited networks. Meanwhile, SSL enables the system to learn robust representations from unlabeled data, thereby reducing dependency on manually labeled training sets. The proposed framework is evaluated on benchmark IoT intrusion datasets, demonstrating superior performance in terms of detection accuracy, false positive rate, and computational efficiency compared to conventional evolutionary and deep learning-based IDS models. The results highlight the potential of combining quantum-inspired optimization with self-supervised paradigms to design next-generation intrusion detection solutions for IoT and WSN environments.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose a data-driven method for approximating real-valued functions on smooth manifolds, building on the Diffusion Maps framework under the manifold hypothesis. Given pointwise evaluations of a function, the method constructs a smooth extension to the ambient space by exploiting diffusion geometry and its connection to the heat equation and the Laplace-Beltrami operator. To address the computational challenges of high-dimensional data, we introduce a dimensionality reduction strategy based on the low-rank structure of the distance matrix, revealed via singular value decomposition (SVD). In addition, we develop an online updating mechanism that enables efficient incorporation of new data, thereby improving scalability and reducing computational cost. Numerical experiments, including applications to sparse CT reconstruction, demonstrate that the proposed methodology outperforms classical feedforward neural networks and interpolation methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>World models that infer and predict environmental dynamics are foundational to embodied intelligence. However, their potential is often limited by the finite complexity and implicit biases of hand-crafted training environments. To develop truly generalizable and robust agents, we need environments that scale in complexity alongside the agents learning within them. In this work, we reframe the challenge of environment generation as the problem of learning a goal-conditioned, generative world model. We propose a system where a generative **Attacker** agent learns an implicit world model to synthesize increasingly difficult challenges for a team of cooperative **Defender** agents. The Attacker's objective is not passive prediction, but active, goal-driven interaction: it models and generates world states (i.e., configurations of enemy units) specifically to exploit the Defenders' weaknesses. Concurrently, the embodied Defender team learns a cooperative policy to overcome these generated worlds. This co-evolutionary dynamic creates a self-scaling curriculum where the world model continuously adapts to challenge the decision-making policy of the agents, providing an effectively infinite stream of novel and relevant training scenarios. We demonstrate that this framework leads to the emergence of complex behaviors, such as the world model learning to generate flanking and shielding formations, and the defenders learning coordinated focus-fire and spreading tactics. Our findings position adversarial co-evolution as a powerful method for learning instrumental world models that drive agents toward greater strategic depth and robustness.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Image diffusion models are trained on independently sampled static images. While this is the bedrock task protocol in generative modeling, capturing the temporal world through the lens of static snapshots is information-deficient by design. This limitation leads to slower convergence, limited distributional coverage, and reduced generalization. In this work, we propose a simple and effective training strategy that leverages the temporal inductive bias present in continuous video frames to improve diffusion training. Notably, the proposed method requires no architectural modification and can be seamlessly integrated into standard diffusion training pipelines. We evaluate our method on the HandCo dataset, where hand-object interactions exhibit dense temporal coherence and subtle variations in finger articulation often result in semantically distinct motions. Empirically, our method accelerates convergence by over 2$\text{x}$ faster and achieves lower FID on both training and validation distributions. It also improves generative diversity by encouraging the model to capture meaningful temporal variations. We further provide an optimization analysis showing that our regularization reduces the gradient variance, which contributes to faster convergence.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Prompt learning has recently attracted much attention for adapting pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) to downstream recognition tasks. However, most of the existing CLIP-based prompt learning methods only show a limited ability for handling fine-grained datasets. To address this issue, we propose a causality-guided text prompt learning method via visual granulation for CLIP, called CaPL, where the explored visual granulation technique could construct sets of visual granules for the text prompt to capture subtle discrepancies among different fine-grained classes through casual inference. The CaPL method contains the following two modules: (1) An attribute disentanglement module is proposed to decompose visual features into non-individualized attributes (shared by some classes) and individualized attributes (specific to single classes) using a Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model; (2) A granule learning module is proposed to construct visual granules by integrating the aforementioned attributes for recognition under two causal inference strategies. Thanks to the learned visual granules, more discriminative text prompt is expected to be learned. Extensive experimental results on 15 datasets demonstrate that our CaPL method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art prompt learning methods, especially on fine-grained datasets.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Human motion video generation has garnered significant research interest due to its broad applications, enabling innovations such as photorealistic singing heads or dynamic avatars that seamlessly dance to music. However, existing surveys in this field focus on individual methods, lacking a comprehensive overview of the entire generative process. This paper addresses this gap by providing an in-depth survey of human motion video generation, encompassing over ten sub-tasks, and detailing the five key phases of the generation process: input, motion planning, motion video generation, refinement, and output. Notably, this is the first survey that discusses the potential of large language models in enhancing human motion video generation. Our survey reviews the latest developments and technological trends in human motion video generation across three primary modalities: vision, text, and audio. By covering over two hundred papers, we offer a thorough overview of the field and highlight milestone works that have driven significant technological breakthroughs. Our goal for this survey is to unveil the prospects of human motion video generation and serve as a valuable resource for advancing the comprehensive applications of digital humans.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we propose OccTENS, a generative occupancy world model that enables controllable, high-fidelity long-term occupancy generation while maintaining computational efficiency. Different from visual generation, the occupancy world model must capture the fine-grained 3D geometry and dynamic evolution of the 3D scenes, posing great challenges for the generative models. Recent approaches based on autoregression (AR) have demonstrated the potential to predict vehicle movement and future occupancy scenes simultaneously from historical observations, but they typically suffer from \textbf{inefficiency}, \textbf{temporal degradation} in long-term generation and \textbf{lack of controllability}. To holistically address these issues, we reformulate the occupancy world model as a temporal next-scale prediction (TENS) task, which decomposes the temporal sequence modeling problem into the modeling of spatial scale-by-scale generation and temporal scene-by-scene prediction. With a \textbf{TensFormer}, OccTENS can effectively manage the temporal causality and spatial relationships of occupancy sequences in a flexible and scalable way. To enhance the pose controllability, we further propose a holistic pose aggregation strategy, which features a unified sequence modeling for occupancy and ego-motion. Experiments show that OccTENS outperforms the state-of-the-art method with both higher occupancy quality and faster inference time.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Establishing dense correspondences across image pairs is essential for tasks such as shape reconstruction and robot manipulation. In the challenging setting of matching across different categories, the function of an object, i.e., the effect that an object can cause on other objects, can guide how correspondences should be established. This is because object parts that enable specific functions often share similarities in shape and appearance. We derive the definition of dense functional correspondence based on this observation and propose a weakly-supervised learning paradigm to tackle the prediction task. The main insight behind our approach is that we can leverage vision-language models to pseudo-label multi-view images to obtain functional parts. We then integrate this with dense contrastive learning from pixel correspondences to distill both functional and spatial knowledge into a new model that can establish dense functional correspondence. Further, we curate synthetic and real evaluation datasets as task benchmarks. Our results demonstrate the advantages of our approach over baseline solutions consisting of off-the-shelf self-supervised image representations and grounded vision language models.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The scarcity of well-annotated diverse medical images is a major hurdle for developing reliable AI models in healthcare. Substantial technical advances have been made in generative foundation models for natural images. Here we develop `ChexGen', a generative vision-language foundation model that introduces a unified framework for text-, mask-, and bounding box-guided synthesis of chest radiographs. Built upon the latent diffusion transformer architecture, ChexGen was pretrained on the largest curated chest X-ray dataset to date, consisting of 960,000 radiograph-report pairs. ChexGen achieves accurate synthesis of radiographs through expert evaluations and quantitative metrics. We demonstrate the utility of ChexGen for training data augmentation and supervised pretraining, which led to performance improvements across disease classification, detection, and segmentation tasks using a small fraction of training data. Further, our model enables the creation of diverse patient cohorts that enhance model fairness by detecting and mitigating demographic biases. Our study supports the transformative role of generative foundation models in building more accurate, data-efficient, and equitable medical AI systems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Current Ethereum fraud detection methods rely on context-independent, numerical transaction sequences, failing to capture semantic of account transactions. Furthermore, the pervasive homogeneity in Ethereum transaction records renders it challenging to learn discriminative account embeddings. Moreover, current self-supervised graph learning methods primarily learn node representations through graph reconstruction, resulting in suboptimal performance for node-level tasks like fraud account detection, while these methods also encounter scalability challenges. To tackle these challenges, we propose LMAE4Eth, a multi-view learning framework that fuses transaction semantics, masked graph embedding, and expert knowledge. We first propose a transaction-token contrastive language model (TxCLM) that transforms context-independent numerical transaction records into logically cohesive linguistic representations. To clearly characterize the semantic differences between accounts, we also use a token-aware contrastive learning pre-training objective together with the masked transaction model pre-training objective, learns high-expressive account representations. We then propose a masked account graph autoencoder (MAGAE) using generative self-supervised learning, which achieves superior node-level account detection by focusing on reconstructing account node features. To enable MAGAE to scale for large-scale training, we propose to integrate layer-neighbor sampling into the graph, which reduces the number of sampled vertices by several times without compromising training quality. Finally, using a cross-attention fusion network, we unify the embeddings of TxCLM and MAGAE to leverage the benefits of both. We evaluate our method against 21 baseline approaches on three datasets. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the best baseline by over 10% in F1-score on two of the datasets.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Due to their powerful feature association capabilities, neural network-based computer vision models have the ability to detect and exploit unintended patterns within the data, potentially leading to correct predictions based on incorrect or unintended but statistically relevant signals. These clues may vary from simple color aberrations to small texts within the image. In situations where these unintended signals align with the predictive task, models can mistakenly link these features with the task and rely on them for making predictions. This phenomenon is referred to as spurious correlations, where patterns appear to be associated with the task but are actually coincidental. As a result, detection and mitigation of spurious correlations have become crucial tasks for building trustworthy, reliable, and generalizable machine learning models. In this work, we present a novel method to detect spurious correlations in vision transformers, a type of neural network architecture that gained significant popularity in recent years. Using both supervised and self-supervised trained models, we present large-scale experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrating the ability of the proposed method to identify spurious correlations. We also find that, even if the same architecture is used, the training methodology has a significant impact on the model's reliance on spurious correlations. Furthermore, we show that certain classes in the ImageNet dataset contain spurious signals that are easily detected by the models and discuss the underlying reasons for those spurious signals. In light of our findings, we provide an exhaustive list of the aforementioned images and call for caution in their use in future research efforts. Lastly, we present a case study investigating spurious signals in invasive breast mass classification, grounding our work in real-world scenarios.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Over the past decade, the use of machine learning (ML) models in healthcare applications has rapidly increased. Despite high performance, modern ML models do not always capture patterns the end user requires. For example, a model may predict a non-monotonically decreasing relationship between cancer stage and survival, keeping all other features fixed. In this paper, we present a reproducible framework for investigating this misalignment between model behavior and clinical experiential learning, focusing on the effects of underspecification of modern ML pipelines. In a prostate cancer outcome prediction case study, we first identify and address these inconsistencies by incorporating clinical knowledge, collected by a survey, via constraints into the ML model, and subsequently analyze the impact on model performance and behavior across degrees of underspecification. The approach shows that aligning the ML model with clinical experiential learning is possible without compromising performance. Motivated by recent literature in generative AI, we further examine the feasibility of a feedback-driven alignment approach in non-generative AI clinical risk prediction models through a randomized experiment with clinicians. Our findings illustrate that, by eliciting clinicians' model preferences using our proposed methodology, the larger the difference in how the constrained and unconstrained models make predictions for a patient, the more apparent the difference is in clinical interpretation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) in general, and in Natural Language Processing (NLP) in particular, and some of its applications such as chatbots, have led to their implementation in different domains like education, healthcare, tourism, and customer service. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an increasing interest in these digital technologies to allow and enhance remote access. In education, e-learning systems have been massively adopted worldwide. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLM) such as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformers) made chatbots even more popular. In this study, we present a survey on existing Arabic chatbots in education and their different characteristics such as the adopted approaches, language variety, and metrics used to measure their performance. We were able to identified some research gaps when we discovered that, despite the success of chatbots in other languages such as English, only a few educational Arabic chatbots used modern techniques. Finally, we discuss future directions of research in this field.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text-to-story visualization is challenging due to the need for consistent interaction among multiple characters across frames. Existing methods struggle with character consistency, leading to artifact generation and inaccurate dialogue rendering, which results in disjointed storytelling. In response, we introduce TaleDiffusion, a novel framework for generating multi-character stories with an iterative process, maintaining character consistency, and accurate dialogue assignment via postprocessing. Given a story, we use a pre-trained LLM to generate per-frame descriptions, character details, and dialogues via in-context learning, followed by a bounded attention-based per-box mask technique to control character interactions and minimize artifacts. We then apply an identity-consistent self-attention mechanism to ensure character consistency across frames and region-aware cross-attention for precise object placement. Dialogues are also rendered as bubbles and assigned to characters via CLIPSeg. Experimental results demonstrate that TaleDiffusion outperforms existing methods in consistency, noise reduction, and dialogue rendering.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable image quality, but they still struggle with complex, multiele ment prompts, and limited stylistic diversity. To address these limitations, we propose a Multi-Expert Planning and Gen eration Framework (MEPG) that synergistically integrates position- and style-aware large language models (LLMs) with spatial-semantic expert modules. The framework comprises two core components: (1) a Position-Style-Aware (PSA) module that utilizes a supervised fine-tuned LLM to decom pose input prompts into precise spatial coordinates and style encoded semantic instructions; and (2) a Multi-Expert Dif fusion (MED) module that implements cross-region genera tion through dynamic expert routing across both local regions and global areas. During the generation process for each lo cal region, specialized models (e.g., realism experts, styliza tion specialists) are selectively activated for each spatial par tition via attention-based gating mechanisms. The architec ture supports lightweight integration and replacement of ex pert models, providing strong extensibility. Additionally, an interactive interface enables real-time spatial layout editing and per-region style selection from a portfolio of experts. Ex periments show that MEPG significantly outperforms base line models with the same backbone in both image quality and style diversity.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Self-supervised speech models have demonstrated impressive performance in speech processing, but their effectiveness on non-speech data remains underexplored. We study the transfer learning capabilities of such models on bioacoustic detection and classification tasks. We show that models such as HuBERT, WavLM, and XEUS can generate rich latent representations of animal sounds across taxa. We analyze the models properties with linear probing on time-averaged representations. We then extend the approach to account for the effect of time-wise information with other downstream architectures. Finally, we study the implication of frequency range and noise on performance. Notably, our results are competitive with fine-tuned bioacoustic pre-trained models and show the impact of noise-robust pre-training setups. These findings highlight the potential of speech-based self-supervised learning as an efficient framework for advancing bioacoustic research.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>AI models rely on annotated data to learn pattern and perform prediction. Annotation is usually a labor-intensive step that require associating labels ranging from a simple classification label to more complex tasks such as object detection, oriented bounding box estimation, and instance segmentation. Traditional tools often require extensive manual input, limiting scalability for large datasets. To address this, we introduce VisioFirm, an open-source web application designed to streamline image labeling through AI-assisted automation. VisioFirm integrates state-of-the-art foundation models into an interface with a filtering pipeline to reduce human-in-the-loop efforts. This hybrid approach employs CLIP combined with pre-trained detectors like Ultralytics models for common classes and zero-shot models such as Grounding DINO for custom labels, generating initial annotations with low-confidence thresholding to maximize recall. Through this framework, when tested on COCO-type of classes, initial prediction have been proven to be mostly correct though the users can refine these via interactive tools supporting bounding boxes, oriented bounding boxes, and polygons. Additionally, VisioFirm has on-the-fly segmentation powered by Segment Anything accelerated through WebGPU for browser-side efficiency. The tool supports multiple export formats (YOLO, COCO, Pascal VOC, CSV) and operates offline after model caching, enhancing accessibility. VisioFirm demonstrates up to 90\% reduction in manual effort through benchmarks on diverse datasets, while maintaining high annotation accuracy via clustering of connected CLIP-based disambiguate components and IoU-graph for redundant detection suppression.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Autoregressive next token prediction language models offer powerful capabilities but face significant challenges in practical deployment due to the high computational and memory costs of inference, particularly during the decoding stage. We introduce Set Block Decoding (SBD), a simple and flexible paradigm that accelerates generation by integrating standard next token prediction (NTP) and masked token prediction (MATP) within a single architecture. SBD allows the model to sample multiple, not necessarily consecutive, future tokens in parallel, a key distinction from previous acceleration methods. This flexibility allows the use of advanced solvers from the discrete diffusion literature, offering significant speedups without sacrificing accuracy. SBD requires no architectural changes or extra training hyperparameters, maintains compatibility with exact KV-caching, and can be implemented by fine-tuning existing next token prediction models. By fine-tuning Llama-3.1 8B and Qwen-3 8B, we demonstrate that SBD enables a 3-5x reduction in the number of forward passes required for generation while achieving same performance as equivalent NTP training.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The widespread adoption of Kubernetes (K8s) for orchestrating cloud-native applications has introduced significant security challenges, such as misconfigured resources and overly permissive configurations. Failing to address these issues can result in unauthorized access, privilege escalation, and lateral movement within clusters. Most existing K8s security solutions focus on detecting misconfigurations, typically through static analysis or anomaly detection. In contrast, this paper presents KubeGuard, a novel runtime log-driven recommender framework aimed at mitigating risks by addressing overly permissive configurations. KubeGuard is designed to harden K8s environments through two complementary tasks: Resource Creation and Resource Refinement. It leverages large language models (LLMs) to analyze manifests and runtime logs reflecting actual system behavior, using modular prompt-chaining workflows. This approach enables KubeGuard to create least-privilege configurations for new resources and refine existing manifests to reduce the attack surface. KubeGuard's output manifests are presented as recommendations that users (e.g., developers and operators) can review and adopt to enhance cluster security. Our evaluation demonstrates that KubeGuard effectively generates and refines K8s manifests for Roles, NetworkPolicies, and Deployments, leveraging both proprietary and open-source LLMs. The high precision, recall, and F1-scores affirm KubeGuard's practicality as a framework that translates runtime observability into actionable, least-privilege configuration guidance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Unsupervised cross-domain image retrieval (UCIR) aims to retrieve images of the same category across diverse domains without relying on annotations. Existing UCIR methods, which align cross-domain features for the entire image, often struggle with the domain gap, as the object features critical for retrieval are frequently entangled with domain-specific styles. To address this challenge, we propose DUDE, a novel UCIR method building upon feature disentanglement. In brief, DUDE leverages a text-to-image generative model to disentangle object features from domain-specific styles, thus facilitating semantical image retrieval. To further achieve reliable alignment of the disentangled object features, DUDE aligns mutual neighbors from within domains to across domains in a progressive manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DUDE achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets over 13 domains. The code will be released.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The proliferation of Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) has significantly advanced zero-shot forecasting, enabling predictions for unseen time series without task-specific fine-tuning. Extensive research has confirmed that no single TSFM excels universally, as different models exhibit preferences for distinct temporal patterns. This diversity suggests an opportunity: how to take advantage of the complementary abilities of TSFMs. To this end, we propose ZooCast, which characterizes each model's distinct forecasting strengths. ZooCast can intelligently assemble current TSFMs into a model zoo that dynamically selects optimal models for different forecasting tasks. Our key innovation lies in the One-Embedding-Fits-All paradigm that constructs a unified representation space where each model in the zoo is represented by a single embedding, enabling efficient similarity matching for all tasks. Experiments demonstrate ZooCast's strong performance on the GIFT-Eval zero-shot forecasting benchmark while maintaining the efficiency of a single TSFM. In real-world scenarios with sequential model releases, the framework seamlessly adds new models for progressive accuracy gains with negligible overhead.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Background: Heart failure (HF) research is constrained by limited access to large, shareable datasets due to privacy regulations and institutional barriers. Synthetic data generation offers a promising solution to overcome these challenges while preserving patient confidentiality. Methods: We generated synthetic HF datasets from institutional data comprising 12,552 unique patients using five deep learning models: tabular variational autoencoder (TVAE), normalizing flow, ADSGAN, SurvivalGAN, and tabular denoising diffusion probabilistic models (TabDDPM). We comprehensively evaluated synthetic data utility through statistical similarity metrics, survival prediction using machine learning and privacy assessments. Results: SurvivalGAN and TabDDPM demonstrated high fidelity to the original dataset, exhibiting similar variable distributions and survival curves after applying histogram equalization. SurvivalGAN (C-indices: 0.71-0.76) and TVAE (C-indices: 0.73-0.76) achieved the strongest performance in survival prediction evaluation, closely matched real data performance (C-indices: 0.73-0.76). Privacy evaluation confirmed protection against re-identification attacks. Conclusions: Deep learning-based synthetic data generation can produce high-fidelity, privacy-preserving HF datasets suitable for research applications. This publicly available synthetic dataset addresses critical data sharing barriers and provides a valuable resource for advancing HF research and predictive modeling.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Comparison of fine-tuning models with reinforcement learning (RL) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) reveals that, despite similar performance at a new task, RL preserves prior knowledge and capabilities significantly better. We find that the degree of forgetting is determined by the distributional shift, measured as the KL-divergence between the fine-tuned and base policy evaluated on the new task. Our analysis reveals that on-policy RL is implicitly biased towards KL-minimal solutions among the many that solve the new task, whereas SFT can converge to distributions arbitrarily far from the base model. We validate these findings through experiments with large language models and robotic foundation models and further provide theoretical justification for why on-policy RL updates lead to a smaller KL change. We term this principle $\textit{RL's Razor}$: among all ways to solve a new task, RL prefers those closest in KL to the original model.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Accurate quantification of tau pathology via tau positron emission tomography (PET) scan is crucial for diagnosing and monitoring Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the high cost and limited availability of tau PET restrict its widespread use. In contrast, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and plasma-based biomarkers provide non-invasive and widely available complementary information related to brain anatomy and disease progression. In this work, we propose a text-guided 3D diffusion model for 3D tau PET image synthesis, leveraging multimodal conditions from both structural MRI and plasma measurement. Specifically, the textual prompt is from the plasma p-tau217 measurement, which is a key indicator of AD progression, while MRI provides anatomical structure constraints. The proposed framework is trained and evaluated using clinical AV1451 tau PET data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can generate realistic, clinically meaningful 3D tau PET across a range of disease stages. The proposed framework can help perform tau PET data augmentation under different settings, provide a non-invasive, cost-effective alternative for visualizing tau pathology, and support the simulation of disease progression under varying plasma biomarker levels and cognitive conditions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present a novel self-supervised framework for learning articulated object representations from sparse-view, unposed images. Unlike prior methods that require dense multi-view observations and ground-truth camera poses, our approach operates with as few as four views per articulation and no camera supervision. To address the inherent challenges, we first reconstruct each articulation independently using recent advances in sparse-view 3D reconstruction, then learn a deformation field that establishes dense correspondences across poses. A progressive disentanglement strategy further separates static from moving parts, enabling robust separation of camera and object motion. Finally, we jointly optimize geometry, appearance, and kinematics with a self-supervised loss that enforces cross-view and cross-pose consistency. Experiments on the standard benchmark and real-world examples demonstrate that our method produces accurate and detailed articulated object representations under significantly weaker input assumptions than existing approaches.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The recently introduced odd-one-out anomaly detection task involves identifying the odd-looking instances within a multi-object scene. This problem presents several challenges for modern deep learning models, demanding spatial reasoning across multiple views and relational reasoning to understand context and generalize across varying object categories and layouts. We argue that these challenges must be addressed with efficiency in mind. To this end, we propose a DINO-based model that reduces the number of parameters by one third and shortens training time by a factor of three compared to the current state-of-the-art, while maintaining competitive performance. Our experimental evaluation also introduces a Multimodal Large Language Model baseline, providing insights into its current limitations in structured visual reasoning tasks.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Leveraging visual priors from pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) generative models has shown success in dense prediction. However, dense prediction is inherently an image-to-image task, suggesting that image editing models, rather than T2I generative models, may be a more suitable foundation for fine-tuning. Motivated by this, we conduct a systematic analysis of the fine-tuning behaviors of both editors and generators for dense geometry estimation. Our findings show that editing models possess inherent structural priors, which enable them to converge more stably by ``refining" their innate features, and ultimately achieve higher performance than their generative counterparts. Based on these findings, we introduce \textbf{FE2E}, a framework that pioneeringly adapts an advanced editing model based on Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture for dense geometry prediction. Specifically, to tailor the editor for this deterministic task, we reformulate the editor's original flow matching loss into the ``consistent velocity" training objective. And we use logarithmic quantization to resolve the precision conflict between the editor's native BFloat16 format and the high precision demand of our tasks. Additionally, we leverage the DiT's global attention for a cost-free joint estimation of depth and normals in a single forward pass, enabling their supervisory signals to mutually enhance each other. Without scaling up the training data, FE2E achieves impressive performance improvements in zero-shot monocular depth and normal estimation across multiple datasets. Notably, it achieves over 35\% performance gains on the ETH3D dataset and outperforms the DepthAnything series, which is trained on 100$\times$ data.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid growth of private car ownership has worsened the urban parking predicament, underscoring the need for accurate and effective parking availability prediction to support urban planning and management. To address key limitations in modeling spatio-temporal dependencies and exploiting multi-source data for parking availability prediction, this study proposes a novel approach with SST-iTransformer. The methodology leverages K-means clustering to establish parking cluster zones (PCZs), extracting and integrating traffic demand characteristics from various transportation modes (i.e., metro, bus, online ride-hailing, and taxi) associated with the targeted parking lots. Upgraded on vanilla iTransformer, SST-iTransformer integrates masking-reconstruction-based pretext tasks for self-supervised spatio-temporal representation learning, and features an innovative dual-branch attention mechanism: Series Attention captures long-term temporal dependencies via patching operations, while Channel Attention models cross-variate interactions through inverted dimensions. Extensive experiments using real-world data from Chengdu, China, demonstrate that SST-iTransformer outperforms baseline deep learning models (including Informer, Autoformer, Crossformer, and iTransformer), achieving state-of-the-art performance with the lowest mean squared error (MSE) and competitive mean absolute error (MAE). Comprehensive ablation studies quantitatively reveal the relative importance of different data sources: incorporating ride-hailing data provides the largest performance gains, followed by taxi, whereas fixed-route transit features (bus/metro) contribute marginally. Spatial correlation analysis further confirms that excluding historical data from correlated parking lots within PCZs leads to substantial performance degradation, underscoring the importance of modeling spatial dependencies.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative, anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With growing public safety demands, text-based person anomaly search has emerged as a critical task, aiming to retrieve individuals with abnormal behaviors via natural language descriptions. Unlike conventional person search, this task presents two unique challenges: (1) fine-grained cross-modal alignment between textual anomalies and visual behaviors, and (2) anomaly recognition under sparse real-world samples. While Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs) excel in multi-modal understanding, their potential for fine-grained anomaly retrieval remains underexplored, hindered by: (1) a domain gap between generative knowledge and discriminative retrieval, and (2) the absence of efficient adaptation strategies for deployment. In this work, we propose AnomalyLMM, the first framework that harnesses LMMs for text-based person anomaly search. Our key contributions are: (1) A novel coarse-to-fine pipeline integrating LMMs to bridge generative world knowledge with retrieval-centric anomaly detection; (2) A training-free adaptation cookbook featuring masked cross-modal prompting, behavioral saliency prediction, and knowledge-aware re-ranking, enabling zero-shot focus on subtle anomaly cues. As the first study to explore LMMs for this task, we conduct a rigorous evaluation on the PAB dataset, the only publicly available benchmark for text-based person anomaly search, with its curated real-world anomalies covering diverse scenarios (e.g., falling, collision, and being hit). Experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed method, surpassing the competitive baseline by +0.96% Recall@1 accuracy. Notably, our method reveals interpretable alignment between textual anomalies and visual behaviors, validated via qualitative analysis. Our code and models will be released for future research.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advancements in neural representations, such as Neural Radiance Fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting, have increased interest in applying style transfer to 3D scenes. While existing methods can transfer style patterns onto 3D-consistent neural representations, they struggle to effectively extract and transfer high-level style semantics from the reference style image. Additionally, the stylized results often lack structural clarity and separation, making it difficult to distinguish between different instances or objects within the 3D scene. To address these limitations, we propose a novel 3D style transfer pipeline that effectively integrates prior knowledge from pretrained 2D diffusion models. Our pipeline consists of two key stages: First, we leverage diffusion priors to generate stylized renderings of key viewpoints. Then, we transfer the stylized key views onto the 3D representation. This process incorporates two innovative designs. The first is cross-view style alignment, which inserts cross-view attention into the last upsampling block of the UNet, allowing feature interactions across multiple key views. This ensures that the diffusion model generates stylized key views that maintain both style fidelity and instance-level consistency. The second is instance-level style transfer, which effectively leverages instance-level consistency across stylized key views and transfers it onto the 3D representation. This results in a more structured, visually coherent, and artistically enriched stylization. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our 3D style transfer pipeline significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across a wide range of scenes, from forward-facing to challenging 360-degree environments.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>A fundamental dilemma in generative modeling persists: iterative diffusion models achieve outstanding fidelity, but at a significant computational cost, while efficient few-step alternatives are constrained by a hard quality ceiling. This conflict between generation steps and output quality arises from restrictive training objectives that focus exclusively on either infinitesimal dynamics (PF-ODEs) or direct endpoint prediction. We address this challenge by introducing an exact, continuous-time dynamics equation that analytically defines state transitions across any finite time interval. This leads to a novel generative paradigm, Transition Models (TiM), which adapt to arbitrary-step transitions, seamlessly traversing the generative trajectory from single leaps to fine-grained refinement with more steps. Despite having only 865M parameters, TiM achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing leading models such as SD3.5 (8B parameters) and FLUX.1 (12B parameters) across all evaluated step counts. Importantly, unlike previous few-step generators, TiM demonstrates monotonic quality improvement as the sampling budget increases. Additionally, when employing our native-resolution strategy, TiM delivers exceptional fidelity at resolutions up to 4096x4096.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, reduce adaptation cost by injecting low-rank updates into pretrained weights. However, LoRA's down-projection is randomly initialized and data-agnostic, discarding potentially useful information. Prior analyses show that this projection changes little during training, while the up-projection carries most of the adaptation, making the random input compression a performance bottleneck. We propose IPA, a feature-aware projection framework that explicitly preserves information in the reduced hidden space. In the linear case, we instantiate IPA with algorithms approximating top principal components, enabling efficient projector pretraining with negligible inference overhead. Across language and vision benchmarks, IPA consistently improves over LoRA and DoRA, achieving on average 1.5 points higher accuracy on commonsense reasoning and 2.3 points on VTAB-1k, while matching full LoRA performance with roughly half the trainable parameters when the projection is frozen.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>X-ray ptychography provides exceptional nanoscale resolution and is widely applied in materials science, biology, and nanotechnology. However, its full potential is constrained by the critical challenge of accurately reconstructing images when the illuminating probe is unknown. Conventional iterative methods and deep learning approaches are often suboptimal, particularly under the low-signal conditions inherent to low-dose and high-speed experiments. These limitations compromise reconstruction fidelity and restrict the broader adoption of the technique. In this work, we introduce the Ptychographic Implicit Neural Representation (PtyINR), a self-supervised framework that simultaneously addresses the object and probe recovery problem. By parameterizing both as continuous neural representations, PtyINR performs end-to-end reconstruction directly from raw diffraction patterns without requiring any pre-characterization of the probe. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that PtyINR achieves superior reconstruction quality on both simulated and experimental data, with remarkable robustness under challenging low-signal conditions. Furthermore, PtyINR offers a generalizable, physics-informed framework for addressing probe-dependent inverse problems, making it applicable to a wide range of computational microscopy problems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Flow-based 3D generation models typically require dozens of sampling steps during inference. Though few-step distillation methods, particularly Consistency Models (CMs), have achieved substantial advancements in accelerating 2D diffusion models, they remain under-explored for more complex 3D generation tasks. In this study, we propose a novel framework, MDT-dist, for few-step 3D flow distillation. Our approach is built upon a primary objective: distilling the pretrained model to learn the Marginal-Data Transport. Directly learning this objective needs to integrate the velocity fields, while this integral is intractable to be implemented. Therefore, we propose two optimizable objectives, Velocity Matching (VM) and Velocity Distillation (VD), to equivalently convert the optimization target from the transport level to the velocity and the distribution level respectively. Velocity Matching (VM) learns to stably match the velocity fields between the student and the teacher, but inevitably provides biased gradient estimates. Velocity Distillation (VD) further enhances the optimization process by leveraging the learned velocity fields to perform probability density distillation. When evaluated on the pioneer 3D generation framework TRELLIS, our method reduces sampling steps of each flow transformer from 25 to 1 or 2, achieving 0.68s (1 step x 2) and 0.94s (2 steps x 2) latency with 9.0x and 6.5x speedup on A800, while preserving high visual and geometric fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing CM distillation methods, and enables TRELLIS to achieve superior performance in few-step 3D generation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Understanding causal heterogeneity is essential for scientific discovery in domains such as biology and medicine. However, existing methods lack causal awareness, with insufficient modeling of heterogeneity, confounding, and observational constraints, leading to poor interpretability and difficulty distinguishing true causal heterogeneity from spurious associations. We propose an unsupervised framework, HCL (Interpretable Causal Mechanism-Aware Clustering with Adaptive Heterogeneous Causal Structure Learning), that jointly infers latent clusters and their associated causal structures from mixed-type observational data without requiring temporal ordering, environment labels, interventions or other prior knowledge. HCL relaxes the homogeneity and sufficiency assumptions by introducing an equivalent representation that encodes both structural heterogeneity and confounding. It further develops a bi-directional iterative strategy to alternately refine causal clustering and structure learning, along with a self-supervised regularization that balance cross-cluster universality and specificity. Together, these components enable convergence toward interpretable, heterogeneous causal patterns. Theoretically, we show identifiability of heterogeneous causal structures under mild conditions. Empirically, HCL achieves superior performance in both clustering and structure learning tasks, and recovers biologically meaningful mechanisms in real-world single-cell perturbation data, demonstrating its utility for discovering interpretable, mechanism-level causal heterogeneity.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present Durian, the first method for generating portrait animation videos with facial attribute transfer from a given reference image to a target portrait in a zero-shot manner. To enable high-fidelity and spatially consistent attribute transfer across frames, we introduce dual reference networks that inject spatial features from both the portrait and attribute images into the denoising process of a diffusion model. We train the model using a self-reconstruction formulation, where two frames are sampled from the same portrait video: one is treated as the attribute reference and the other as the target portrait, and the remaining frames are reconstructed conditioned on these inputs and their corresponding masks. To support the transfer of attributes with varying spatial extent, we propose a mask expansion strategy using keypoint-conditioned image generation for training. In addition, we further augment the attribute and portrait images with spatial and appearance-level transformations to improve robustness to positional misalignment between them. These strategies allow the model to effectively generalize across diverse attributes and in-the-wild reference combinations, despite being trained without explicit triplet supervision. Durian achieves state-of-the-art performance on portrait animation with attribute transfer, and notably, its dual reference design enables multi-attribute composition in a single generation pass without additional training.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated significant capabilities to generate diverse and detailed visuals in various domains, and story visualization is emerging as a particularly promising application. However, as their use in real-world creative domains increases, the need for providing enhanced control, refinement, and the ability to modify images post-generation in a consistent manner becomes an important challenge. Existing methods often lack the flexibility to apply fine or coarse edits while maintaining visual and narrative consistency across multiple frames, preventing creators from seamlessly crafting and refining their visual stories. To address these challenges, we introduce Plot'n Polish, a zero-shot framework that enables consistent story generation and provides fine-grained control over story visualizations at various levels of detail.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multimodal misinformation, encompassing textual, visual, and cross-modal distortions, poses an increasing societal threat that is amplified by generative AI. Existing methods typically focus on a single type of distortion and struggle to generalize to unseen scenarios. In this work, we observe that different distortion types share common reasoning capabilities while also requiring task-specific skills. We hypothesize that joint training across distortion types facilitates knowledge sharing and enhances the model's ability to generalize. To this end, we introduce TRUST-VL, a unified and explainable vision-language model for general multimodal misinformation detection. TRUST-VL incorporates a novel Question-Aware Visual Amplifier module, designed to extract task-specific visual features. To support training, we also construct TRUST-Instruct, a large-scale instruction dataset containing 198K samples featuring structured reasoning chains aligned with human fact-checking workflows. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate that TRUST-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance, while also offering strong generalization and interpretability.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present ChronoGraph, a graph-structured multivariate time series forecasting dataset built from real-world production microservices. Each node is a service that emits a multivariate stream of system-level performance metrics, capturing CPU, memory, and network usage patterns, while directed edges encode dependencies between services. The primary task is forecasting future values of these signals at the service level. In addition, ChronoGraph provides expert-annotated incident windows as anomaly labels, enabling evaluation of anomaly detection methods and assessment of forecast robustness during operational disruptions. Compared to existing benchmarks from industrial control systems or traffic and air-quality domains, ChronoGraph uniquely combines (i) multivariate time series, (ii) an explicit, machine-readable dependency graph, and (iii) anomaly labels aligned with real incidents. We report baseline results spanning forecasting models, pretrained time-series foundation models, and standard anomaly detectors. ChronoGraph offers a realistic benchmark for studying structure-aware forecasting and incident-aware evaluation in microservice systems.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce the Virtual Fitting Room (VFR), a novel video generative model that produces arbitrarily long virtual try-on videos. Our VFR models long video generation tasks as an auto-regressive, segment-by-segment generation process, eliminating the need for resource-intensive generation and lengthy video data, while providing the flexibility to generate videos of arbitrary length. The key challenges of this task are twofold: ensuring local smoothness between adjacent segments and maintaining global temporal consistency across different segments. To address these challenges, we propose our VFR framework, which ensures smoothness through a prefix video condition and enforces consistency with the anchor video -- a 360-degree video that comprehensively captures the human's wholebody appearance. Our VFR generates minute-scale virtual try-on videos with both local smoothness and global temporal consistency under various motions, making it a pioneering work in long virtual try-on video generation.</li>
