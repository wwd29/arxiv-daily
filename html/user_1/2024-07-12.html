          What's the score? Automated Denoising Score Matching for Nonlinear Diffusions(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Reversing a diffusion process by learning its score forms the heart of diffusion-based generative modeling and for estimating properties of scientific systems. The diffusion processes that are tractable center on linear processes with a Gaussian stationary distribution. This limits the kinds of models that can be built to those that target a Gaussian prior or more generally limits the kinds of problems that can be generically solved to those that have conditionally linear score functions. In this work, we introduce a family of tractable denoising score matching objectives, called local-DSM, built using local increments of the diffusion process. We show how local-DSM melded with Taylor expansions enables automated training and score estimation with nonlinear diffusion processes. To demonstrate these ideas, we use automated-DSM to train generative models using non-Gaussian priors on challenging low dimensional distributions and the CIFAR10 image dataset. Additionally, we use the automated-DSM to learn the scores for nonlinear processes studied in statistical physics.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is characterized as a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disease that presents individuals with limited treatment options in the realm of medical interventions and therapies. The disease showcases a diverse range of onset patterns and progression trajectories, emphasizing the critical importance of early detection of functional decline to enable tailored care strategies and timely therapeutic interventions. The present investigation, spearheaded by the iDPP@CLEF 2024 challenge, focuses on utilizing sensor-derived data obtained through an app. This data is used to construct various machine learning models specifically designed to forecast the advancement of the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) score, leveraging the dataset provided by the organizers. In our analysis, multiple predictive models were evaluated to determine their efficacy in handling ALS sensor data. The temporal aspect of the sensor data was compressed and amalgamated using statistical methods, thereby augmenting the interpretability and applicability of the gathered information for predictive modeling objectives. The models that demonstrated optimal performance were a naive baseline and ElasticNet regression. The naive model achieved a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.20 and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.49, slightly outperforming the ElasticNet model, which recorded an MAE of 0.22 and an RMSE of 0.50. Our comparative analysis suggests that while the naive approach yielded marginally better predictive accuracy, the ElasticNet model provides a robust framework for understanding feature contributions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the advancements in denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), image inpainting has significantly evolved from merely filling information based on nearby regions to generating content conditioned on various prompts such as text, exemplar images, and sketches. However, existing methods, such as model fine-tuning and simple concatenation of latent vectors, often result in generation failures due to overfitting and inconsistency between the inpainted region and the background. In this paper, we argue that the current large diffusion models are sufficiently powerful to generate realistic images without further tuning. Hence, we introduce PILOT (in\textbf{P}ainting v\textbf{I}a \textbf{L}atent \textbf{O}p\textbf{T}imization), an optimization approach grounded on a novel \textit{semantic centralization} and \textit{background preservation loss}. Our method searches latent spaces capable of generating inpainted regions that exhibit high fidelity to user-provided prompts while maintaining coherence with the background. Furthermore, we propose a strategy to balance optimization expense and image quality, significantly enhancing generation efficiency. Our method seamlessly integrates with any pre-trained model, including ControlNet and DreamBooth, making it suitable for deployment in multi-modal editing tools. Our qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that PILOT outperforms existing approaches by generating more coherent, diverse, and faithful inpainted regions in response to provided prompts.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Predicting realistic ground views from satellite imagery in urban scenes is a challenging task due to the significant view gaps between satellite and ground-view images. We propose a novel pipeline to tackle this challenge, by generating geospecifc views that maximally respect the weak geometry and texture from multi-view satellite images. Different from existing approaches that hallucinate images from cues such as partial semantics or geometry from overhead satellite images, our method directly predicts ground-view images at geolocation by using a comprehensive set of information from the satellite image, resulting in ground-level images with a resolution boost at a factor of ten or more. We leverage a novel building refinement method to reduce geometric distortions in satellite data at ground level, which ensures the creation of accurate conditions for view synthesis using diffusion networks. Moreover, we proposed a novel geospecific prior, which prompts distribution learning of diffusion models to respect image samples that are closer to the geolocation of the predicted images. We demonstrate our pipeline is the first to generate close-to-real and geospecific ground views merely based on satellite images.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep learning algorithms - typically consisting of a class of deep neural networks trained by a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization method - are nowadays the key ingredients in many artificial intelligence (AI) systems and have revolutionized our ways of working and living in modern societies. For example, SGD methods are used to train powerful large language models (LLMs) such as versions of ChatGPT and Gemini, SGD methods are employed to create successful generative AI based text-to-image creation models such as Midjourney, DALL-E, and Stable Diffusion, but SGD methods are also used to train DNNs to approximately solve scientific models such as partial differential equation (PDE) models from physics and biology and optimal control and stopping problems from engineering. It is known that the plain vanilla standard SGD method fails to converge even in the situation of several convex optimization problems if the learning rates are bounded away from zero. However, in many practical relevant training scenarios, often not the plain vanilla standard SGD method but instead adaptive SGD methods such as the RMSprop and the Adam optimizers, in which the learning rates are modified adaptively during the training process, are employed. This naturally rises the question whether such adaptive optimizers, in which the learning rates are modified adaptively during the training process, do converge in the situation of non-vanishing learning rates. In this work we answer this question negatively by proving that adaptive SGD methods such as the popular Adam optimizer fail to converge to any possible random limit point if the learning rates are asymptotically bounded away from zero. In our proof of this non-convergence result we establish suitable pathwise a priori bounds for a class of accelerated and adaptive SGD methods, which are also of independent interest.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose a novel unsupervised cross-modal homography estimation framework based on intra-modal Self-supervised learning, Correlation, and consistent feature map Projection, namely SCPNet. The concept of intra-modal self-supervised learning is first presented to facilitate the unsupervised cross-modal homography estimation. The correlation-based homography estimation network and the consistent feature map projection are combined to form the learnable architecture of SCPNet, boosting the unsupervised learning framework. SCPNet is the first to achieve effective unsupervised homography estimation on the satellite-map image pair cross-modal dataset, GoogleMap, under [-32,+32] offset on a 128x128 image, leading the supervised approach MHN by 14.0% of mean average corner error (MACE). We further conduct extensive experiments on several cross-modal/spectral and manually-made inconsistent datasets, on which SCPNet achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among unsupervised approaches, and owns 49.0%, 25.2%, 36.4%, and 10.7% lower MACEs than the supervised approach MHN.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Understanding of video creativity and content often varies among individuals, with differences in focal points and cognitive levels across different ages, experiences, and genders. There is currently a lack of research in this area, and most existing benchmarks suffer from several drawbacks: 1) a limited number of modalities and answers with restrictive length; 2) the content and scenarios within the videos are excessively monotonous, transmitting allegories and emotions that are overly simplistic. To bridge the gap to real-world applications, we introduce a large-scale \textbf{S}ubjective \textbf{R}esponse \textbf{I}ndicators for \textbf{A}dvertisement \textbf{V}ideos dataset, namely SRI-ADV. Specifically, we collected real changes in Electroencephalographic (EEG) and eye-tracking regions from different demographics while they viewed identical video content. Utilizing this multi-modal dataset, we developed tasks and protocols to analyze and evaluate the extent of cognitive understanding of video content among different users. Along with the dataset, we designed a \textbf{H}ypergraph \textbf{M}ulti-modal \textbf{L}arge \textbf{L}anguage \textbf{M}odel (HMLLM) to explore the associations among different demographics, video elements, EEG and eye-tracking indicators. HMLLM could bridge semantic gaps across rich modalities and integrate information beyond different modalities to perform logical reasoning. Extensive experimental evaluations on SRI-ADV and other additional video-based generative performance benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The electroretinogram (ERG) is a clinical test that records the retina's electrical response to light. The ERG is a promising way to study different neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD) - a neurodevelopmental condition that impacts language, communication, and reciprocal social interactions. However, in heterogeneous populations, such as ASD, where the ability to collect large datasets is limited, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) is complicated. Synthetic ERG signals generated from real ERG recordings carry similar information as natural ERGs and, therefore, could be used as an extension for natural data to increase datasets so that AI applications can be fully utilized. As proof of principle, this study presents a Generative Adversarial Network capable of generating synthetic ERG signals of children with ASD and typically developing control individuals. We applied a Time Series Transformer and Visual Transformer with Continuous Wavelet Transform to enhance classification results on the extended synthetic signals dataset. This approach may support classification models in related psychiatric conditions where the ERG may help classify disorders.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have revolutionized both the natural language processing research and applications. However, stereotypical biases (e.g., gender and racial discrimination) encoded in PLMs have raised negative ethical implications for PLMs, which critically limits their broader applications. To address the aforementioned unfairness issues, we present fairBERTs, a general framework for learning fair fine-tuned BERT series models by erasing the protected sensitive information via semantic and fairness-aware perturbations generated by a generative adversarial network. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on two real-world tasks, we demonstrate the great superiority of fairBERTs in mitigating unfairness while maintaining the model utility. We also verify the feasibility of transferring adversarial components in fairBERTs to other conventionally trained BERT-like models for yielding fairness improvements. Our findings may shed light on further research on building fairer fine-tuned PLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) combines the generative abilities of large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge sources to provide more accurate and up-to-date responses. Recent RAG advancements focus on improving retrieval outcomes through iterative LLM refinement or self-critique capabilities acquired through additional instruction tuning of LLMs. In this work, we introduce Speculative RAG - a framework that leverages a larger generalist LM to efficiently verify multiple RAG drafts produced in parallel by a smaller, distilled specialist LM. Each draft is generated from a distinct subset of retrieved documents, offering diverse perspectives on the evidence while reducing input token counts per draft. This approach enhances comprehension of each subset and mitigates potential position bias over long context. Our method accelerates RAG by delegating drafting to the smaller specialist LM, with the larger generalist LM performing a single verification pass over the drafts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Speculative RAG achieves state-of-the-art performance with reduced latency on TriviaQA, MuSiQue, PubHealth, and ARC-Challenge benchmarks. It notably enhances accuracy by up to 12.97% while reducing latency by 51% compared to conventional RAG systems on PubHealth.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Event cameras, mimicking the human retina, capture brightness changes with unparalleled temporal resolution and dynamic range. Integrating events into intensities poses a highly ill-posed challenge, marred by initial condition ambiguities. Traditional regression-based deep learning methods fall short in perceptual quality, offering deterministic and often unrealistic reconstructions. In this paper, we introduce diffusion models to events-to-video reconstruction, achieving colorful, realistic, and perceptually superior video generation from achromatic events. Powered by the image generation ability and knowledge of pretrained diffusion models, the proposed method can achieve a better trade-off between the perception and distortion of the reconstructed frame compared to previous solutions. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach can produce diverse, realistic frames with faithfulness to the given events.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Most recent unsupervised non-rigid 3D shape matching methods are based on the functional map framework due to its efficiency and superior performance. Nevertheless, respective methods struggle to obtain spatially smooth pointwise correspondences due to the lack of proper regularisation. In this work, inspired by the success of message passing on graphs, we propose a synchronous diffusion process which we use as regularisation to achieve smoothness in non-rigid 3D shape matching problems. The intuition of synchronous diffusion is that diffusing the same input function on two different shapes results in consistent outputs. Using different challenging datasets, we demonstrate that our novel regularisation can substantially improve the state-of-the-art in shape matching, especially in the presence of topological noise.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) with in-context learning have significantly improved the performance of text-to-SQL task. Previous works generally focus on using exclusive SQL generation prompt to improve the LLMs' reasoning ability. However, they are mostly hard to handle large databases with numerous tables and columns, and usually ignore the significance of pre-processing database and extracting valuable information for more efficient prompt engineering. Based on above analysis, we propose RB-SQL, a novel retrieval-based LLM framework for in-context prompt engineering, which consists of three modules that retrieve concise tables and columns as schema, and targeted examples for in-context learning. Experiment results demonstrate that our model achieves better performance than several competitive baselines on public datasets BIRD and Spider.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce Diff-Tracker, a novel approach for the challenging unsupervised visual tracking task leveraging the pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model. Our main idea is to leverage the rich knowledge encapsulated within the pre-trained diffusion model, such as the understanding of image semantics and structural information, to address unsupervised visual tracking. To this end, we design an initial prompt learner to enable the diffusion model to recognize the tracking target by learning a prompt representing the target. Furthermore, to facilitate dynamic adaptation of the prompt to the target's movements, we propose an online prompt updater. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, which also achieves state-of-the-art performance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Human video generation is a dynamic and rapidly evolving task that aims to synthesize 2D human body video sequences with generative models given control conditions such as text, audio, and pose. With the potential for wide-ranging applications in film, gaming, and virtual communication, the ability to generate natural and realistic human video is critical. Recent advancements in generative models have laid a solid foundation for the growing interest in this area. Despite the significant progress, the task of human video generation remains challenging due to the consistency of characters, the complexity of human motion, and difficulties in their relationship with the environment. This survey provides a comprehensive review of the current state of human video generation, marking, to the best of our knowledge, the first extensive literature review in this domain. We start with an introduction to the fundamentals of human video generation and the evolution of generative models that have facilitated the field's growth. We then examine the main methods employed for three key sub-tasks within human video generation: text-driven, audio-driven, and pose-driven motion generation. These areas are explored concerning the conditions that guide the generation process. Furthermore, we offer a collection of the most commonly utilized datasets and the evaluation metrics that are crucial in assessing the quality and realism of generated videos. The survey concludes with a discussion of the current challenges in the field and suggests possible directions for future research. The goal of this survey is to offer the research community a clear and holistic view of the advancements in human video generation, highlighting the milestones achieved and the challenges that lie ahead.</li>

          Latent Conditional Diffusion-based Data Augmentation for Continuous-Time Dynamic Graph Mode(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Continuous-Time Dynamic Graph (CTDG) precisely models evolving real-world relationships, drawing heightened interest in dynamic graph learning across academia and industry. However, existing CTDG models encounter challenges stemming from noise and limited historical data. Graph Data Augmentation (GDA) emerges as a critical solution, yet current approaches primarily focus on static graphs and struggle to effectively address the dynamics inherent in CTDGs. Moreover, these methods often demand substantial domain expertise for parameter tuning and lack theoretical guarantees for augmentation efficacy. To address these issues, we propose Conda, a novel latent diffusion-based GDA method tailored for CTDGs. Conda features a sandwich-like architecture, incorporating a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) and a conditional diffusion model, aimed at generating enhanced historical neighbor embeddings for target nodes. Unlike conventional diffusion models trained on entire graphs via pre-training, Conda requires historical neighbor sequence embeddings of target nodes for training, thus facilitating more targeted augmentation. We integrate Conda into the CTDG model and adopt an alternating training strategy to optimize performance. Extensive experimentation across six widely used real-world datasets showcases the consistent performance improvement of our approach, particularly in scenarios with limited historical data.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Facial video-based remote physiological measurement is a promising research area for detecting human vital signs (e.g., heart rate, respiration frequency) in a non-contact way. Conventional approaches are mostly supervised learning, requiring extensive collections of facial videos and synchronously recorded photoplethysmography (PPG) signals. To tackle it, self-supervised learning has recently gained attentions; due to the lack of ground truth PPG signals, its performance is however limited. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised framework that successfully integrates the popular vision-language models (VLMs) into the remote physiological measurement task. Given a facial video, we first augment its positive and negative video samples with varying rPPG signal frequencies. Next, we introduce a frequency-oriented vision-text pair generation method by carefully creating contrastive spatio-temporal maps from positive and negative samples and designing proper text prompts to describe their relative ratios of signal frequencies. A pre-trained VLM is employed to extract features for these formed vision-text pairs and estimate rPPG signals thereafter. We develop a series of generative and contrastive learning mechanisms to optimize the VLM, including the text-guided visual map reconstruction task, the vision-text contrastive learning task, and the frequency contrastive and ranking task. Overall, our method for the first time adapts VLMs to digest and align the frequency-related knowledge in vision and text modalities. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that it significantly outperforms state of the art self-supervised methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we show different fine-tuning methods for Stable Diffusion XL; this includes inference steps, and caption customization for each image to align with generating images in the style of a commercial 2D icon training set. We also show how important it is to properly define what "high-quality" really is especially for a commercial-use environment. As generative AI models continue to gain widespread acceptance and usage, there emerge many different ways to optimize and evaluate them for various applications. Specifically text-to-image models, such as Stable Diffusion XL and DALL-E 3 require distinct evaluation practices to effectively generate high-quality icons according to a specific style. Although some images that are generated based on a certain style may have a lower FID score (better), we show how this is not absolute in and of itself even for rasterized icons. While FID scores reflect the similarity of generated images to the overall training set, CLIP scores measure the alignment between generated images and their textual descriptions. We show how FID scores miss significant aspects, such as the minority of pixel differences that matter most in an icon, while CLIP scores result in misjudging the quality of icons. The CLIP model's understanding of "similarity" is shaped by its own training data; which does not account for feature variation in our style of choice. Our findings highlight the need for specialized evaluation metrics and fine-tuning approaches when generating high-quality commercial icons, potentially leading to more effective and tailored applications of text-to-image models in professional design contexts.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While recent vision-and-language models (VLMs) like CLIP are a powerful tool for analyzing text and images in a shared semantic space, they do not explicitly model the hierarchical nature of the set of texts which may describe an image. Conversely, existing multimodal hierarchical representation learning methods require costly training from scratch, failing to leverage the knowledge encoded by state-of-the-art multimodal foundation models. In this work, we study the knowledge of existing foundation models, finding that they exhibit emergent understanding of visual-semantic hierarchies despite not being directly trained for this purpose. We propose the Radial Embedding (RE) framework for probing and optimizing hierarchical understanding, and contribute the HierarCaps dataset, a benchmark facilitating the study of hierarchical knowledge in image--text representations, constructed automatically via large language models. Our results show that foundation VLMs exhibit zero-shot hierarchical understanding, surpassing the performance of prior models explicitly designed for this purpose. Furthermore, we show that foundation models may be better aligned to hierarchical reasoning via a text-only fine-tuning phase, while retaining pretraining knowledge.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Exemplar-free class-incremental learning using a backbone trained from scratch and starting from a small first task presents a significant challenge for continual representation learning. Prototype-based approaches, when continually updated, face the critical issue of semantic drift due to which the old class prototypes drift to different positions in the new feature space. Through an analysis of prototype-based continual learning, we show that forgetting is not due to diminished discriminative power of the feature extractor, and can potentially be corrected by drift compensation. To address this, we propose Learnable Drift Compensation (LDC), which can effectively mitigate drift in any moving backbone, whether supervised or unsupervised. LDC is fast and straightforward to integrate on top of existing continual learning approaches. Furthermore, we showcase how LDC can be applied in combination with self-supervised CL methods, resulting in the first exemplar-free semi-supervised continual learning approach. We achieve state-of-the-art performance in both supervised and semi-supervised settings across multiple datasets. Code is available at \url{this https URL}.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce an approach to bias deep generative models, such as GANs and diffusion models, towards generating data with either enhanced fidelity or increased diversity. Our approach involves manipulating the distribution of training and generated data through a novel metric for individual samples, named pseudo density, which is based on the nearest-neighbor information from real samples. Our approach offers three distinct techniques to adjust the fidelity and diversity of deep generative models: 1) Per-sample perturbation, enabling precise adjustments for individual samples towards either more common or more unique characteristics; 2) Importance sampling during model inference to enhance either fidelity or diversity in the generated data; 3) Fine-tuning with importance sampling, which guides the generative model to learn an adjusted distribution, thus controlling fidelity and diversity. Furthermore, our fine-tuning method demonstrates the ability to improve the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) for pre-trained generative models with minimal iterations.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models have shown remarkable efficacy in generating streaming data such as text and audio, thanks to their temporally uni-directional attention mechanism, which models correlations between the current token and previous tokens. However, video streaming remains much less explored, despite a growing need for live video processing. State-of-the-art video diffusion models leverage bi-directional temporal attention to model the correlations between the current frame and all the surrounding (i.e. including future) frames, which hinders them from processing streaming videos. To address this problem, we present Live2Diff, the first attempt at designing a video diffusion model with uni-directional temporal attention, specifically targeting live streaming video translation. Compared to previous works, our approach ensures temporal consistency and smoothness by correlating the current frame with its predecessors and a few initial warmup frames, without any future frames. Additionally, we use a highly efficient denoising scheme featuring a KV-cache mechanism and pipelining, to facilitate streaming video translation at interactive framerates. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed attention mechanism and pipeline, outperforming previous methods in terms of temporal smoothness and/or efficiency.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We have made significant progress towards building foundational video diffusion models. As these models are trained using large-scale unsupervised data, it has become crucial to adapt these models to specific downstream tasks. Adapting these models via supervised fine-tuning requires collecting target datasets of videos, which is challenging and tedious. In this work, we utilize pre-trained reward models that are learned via preferences on top of powerful vision discriminative models to adapt video diffusion models. These models contain dense gradient information with respect to generated RGB pixels, which is critical to efficient learning in complex search spaces, such as videos. We show that backpropagating gradients from these reward models to a video diffusion model can allow for compute and sample efficient alignment of the video diffusion model. We show results across a variety of reward models and video diffusion models, demonstrating that our approach can learn much more efficiently in terms of reward queries and computation than prior gradient-free approaches.
