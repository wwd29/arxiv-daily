          Credit Card Fraud Detection in the Nigerian Financial Sector: A Comparison of Unsupervised TensorFlow-Based Anomaly Detection Techniques, Autoencoders and PCA Algorithm(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Credit card fraud is a major cause of national concern in the Nigerian financial sector, affecting hundreds of transactions per second and impacting international ecommerce negatively. Despite the rapid spread and adoption of online marketing, millions of Nigerians are prevented from transacting in several countries with local credit cards due to bans and policies directed at restricting credit card fraud. Presently, a myriad of technologies exist to detect fraudulent transactions, a few of which are adopted by Nigerian financial institutions to proactively manage the situation. Fraud detection allows institutions to restrict offenders from networks and with a centralized banking identity management system, such as the Bank Verification Number used by the Central Bank of Nigeria, offenders who may have stolen other identities can be backtraced and their bank accounts frozen. This paper aims to compare the effectiveness of two fraud detection technologies that are projected to work fully independent of human intervention to possibly predict and detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Autoencoders as an unsupervised tensorflow based anomaly detection technique generally offers greater performance in dimensionality reduction than the Principal Component Analysis, and this theory was tested out on Nigerian credit card transaction data. Results demonstrate that autoencoders are better suited to analyzing complex and extensive datasets and offer more reliable results with minimal mislabeling than the PCA algorithm.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vision-language foundation models have been incredibly successful in a wide range of downstream computer vision tasks using adaptation methods. However, due to the high cost of obtaining pre-training datasets, pairs with weak image-text correlation in the data exist in large numbers. We call them weak-paired samples. Due to the limitations of these weak-paired samples, the pre-training model are unable to mine all the knowledge from pre-training data. The existing adaptation methods do not consider the missing knowledge, which may lead to crucial task-related knowledge for the downstream tasks being ignored. To address this issue, we propose a new adaptation framework called Data Adaptive Traceback (DAT). Specifically, we utilize a zero-shot-based method to extract the most downstream task-related subset of the pre-training data to enable the downstream tasks. Furthermore, we adopt a pseudo-label-based semi-supervised technique to reuse the pre-training images and a vision-language contrastive learning method to address the confirmation bias issue in semi-supervised learning. We conduct extensive experiments that show our proposed DAT approach meaningfully improves various benchmark datasets performance over traditional adaptation methods by simply.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent point cloud understanding research suffers from performance drops on unseen data, due to the distribution shifts across different domains. While recent studies use Domain Generalization (DG) techniques to mitigate this by learning domain-invariant features, most are designed for a single task and neglect the potential of testing data. Despite In-Context Learning (ICL) showcasing multi-task learning capability, it usually relies on high-quality context-rich data and considers a single dataset, and has rarely been studied in point cloud understanding. In this paper, we introduce a novel, practical, multi-domain multi-task setting, handling multiple domains and multiple tasks within one unified model for domain generalized point cloud understanding. To this end, we propose Domain Generalized Point-In-Context Learning (DG-PIC) that boosts the generalizability across various tasks and domains at testing time. In particular, we develop dual-level source prototype estimation that considers both global-level shape contextual and local-level geometrical structures for representing source domains and a dual-level test-time feature shifting mechanism that leverages both macro-level domain semantic information and micro-level patch positional relationships to pull the target data closer to the source ones during the testing. Our DG-PIC does not require any model updates during the testing and can handle unseen domains and multiple tasks, \textit{i.e.,} point cloud reconstruction, denoising, and registration, within one unified model. We also introduce a benchmark for this new setting. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that DG-PIC outperforms state-of-the-art techniques significantly.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep learning (DL) has emerged as a crucial tool in network anomaly detection (NAD) for cybersecurity. While DL models for anomaly detection excel at extracting features and learning patterns from data, they are vulnerable to data contamination -- the inadvertent inclusion of attack-related data in training sets presumed benign. This study evaluates the robustness of six unsupervised DL algorithms against data contamination using our proposed evaluation protocol. Results demonstrate significant performance degradation in state-of-the-art anomaly detection algorithms when exposed to contaminated data, highlighting the critical need for self-protection mechanisms in DL-based NAD models. To mitigate this vulnerability, we propose an enhanced auto-encoder with a constrained latent representation, allowing normal data to cluster more densely around a learnable center in the latent space. Our evaluation reveals that this approach exhibits improved resistance to data contamination compared to existing methods, offering a promising direction for more robust NAD systems.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the proliferation of Artificial Intelligence, there has been a massive increase in the amount of data required to be accumulated and disseminated digitally. As the data are available online in digital landscapes with complex and sophisticated infrastructures, it is crucial to implement various defense mechanisms based on cybersecurity. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which are deep learning models, have emerged as powerful solutions for addressing the constantly changing security issues. This survey studies the significance of the deep learning model, precisely on GANs, in strengthening cybersecurity defenses. Our survey aims to explore the various works completed in GANs, such as Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), Mobile and Network Trespass, BotNet Detection, and Malware Detection. The focus is to examine how GANs can be influential tools to strengthen cybersecurity defenses in these domains. Further, the paper discusses the challenges and constraints of using GANs in these areas and suggests future research directions. Overall, the paper highlights the potential of GANs in enhancing cybersecurity measures and addresses the need for further exploration in this field.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Beyond estimating parameters of interest from data, one of the key goals of statistical inference is to properly quantify uncertainty in these estimates. In Bayesian inference, this uncertainty is provided by the posterior distribution, the computation of which typically involves an intractable high-dimensional integral. Among available approximation methods, sampling-based approaches come with strong theoretical guarantees but scale poorly to large problems, while variational approaches scale well but offer few theoretical guarantees. In particular, variational methods are known to produce overconfident estimates of posterior uncertainty and are typically non-identifiable, with many latent variable configurations generating equivalent predictions. Here, we address these challenges by showing how diffusion-based models (DBMs), which have recently produced state-of-the-art performance in generative modeling tasks, can be repurposed for performing calibrated, identifiable Bayesian inference. By exploiting a previously established connection between the stochastic and probability flow ordinary differential equations (pfODEs) underlying DBMs, we derive a class of models, inflationary flows, that uniquely and deterministically map high-dimensional data to a lower-dimensional Gaussian distribution via ODE integration. This map is both invertible and neighborhood-preserving, with controllable numerical error, with the result that uncertainties in the data are correctly propagated to the latent space. We demonstrate how such maps can be learned via standard DBM training using a novel noise schedule and are effective at both preserving and reducing intrinsic data dimensionality. The result is a class of highly expressive generative models, uniquely defined on a low-dimensional latent space, that afford principled Bayesian inference.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>De gustibus non est disputandum ("there is no accounting for others' tastes") is a common Latin maxim describing how many solutions in life are determined by people's personal preferences. Many household tasks, in particular, can only be considered fully successful when they account for personal preferences such as the visual aesthetic of the scene. For example, setting a table could be optimized by arranging utensils according to traditional rules of Western table setting decorum, without considering the color, shape, or material of each object, but this may not be a completely satisfying solution for a given person. Toward this end, we present DegustaBot, an algorithm for visual preference learning that solves household multi-object rearrangement tasks according to personal preference. To do this, we use internet-scale pre-trained vision-and-language foundation models (VLMs) with novel zero-shot visual prompting techniques. To evaluate our method, we collect a large dataset of naturalistic personal preferences in a simulated table-setting task, and conduct a user study in order to develop two novel metrics for determining success based on personal preference. This is a challenging problem and we find that 50% of our model's predictions are likely to be found acceptable by at least 20% of people.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The relationship between brain connections and non-imaging phenotypes is increasingly studied using deep neural networks. However, the local and global properties of the brain's white matter networks are often overlooked in convolutional network design. We introduce TractGraphFormer, a hybrid Graph CNN-Transformer deep learning framework tailored for diffusion MRI tractography. This model leverages local anatomical characteristics and global feature dependencies of white matter structures. The Graph CNN module captures white matter geometry and grey matter connectivity to aggregate local features from anatomically similar white matter connections, while the Transformer module uses self-attention to enhance global information learning. Additionally, TractGraphFormer includes an attention module for interpreting predictive white matter connections. In sex prediction tests, TractGraphFormer shows strong performance in large datasets of children (n=9345) and young adults (n=1065). Overall, our approach suggests that widespread connections in the WM are predictive of the sex of an individual, and consistent predictive anatomical tracts are identified across the two datasets. The proposed approach highlights the potential of integrating local anatomical information and global feature dependencies to improve prediction performance in machine learning with diffusion MRI tractography.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Illustration is a fundamental mode of human expression and communication. Certain types of motion that accompany speech can provide this illustrative mode of communication. While Augmented and Virtual Reality technologies (AR/VR) have introduced tools for producing drawings with hand motions (air drawing), they typically require costly hardware and additional digital markers, thereby limiting their accessibility and portability. Furthermore, air drawing demands considerable skill to achieve aesthetic results. To address these challenges, we introduce the concept of AirSketch, aimed at generating faithful and visually coherent sketches directly from hand motions, eliminating the need for complicated headsets or markers. We devise a simple augmentation-based self-supervised training procedure, enabling a controllable image diffusion model to learn to translate from highly noisy hand tracking images to clean, aesthetically pleasing sketches, while preserving the essential visual cues from the original tracking data. We present two air drawing datasets to study this problem. Our findings demonstrate that beyond producing photo-realistic images from precise spatial inputs, controllable image diffusion can effectively produce a refined, clear sketch from a noisy input. Our work serves as an initial step towards marker-less air drawing and reveals distinct applications of controllable diffusion models to AirSketch and AR/VR in general.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we propose a diffusion-based unsupervised framework that incorporates physically explainable Retinex theory with diffusion models for low-light image enhancement, named LightenDiffusion. Specifically, we present a content-transfer decomposition network that performs Retinex decomposition within the latent space instead of image space as in previous approaches, enabling the encoded features of unpaired low-light and normal-light images to be decomposed into content-rich reflectance maps and content-free illumination maps. Subsequently, the reflectance map of the low-light image and the illumination map of the normal-light image are taken as input to the diffusion model for unsupervised restoration with the guidance of the low-light feature, where a self-constrained consistency loss is further proposed to eliminate the interference of normal-light content on the restored results to improve overall visual quality. Extensive experiments on publicly available real-world benchmarks show that the proposed LightenDiffusion outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised competitors and is comparable to supervised methods while being more generalizable to various scenes.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative models hold promise for revolutionizing medical education, robot-assisted surgery, and data augmentation for medical AI development. Diffusion models can now generate realistic images from text prompts, while recent advancements have demonstrated their ability to create diverse, high-quality videos. However, these models often struggle with generating accurate representations of medical procedures and detailed anatomical structures. This paper introduces Bora, the first spatio-temporal diffusion probabilistic model designed for text-guided biomedical video generation. Bora leverages Transformer architecture and is pre-trained on general-purpose video generation tasks. It is fine-tuned through model alignment and instruction tuning using a newly established medical video corpus, which includes paired text-video data from various biomedical fields. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to establish such a comprehensive annotated biomedical video dataset. Bora is capable of generating high-quality video data across four distinct biomedical domains, adhering to medical expert standards and demonstrating consistency and diversity. This generalist video generative model holds significant potential for enhancing medical consultation and decision-making, particularly in resource-limited settings. Additionally, Bora could pave the way for immersive medical training and procedure planning. Extensive experiments on distinct medical modalities such as endoscopy, ultrasound, MRI, and cell tracking validate the effectiveness of our model in understanding biomedical instructions and its superior performance across subjects compared to state-of-the-art generation models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models learn to denoise data and the trained denoiser is then used to generate new samples from the data distribution. In this paper, we revisit the diffusion sampling process and identify a fundamental cause of sample quality degradation: the denoiser is poorly estimated in regions that are far Outside Of the training Distribution (OOD), and the sampling process inevitably evaluates in these OOD regions. This can become problematic for all sampling methods, especially when we move to parallel sampling which requires us to initialize and update the entire sample trajectory of dynamics in parallel, leading to many OOD evaluations. To address this problem, we introduce a new self-supervised training objective that differentiates the levels of noise added to a sample, leading to improved OOD denoising performance. The approach is based on our observation that diffusion models implicitly define a log-likelihood ratio that distinguishes distributions with different amounts of noise, and this expression depends on denoiser performance outside the standard training distribution. We show by diverse experiments that the proposed contrastive diffusion training is effective for both sequential and parallel settings, and it improves the performance and speed of parallel samplers significantly.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Enhancing model interpretability can address spurious correlations by revealing how models draw their predictions. Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) can provide a principled way of disclosing and guiding model behaviors through human-understandable concepts, albeit at a high cost of human efforts in data annotation. In this paper, we leverage a synergy of multiple foundation models to construct CBMs with nearly no human effort. We discover undesirable biases in CBMs built on pre-trained models and propose a novel framework designed to exploit pre-trained models while being immune to these biases, thereby reducing vulnerability to spurious correlations. Specifically, our method offers a seamless pipeline that adopts foundation models for assessing potential spurious correlations in datasets, annotating concepts for images, and refining the annotations for improved robustness. We evaluate the proposed method on multiple datasets, and the results demonstrate its effectiveness in reducing model reliance on spurious correlations while preserving its interpretability.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Few-Shot Fake News Detection (FS-FND) aims to distinguish inaccurate news from real ones in extremely low-resource scenarios. This task has garnered increased attention due to the widespread dissemination and harmful impact of fake news on social media. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated competitive performance with the help of their rich prior knowledge and excellent in-context learning abilities. However, existing methods face significant limitations, such as the Understanding Ambiguity and Information Scarcity, which significantly undermine the potential of LLMs. To address these shortcomings, we propose a Dual-perspective Augmented Fake News Detection (DAFND) model, designed to enhance LLMs from both inside and outside perspectives. Specifically, DAFND first identifies the keywords of each news article through a Detection Module. Subsequently, DAFND creatively designs an Investigation Module to retrieve inside and outside valuable information concerning to the current news, followed by another Judge Module to derive its respective two prediction results. Finally, a Determination Module further integrates these two predictions and derives the final result. Extensive experiments on two publicly available datasets show the efficacy of our proposed method, particularly in low-resource settings.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Few-Shot Relation Extraction (FSRE), a subtask of Relation Extraction (RE) that utilizes limited training instances, appeals to more researchers in Natural Language Processing (NLP) due to its capability to extract textual information in extremely low-resource scenarios. The primary methodologies employed for FSRE have been fine-tuning or prompt tuning techniques based on Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs). Recently, the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has prompted numerous researchers to explore FSRE through In-Context Learning (ICL). However, there are substantial limitations associated with methods based on either traditional RE models or LLMs. Traditional RE models are hampered by a lack of necessary prior knowledge, while LLMs fall short in their task-specific capabilities for RE. To address these shortcomings, we propose a Dual-System Augmented Relation Extractor (DSARE), which synergistically combines traditional RE models with LLMs. Specifically, DSARE innovatively injects the prior knowledge of LLMs into traditional RE models, and conversely enhances LLMs' task-specific aptitude for RE through relation extraction augmentation. Moreover, an Integrated Prediction module is employed to jointly consider these two respective predictions and derive the final results. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method.</li>

However, properly written text is rarely found in real-world scenarios and hence, oftentimes invalidates the aforementioned foundational assumption. Recently, Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance, but can they handle the inevitable noise in real-world data? This work tackles this critical question by investigating LLMs' resilience against morphological variations in text. To that end, we artificially introduce varying levels of noise into a diverse set of datasets and systematically evaluate LLMs' robustness against the corrupt variations of the original text. Our findings show that contrary to popular beliefs, generative LLMs are quiet robust to noisy perturbations in text. This is a departure from pre-trained models like BERT or RoBERTa whose performance has been shown to be sensitive to deteriorating noisy text. Additionally, we test LLMs' resilience on multiple real-world benchmarks that closely mimic commonly found errors in the wild. With minimal prompting, LLMs achieve a new state-of-the-art on the benchmark tasks of Grammar Error Correction (GEC) and Lexical Semantic Change (LSC). To empower future research, we also release a dataset annotated by humans stating their preference for LLM vs. human-corrected outputs along with the code to reproduce our results.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Pose-driven human-image animation diffusion models have shown remarkable capabilities in realistic human video synthesis. Despite the promising results achieved by previous approaches, challenges persist in achieving temporally consistent animation and ensuring robustness with off-the-shelf pose detectors. In this paper, we present TCAN, a pose-driven human image animation method that is robust to erroneous poses and consistent over time. In contrast to previous methods, we utilize the pre-trained ControlNet without fine-tuning to leverage its extensive pre-acquired knowledge from numerous pose-image-caption pairs. To keep the ControlNet frozen, we adapt LoRA to the UNet layers, enabling the network to align the latent space between the pose and appearance features. Additionally, by introducing an additional temporal layer to the ControlNet, we enhance robustness against outliers of the pose detector. Through the analysis of attention maps over the temporal axis, we also designed a novel temperature map leveraging pose information, allowing for a more static background. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve promising results in video synthesis tasks encompassing various poses, like chibi. Project Page: this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Drawing upon recent advances in language model alignment, we formulate offline Reinforcement Learning as a two-stage optimization problem: First pretraining expressive generative policies on reward-free behavior datasets, then fine-tuning these policies to align with task-specific annotations like Q-values. This strategy allows us to leverage abundant and diverse behavior data to enhance generalization and enable rapid adaptation to downstream tasks using minimal annotations. In particular, we introduce Efficient Diffusion Alignment (EDA) for solving continuous control problems. EDA utilizes diffusion models for behavior modeling. However, unlike previous approaches, we represent diffusion policies as the derivative of a scalar neural network with respect to action inputs. This representation is critical because it enables direct density calculation for diffusion models, making them compatible with existing LLM alignment theories. During policy fine-tuning, we extend preference-based alignment methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align diffusion behaviors with continuous Q-functions. Our evaluation on the D4RL benchmark shows that EDA exceeds all baseline methods in overall performance. Notably, EDA maintains about 95\% of performance and still outperforms several baselines given only 1\% of Q-labelled data during fine-tuning.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Continual learning (CL) poses the important challenge of adapting to evolving data distributions without forgetting previously acquired knowledge while consolidating new knowledge. In this paper, we introduce a new methodology, coined as Tabular-data Rehearsal-based Incremental Lifelong Learning framework (TRIL3), designed to address the phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting in tabular data classification problems. TRIL3 uses the prototype-based incremental generative model XuILVQ to generate synthetic data to preserve old knowledge and the DNDF algorithm, which was modified to run in an incremental way, to learn classification tasks for tabular data, without storing old samples. After different tests to obtain the adequate percentage of synthetic data and to compare TRIL3 with other CL available proposals, we can conclude that the performance of TRIL3 outstands other options in the literature using only 50% of synthetic data.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have become the cornerstone of today's generative AI ecosystem, sparking intense competition among tech giants and startups. In particular, an MLLM generates a text response given a prompt consisting of an image and a question. While state-of-the-art MLLMs use safety filters and alignment techniques to refuse unsafe prompts, in this work, we introduce MLLM-Refusal, the first method that induces refusals for safe prompts. In particular, our MLLM-Refusal optimizes a nearly-imperceptible refusal perturbation and adds it to an image, causing target MLLMs to likely refuse a safe prompt containing the perturbed image and a safe question. Specifically, we formulate MLLM-Refusal as a constrained optimization problem and propose an algorithm to solve it. Our method offers competitive advantages for MLLM model providers by potentially disrupting user experiences of competing MLLMs, since competing MLLM's users will receive unexpected refusals when they unwittingly use these perturbed images in their prompts. We evaluate MLLM-Refusal on four MLLMs across four datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in causing competing MLLMs to refuse safe prompts while not affecting non-competing MLLMs. Furthermore, we explore three potential countermeasures -- adding Gaussian noise, DiffPure, and adversarial training. Our results show that they are insufficient: though they can mitigate MLLM-Refusal's effectiveness, they also sacrifice the accuracy and/or efficiency of the competing MLLM.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Choosing a meaningful subset of features from high-dimensional observations in unsupervised settings can greatly enhance the accuracy of downstream analysis, such as clustering or dimensionality reduction, and provide valuable insights into the sources of heterogeneity in a given dataset. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised graph-based approach for unsupervised feature selection. Our method's core involves computing robust pseudo-labels by applying simple processing steps to the graph Laplacian's eigenvectors. The subset of eigenvectors used for computing pseudo-labels is chosen based on a model stability criterion. We then measure the importance of each feature by training a surrogate model to predict the pseudo-labels from the observations. Our approach is shown to be robust to challenging scenarios, such as the presence of outliers and complex substructures. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on real-world datasets, showing its robustness across multiple domains, particularly its effectiveness on biological datasets.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the realm of self-supervised learning (SSL), masked image modeling (MIM) has gained popularity alongside contrastive learning methods. MIM involves reconstructing masked regions of input images using their unmasked portions. A notable subset of MIM methodologies employs discrete tokens as the reconstruction target, but the theoretical underpinnings of this choice remain underexplored. In this paper, we explore the role of these discrete tokens, aiming to unravel their benefits and limitations. Building upon the connection between MIM and contrastive learning, we provide a comprehensive theoretical understanding on how discrete tokenization affects the model's generalization capabilities. Furthermore, we propose a novel metric named TCAS, which is specifically designed to assess the effectiveness of discrete tokens within the MIM framework. Inspired by this metric, we contribute an innovative tokenizer design and propose a corresponding MIM method named ClusterMIM. It demonstrates superior performance on a variety of benchmark datasets and ViT backbones. Code is available at this https URL.</li>

          On Exact Bit-level Reversible Transformers Without Changing Architectures(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the literature, various reversible deep neural networks (DNN) models have been proposed to reduce memory consumption or improve data-throughput in the training process. However, almost all existing reversible DNNs either are constrained to have special structures or are constructed by modifying the original DNN architectures considerably to enable reversibility. In this work, we propose exact bit-level reversible transformers without changing the architectures in the inference procedure. The basic idea is to first treat each transformer block as the Euler integration approximation for solving an ordinary differential equation (ODE) and then incorporate the technique of bidirectional integration approximation (BDIA) (see [26]) for BDIA-based diffusion inversion) into the neural architecture together with activation quantization to make it exactly bit-level reversible, referred to as BDIA-transformer. In the training process, we let a hyper-parameter $\gamma$ in BDIA-transformer randomly take one of the two values $\{0.5, -0.5\}$ per transformer block for averaging two consecutive integration approximations, which regularizes the models for improving the validation accuracy. Light-weight side information per transformer block is required to be stored in the forward process to account for binary quantization loss to enable exact bit-level reversibility. In the inference procedure, the expectation $\mathbb{E}(\gamma)=0$ is taken to make the resulting architectures of BDIA-transformer be identical to transformers up to activation quantization. Empirical study indicates that BDIA-transformers outperform their original counterparts notably due to the regularization effect of the $\gamma$ parameter.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Behavioural biometric authentication systems entail an enrolment period that is burdensome for the user. In this work, we explore generating synthetic gestures from a few real user gestures with generative deep learning, with the application of training a simple (i.e. non-deep-learned) authentication model. Specifically, we show that utilising synthetic data alongside real data can reduce the number of real datapoints a user must provide to enrol into a biometric system. To validate our methods, we use the publicly available dataset of WatchAuth, a system proposed in 2022 for authenticating smartwatch payments using the physical gesture of reaching towards a payment terminal. We develop a regularised autoencoder model for generating synthetic user-specific wrist motion data representing these physical gestures, and demonstrate the diversity and fidelity of our synthetic gestures. We show that using synthetic gestures in training can improve classification ability for a real-world system. Through this technique we can reduce the number of gestures required to enrol a user into a WatchAuth-like system by more than 40% without negatively impacting its error rates.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>When Large Language Models (LLMs) are compressed using techniques such as quantization, the predominant way to demonstrate the validity of such techniques is by measuring the model's accuracy on various benchmarks.If the accuracies of the baseline model and the compressed model are close, it is assumed that there was negligible degradation in quality.However, even when the accuracy of baseline and compressed model are similar, we observe the phenomenon of flips, wherein answers change from correct to incorrect and vice versa in proportion.We conduct a detailed study of metrics across multiple compression techniques, models and datasets, demonstrating that the behavior of compressed models as visible to end-users is often significantly different from the baseline model, even when accuracy is similar.We further evaluate compressed models qualitatively and quantitatively using MT-Bench and show that compressed models are significantly worse than baseline models in this free-form generative task.Thus, we argue that compression techniques should also be evaluated using distance metrics.We propose two such metrics, KL-Divergence and flips, and show that they are well correlated.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Anatomical Landmark Detection is the process of identifying key areas of an image for clinical measurements. Each landmark is a single ground truth point labelled by a clinician. A machine learning model predicts the locus of a landmark as a probability region represented by a heatmap. Diffusion models have increased in popularity for generative modelling due to their high quality sampling and mode coverage, leading to their adoption in medical image processing for semantic segmentation. Diffusion modelling can be further adapted to learn a distribution over landmarks. The stochastic nature of diffusion models captures fluctuations in the landmark prediction, which we leverage by blurring into meaningful probability regions. In this paper, we reformulate automatic Anatomical Landmark Detection as a precise generative modelling task, producing a few-hot pixel heatmap. Our method achieves state-of-the-art MRE and comparable SDR performance with existing work.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Acquiring surgical data for research and development is significantly hindered by high annotation costs and practical and ethical constraints. Utilizing synthetically generated images could offer a valuable alternative. In this work, we conduct an in-depth analysis on adapting text-to-image generative models for the surgical domain, leveraging the CholecT50 dataset, which provides surgical images annotated with surgical action triplets (instrument, verb, target). We investigate various language models and find T5 to offer more distinct features for differentiating surgical actions based on triplet-based textual inputs. Our analysis demonstrates strong alignment between long and triplet-based captions, supporting the use of triplet-based labels. We address the challenges in training text-to-image models on triplet-based captions without additional input signals by uncovering that triplet text embeddings are instrument-centric in the latent space and then, by designing an instrument-based class balancing technique to counteract the imbalance and skewness in the surgical data, improving training convergence. Extending Imagen, a diffusion-based generative model, we develop Surgical Imagen to generate photorealistic and activity-aligned surgical images from triplet-based textual prompts. We evaluate our model using diverse metrics, including human expert surveys and automated methods like FID and CLIP scores. We assess the model performance on key aspects: quality, alignment, reasoning, knowledge, and robustness, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in providing a realistic alternative to real data collection.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper we introduce a new dataset containing instance segmentation masks for ten different categories of winter sports equipment, called WSESeg (Winter Sports Equipment Segmentation). Furthermore, we carry out interactive segmentation experiments on said dataset to explore possibilities for efficient further labeling. The SAM and HQ-SAM models are conceptualized as foundation models for performing user guided segmentation. In order to measure their claimed generalization capability we evaluate them on WSESeg. Since interactive segmentation offers the benefit of creating easily exploitable ground truth data during test-time, we are going to test various online adaptation methods for the purpose of exploring potentials for improvements without having to fine-tune the models explicitly. Our experiments show that our adaptation methods drastically reduce the Failure Rate (FR) and Number of Clicks (NoC) metrics, which generally leads faster to better interactive segmentation results.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present a novel inverse rendering-based framework to estimate the 3D shape (per-pixel surface normals and depth) of objects and scenes from single-view polarization images, the problem popularly known as Shape from Polarization (SfP). The existing physics-based and learning-based methods for SfP perform under certain restrictions, i.e., (a) purely diffuse or purely specular reflections, which are seldom in the real surfaces, (b) availability of the ground truth surface normals for direct supervision that are hard to acquire and are limited by the scanner's resolution, and (c) known refractive index. To overcome these restrictions, we start by learning to separate the partially-polarized diffuse and specular reflection components, which we call reflectance cues, based on a modified polarization reflection model and then estimate shape under mixed polarization through an inverse-rendering based self-supervised deep learning framework called SS-SfP, guided by the polarization data and estimated reflectance cues. Furthermore, we also obtain the refractive index as a non-linear least squares solution. Through extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluation, we establish the efficacy of the proposed framework over simple single-object scenes from DeepSfP dataset and complex in-the-wild scenes from SPW dataset in an entirely self-supervised setting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first learning-based approach to address SfP under mixed polarization in a completely self-supervised framework.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Density-based distances (DBDs) offer an elegant solution to the problem of metric learning. By defining a Riemannian metric which increases with decreasing probability density, shortest paths naturally follow the data manifold and points are clustered according to the modes of the data. We show that existing methods to estimate Fermat distances, a particular choice of DBD, suffer from poor convergence in both low and high dimensions due to i) inaccurate density estimates and ii) reliance on graph-based paths which are increasingly rough in high dimensions. To address these issues, we propose learning the densities using a normalizing flow, a generative model with tractable density estimation, and employing a smooth relaxation method using a score model initialized from a graph-based proposal. Additionally, we introduce a dimension-adapted Fermat distance that exhibits more intuitive behavior when scaled to high dimensions and offers better numerical properties. Our work paves the way for practical use of density-based distances, especially in high-dimensional spaces.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Infrared imaging technology has gained significant attention for its reliable sensing ability in low visibility conditions, prompting many studies to convert the abundant RGB images to infrared images. However, most existing image translation methods treat infrared images as a stylistic variation, neglecting the underlying physical laws, which limits their practical application. To address these issues, we propose a Physics-Informed Diffusion (PID) model for translating RGB images to infrared images that adhere to physical laws. Our method leverages the iterative optimization of the diffusion model and incorporates strong physical constraints based on prior knowledge of infrared laws during training. This approach enhances the similarity between translated infrared images and the real infrared domain without increasing extra training parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that PID significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at this https URL.</li>

          ProDepth: Boosting Self-Supervised Multi-Frame Monocular Depth with Probabilistic Fusion(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Self-supervised multi-frame monocular depth estimation relies on the geometric consistency between successive frames under the assumption of a static scene. However, the presence of moving objects in dynamic scenes introduces inevitable inconsistencies, causing misaligned multi-frame feature matching and misleading self-supervision during training. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called ProDepth, which effectively addresses the mismatch problem caused by dynamic objects using a probabilistic approach. We initially deduce the uncertainty associated with static scene assumption by adopting an auxiliary decoder. This decoder analyzes inconsistencies embedded in the cost volume, inferring the probability of areas being dynamic. We then directly rectify the erroneous cost volume for dynamic areas through a Probabilistic Cost Volume Modulation (PCVM) module. Specifically, we derive probability distributions of depth candidates from both single-frame and multi-frame cues, modulating the cost volume by adaptively fusing those distributions based on the inferred uncertainty. Additionally, we present a self-supervision loss reweighting strategy that not only masks out incorrect supervision with high uncertainty but also mitigates the risks in remaining possible dynamic areas in accordance with the probability. Our proposed method excels over state-of-the-art approaches in all metrics on both Cityscapes and KITTI datasets, and demonstrates superior generalization ability on the Waymo Open dataset.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Self-supervised contrastive learning has become a key technique in deep learning, particularly in time series analysis, due to its ability to learn meaningful representations without explicit supervision. Augmentation is a critical component in contrastive learning, where different augmentations can dramatically impact performance, sometimes influencing accuracy by over 30%. However, the selection of augmentations is predominantly empirical which can be suboptimal, or grid searching that is time-consuming. In this paper, we establish a principled framework for selecting augmentations based on dataset characteristics such as trend and seasonality. Specifically, we construct 12 synthetic datasets incorporating trend, seasonality, and integration weights. We then evaluate the effectiveness of 8 different augmentations across these synthetic datasets, thereby inducing generalizable associations between time series characteristics and augmentation efficiency. Additionally, we evaluated the induced associations across 6 real-world datasets encompassing domains such as activity recognition, disease diagnosis, traffic monitoring, electricity usage, mechanical fault prognosis, and finance. These real-world datasets are diverse, covering a range from 1 to 12 channels, 2 to 10 classes, sequence lengths of 14 to 1280, and data frequencies from 250 Hz to daily intervals. The experimental results show that our proposed trend-seasonality-based augmentation recommendation algorithm can accurately identify the effective augmentations for a given time series dataset, achieving an average Recall@3 of 0.667, outperforming baselines. Our work provides guidance for studies employing contrastive learning in time series analysis, with wide-ranging applications.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generating novel molecules is challenging, with most representations leading to generative models producing many invalid molecules. Spanning Tree-based Graph Generation (STGG) is a promising approach to ensure the generation of valid molecules, outperforming state-of-the-art SMILES and graph diffusion models for unconditional generation. In the real world, we want to be able to generate molecules conditional on one or multiple desired properties rather than unconditionally. Thus, in this work, we extend STGG to multi-property-conditional generation. Our approach, STGG+, incorporates a modern Transformer architecture, random masking of properties during training (enabling conditioning on any subset of properties and classifier-free guidance), an auxiliary property-prediction loss (allowing the model to self-criticize molecules and select the best ones), and other improvements. We show that STGG+ achieves state-of-the-art performance on in-distribution and out-of-distribution conditional generation, and reward maximization.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Anomaly synthesis strategies can effectively enhance unsupervised anomaly detection. However, existing strategies have limitations in the coverage and controllability of anomaly synthesis, particularly for weak defects that are very similar to normal regions. In this paper, we propose Global and Local Anomaly co-Synthesis Strategy (GLASS), a novel unified framework designed to synthesize a broader coverage of anomalies under the manifold and hypersphere distribution constraints of Global Anomaly Synthesis (GAS) at the feature level and Local Anomaly Synthesis (LAS) at the image level. Our method synthesizes near-in-distribution anomalies in a controllable way using Gaussian noise guided by gradient ascent and truncated projection. GLASS achieves state-of-the-art results on the MVTec AD (detection AUROC of 99.9\%), VisA, and MPDD datasets and excels in weak defect detection. The effectiveness and efficiency have been further validated in industrial applications for woven fabric defect detection. The code and dataset are available at: \url{this https URL}.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This work explores the in-context learning capabilities of State Space Models (SSMs) and presents, to the best of our knowledge, the first theoretical explanation of a possible underlying mechanism. We introduce a novel weight construction for SSMs, enabling them to predict the next state of any dynamical system after observing previous states without parameter fine-tuning. This is accomplished by extending the HiPPO framework to demonstrate that continuous SSMs can approximate the derivative of any input signal. Specifically, we find an explicit weight construction for continuous SSMs and provide an asymptotic error bound on the derivative approximation. The discretization of this continuous SSM subsequently yields a discrete SSM that predicts the next state. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our parameterization empirically. This work should be an initial step toward understanding how sequence models based on SSMs learn in context.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Seeking answers to questions within long scientific research articles is a crucial area of study that aids readers in quickly addressing their inquiries. However, existing question-answering (QA) datasets based on scientific papers are limited in scale and focus solely on textual content. To address this limitation, we introduce SPIQA (Scientific Paper Image Question Answering), the first large-scale QA dataset specifically designed to interpret complex figures and tables within the context of scientific research articles across various domains of computer science. Leveraging the breadth of expertise and ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to understand figures, we employ automatic and manual curation to create the dataset. We craft an information-seeking task involving multiple images that cover a wide variety of plots, charts, tables, schematic diagrams, and result visualizations. SPIQA comprises 270K questions divided into training, validation, and three different evaluation splits. Through extensive experiments with 12 prominent foundational models, we evaluate the ability of current multimodal systems to comprehend the nuanced aspects of research articles. Additionally, we propose a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) evaluation strategy with in-context retrieval that allows fine-grained, step-by-step assessment and improves model performance. We further explore the upper bounds of performance enhancement with additional textual information, highlighting its promising potential for future research and the dataset's impact on revolutionizing how we interact with scientific literature.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Foundation models (FMs) currently dominate news headlines. They employ advanced deep learning architectures to extract structural information autonomously from vast datasets through self-supervision. The resulting rich representations of complex systems and dynamics can be applied to many downstream applications. Therefore, FMs can find uses in electric power grids, challenged by the energy transition and climate change. In this paper, we call for the development of, and state why we believe in, the potential of FMs for electric grids. We highlight their strengths and weaknesses amidst the challenges of a changing grid. We argue that an FM learning from diverse grid data and topologies could unlock transformative capabilities, pioneering a new approach in leveraging AI to redefine how we manage complexity and uncertainty in the electric grid. Finally, we discuss a power grid FM concept, namely GridFM, based on graph neural networks and show how different downstream tasks benefit.</li>
