<li>Summary: <p>We extract mathematical concepts from mathematical text using generative
large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, contributing to the field of
automatic term extraction (ATE) and mathematical text processing, and also to
the study of LLMs themselves. Our work builds on that of others in that we aim
for automatic extraction of terms (keywords) in one mathematical field,
category theory, using as a corpus the 755 abstracts from a snapshot of the
online journal "Theory and Applications of Categories", circa 2020. Where our
study diverges from previous work is in (1) providing a more thorough analysis
of what makes mathematical term extraction a difficult problem to begin with;
(2) paying close attention to inter-annotator disagreements; (3) providing a
set of guidelines which both human and machine annotators could use to
standardize the extraction process; (4) introducing a new annotation tool to
help humans with ATE, applicable to any mathematical field and even beyond
mathematics; (5) using prompts to ChatGPT as part of the extraction process,
and proposing best practices for such prompts; and (6) raising the question of
whether ChatGPT could be used as an annotator on the same level as human
experts. Our overall findings are that the matter of mathematical ATE is an
interesting field which can benefit from participation by LLMs, but LLMs
themselves cannot at this time surpass human performance on it.

<li>Summary: <p>We aim to better understand the emergence of `situational awareness' in large
language models (LLMs). A model is situationally aware if it's aware that it's
a model and can recognize whether it's currently in testing or deployment.
Today's LLMs are tested for safety and alignment before they are deployed. An
LLM could exploit situational awareness to achieve a high score on safety
tests, while taking harmful actions after deployment. Situational awareness may
emerge unexpectedly as a byproduct of model scaling. One way to better foresee
this emergence is to run scaling experiments on abilities necessary for
situational awareness. As such an ability, we propose `out-of-context
reasoning' (in contrast to in-context learning). We study out-of-context
reasoning experimentally. First, we finetune an LLM on a description of a test
while providing no examples or demonstrations. At test time, we assess whether
the model can pass the test. To our surprise, we find that LLMs succeed on this
out-of-context reasoning task. Their success is sensitive to the training setup
and only works when we apply data augmentation. For both GPT-3 and LLaMA-1,
performance improves with model size. These findings offer a foundation for
further empirical study, towards predicting and potentially controlling the
emergence of situational awareness in LLMs. Code is available at:
