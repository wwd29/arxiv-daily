<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The task of industrial detection based on deep learning often involves solving two problems: (1) obtaining sufficient and effective data samples, (2) and using efficient and convenient model training methods. In this paper, we introduce a novel defect-generation method, named DDPM-MoCo, to address these issues. Firstly, we utilize the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) to generate high-quality defect data samples, overcoming the problem of insufficient sample data for model learning. Furthermore, we utilize the unsupervised learning Momentum Contrast model (MoCo) with an enhanced batch contrastive loss function for training the model on unlabeled data, addressing the efficiency and consistency challenges in large-scale negative sample encoding during diffusion model training. The experimental results showcase an enhanced visual detection method for identifying defects on metal surfaces, covering the entire process, starting from generating unlabeled sample data for training the diffusion model, to utilizing the same labeled sample data for downstream detection tasks. This study offers valuable practical insights and application potential for visual detection in the metal processing industry.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multimodal foundation models that can holistically process text alongside images, video, audio, and other sensory modalities are increasingly used in a variety of real-world applications. However, it is challenging to characterize and study progress in multimodal foundation models, given the range of possible modeling decisions, tasks, and domains. In this paper, we introduce Holistic Evaluation of Multimodal Models (HEMM) to systematically evaluate the capabilities of multimodal foundation models across a set of 3 dimensions: basic skills, information flow, and real-world use cases. Basic multimodal skills are internal abilities required to solve problems, such as learning interactions across modalities, fine-grained alignment, multi-step reasoning, and the ability to handle external knowledge. Information flow studies how multimodal content changes during a task through querying, translation, editing, and fusion. Use cases span domain-specific challenges introduced in real-world multimedia, affective computing, natural sciences, healthcare, and human-computer interaction applications. Through comprehensive experiments across the 30 tasks in HEMM, we (1) identify key dataset dimensions (e.g., basic skills, information flows, and use cases) that pose challenges to today's models, and (2) distill performance trends regarding how different modeling dimensions (e.g., scale, pre-training data, multimodal alignment, pre-training, and instruction tuning objectives) influence performance. Our conclusions regarding challenging multimodal interactions, use cases, and tasks requiring reasoning and external knowledge, the benefits of data and model scale, and the impacts of instruction tuning yield actionable insights for future work in multimodal foundation models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Autonomous mobile robots deployed in urban environments must be context-aware, i.e., able to distinguish between different semantic entities, and robust to occlusions. Current approaches like semantic scene completion (SSC) require pre-enumerating the set of classes and costly human annotations, while representation learning methods relax these assumptions but are not robust to occlusions and learn representations tailored towards auxiliary tasks. To address these limitations, we propose LSMap, a method that lifts masks from visual foundation models to predict a continuous, open-set semantic and elevation-aware representation in bird's eye view (BEV) for the entire scene, including regions underneath dynamic entities and in occluded areas. Our model only requires a single RGBD image, does not require human labels, and operates in real time. We quantitatively demonstrate our approach outperforms existing models trained from scratch on semantic and elevation scene completion tasks with finetuning. Furthermore, we show that our pre-trained representation outperforms existing visual foundation models at unsupervised semantic scene completion. We evaluate our approach using CODa, a large-scale, real-world urban robot dataset. Supplementary visualizations, code, data, and pre-trained models, will be publicly available soon.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present NEBULA, the first latent 3D generative model for scalable generation of large molecular libraries around a seed compound of interest. Such libraries are crucial for scientific discovery, but it remains challenging to generate large numbers of high quality samples efficiently. 3D-voxel-based methods have recently shown great promise for generating high quality samples de novo from random noise (Pinheiro et al., 2023). However, sampling in 3D-voxel space is computationally expensive and use in library generation is prohibitively slow. Here, we instead perform neural empirical Bayes sampling (Saremi & Hyvarinen, 2019) in the learned latent space of a vector-quantized variational autoencoder. NEBULA generates large molecular libraries nearly an order of magnitude faster than existing methods without sacrificing sample quality. Moreover, NEBULA generalizes better to unseen drug-like molecules, as demonstrated on two public datasets and multiple recently released drugs. We expect the approach herein to be highly enabling for machine learning-based drug discovery. The code is available at this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The use of generative AI in video game development is on the rise, and as the conversational and other capabilities of large language models continue to improve, we expect LLM-driven non-player characters (NPCs) to become widely deployed. In this paper, we seek to understand how human players collaborate with LLM-driven NPCs to accomplish in-game goals. We design a minigame within Minecraft where a player works with two GPT4-driven NPCs to complete a quest. We perform a user study in which 28 Minecraft players play this minigame and share their feedback. On analyzing the game logs and recordings, we find that several patterns of collaborative behavior emerge from the NPCs and the human players. We also report on the current limitations of language-only models that do not have rich game-state or visual understanding. We believe that this preliminary study and analysis will inform future game developers on how to better exploit these rapidly improving generative AI models for collaborative roles in games.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the realm of self-supervised learning (SSL), conventional wisdom has gravitated towards the utility of massive, general domain datasets for pretraining robust backbones. In this paper, we challenge this idea by exploring if it is possible to bridge the scale between general-domain datasets and (traditionally smaller) domain-specific datasets to reduce the current performance gap. More specifically, we propose Precision at Scale (PaS), a novel method for the autonomous creation of domain-specific datasets on-demand. The modularity of the PaS pipeline enables leveraging state-of-the-art foundational and generative models to create a collection of images of any given size belonging to any given domain with minimal human intervention. Extensive analysis in two complex domains, proves the superiority of PaS datasets over existing traditional domain-specific datasets in terms of diversity, scale, and effectiveness in training visual transformers and convolutional neural networks. Most notably, we prove that automatically generated domain-specific datasets lead to better pretraining than large-scale supervised datasets such as ImageNet-1k and ImageNet-21k. Concretely, models trained on domain-specific datasets constructed by PaS pipeline, beat ImageNet-1k pretrained backbones by at least 12% in all the considered domains and classification tasks and lead to better food domain performance than supervised ImageNet-21k pretrain while being 12 times smaller.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Two competing paradigms exist for self-supervised learning of data representations. Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) is a class of architectures in which semantically similar inputs are encoded into representations that are predictive of each other. A recent successful approach that falls under the JEPA framework is self-distillation, where an online encoder is trained to predict the output of the target encoder, sometimes using a lightweight predictor network. This is contrasted with the Masked AutoEncoder (MAE) paradigm, where an encoder and decoder are trained to reconstruct missing parts of the input in the data space rather, than its latent representation. A common motivation for using the JEPA approach over MAE is that the JEPA objective prioritizes abstract features over fine-grained pixel information (which can be unpredictable and uninformative). In this work, we seek to understand the mechanism behind this empirical observation by analyzing the training dynamics of deep linear models. We uncover a surprising mechanism: in a simplified linear setting where both approaches learn similar representations, JEPAs are biased to learn high-influence features, i.e., features characterized by having high regression coefficients. Our results point to a distinct implicit bias of predicting in latent space that may shed light on its success in practice.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Foundation models (FMs) have revolutionized computer vision, enabling effective learning across different domains. However, their performance under domain shift is yet underexplored. This paper investigates the zero-shot domain adaptation potential of FMs by comparing different backbone architectures and introducing novel domain-aware components that leverage domain related textual embeddings. We propose domain adaptive normalization, termed as Domino, which explicitly leverages domain embeddings during fine-tuning, thus making the model domain aware. Ultimately, Domino enables more robust computer vision models that can adapt effectively to various unseen domains.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Low-light videos often exhibit spatiotemporal incoherent noise, compromising visibility and performance in computer vision applications. One significant challenge in enhancing such content using deep learning is the scarcity of training data. This paper introduces a novel low-light video dataset, consisting of 40 scenes with various motion scenarios under two distinct low-lighting conditions, incorporating genuine noise and temporal artifacts. We provide fully registered ground truth data captured in normal light using a programmable motorized dolly and refine it via an image-based approach for pixel-wise frame alignment across different light levels. We provide benchmarks based on four different technologies: convolutional neural networks, transformers, diffusion models, and state space models (mamba). Our experimental results demonstrate the significance of fully registered video pairs for low-light video enhancement (LLVE) and the comprehensive evaluation shows that the models trained with our dataset outperform those trained with the existing datasets.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Medical image segmentation has been significantly advanced with the rapid development of deep learning (DL) techniques. Existing DL-based segmentation models are typically discriminative; i.e., they aim to learn a mapping from the input image to segmentation masks. However, these discriminative methods neglect the underlying data distribution and intrinsic class characteristics, suffering from unstable feature space. In this work, we propose to complement discriminative segmentation methods with the knowledge of underlying data distribution from generative models. To that end, we propose a novel hybrid diffusion framework for medical image segmentation, termed HiDiff, which can synergize the strengths of existing discriminative segmentation models and new generative diffusion models. HiDiff comprises two key components: discriminative segmentor and diffusion refiner. First, we utilize any conventional trained segmentation models as discriminative segmentor, which can provide a segmentation mask prior for diffusion refiner. Second, we propose a novel binary Bernoulli diffusion model (BBDM) as the diffusion refiner, which can effectively, efficiently, and interactively refine the segmentation mask by modeling the underlying data distribution. Third, we train the segmentor and BBDM in an alternate-collaborative manner to mutually boost each other. Extensive experimental results on abdomen organ, brain tumor, polyps, and retinal vessels segmentation datasets, covering four widely-used modalities, demonstrate the superior performance of HiDiff over existing medical segmentation algorithms, including the state-of-the-art transformer- and diffusion-based ones. In addition, HiDiff excels at segmenting small objects and generalizing to new datasets. Source codes are made available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Standard deep learning architectures such as convolutional neural networks and vision transformers often fail to generalize to previously unseen domains due to the implicit assumption that both source and target data are drawn from independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) populations. In response, Domain Generalization techniques aim to enhance model robustness by simulating novel data distributions during training, typically through various augmentation or stylization strategies. However, these methods frequently suffer from limited control over the diversity of generated images and lack assurance that these images span distinct distributions. To address these challenges, we propose FDS, a novel strategy that employs diffusion models to synthesize samples from new domains by training on source distribution samples and performing domain mixing. By incorporating images that pose classification challenges to models trained on original samples, alongside the original dataset, we ensure the generation of a training set that spans a broad distribution spectrum. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that this methodology sets new benchmarks in domain generalization performance across a range of challenging datasets, effectively managing diverse types of domain shifts.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Visual anomaly detection is critical in industrial manufacturing, but traditional methods often rely on extensive normal datasets and custom models, limiting scalability. Recent advancements in large-scale visual-language models have significantly improved zero/few-shot anomaly detection. However, these approaches may not fully utilize hierarchical features, potentially missing nuanced details. We introduce a window self-attention mechanism based on the CLIP model, combined with learnable prompts to process multi-level features within a Soldier-Offier Window self-Attention (SOWA) framework. Our method has been tested on five benchmark datasets, demonstrating superior performance by leading in 18 out of 20 metrics compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Realistic image restoration is a crucial task in computer vision, and the use of diffusion-based models for image restoration has garnered significant attention due to their ability to produce realistic results. However, the quality of the generated images is still a significant challenge due to the severity of image degradation and the uncontrollability of the diffusion model. In this work, we delve into the potential of utilizing pre-trained stable diffusion for image restoration and propose MRIR, a diffusion-based restoration method with multimodal insights. Specifically, we explore the problem from two perspectives: textual level and visual level. For the textual level, we harness the power of the pre-trained multimodal large language model to infer meaningful semantic information from low-quality images. Furthermore, we employ the CLIP image encoder with a designed Refine Layer to capture image details as a supplement. For the visual level, we mainly focus on the pixel level control. Thus, we utilize a Pixel-level Processor and ControlNet to control spatial structures. Finally, we integrate the aforementioned control information into the denoising U-Net using multi-level attention mechanisms and realize controllable image restoration with multimodal insights. The qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate our method's superiority over other state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Image restoration is a classic low-level problem aimed at recovering high-quality images from low-quality images with various degradations such as blur, noise, rain, haze, etc. However, due to the inherent complexity and non-uniqueness of degradation in real-world images, it is challenging for a model trained for single tasks to handle real-world restoration problems effectively. Moreover, existing methods often suffer from over-smoothing and lack of realism in the restored results. To address these issues, we propose Diff-Restorer, a universal image restoration method based on the diffusion model, aiming to leverage the prior knowledge of Stable Diffusion to remove degradation while generating high perceptual quality restoration results. Specifically, we utilize the pre-trained visual language model to extract visual prompts from degraded images, including semantic and degradation embeddings. The semantic embeddings serve as content prompts to guide the diffusion model for generation. In contrast, the degradation embeddings modulate the Image-guided Control Module to generate spatial priors for controlling the spatial structure of the diffusion process, ensuring faithfulness to the original image. Additionally, we design a Degradation-aware Decoder to perform structural correction and convert the latent code to the pixel domain. We conducted comprehensive qualitative and quantitative analysis on restoration tasks with different degradations, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of our approach.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Affective computing stands at the forefront of artificial intelligence (AI), seeking to imbue machines with the ability to comprehend and respond to human emotions. Central to this field is emotion recognition, which endeavors to identify and interpret human emotional states from different modalities, such as speech, facial images, text, and physiological signals. In recent years, important progress has been made in generative models, including Autoencoder, Generative Adversarial Network, Diffusion Model, and Large Language Model. These models, with their powerful data generation capabilities, emerge as pivotal tools in advancing emotion recognition. However, up to now, there remains a paucity of systematic efforts that review generative technology for emotion recognition. This survey aims to bridge the gaps in the existing literature by conducting a comprehensive analysis of over 320 research papers until June 2024. Specifically, this survey will firstly introduce the mathematical principles of different generative models and the commonly used datasets. Subsequently, through a taxonomy, it will provide an in-depth analysis of how generative techniques address emotion recognition based on different modalities in several aspects, including data augmentation, feature extraction, semi-supervised learning, cross-domain, etc. Finally, the review will outline future research directions, emphasizing the potential of generative models to advance the field of emotion recognition and enhance the emotional intelligence of AI systems.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In practical applications within the human body, it is often challenging to fully encompass the target tissue or organ, necessitating the use of limited-view arrays, which can lead to the loss of crucial information. Addressing the reconstruction of photoacoustic sensor signals in limited-view detection spaces has become a focal point of current research. In this study, we introduce a self-supervised network termed HIgh-quality Self-supervised neural representation (HIS), which tackles the inverse problem of photoacoustic imaging to reconstruct high-quality photoacoustic images from sensor data acquired under limited viewpoints. We regard the desired reconstructed photoacoustic image as an implicit continuous function in 2D image space, viewing the pixels of the image as sparse discrete samples. The HIS's objective is to learn the continuous function from limited observations by utilizing a fully connected neural network combined with Fourier feature position encoding. By simply minimizing the error between the network's predicted sensor data and the actual sensor data, HIS is trained to represent the observed continuous model. The results indicate that the proposed HIS model offers superior image reconstruction quality compared to three commonly used methods for photoacoustic image reconstruction.</li>

We first discuss the expected goals of using synthetic data in data augmentation, which can be divided into four parts: 1) Improving Diversity, 2) Data Balancing, 3) Addressing Domain Shift, and 4) Resolving Edge Cases. Synthesizing data are closely related to the prevailing machine learning techniques at the time, therefore, we summarize the domain of synthetic data techniques into four categories: 1) Expert-knowledge, 2) Direct Training, 3) Pre-train then Fine-tune, and 4) Foundation Models without Fine-tuning. Next, we categorize the goals of synthetic data filtering into four types for discussion: 1) Basic Quality, 2) Label Consistency, and 3) Data Distribution. In section 5 of this paper, we also discuss the future directions of synthetic data and state three direction that we believe is important: 1) focus more on quality, 2) the evaluation of synthetic data, and 3) multi-model data augmentation.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The primary goal of structural health monitoring is to detect damage at its onset before it reaches a critical level. The in-depth investigation in the present work addresses deep learning applied to data-driven damage detection in nonlinear dynamic systems. In particular, autoencoders (AEs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs) are implemented leveraging on 1D convolutional neural networks. The onset of damage is detected in the investigated nonlinear dynamic systems by exciting random vibrations of varying intensity, without prior knowledge of the system or the excitation and in unsupervised manner. The comprehensive numerical study is conducted on dynamic systems exhibiting different types of nonlinear behavior. An experimental application related to a magneto-elastic nonlinear system is also presented to corroborate the conclusions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In unsupervised representation learning, models aim to distill essential features from high-dimensional data into lower-dimensional learned representations, guided by inductive biases. Understanding the characteristics that make a good representation remains a topic of ongoing research. Disentanglement of independent generative processes has long been credited with producing high-quality representations. However, focusing solely on representations that adhere to the stringent requirements of most disentanglement metrics, may result in overlooking many high-quality representations, well suited for various downstream tasks. These metrics often demand that generative factors be encoded in distinct, single dimensions aligned with the canonical basis of the representation space. Motivated by these observations, we propose two novel metrics: Importance-Weighted Orthogonality (IWO) and Importance-Weighted Rank (IWR). These metrics evaluate the mutual orthogonality and rank of generative factor subspaces. Throughout extensive experiments on common downstream tasks, over several benchmark datasets and models, IWO and IWR consistently show stronger correlations with downstream task performance than traditional disentanglement metrics. Our findings suggest that representation quality is closer related to the orthogonality of independent generative processes rather than their disentanglement, offering a new direction for evaluating and improving unsupervised learning models.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Speech accents present a serious challenge to the performance of state-of-the-art end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. Even with self-supervised learning and pre-training of ASR models, accent invariance is seldom achieved. In this work, we propose an accent-aware adaptation technique for self-supervised learning that introduces a trainable set of accent-specific codebooks to the self-supervised architecture. These learnable codebooks enable the model to capture accent specific information during pre-training, that is further refined during ASR finetuning. On the Mozilla Common Voice dataset, our proposed approach outperforms all other accent-adaptation approaches on both seen and unseen English accents, with up to 9% relative reduction in word error rate (WER).</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Image retouching aims to enhance the visual quality of photos. Considering the different aesthetic preferences of users, the target of retouching is subjective. However, current retouching methods mostly adopt deterministic models, which not only neglects the style diversity in the expert-retouched results and tends to learn an average style during training, but also lacks sample diversity during inference. In this paper, we propose a diffusion-based method, named DiffRetouch. Thanks to the excellent distribution modeling ability of diffusion, our method can capture the complex fine-retouched distribution covering various visual-pleasing styles in the training data. Moreover, four image attributes are made adjustable to provide a user-friendly editing mechanism. By adjusting these attributes in specified ranges, users are allowed to customize preferred styles within the learned fine-retouched distribution. Additionally, the affine bilateral grid and contrastive learning scheme are introduced to handle the problem of texture distortion and control insensitivity respectively. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the superior performance of our method on visually appealing and sample diversity. The code will be made available to the community.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive reformulation of the task known as Circuit Discovery, along with DiscoGP, a novel and effective algorithm based on differentiable masking for discovering circuits. Circuit discovery is the task of interpreting the computational mechanisms of language models (LMs) by dissecting their functions and capabilities into sparse subnetworks (circuits). We identified two major limitations in existing circuit discovery efforts: (1) a dichotomy between weight-based and connection-edge-based approaches forces researchers to choose between pruning connections or weights, thereby limiting the scope of mechanistic interpretation of LMs; (2) algorithms based on activation patching tend to identify circuits that are neither functionally faithful nor complete. The performance of these identified circuits is substantially reduced, often resulting in near-random performance in isolation. Furthermore, the complement of the circuit -- i.e., the original LM with the identified circuit removed -- still retains adequate performance, indicating that essential components of a complete circuits are missed by existing methods. DiscoGP successfully addresses the two aforementioned issues and demonstrates state-of-the-art faithfulness, completeness, and sparsity. The effectiveness of the algorithm and its novel structure open up new avenues of gathering new insights into the internal workings of generative AI.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative, anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Monitoring the stress level in patients with neurodegenerative diseases can help manage symptoms, improve patient's quality of life, and provide insight into disease progression. In the literature, ECG, actigraphy, speech, voice, and facial analysis have proven effective at detecting patients' emotions. On the other hand, these tools are invasive and do not integrate smoothly into the patient's daily life. HRV has also been proven to effectively indicate stress conditions, especially in combination with other signals. However, when HRV is derived from less invasive devices than the ECG, like smartwatches and bracelets, the quality of measurements significantly degrades. This paper presents a methodology for stress detection from a smartwatch based on a universal model for time series, UniTS, which we fine-tuned for the task. We cast the problem as anomaly detection rather than classification to favor model adaptation to individual patients and allow the clinician to maintain greater control over the system's predictions. We demonstrate that our proposed model considerably surpasses 12 top-performing methods on 3 benchmark datasets. Furthermore, unlike other state-of-the-art systems, UniTS enables seamless monitoring, as it shows comparable performance when using signals from invasive or lightweight devices.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper, for the first time, marries large foundation models with human sketch understanding. We demonstrate what this brings -- a paradigm shift in terms of generalised sketch representation learning (e.g., classification). This generalisation happens on two fronts: (i) generalisation across unknown categories (i.e., open-set), and (ii) generalisation traversing abstraction levels (i.e., good and bad sketches), both being timely challenges that remain unsolved in the sketch literature. Our design is intuitive and centred around transferring the already stellar generalisation ability of CLIP to benefit generalised learning for sketches. We first "condition" the vanilla CLIP model by learning sketch-specific prompts using a novel auxiliary head of raster to vector sketch conversion. This importantly makes CLIP "sketch-aware". We then make CLIP acute to the inherently different sketch abstraction levels. This is achieved by learning a codebook of abstraction-specific prompt biases, a weighted combination of which facilitates the representation of sketches across abstraction levels -- low abstract edge-maps, medium abstract sketches in TU-Berlin, and highly abstract doodles in QuickDraw. Our framework surpasses popular sketch representation learning algorithms in both zero-shot and few-shot setups and in novel settings across different abstraction boundaries.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent developments in deep generative models have opened up a wide range of opportunities for image synthesis, leading to significant changes in various creative fields, including the fashion industry. While numerous methods have been proposed to benefit buyers, particularly in virtual try-on applications, there has been relatively less focus on facilitating fast prototyping for designers and customers seeking to order new designs. To address this gap, we introduce DiCTI (Diffusion-based Clothing Designer via Text-guided Input), a straightforward yet highly effective approach that allows designers to quickly visualize fashion-related ideas using text inputs only. Given an image of a person and a description of the desired garments as input, DiCTI automatically generates multiple high-resolution, photorealistic images that capture the expressed semantics. By leveraging a powerful diffusion-based inpainting model conditioned on text inputs, DiCTI is able to synthesize convincing, high-quality images with varied clothing designs that viably follow the provided text descriptions, while being able to process very diverse and challenging inputs, captured in completely unconstrained settings. We evaluate DiCTI in comprehensive experiments on two different datasets (VITON-HD and Fashionpedia) and in comparison to the state-of-the-art (SoTa). The results of our experiments show that DiCTI convincingly outperforms the SoTA competitor in generating higher quality images with more elaborate garments and superior text prompt adherence, both according to standard quantitative evaluation measures and human ratings, generated as part of a user study.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models have marked a significant breakthrough in the synthesis of semantically coherent images. However, their extensive noise estimation networks and the iterative generation process limit their wider application, particularly on resource-constrained platforms like mobile devices. Existing post-training quantization (PTQ) methods have managed to compress diffusion models to low precision. Nevertheless, due to the iterative nature of diffusion models, quantization errors tend to accumulate throughout the generation process. This accumulation of error becomes particularly problematic in low-precision scenarios, leading to significant distortions in the generated images. We attribute this accumulation issue to two main causes: error propagation and exposure bias. To address these problems, we propose a timestep-aware correction method for quantized diffusion model, which dynamically corrects the quantization error. By leveraging the proposed method in low-precision diffusion models, substantial enhancement of output quality could be achieved with only negligible computation overhead. Extensive experiments underscore our method's effectiveness and generalizability. By employing the proposed correction strategy, we achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on low-precision models.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Anomaly detection plays a crucial role in various domains, from cybersecurity to industrial systems. However, traditional centralized approaches often encounter challenges related to data privacy. In this context, Federated Learning emerges as a promising solution. This work introduces two innovative algorithms--Ensemble SVDD and Support Vector Election--that leverage Support Vector Machines for anomaly detection in a federated setting. In comparison with the Neural Networks typically used in within Federated Learning, these new algorithms emerge as potential alternatives, as they can operate effectively with small datasets and incur lower computational costs. The novel algorithms are tested in various distributed system configurations, yielding promising initial results that pave the way for further investigation.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Metaphors are part of everyday language and shape the way in which we conceptualize the world. Moreover, they play a multifaceted role in communication, making their understanding and generation a challenging task for language models (LMs). While there has been extensive work in the literature linking metaphor to the fulfilment of individual intentions, no comprehensive taxonomy of such intentions, suitable for natural language processing (NLP) applications, is available to present day. In this paper, we propose a novel taxonomy of intentions commonly attributed to metaphor, which comprises 9 categories. We also release the first dataset annotated for intentions behind metaphor use. Finally, we use this dataset to test the capability of large language models (LLMs) in inferring the intentions behind metaphor use, in zero- and in-context few-shot settings. Our experiments show that this is still a challenge for LLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Defect detection is the task of identifying defects in production samples. Usually, defect detection classifiers are trained on ground-truth data formed by normal samples (negative data) and samples with defects (positive data), where the latter are consistently fewer than normal samples. State-of-the-art data augmentation procedures add synthetic defect data by superimposing artifacts to normal samples to mitigate problems related to unbalanced training data. These techniques often produce out-of-distribution images, resulting in systems that learn what is not a normal sample but cannot accurately identify what a defect looks like. In this work, we introduce DIAG, a training-free Diffusion-based In-distribution Anomaly Generation pipeline for data augmentation. Unlike conventional image generation techniques, we implement a human-in-the-loop pipeline, where domain experts provide multimodal guidance to the model through text descriptions and region localization of the possible anomalies. This strategic shift enhances the interpretability of results and fosters a more robust human feedback loop, facilitating iterative improvements of the generated outputs. Remarkably, our approach operates in a zero-shot manner, avoiding time-consuming fine-tuning procedures while achieving superior performance. We demonstrate the efficacy and versatility of DIAG with respect to state-of-the-art data augmentation approaches on the challenging KSDD2 dataset, with an improvement in AP of approximately 18% when positive samples are available and 28% when they are missing.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Depth estimation is a cornerstone for autonomous driving, yet acquiring per-pixel depth ground truth for supervised learning is challenging. Self-Supervised Surround Depth Estimation (SSSDE) from consecutive images offers an economical alternative. While previous SSSDE methods have proposed different mechanisms to fuse information across images, few of them explicitly consider the cross-view constraints, leading to inferior performance, particularly in overlapping regions. This paper proposes an efficient and consistent pose estimation design and two loss functions to enhance cross-view consistency for SSSDE. For pose estimation, we propose to use only front-view images to reduce training memory and sustain pose estimation consistency. The first loss function is the dense depth consistency loss, which penalizes the difference between predicted depths in overlapping regions. The second one is the multi-view reconstruction consistency loss, which aims to maintain consistency between reconstruction from spatial and spatial-temporal contexts. Additionally, we introduce a novel flipping augmentation to improve the performance further. Our techniques enable a simple neural model to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the DDAD and nuScenes datasets. Last but not least, our proposed techniques can be easily applied to other methods. The code will be made public.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper investigates the use of unsupervised text-to-speech synthesis (TTS) as a data augmentation method to improve accented speech recognition. TTS systems are trained with a small amount of accented speech training data and their pseudo-labels rather than manual transcriptions, and hence unsupervised. This approach enables the use of accented speech data without manual transcriptions to perform data augmentation for accented speech recognition. Synthetic accented speech data, generated from text prompts by using the TTS systems, are then combined with available non-accented speech data to train automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. ASR experiments are performed in a self-supervised learning framework using a Wav2vec2.0 model which was pre-trained on large amount of unsupervised accented speech data. The accented speech data for training the unsupervised TTS are read speech, selected from L2-ARCTIC and British Isles corpora, while spontaneous conversational speech from the Edinburgh international accents of English corpus are used as the evaluation data. Experimental results show that Wav2vec2.0 models which are fine-tuned to downstream ASR task with synthetic accented speech data, generated by the unsupervised TTS, yield up to 6.1% relative word error rate reductions compared to a Wav2vec2.0 baseline which is fine-tuned with the non-accented speech data from Librispeech corpus.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Introducing Entity-Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (EASTE), a novel Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) task which extends Target-Aspect-Sentiment Detection (TASD) by separating aspect categories (e.g., food#quality) into pre-defined entities (e.g., meal, drink) and aspects (e.g., taste, freshness) which add a fine-gainer level of complexity, yet help exposing true sentiment of chained aspect to its entity. We explore the task of EASTE solving capabilities of language models based on transformers architecture from our proposed unified-loss approach via token classification task using BERT architecture to text generative models such as Flan-T5, Flan-Ul2 to Llama2, Llama3 and Mixtral employing different alignment techniques such as zero/few-shot learning, Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT) such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). The model performances are evaluated on the SamEval-2016 benchmark dataset representing the fair comparison to existing works. Our research not only aims to achieve high performance on the EASTE task but also investigates the impact of model size, type, and adaptation techniques on task performance. Ultimately, we provide detailed insights and achieving state-of-the-art results in complex sentiment analysis.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative AI raises many societal concerns such as boosting disinformation and propaganda campaigns. Watermarking AI-generated content is a key technology to address these concerns and has been widely deployed in industry. However, watermarking is vulnerable to removal attacks and forgery attacks. In this work, we propose the first image watermarks with certified robustness guarantees against removal and forgery attacks. Our method leverages randomized smoothing, a popular technique to build certifiably robust classifiers and regression models. Our major technical contributions include extending randomized smoothing to watermarking by considering its unique characteristics, deriving the certified robustness guarantees, and designing algorithms to estimate them. Moreover, we extensively evaluate our image watermarks in terms of both certified and empirical robustness. Our code is available at \url{this https URL}.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Motivated by efficiency requirements, most anomaly detection and segmentation (AD&S) methods focus on processing low-resolution images, e.g., $224\times 224$ pixels, obtained by downsampling the original input images. In this setting, downsampling is typically applied also to the provided ground-truth defect masks. Yet, as numerous industrial applications demand identification of both large and tiny defects, the above-described protocol may fall short in providing a realistic picture of the actual performance attainable by current methods. Hence, in this work, we introduce a novel benchmark that evaluates methods on the original, high-resolution image and ground-truth masks, focusing on segmentation performance as a function of the size of anomalies. Our benchmark includes a metric that captures robustness with respect to defect size, i.e., the ability of a method to preserve good localization from large anomalies to tiny ones. Furthermore, we introduce an AD&S approach based on a novel Teacher-Student paradigm which relies on two shallow MLPs (the Students) that learn to transfer patch features across the layers of a frozen vision transformer (the Teacher). By means of our benchmark, we evaluate our proposal and other recent AD&S methods on high-resolution inputs containing large and tiny defects. Our proposal features the highest robustness to defect size, runs at the fastest speed, yields state-of-the-art performance on the MVTec AD dataset and state-of-the-art segmentation performance on the VisA dataset.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Image data augmentation constitutes a critical methodology in modern computer vision tasks, since it can facilitate towards enhancing the diversity and quality of training datasets; thereby, improving the performance and robustness of machine learning models in downstream tasks. In parallel, augmentation approaches can also be used for editing/modifying a given image in a context- and semantics-aware way. Diffusion Models (DMs), which comprise one of the most recent and highly promising classes of methods in the field of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), have emerged as a powerful tool for image data augmentation, capable of generating realistic and diverse images by learning the underlying data distribution. The current study realizes a systematic, comprehensive and in-depth review of DM-based approaches for image augmentation, covering a wide range of strategies, tasks and applications. In particular, a comprehensive analysis of the fundamental principles, model architectures and training strategies of DMs is initially performed. Subsequently, a taxonomy of the relevant image augmentation methods is introduced, focusing on techniques regarding semantic manipulation, personalization and adaptation, and application-specific augmentation tasks. Then, performance assessment methodologies and respective evaluation metrics are analyzed. Finally, current challenges and future research directions in the field are discussed.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Estimating the landscape and soil freeze-thaw (FT) dynamics in the Northern Hemisphere is crucial for understanding permafrost response to global warming and changes in regional and global carbon budgets. A new framework is presented for surface FT-cycle retrievals using L-band microwave radiometry based on a deep convolutional autoencoder neural network. This framework defines the landscape FT-cycle retrieval as a time series anomaly detection problem considering the frozen states as normal and thawed states as anomalies. The autoencoder retrieves the FT-cycle probabilistically through supervised reconstruction of the brightness temperature (TB) time series using a contrastive loss function that minimizes (maximizes) the reconstruction error for the peak winter (summer). Using the data provided by the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite, it is demonstrated that the framework learns to isolate the landscape FT states over different land surface types with varying complexities related to the radiometric characteristics of snow cover, lake-ice phenology, and vegetation canopy. The consistency of the retrievals is evaluated over Alaska, against in situ ground-based observations, showing reduced uncertainties compared to the traditional methods that use thresholding of the normalized polarization ratio.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Nursing notes, an important component of Electronic Health Records (EHRs), keep track of the progression of a patient's health status during a care episode. Distilling the key information in nursing notes through text summarization techniques can improve clinicians' efficiency in understanding patients' conditions when reviewing nursing notes. However, existing abstractive summarization methods in the clinical setting have often overlooked nursing notes and require the creation of reference summaries for supervision signals, which is time-consuming. In this work, we introduce QGSumm, a query-guided self-supervised domain adaptation framework for nursing note summarization. Using patient-related clinical queries as guidance, our approach generates high-quality, patient-centered summaries without relying on reference summaries for training. Through automatic and manual evaluation by an expert clinician, we demonstrate the strengths of our approach compared to the state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. Ultimately, our approach provides a new perspective on conditional text summarization, tailored to the specific interests of clinical personnel.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The exponential progress in generative AI poses serious implications for the credibility of all real images and videos. There will exist a point in the future where 1) digital content produced by generative AI will be indistinguishable from those created by cameras, 2) high-quality generative algorithms will be accessible to anyone, and 3) the ratio of all synthetic to real images will be large. It is imperative to establish methods that can separate real data from synthetic data with high confidence. We define real images as those that were produced by the camera hardware, capturing a real-world scene. Any synthetic generation of an image or alteration of a real image through generative AI or computer graphics techniques is labeled as a synthetic image. To this end, this document aims to: present known strategies in detection and cryptography that can be employed to verify which images are real, weight the strengths and weaknesses of these strategies, and suggest additional improvements to alleviate shortcomings.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>G-code (Geometric code) or RS-274 is the most widely used computer numerical control (CNC) and 3D printing programming language. G-code provides machine instructions for the movement of the 3D printer, especially for the nozzle, stage, and extrusion of material for extrusion-based additive manufacturing. Currently there does not exist a large repository of curated CAD models along with their corresponding G-code files for additive manufacturing. To address this issue, we present SLICE-100K, a first-of-its-kind dataset of over 100,000 G-code files, along with their tessellated CAD model, LVIS (Large Vocabulary Instance Segmentation) categories, geometric properties, and renderings. We build our dataset from triangulated meshes derived from Objaverse-XL and Thingi10K datasets. We demonstrate the utility of this dataset by finetuning GPT-2 on a subset of the dataset for G-code translation from a legacy G-code format (Sailfish) to a more modern, widely used format (Marlin). SLICE-100K will be the first step in developing a multimodal foundation model for digital manufacturing.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models offer unprecedented image generation capabilities given just a text prompt. While emerging control mechanisms have enabled users to specify the desired spatial arrangements of the generated content, they cannot predict or control where viewers will pay more attention due to the complexity of human vision. Recognizing the critical necessity of attention-controllable image generation in practical applications, we present a saliency-guided framework to incorporate the data priors of human visual attention into the generation process. Given a desired viewer attention distribution, our control module conditions a diffusion model to generate images that attract viewers' attention toward desired areas. To assess the efficacy of our approach, we performed an eye-tracked user study and a large-scale model-based saliency analysis. The results evidence that both the cross-user eye gaze distributions and the saliency model predictions align with the desired attention distributions. Lastly, we outline several applications, including interactive design of saliency guidance, attention suppression in unwanted regions, and adaptive generation for varied display/viewing conditions.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We address the challenges inherent in sketch-based image retrieval (SBIR) across various settings, including zero-shot SBIR, generalized zero-shot SBIR, and fine-grained zero-shot SBIR, by leveraging the vision-language foundation model, CLIP. While recent endeavors have employed CLIP to enhance SBIR, these approaches predominantly follow uni-modal prompt processing and overlook to fully exploit CLIP's integrated visual and textual capabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce SpLIP, a novel multi-modal prompt learning scheme designed to operate effectively with frozen CLIP backbones. We diverge from existing multi-modal prompting methods that either treat visual and textual prompts independently or integrate them in a limited fashion, leading to suboptimal generalization. SpLIP implements a bi-directional prompt-sharing strategy that enables mutual knowledge exchange between CLIP's visual and textual encoders, fostering a more cohesive and synergistic prompt processing mechanism that significantly reduces the semantic gap between the sketch and photo embeddings. In addition to pioneering multi-modal prompt learning, we propose two innovative strategies for further refining the embedding space. The first is an adaptive margin generation for the sketch-photo triplet loss, regulated by CLIP's class textual embeddings. The second introduces a novel task, termed conditional cross-modal jigsaw, aimed at enhancing fine-grained sketch-photo alignment, by focusing on implicitly modelling the viable patch arrangement of sketches using knowledge of unshuffled photos. Our comprehensive experimental evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of SpLIP in all three SBIR scenarios. Code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Time series generation is a crucial research topic in the area of deep learning, which can be used for data augmentation, imputing missing values, and forecasting. Currently, latent diffusion models are ascending to the forefront of generative modeling for many important data representations. Being the most pivotal in the computer vision domain, latent diffusion models have also recently attracted interest in other communities, including NLP, Speech, and Geometric Space. In this work, we propose TimeLDM, a novel latent diffusion model for high-quality time series generation. TimeLDM is composed of a variational autoencoder that encodes time series into an informative and smoothed latent content and a latent diffusion model operating in the latent space to generate latent information. We evaluate the ability of our method to generate synthetic time series with simulated and realistic datasets, benchmark the performance against existing state-of-the-art methods. Qualitatively and quantitatively, we find that the proposed TimeLDM persistently delivers high-quality generated time series. Sores from Context-FID and Discriminative indicate that TimeLDM consistently and significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art benchmarks with an average improvement of 3.4$\times$ and 3.8$\times$, respectively. Further studies demonstrate that our method presents better performance on different lengths of time series data generation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the potential of the latent diffusion model for unconditional time series generation and establish a new baseline for synthetic time series.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While text-to-image diffusion models demonstrate impressive generation capabilities, they also exhibit vulnerability to backdoor attacks, which involve the manipulation of model outputs through malicious triggers. In this paper, for the first time, we propose a comprehensive defense method named T2IShield to detect, localize, and mitigate such attacks. Specifically, we find the "Assimilation Phenomenon" on the cross-attention maps caused by the backdoor trigger. Based on this key insight, we propose two effective backdoor detection methods: Frobenius Norm Threshold Truncation and Covariance Discriminant Analysis. Besides, we introduce a binary-search approach to localize the trigger within a backdoor sample and assess the efficacy of existing concept editing methods in mitigating backdoor attacks. Empirical evaluations on two advanced backdoor attack scenarios show the effectiveness of our proposed defense method. For backdoor sample detection, T2IShield achieves a detection F1 score of 88.9$\%$ with low computational cost. Furthermore, T2IShield achieves a localization F1 score of 86.4$\%$ and invalidates 99$\%$ poisoned samples. Codes are released at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>For document image binarization task, generative adversarial networks (GANs) can generate images where shadows and noise are effectively removed, which allow for text information extraction. The current state-of-the-art (SOTA) method proposes a three-stage network architecture that utilizes six GANs. Despite its excellent model performance, the SOTA network architecture requires long training and inference times. To overcome this problem, this work introduces an efficient GAN method based on the three-stage network architecture that incorporates the Discrete Wavelet Transformation and normalization to reduce the input image size, which in turns, decrease both training and inference times. In addition, this work presents novel generators, discriminators, and loss functions to improve the model's performance. Experimental results show that the proposed method reduces the training time by 10% and the inference time by 26% when compared to the SOTA method while maintaining the model performance at 73.79 of Avg-Score.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present GSD, a diffusion model approach based on Gaussian Splatting (GS) representation for 3D object reconstruction from a single view. Prior works suffer from inconsistent 3D geometry or mediocre rendering quality due to improper representations. We take a step towards resolving these shortcomings by utilizing the recent state-of-the-art 3D explicit representation, Gaussian Splatting, and an unconditional diffusion model. This model learns to generate 3D objects represented by sets of GS ellipsoids. With these strong generative 3D priors, though learning unconditionally, the diffusion model is ready for view-guided reconstruction without further model fine-tuning. This is achieved by propagating fine-grained 2D features through the efficient yet flexible splatting function and the guided denoising sampling process. In addition, a 2D diffusion model is further employed to enhance rendering fidelity, and improve reconstructed GS quality by polishing and re-using the rendered images. The final reconstructed objects explicitly come with high-quality 3D structure and texture, and can be efficiently rendered in arbitrary views. Experiments on the challenging real-world CO3D dataset demonstrate the superiority of our approach.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have performed exceptionally in various text-generative tasks, including question answering, translation, code completion, etc. However, the over-assistance of LLMs has raised the challenge of "jailbreaking", which induces the model to generate malicious responses against the usage policy and society by designing adversarial prompts. With the emergence of jailbreak attack methods exploiting different vulnerabilities in LLMs, the corresponding safety alignment measures are also evolving. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive and detailed taxonomy of jailbreak attack and defense methods. For instance, the attack methods are divided into black-box and white-box attacks based on the transparency of the target model. Meanwhile, we classify defense methods into prompt-level and model-level defenses. Additionally, we further subdivide these attack and defense methods into distinct sub-classes and present a coherent diagram illustrating their relationships. We also conduct an investigation into the current evaluation methods and compare them from different perspectives. Our findings aim to inspire future research and practical implementations in safeguarding LLMs against adversarial attacks. Above all, although jailbreak remains a significant concern within the community, we believe that our work enhances the understanding of this domain and provides a foundation for developing more secure LLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Supervised learning-based adversarial attack detection methods rely on a large number of labeled data and suffer significant performance degradation when applying the trained model to new domains. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised representation learning framework for the adversarial attack detection task to address this drawback. Firstly, we map the pixels of augmented input images into an embedding space. Then, we employ the prototype-wise contrastive estimation loss to cluster prototypes as latent variables. Additionally, drawing inspiration from the concept of memory banks, we introduce a discrimination bank to distinguish and learn representations for each individual instance that shares the same or a similar prototype, establishing a connection between instances and their associated prototypes. We propose a parallel axial-attention (PAA)-based encoder to facilitate the training process by parallel training over height- and width-axis of attention maps. Experimental results show that, compared to various benchmark self-supervised vision learning models and supervised adversarial attack detection methods, the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the adversarial attack detection task across a wide range of images.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Category-level 3D pose estimation is a fundamentally important problem in computer vision and robotics, e.g. for embodied agents or to train 3D generative models. However, so far methods that estimate the category-level object pose require either large amounts of human annotations, CAD models or input from RGB-D sensors. In contrast, we tackle the problem of learning to estimate the category-level 3D pose only from casually taken object-centric videos without human supervision. We propose a two-step pipeline: First, we introduce a multi-view alignment procedure that determines canonical camera poses across videos with a novel and robust cyclic distance formulation for geometric and appearance matching using reconstructed coarse meshes and DINOv2 features. In a second step, the canonical poses and reconstructed meshes enable us to train a model for 3D pose estimation from a single image. In particular, our model learns to estimate dense correspondences between images and a prototypical 3D template by predicting, for each pixel in a 2D image, a feature vector of the corresponding vertex in the template mesh. We demonstrate that our method outperforms all baselines at the unsupervised alignment of object-centric videos by a large margin and provides faithful and robust predictions in-the-wild.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Self-supervised learning methods for medical images primarily rely on the imaging modality during pretraining. While such approaches deliver promising results, they do not leverage associated patient or scan information collected within Electronic Health Records (EHR). Here, we propose to incorporate EHR data during self-supervised pretraining with a Masked Siamese Network (MSN) to enhance the quality of chest X-ray representations. We investigate three types of EHR data, including demographic, scan metadata, and inpatient stay information. We evaluate our approach on three publicly available chest X-ray datasets, MIMIC-CXR, CheXpert, and NIH-14, using two vision transformer (ViT) backbones, specifically ViT-Tiny and ViT-Small. In assessing the quality of the representations via linear evaluation, our proposed method demonstrates significant improvement compared to vanilla MSN and state-of-the-art self-supervised learning baselines. Our work highlights the potential of EHR-enhanced self-supervised pre-training for medical imaging. The code is publicly available at: this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent research on texture synthesis for 3D shapes benefits a lot from dramatically developed 2D text-to-image diffusion models, including inpainting-based and optimization-based approaches. However, these methods ignore the modal gap between the 2D diffusion model and 3D objects, which primarily render 3D objects into 2D images and texture each image separately. In this paper, we revisit the texture synthesis and propose a Variance alignment based 3D-2D Collaborative Denoising framework, dubbed VCD-Texture, to address these issues. Formally, we first unify both 2D and 3D latent feature learning in diffusion self-attention modules with re-projected 3D attention receptive fields. Subsequently, the denoised multi-view 2D latent features are aggregated into 3D space and then rasterized back to formulate more consistent 2D predictions. However, the rasterization process suffers from an intractable variance bias, which is theoretically addressed by the proposed variance alignment, achieving high-fidelity texture synthesis. Moreover, we present an inpainting refinement to further improve the details with conflicting regions. Notably, there is not a publicly available benchmark to evaluate texture synthesis, which hinders its development. Thus we construct a new evaluation set built upon three open-source 3D datasets and propose to use four metrics to thoroughly validate the texturing performance.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advancements in the realm of deep generative models focus on generating samples that satisfy multiple desired properties. However, prevalent approaches optimize these property functions independently, thus omitting the trade-offs among them. In addition, the property optimization is often improperly integrated into the generative models, resulting in an unnecessary compromise on generation quality (i.e., the quality of generated samples). To address these issues, we formulate a constrained optimization problem. It seeks to optimize generation quality while ensuring that generated samples reside at the Pareto front of multiple property objectives. Such a formulation enables the generation of samples that cannot be further improved simultaneously on the conflicting property functions and preserves good quality of generated samples. Building upon this formulation, we introduce the PaRetO-gUided Diffusion model (PROUD), wherein the gradients in the denoising process are dynamically adjusted to enhance generation quality while the generated samples adhere to Pareto optimality. Experimental evaluations on image generation and protein generation tasks demonstrate that our PROUD consistently maintains superior generation quality while approaching Pareto optimality across multiple property functions compared to various baselines.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Hyperspectral imaging, a rapidly evolving field, has witnessed the ascendancy of deep learning techniques, supplanting classical feature extraction and classification methods in various applications. However, many researchers employ arbitrary architectures for hyperspectral image processing, often without rigorous analysis of the interplay between spectral and spatial information. This oversight neglects the implications of combining these two modalities on model performance. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of diverse deep learning architectures for hyperspectral image segmentation. Our analysis disentangles the impact of different architectures, spanning various spectral and spatial granularities. Specifically, we investigate the effects of spectral resolution (capturing spectral information) and spatial texture (conveying spatial details) on segmentation outcomes. Additionally, we explore the transferability of knowledge from large pre-trained image foundation models, originally designed for RGB images, to the hyperspectral domain. Results show that incorporating spatial information alongside spectral data leads to improved segmentation results, and that it is essential to further work on novel architectures comprising spectral and spatial information and on the adaption of RGB foundation models into the hyperspectral domain. Furthermore, we contribute to the field by cleaning and publicly releasing the Tecnalia WEEE Hyperspectral dataset. This dataset contains different non-ferrous fractions of Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE), including Copper, Brass, Aluminum, Stainless Steel, and White Copper, spanning the range of 400 to 1000 nm. We expect these conclusions can guide novel researchers in the field of hyperspectral imaging.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present a novel, and effective, approach to the long-standing problem of mesh adaptivity in finite element methods (FEM). FE solvers are powerful tools for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), but their cost and accuracy are critically dependent on the choice of mesh points. To keep computational costs low, mesh relocation (r-adaptivity) seeks to optimise the position of a fixed number of mesh points to obtain the best FE solution accuracy. Classical approaches to this problem require the solution of a separate nonlinear "meshing" PDE to find the mesh point locations. This incurs significant cost at remeshing and relies on certain a-priori assumptions and guiding heuristics for optimal mesh point location. Recent machine learning approaches to r-adaptivity have mainly focused on the construction of fast surrogates for such classical methods. Our new approach combines a graph neural network (GNN) powered architecture, with training based on direct minimisation of the FE solution error with respect to the mesh point locations. The GNN employs graph neural diffusion (GRAND), closely aligning the mesh solution space to that of classical meshing methodologies, thus replacing heuristics with a learnable strategy, and providing a strong inductive bias. This allows for rapid and robust training and results in an extremely efficient and effective GNN approach to online r-adaptivity. This method outperforms classical and prior ML approaches to r-adaptive meshing on the test problems we consider, in particular achieving lower FE solution error, whilst retaining the significant speed-up over classical methods observed in prior ML work.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Speech encoders pretrained through self-supervised learning (SSL) have demonstrated remarkable performance in various downstream tasks, including Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). For instance, fine-tuning SSL models for such tasks has shown significant potential, leading to improvements in the SOTA performance across challenging datasets. In contrast to existing research, this paper contributes by comparing the effectiveness of SSL approaches in the context of (i) the low-resource spoken Tunisian Arabic dialect and (ii) its combination with a low-resource SLU and ASR scenario, where only a few semantic annotations are available for fine-tuning. We conduct experiments using many SSL speech encoders on the TARIC-SLU dataset. We use speech encoders that were pre-trained on either monolingual or multilingual speech data. Some of them have also been refined without in-domain nor Tunisian data through multimodal supervised teacher-student paradigm. This study yields numerous significant findings that we are discussing in this paper.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Computer vision methods that explicitly detect object parts and reason on them are a step towards inherently interpretable models. Existing approaches that perform part discovery driven by a fine-grained classification task make very restrictive assumptions on the geometric properties of the discovered parts; they should be small and compact. Although this prior is useful in some cases, in this paper we show that pre-trained transformer-based vision models, such as self-supervised DINOv2 ViT, enable the relaxation of these constraints. In particular, we find that a total variation (TV) prior, which allows for multiple connected components of any size, substantially outperforms previous work. We test our approach on three fine-grained classification benchmarks: CUB, PartImageNet and Oxford Flowers, and compare our results to previously published methods as well as a re-implementation of the state-of-the-art method PDiscoNet with a transformer-based backbone. We consistently obtain substantial improvements across the board, both on part discovery metrics and the downstream classification task, showing that the strong inductive biases in self-supervised ViT models require to rethink the geometric priors that can be used for unsupervised part discovery.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Language models are capable of iteratively improving their outputs based on natural language feedback, thus enabling in-context optimization of user preference. In place of human users, a second language model can be used as an evaluator, providing feedback along with numerical ratings which the generator attempts to optimize. However, because the evaluator is an imperfect proxy of user preference, this optimization can lead to reward hacking, where the evaluator's ratings improve while the generation quality remains stagnant or even decreases as judged by actual user preference. The concern of reward hacking is heightened in iterative self-refinement where the generator and the evaluator use the same underlying language model, in which case the optimization pressure can drive them to exploit shared vulnerabilities. Using an essay editing task, we show that iterative self-refinement leads to deviation between the language model evaluator and human judgment, demonstrating that reward hacking can occur spontaneously in-context with the use of iterative self-refinement. In addition, we study conditions under which reward hacking occurs and observe two factors that affect reward hacking severity: model size and context sharing between the generator and the evaluator.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Visual storytelling consists in generating a natural language story given a temporally ordered sequence of images. This task is not only challenging for models, but also very difficult to evaluate with automatic metrics since there is no consensus about what makes a story 'good'. In this paper, we introduce a novel method that measures story quality in terms of human likeness regarding three key aspects highlighted in previous work: visual grounding, coherence, and repetitiveness. We then use this method to evaluate the stories generated by several models, showing that the foundation model LLaVA obtains the best result, but only slightly so compared to TAPM, a 50-times smaller visual storytelling model. Upgrading the visual and language components of TAPM results in a model that yields competitive performance with a relatively low number of parameters. Finally, we carry out a human evaluation study, whose results suggest that a 'good' story may require more than a human-like level of visual grounding, coherence, and repetition.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) research, while state-of-the-art models have reached a saturation point with extensive studies on public benchmark datasets, they adopt large-scale tailor-made neural networks (NN) for detection performance or pursued unified models for various tasks. Towards edge computing, it is necessary to develop a computationally efficient and scalable solution that avoids large-scale complex NNs. Motivated by this, we aim to optimize the UAD performance with minimal changes to NN settings. Thus, we revisit the reconstruction-by-inpainting approach and rethink to improve it by analyzing strengths and weaknesses. The strength of the SOTA methods is a single deterministic masking approach that addresses the challenges of random multiple masking that is inference latency and output inconsistency. Nevertheless, the issue of failure to provide a mask to completely cover anomalous regions is a remaining weakness. To mitigate this issue, we propose Feature Attenuation of Defective Representation (FADeR) that only employs two MLP layers which attenuates feature information of anomaly reconstruction during decoding. By leveraging FADeR, features of unseen anomaly patterns are reconstructed into seen normal patterns, reducing false alarms. Experimental results demonstrate that FADeR achieves enhanced performance compared to similar-scale NNs. Furthermore, our approach exhibits scalability in performance enhancement when integrated with other single deterministic masking methods in a plug-and-play manner.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper propels creative control in generative visual AI by allowing users to "select". Departing from traditional text or sketch-based methods, we for the first time allow users to choose visual concepts by parts for their creative endeavors. The outcome is fine-grained generation that precisely captures selected visual concepts, ensuring a holistically faithful and plausible result. To achieve this, we first parse objects into parts through unsupervised feature clustering. Then, we encode parts into text tokens and introduce an entropy-based normalized attention loss that operates on them. This loss design enables our model to learn generic prior topology knowledge about object's part composition, and further generalize to novel part compositions to ensure the generation looks holistically faithful. Lastly, we employ a bottleneck encoder to project the part tokens. This not only enhances fidelity but also accelerates learning, by leveraging shared knowledge and facilitating information exchange among instances. Visual results in the paper and supplementary material showcase the compelling power of PartCraft in crafting highly customized, innovative creations, exemplified by the "charming" and creative birds.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose a randomized physics-informed neural network (PINN) or rPINN method for uncertainty quantification in inverse partial differential equation (PDE) problems with noisy data. This method is used to quantify uncertainty in the inverse PDE PINN solutions. Recently, the Bayesian PINN (BPINN) method was proposed, where the posterior distribution of the PINN parameters was formulated using the Bayes' theorem and sampled using approximate inference methods such as the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) and variational inference (VI) methods. In this work, we demonstrate that HMC fails to converge for non-linear inverse PDE problems. As an alternative to HMC, we sample the distribution by solving the stochastic optimization problem obtained by randomizing the PINN loss function. The effectiveness of the rPINN method is tested for linear and non-linear Poisson equations, and the diffusion equation with a high-dimensional space-dependent diffusion coefficient. The rPINN method provides informative distributions for all considered problems. For the linear Poisson equation, HMC and rPINN produce similar distributions, but rPINN is on average 27 times faster than HMC. For the non-linear Poison and diffusion equations, the HMC method fails to converge because a single HMC chain cannot sample multiple modes of the posterior distribution of the PINN parameters in a reasonable amount of time.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The goal of this paper is to improve the generality and accuracy of open-vocabulary object counting in images. To improve the generality, we repurpose an open-vocabulary detection foundation model (GroundingDINO) for the counting task, and also extend its capabilities by introducing modules to enable specifying the target object to count by visual exemplars. In turn, these new capabilities - being able to specify the target object by multi-modalites (text and exemplars) - lead to an improvement in counting accuracy. We make three contributions: First, we introduce the first open-world counting model, CountGD, where the prompt can be specified by a text description or visual exemplars or both; Second, we show that the performance of the model significantly improves the state of the art on multiple counting benchmarks - when using text only, CountGD is comparable to or outperforms all previous text-only works, and when using both text and visual exemplars, we outperform all previous models; Third, we carry out a preliminary study into different interactions between the text and visual exemplar prompts, including the cases where they reinforce each other and where one restricts the other.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Self-attention performs well in long context but has quadratic complexity. Existing RNN layers have linear complexity, but their performance in long context is limited by the expressive power of their hidden state. We propose a new class of sequence modeling layers with linear complexity and an expressive hidden state. The key idea is to make the hidden state a machine learning model itself, and the update rule a step of self-supervised learning. Since the hidden state is updated by training even on test sequences, our layers are called Test-Time Training (TTT) layers. We consider two instantiations: TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, whose hidden state is a linear model and a two-layer MLP respectively. We evaluate our instantiations at the scale of 125M to 1.3B parameters, comparing with a strong Transformer and Mamba, a modern RNN. Both TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP match or exceed the baselines. Similar to Transformer, they can keep reducing perplexity by conditioning on more tokens, while Mamba cannot after 16k context. With preliminary systems optimization, TTT-Linear is already faster than Transformer at 8k context and matches Mamba in wall-clock time. TTT-MLP still faces challenges in memory I/O, but shows larger potential in long context, pointing to a promising direction for future research.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Verbal videos, featuring voice-overs or text overlays, provide valuable content but present significant challenges in composition, especially when incorporating editing effects to enhance clarity and visual appeal. In this paper, we introduce the novel task of verbal video composition with editing effects. This task aims to generate coherent and visually appealing verbal videos by integrating multimodal editing effects across textual, visual, and audio categories. To achieve this, we curate a large-scale dataset of video effects compositions from publicly available sources. We then formulate this task as a generative problem, involving the identification of appropriate positions in the verbal content and the recommendation of editing effects for these positions. To address this task, we propose VCoME, a general framework that employs a large multimodal model to generate editing effects for video composition. Specifically, VCoME takes in the multimodal video context and autoregressively outputs where to apply effects within the verbal content and which effects are most appropriate for each position. VCoME also supports prompt-based control of composition density and style, providing substantial flexibility for diverse applications. Through extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of VCoME. A comprehensive user study shows that our method produces videos of professional quality while being 85$\times$ more efficient than professional editors.</li>
